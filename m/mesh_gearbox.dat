25|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position.|$|E
50|$|A ZF AS-Tronic {{automated}} constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> (branded TipMatic in MAN’s {{commercial product}} line up) with 12 forward and two reverse gears is standard fit, this coupled to a MAN two-speed transfer case. A powershift-type fully automatic transmission is an option.|$|E
50|$|Three {{versions}} of the Dennis Loline were built: the Loline with rear entrance, Loline II with front entrance and the later Loline III with a revised front grille {{in front of the}} radiator and a different clutch and constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1906 a {{range of}} more {{conventional}} cars was introduced with shaft-drive and vertical engines and from 1907 sliding <b>mesh</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> One of these was supplied to the Emperor of Abyssinia. [...] Models offered included two- and four-cylinder ones {{and one of the}} first British V-8s; this last had a 7270 cc 35/40 hp engine based on the French Antoinette model (an aero engine for which Adams were agents). The V-8 seems to have been plagued by crankshaft breakages.|$|R
25|$|Wet {{multiplate clutch}} and {{five-speed}} constant <b>mesh</b> transmission. The <b>gearbox</b> is {{virtually the same}} as that fitted to Suzuki's GT750 water-cooled triple. RE5 final drive is by 630 chain via a 14-tooth drive sprocket and 43-tooth unit at the rear wheel.|$|R
30|$|Tooth pitting is {{a common}} failure mode of a gearbox. Many {{researchers}} investigated dynamic properties of a gearbox with localized pitting damage on a single gear tooth. The dynamic properties of a gearbox with pitting distributed over multiple teeth have rarely been investigated. In this paper, gear tooth pitting propagation to neighboring teeth is modeled and investigated {{for a pair of}} spur gears. Tooth pitting propagation effect on time-varying <b>mesh</b> stiffness, <b>gearbox</b> dynamics and vibration characteristics is studied and then fault symptoms are revealed. In addition, the influence of gear mesh damping and environmental noise on gearbox vibration properties is investigated. In the end, 114 statistical features are tested to estimate tooth pitting growth. Statistical features that are insensitive to gear mesh damping and environmental noise are recommended.|$|R
5000|$|In 1901 {{a larger}} four-seat 10/15 hp car {{was made and}} the rights to this [...] "vibrationless, very simple, quiet and efficient" [...] "New Turrell" [...] car were {{acquired}} by Pollock Ltd. of Ashton-under-Lyne. The car had a flat twin 10/15 hp engine under the front seat driving the rear wheels through a two-speed constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The car was later made by the Autocar Construction Company and sold as the Hermes.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 {{along with}} the rest of the Claymore range, the Nimbus was uprated {{featuring}} heavier BMC axles and an Albion constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> with either five or six speeds. Vacuum assistance to the brakes was now provided by a Hydrovac system, belt-driven from the engine. Two Nimbus-specific changes were the option of a drop-frame extension at the rear for a luggage boot and the option of a spare wheel mounted on a slide-out carrier, below this extension.|$|E
50|$|They {{were taken}} over in 1961 by AEC parent Associated Commercial Vehicles Ltd, and {{production}} {{was limited to}} Nubians, Big Bens and Antars, although the Thornycroft-designed six-speed constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> was used in AEC and later medium weight Leyland and Albion trucks. ACV was then taken over by Leyland in 1962. They already had a specialist vehicle unit in Scammell, another manufacturer of large haulage vehicles. Thornycroft's Basingstoke factory was closed in 1969 and specialist vehicles transferred to Scammell at Watford.|$|E
40|$|The gearbox is a {{complicated}} rotating machinery equipment, in order to realize the gearbox fault early detection and prevention, it {{is the key to}} carry out the online diagnosis. This paper used the adaptive variable step-length natural gradient blind source separation algorithm to realize the helicopter <b>gearbox</b> <b>meshing</b> vibration signal and fault vibration signal effective separation. Through the algorithm simulation, the accuracy of the algorithm gained the verification and the separation error trended to zero, which has higher separation precision. This algorithm can realize the complicated mechanical vibration signal blind source separation and fault diagnosis, which has a broad application prospect...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure to simulate vibrations in gear transmission systems is presented. This procedure couples {{the dynamics of}} the rotor-bearing gear system with the vibration in the gear box structure. The model synthesis method is used in solving the overall dynamics of the system, and a variable time-stepping integration scheme is used in evaluating the global transient vibration of the system. Locally each gear stage is modeled as a multimass rotor-bearing system using a discrete model. The modal characteristics are calculated using the matrix-transfer technique. The gearbox structure is represented by a finite element models, and modal parameters are solved by using NASTRAN. The rotor-gear stages are coupled through nonlinear compliance in the gear <b>mesh</b> while the <b>gearbox</b> structure is coupled through the bearing supports of the rotor system. Transient and steady state vibrations of the coupled system are examined in both time and frequency domains. A typical three-geared system is used as an example for demonstration of the developed procedure...|$|R
5000|$|Lancia's {{permanent}} four-wheel-drive {{system was}} based on three differentials.An epicyclic gear train served as centre differential, splitting the torque between {{the front and rear}} axle according to a fixed predetermined ratio—56% front&#x2009;/&#x2009;44% rear on the Prisma 4WD. The ring gear of the epicyclic differential <b>meshed</b> with the <b>gearbox</b> output shaft, its sun gear transmitted torque the front open differential, and its planet carrier, through a pair of bevel gears and a three-piece drive shaft, to the rear differential. A Ferguson coupling controlled the centre differential, preventing excessive relative slippage of the two axles. The epicyclic differential, the Ferguson coupling and the front differential were mounted coaxially in a single transverse unit just behind the engine.In place of the complex Torsen rear differential of the Delta HF 4WD, the Prisma 4WD had a simpler [...] "open" [...] type one, with differential lock—useful at low speeds in low grip conditions—controlled by the driver via a switch on the dashboard. This difference reflected the different goals of the two systems and the destination of the two vehicles: the Delta HF was designed for sport driving, the Prisma for all-conditions safe driving.|$|R
5000|$|The GSF1250 {{range is}} launched. It {{has a new}} petrol injection, {{water-cooled}} engine which is compliant with Euro 3 emission regulations. The new engine generates similar power and torque to the earlier 1,200cc engine but the torque of 108 Nm {{is available at the}} lower engine speed of 3,750 RPM. An auxiliary balance shaft reduces engine vibrations. The GSF1250 also has a new six-speed constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> with the input shaft mounted below the crankshaft to reduce the length of the engine. This allows a longer swing arm for improved handling[...]|$|E
50|$|Like its W25 predecessor, the W125 used a 4-speed manual transmission. The gearbox {{design was}} changed to a {{constant}} mesh type, which provided better reliability compared to the sliding mesh transmission of the M25. In a constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox,</b> the transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but the gears are not rigidly connected to the shafts on which they rotate. Instead, the gears can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft on which they are carried. The previous sliding mesh transmission required the gears to be spinning {{at roughly the same}} speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh.|$|E
50|$|The {{only other}} Regent IIs to differ from {{standard}} were Dundee Corporation's fleet of ex-London Transport STLs, {{all of which}} carried flared-bottomed Weymann bodies. Dundee changed the sliding <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> for the pre-selective version - a move {{which may have been}} expected from a concern like London Transport (who favoured pre-select vehicles) but not of a corporation buying vehicles second-hand. Other operators who bought Regent IIs new included Lowestoft Corporation, Mansfield and District, Reading Corporation, City of Oxford Motor Services, Ebor Bus Co of Mansfield. The twenty from London purchased by Norths, a dealer and were sold to a variety of operators such as Grimsby-Cleethorpes Transport and Dundee Corporation.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of active control of longitudinal vibration on a helicopter gearbox support strut. The aim is to test practical solutions for helicopter interior noise reduction using active control techniques. Very annoying components of cabin noise are associated with <b>gearbox</b> <b>meshing</b> tones. A preliminary transmissibility analysis of the vibration path between the gearbox and the helicopter fuselage showed the predominant contribution of the longitudinal vibration. Thus the experiments were arranged and performed on a strut under longitudinal disturbance conditions. The strut was connected with two end masses to roughly reproduce terminal impedances and equipped {{with a pair of}} surface-bonded piezoelectric patches. The control algorithm was the feed-forward FXLMS. The primary excitation was generated on one end- mass by an electro-mechanical shaker aligned with the beam longitudinal axis. The analysis of the high voltage requirements of the control devices led to the implementation of a frequency-shaped FXLMS algorithm, by including a set of digital band-pass filters designed to concentrate the control action on a priori selected disturbing tones. A careful study has been conducted on the type of pass-band filters to ensure low delay response, high cutting properties, no ripple phenomenon and limited computational burden. Experimental results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Complete rejection of large amplitude narrow band disturbances was achieved with limited control effort...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} loyal Bristol {{customers}} up to 1948 had been the North Western Road Car Company (NWRCC) of Stockport, who had until 1941 been jointly owned by Tilling and the British Electric Traction group. (After 1941 it was transferred to BET group control.) After the North Western's last Bristols were delivered in 1950, the company took Leyland Titans and Royal Tigers {{for a year or}} so, but the heavy weight, high fuel consumption, poor braking performance and high purchase cost of the Royal Tiger led North Western's management to seek an equivalent to the nationalised sector's Bristol LS bus, with lightweight construction and a Gardner engine horizontally oriented and mounted underfloor. Not impressed by the heavyweight Gardner-engined Guy Arab UF and Daimler Freeline they approached Atkinson asking for a bus to their specification. This was called the Atkinson Alpha and it made its debut at the 1952 Earls' Court Commercial Motor Show. The Alpha range featured a horizontal Gardner engine (four, five and six-cylinder versions were offered), a choice of constant <b>mesh</b> and synchromesh <b>gearboxes</b> from David Brown, and either a lightweight or medium-weight frame. As events turned out, after the initial two batches for North Western in 1953-4 - the first of which were rare rear-entrance underfloor-engined buses - the senior management of the BET group removed Atkinson, Guy and Daimler from their list of preferred suppliers. Around the same time, Leyland dropped the purchase price of the Tiger Cub. North Western then took Tiger Cubs and AEC Reliances for their single-deck needs {{for the rest of the}} 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The {{power unit}} on launch was a Leyland O350H 97 bhp 5.76-litre {{four-stroke}} direct-injection six-cylinder diesel, mounted horizontally in mid-wheelbase driving through a unit-mounted Albion clutch and constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> to an overhead-worm rear axle derived from that fitted to the FT and PF series lorries. The radiator was mounted {{behind the front}} axle and was inclined to allow a larger surface area without intrusion into the saloon. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic with an engine-driven vacuum exhauster. The fuel tank was a 35 gallon cylindrical unit transversely mounted between the frame members aft of the rear axle. The engine was fitted with an oil-bath air cleaner and a centrifugal oil filter.|$|E
50|$|The AEC Regent II was a front-engined {{double-decker}} bus built by AEC from 1945 to 1947. Despite officially being {{a new type}} it was {{very similar to the}} 1929 Regent. The Regent IIs were all documented as being new with the A173 (also known as the 7.7-litre) engine and a four speed sliding <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The only vehicles that were not standard were the 100 purchased by B.M.M.O. (Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Company), which were classified as O661/20 as the front had to be re-designed so they could carry similar bonnets and radiator grilles that B.M.M.O. had designed for the double deckers they built themselves.|$|E
5000|$|A new [...] "large and powerful" [...] lorry, E43, {{registration}} BM 787, {{took part}} in the Great Commercial Motor Trials in September 1907. It also had a constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> (Comer (sic) slogan—'dogs which bite with a click'). Unladen weight was (3.7 tonnes) 3 tons 13 cwt, the engine had four-cylinders, its output was 33 horsepower at 800 rpm. It had four forward speeds and was driven by side chains. Length 20 feet (6 metres), width just over (2.1 metres) seven feet and height (1.76 metres) two inches under six feet. The platform was (3.6 metres) twelve feet long. The newspaper noted that a Comercars [...] "chassis" [...] was transporting passengers at Widnes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1958 the Claymore {{range was}} revised {{with a lower}} {{specification}} and greater use of bought-in components {{in an attempt to}} reduce costs and thus it was hoped make the line profitable. Nomenclature was now based on model name, the Claymores becoming models CL5N and CL3N or L and the Nimbus model NS3N. Axles were now of Austin (under British Motor Corporation) design, from their 5-ton truck, the rear axle being of spiral-bevel form and a David Brown four-speed constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox</b> was fitted. There was not a wide version of the BMC axles so the NS3 had a width over tyres of 7 ft, rather than the MR9s 7 ft. The engine was the enlarged Albion EN250, a 4.1-litre unit developing [...] at 2,200 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100 bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving control position.|$|E
50|$|The Alpha {{continued}} to be listed without sales into the 1960s but a final home market order came from Sunderland Corporation in 1962 for 1963/4 delivery. The three buses concerned looked like buses from a different age to previous Atkinsons as they carried Marshall bodies of 33 ft length and 8 ft 2 ½ in width to the then-new BET-group outline, with double curvature front and rear screens and peaked roof-domes at either end. They were finished in a mainly cream version of the Sunderland livery and were to B45D layout. Like Doncaster Corporation's slightly later Leyland Royal Tiger Cubs they were purposely designed for the 'intermediate' length and had a wheelbase of 18 ft. They were numbered 46-48 and registered WBR246-8. The first initially was fitted with a constant <b>mesh</b> <b>gearbox,</b> but was swiftly refitted with a direct-air operated Self-Changing Gears unit, featuring a Leyland style 'pedestal' gear change with which {{the other two were}} built. Sunderland 48 was the last Atkinson PSV constructed and is preserved. Ironically, the last Seddon PSV design, the Pennine 7, had much more in common with the Alpha than with most previous Seddon bus chassis. However, these three buses had the unusual combination of vacuum-assisted brakes and air-operated Self-Changing Gears gearbox.|$|E
