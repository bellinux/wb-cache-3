5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, {{the head}} and body length was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), and the body <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, {{the head and}} body length was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the body <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Kilmer {{was buried}} in the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial, near Fere-en-Tardenois, Aisne, Picardy, France. A cenotaph erected to his memory is located on the Kilmer family plot in Elmwood Cemetery, in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

5|$|A Requiem <b>Mass</b> <b>was</b> {{held for}} Tracy on June 12 at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in East Hollywood. Active pallbearers {{included}} George Cukor, Stanley Kramer, Frank Sinatra, James Stewart, and John Ford. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, Hepburn {{did not attend}} the funeral. Tracy is interred at Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park, near his wife, Louise and son, John.|$|E
5|$|A funeral <b>Mass</b> <b>was</b> {{held for}} her on March 31 at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer in New York, the site where Ferraro and Zaccaro had been married and had renewed their vows on their 50th anniversary the year before.

5|$|A small, reddish-brown carnivore, Salanoia durrelli is {{characterized}} by broad feet with prominent pads, reddish- underparts, and broad, robust teeth, among other differences from the brown-tailed mongoose. In the only two weighed specimens, body <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> 600g and 675g (21 and 24oz). It is a marsh-dwelling animal that may feed on crustaceans and mollusks. The Lac Alaotra area is a threatened ecosystem, and S.durrelli may also be endangered by competition with introduced species.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the muddy}} subsoil of the site, {{work on the}} {{foundation}} continued past {{the work on the}} walls to 1581. In 1585, work on the first of the cathedral's chapels began and by 1615, the cathedral's walls reached to about half of their final height. Construction of the interior of the current cathedral began in 1623 and what is now the vestry was where <b>Mass</b> <b>was</b> conducted after the first church was finally torn down.|$|E
5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{the events}} of this {{scenario}} in reverse sequence, we see that non-conservation of <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> a common occurrence: when an unstable elementary particle spontaneously decays into two lighter particles, total energy is conserved, but the <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> not.

5|$|By {{the time}} the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) began subsidizing northside {{commuter}} rail operations in the late 1960s, both the Lexington Branch and the Central Mass Branch {{had been reduced to}} single rush hour round trips on poorly maintained track. The South Sudbury run on the Central <b>Mass</b> <b>was</b> terminated on November 26, 1971. The Bedford round trip on the Lexington Branch ended after a major snowstorm on January 10, 1977, leaving the Fitchburg Line (with multiple daily round trips) as the only rail service at Cambridge station.|$|E
5|$|Cagney died at his Dutchess County farm in Stanfordville, New York, on Easter Sunday 1986, {{of a heart}} attack. He was 86 years old. A funeral <b>Mass</b> <b>was</b> held at Manhattan's St. Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church. The eulogy at {{the funeral}} was given by his close friend, who was also the President of the United States at the time, Ronald Reagan. His pallbearers {{included}} the boxer Floyd Patterson, the dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov (who had hoped to play Cagney on Broadway), actor Ralph Bellamy, and the director Miloš Forman. Governor Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor Edward I. Koch were also in attendance at the service.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton forms {{part of the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford. The Roman Catholic Parish of Corpus Christi {{was founded}} in Chadderton in 1878, {{following}} immigration to the region by Irish Catholics fleeing the Great Famine. A combined school and church was opened in 1904. A further Catholic parish for Chadderton, dedicated to Saint Herbert, was created in 1916. Its first <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> held on 1July1916, the day the Battle of the Somme began.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A basic mathematic {{model of}} ship section added <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} for the ship dynamics research.

50|$|Einstein’s {{equivalence}} principle postulates that inertial mass must equal passive gravitational mass. The law of conservation of momentum requires that active and passive gravitational <b>mass</b> <b>be</b> identical. All experimental evidence {{to date has}} found these are, indeed, always the same. In considering negative <b>mass,</b> it <b>is</b> important to consider which of these concepts of <b>mass</b> <b>are</b> negative. In most analyses of negative <b>mass,</b> it <b>is</b> assumed that the {{equivalence principle}} and conservation of momentum continue to apply, and therefore all three forms of <b>mass</b> <b>are</b> still the same.|$|R
50|$|In meteorology, an air <b>mass</b> <b>is</b> {{a volume}} of air defined by its {{temperature}} and water vapor content. Air masses cover many {{hundreds or thousands of}} square miles, and adapt to the characteristics of the surface below them. They are classified according to latitude and their continental or maritime source regions. Colder air <b>masses</b> <b>are</b> termed polar or arctic, while warmer air <b>masses</b> <b>are</b> deemed tropical. Continental and superior air <b>masses</b> <b>are</b> dry while maritime and monsoon air <b>masses</b> <b>are</b> moist. Weather fronts separate air masses with different density (temperature and/or moisture) characteristics. Once an air mass moves away from its source region, underlying vegetation and water bodies can quickly modify its character. Classification schemes tackle an air mass' characteristics, as well as modification.|$|R
5|$|Charles was ailing {{during the}} last years of his life. He died in Visegrád on 16July 1342. His corpse was first {{delivered}} to Buda where a <b>Mass</b> <b>was</b> said for his soul. From Buda, his corpse was taken to Székesfehérvár. He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica a month after his death. His brother-in-law, CasimirIII of Poland, and Charles, Margrave of Moravia, were present at his funeral, an indication of Charles's international prestige.|$|E
5|$|East Timorese animist {{belief systems}} {{did not fit}} with Indonesia's {{constitutional}} monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> replaced by Indonesian mass. Before the invasion, only 20 percent of East Timorese were Roman Catholics, and by the 1980s, 95 percent were registered as Catholics. With over 90 percent Catholic population, East Timor is currently {{one of the most}} densely Catholic countries in the world.|$|E
5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the new land was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land <b>mass</b> <b>was</b> probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon radically changed this picture. By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate Pluto's mass for the first time, which they found to be much smaller than expected.
