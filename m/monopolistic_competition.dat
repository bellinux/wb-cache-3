5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s, new Keynesian {{researchers}} investigated how market imperfections like <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition,</b> nominal frictions like sticky prices, and other frictions made microeconomics consistent with Keynesian macroeconomics.

40|$|Scrutinizing a {{state-dependent}} {{pricing model}} {{in the presence of}} menu costs and dynamic duopolistic interactions, this paper claims that the assumption about market structure is crucial for identifying menu costs for price changes. Prices in a dynamic duopoly market can be more rigid than those in more competitive markets such as monopolistically competitive one. If so, estimates of menu costs under <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competitions</b> are potentially biased upwards due to the price rigidity from strategic interactions between dynamic duopoly rms. Developing and estimating a dynamic discrete-choice model with duopoly to correct this potential bias, this paper provides empirical evidence that not only menu costs but also dynamic strategic interactions play an important role to explain the observed degree of price rigidity in data of weekly retail prices. ...|$|R

25|$|Unemployment: Idle {{capacity}} under <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> expenditure {{leads to}} unemployment. In particular, unemployment of workers leads to poverty and misery in the society. If idle capacity is fully used, {{the problem of}} unemployment can be solved to some extent.|$|E
25|$|Selling costs: Products under <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> are {{spending}} huge amounts on advertising and publicity. Much of this expenditure is wasteful {{from the social}} point of view. The producer can reduce {{the price of the}} product instead of spending on publicity.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} of a double dividend from environmental taxation i. e. whether shifting the burden of taxation away from labour toward the environment can boost employment and increase welfare. We present a general-equilibrium model where the economy is distorted by labour taxes, <b>monopolistic</b> product-market <b>competition,</b> and union-wage bargaining. We find that employment and welfare always increase when the revenue from an {{the introduction of a}} Pigouvian tax (imposed on firms and households) is fully recycled to cut the rate of the pre-existing labour tax. Moreover, {{it turns out that the}} degree of the imperfections influences the magnitude of the effects of the reform. We also offer numerical results for the case in which the pollution tax is positive at the outset...|$|R
40|$|The present paper studies {{localisation}} economies from {{a service}} industry perspective {{and especially the}} spatial location structure of the consumer- and producer service sector in Sweden. The service sector and especially the producer input sector is assumed to handle specialised goods (inputs) and theory therefore suggests {{a certain degree of}} <b>monopolistic</b> chamberlinian <b>competition</b> amongst the firms in this sector. Theory also proposes that firms within service-industries manage so-called non-tradable items and should therefore be influenced by intra- rather than interregional demand in their location decision. The service sector is also assumed to be relatively labour intensive and is therefore dependent on a pooled labour market with specialised skills. Population density should therefore be an important determinant in determining the proliferation of those sectors in a region. ...|$|R
25|$|Excess Capacity: Under Imperfect competition, the {{installed}} capacity of every firm is large, but not fully utilized. Total output is, therefore, {{less than the}} output which is socially desirable. Since production capacity is not fully utilized, the resources lie idle. Therefore, the production under <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> is below the full capacity level.|$|E
25|$|Lack of Specialization: Under <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition,</b> {{there is}} little scope for {{specialization}} or standardization. Product differentiation practiced under this competition leads to wasteful expenditure. It is argued that instead of producing too many similar products, only a few standardized products may be produced. This would ensure better allocation of resources and would promote economic welfare of the society.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} change in neoclassical economics occurred around 1933. Joan Robinson and Edward H. Chamberlin, with the near simultaneous publication {{of their respective}} books, The Economics of Imperfect Competition (1933) and The Theory of <b>Monopolistic</b> <b>Competition</b> (1933), introduced models of imperfect competition. Theories of market forms and industrial organization grew out of this work. They also emphasized certain tools, such as the marginal revenue curve.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} argued that {{competing}} banks make inefficiently frequent use of collateralization in situations where they are better able to evaluate a project's risk than entrepreneurs. We study the bank's choice between screening and collateralization in a model where banks do not have this superior screening skill. In particular, we study the effect of bank competition on this choice. We find that competing banks use collateral less often than a <b>monopolistic</b> bank because <b>competition</b> will intensify if both banks collateralize. Moreover, bank competition is welfare improving if collateralization is rather costly...|$|R
25|$|In {{perfectly}} competitive markets {{studied in}} the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. Industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition,</b> various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.|$|E
25|$|Like perfect competition, under <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> also, {{the firms}} can enter or exit freely. The firms will enter when the {{existing}} firms are making super-normal profits. With {{the entry of}} new firms, the supply would increase which would reduce the price and hence the existing firms will be left only with normal profits. Similarly, if the existing firms are sustaining losses, some of the marginal firms will exit. It will reduce the supply due to which price would rise and the existing firms will be left only with normal profit.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> {{is a type}} of {{imperfect}} competition such that many producers sell products that are differentiated from one another (e.g. by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes. In <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition,</b> a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms. In the presence of coercive government, <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> will fall into government-granted monopoly. Unlike perfect competition, the firm maintains spare capacity. Models of <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> are often used to model industries. Textbook examples of industries with market structures similar to <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> include restaurants, cereal, clothing, shoes, and service industries in large cities.

5000|$|In {{business}} literature, commoditization {{is defined}} as the process by which goods that have economic value and are distinguishable in terms of attributes (uniqueness or brand) end up becoming simple commodities {{in the eyes of the}} market or consumers. It is the movement of a market from differentiated to undifferentiated price <b>competition</b> and from <b>monopolistic</b> to perfect <b>competition.</b> Hence, the key effect of commoditization is that the pricing power of the manufacturer or brand owner is weakened: when products become more similar from a buyer's point of view, they will tend to buy the cheapest.|$|R
25|$|George {{was opposed}} to tariffs, which were at the time both the major method of {{protectionist}} trade policy and {{an important source of}} federal revenue (the federal income tax having not yet been introduced). He argued that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in overall wages. He also believed that tariffs protected <b>monopolistic</b> companies from <b>competition,</b> thus augmenting their power. Later in his life, free trade became a major issue in federal politics and his book Protection or Free Trade was read into the Congressional Record by five Democratic congressmen.|$|R
2500|$|There are six {{characteristics}} of <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> (MC): ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> {{is a type}} of {{imperfect}} competition such that many producers sell products that are differentiated from one another (e.g. by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes. In <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition,</b> a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms. The [...] "founding father" [...] of the theory of <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> is Edward Hastings Chamberlin, who wrote a pioneering book on the subject, Theory of <b>Monopolistic</b> <b>Competition</b> (1933). Joan Robinson published a book The Economics of Imperfect Competition with a comparable theme of distinguishing perfect from {{imperfect competition}}. Chamberlin defined <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> as, [...] "...challenge to traditional viewpoint of economics that competition and monopoly are alternatives and that individual prices are to be explained in terms of one or the other." [...] He continues, [...] "By contrast it is held that most economic situations are composite of both competition and monopoly, and that, wherever this is the case, a false view is given by neglecting either one of the two forces and regarding the situation as made up entirely of the other." ...|$|E
2500|$|The long-run {{characteristics}} of a monopolistically competitive market are almost {{the same as a}} perfectly competitive market. [...] Two differences between the two are that <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> produces heterogeneous products and that <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> involves a great deal of non-price competition, which is based on subtle product differentiation. [...] A firm making profits in the short run will nonetheless only break even in the long run because demand will decrease and average total cost will increase. [...] This means in the long run, a monopolistically competitive firm will make zero economic profit. This illustrates the amount of influence the firm has over the market; because of brand loyalty, it can raise its prices without losing all of its customers. This means that an individual firm's demand curve is downward sloping, in contrast to perfect competition, which has a perfectly elastic demand schedule.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a perfect {{competition}} test which checks whether arbitrarily small coalitions of firms, which behave strategically on costs, {{are able to}} manipulate prices in their own benefit. We apply this test to economies with a continuum of differentiated producers. We show that, under thickness conditions on preferences, implying {{a high degree of}} substitutability among commodities, there is no monopolistic power neither in economies with constant average costs nor in economies with increasing returns. We also give an example of thin markets where monopolistic power prevails. Perfect <b>competition,</b> <b>monopolistic</b> power, Walrasian equilibrium, thick markets...|$|R
40|$|Objective – Analyze the {{reactions}} {{of the stock market}} to M&A announcements, i. e. find out if there was value creation and consequently maximization of shareholder wealth or whether there was value destruction and consequently a decrease in the wealth of the shareholders of the acquiring companies in the short term. Design/methodology/approach – Event study – Quantitative Method Findings – It can neither be affirmed that the acquisitions {{had a significant impact on}} value creation for purchasers and banks, nor can it be denied. Given the lack of preponderance of either positive or negative returns, the transactions may have been perceived in different manners. Practical implications – The results may be explained by the fact that the synergies that resulted from the M&A processes in the banking sector only helped consolidating major market players and consequently reduced competitiveness in that sector. The negative abnormal returns of M&A processes are due to the <b>monopolistic</b> market <b>competition</b> structure (Tabak, Fazio & Cajueiro, 2012).

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{contributions in}} labor economics suggest that individual firms face upward sloping labor supplies. We rationalize this by assuming that diosyncratic non-pecuniary conditions interact with money wages in workers' decisions {{to work for}} specific firms. Likewise, firms supply differentiated goods in response to differences in consumer tastes. Hence, firms are price-makers and wage-setters. By combining <b>monopolistic</b> and monopsonistic <b>competition,</b> our setting encapsulates general equilibrium interactions between the two markets. The equilibrium involves double exploitation of labor. Compared to the competitive outcome, the high-productive workers are overpaid under free entry, whereas the low-productive workers are underpaid. In the same vein, capital-owners receive a premium, whereas workers are exploited...|$|R
2500|$|Monopolistically {{competitive}} {{firms are}} inefficient, {{it is usually}} the case that the costs of regulating prices for products sold in <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> exceed the benefits of such regulation[...] A monopolistically competitive firm might be said to be marginally inefficient because the firm produces at an output where average total cost is not a minimum. A monopolistically competitive market is productively inefficient market structure because marginal cost is less than price in the long run. Monopolistically competitive markets are also allocatively inefficient, as the price given is higher than Marginal cost. Product differentiation increases total utility by better meeting people's wants than homogenous products in a perfectly competitive market.|$|E
2500|$|Forms include {{monopoly}} (in {{which there}} is only one seller of a good), duopoly (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), monopsony (in {{which there is}} only one buyer of a good), and oligopsony (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be [...] "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{concern is}} that <b>monopolistic</b> <b>competition</b> fosters {{advertising}} {{and the creation of}} brand names. Advertising induces customers into spending more on products because of the name associated with them rather than because of rational factors. Defenders of advertising dispute this, arguing that brand names can represent a guarantee of quality and that advertising helps reduce the cost to consumers of weighing the tradeoffs of numerous competing brands. [...] There are unique information and information processing costs associated with selecting a brand in a monopolistically competitive environment. In a monopoly market, the consumer is faced with a single brand, making information gathering relatively inexpensive. In a perfectly competitive industry, the consumer is faced with many brands, but because the brands are virtually identical information gathering is also relatively inexpensive. In a monopolistically competitive market, the consumer must collect and process information on a large number of different brands to be able to select the best of them. In many cases, the cost of gathering information necessary to selecting the best brand can exceed the benefit of consuming the best brand instead of a randomly selected brand. The result is that the consumer is confused. Some brands gain prestige value and can extract an additional price for that.|$|E
40|$|This paper models an {{open economy}} with a {{competitive}} traded sector and a <b>monopolistic</b> non-traded sector. <b>Competition</b> {{policy in the}} non-traded sector can reduce the price of traded goods and increase welfare {{but only if the}} labour market clears continuously. If insider workers have "power" over entrepreneurs, competition policy merely enables wage increases (or increased profit taking) in both sectors.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1990 s, the credit balance of the banking system in mainland China has experienced a big swing from negative to positive. The balance has continued to expand up to now. It seems that both negative and positive credit balances are so large that the financial resources have been utilized inefficiently by the banking system. On the eve of China¡¦s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), challenges from banking competition will increase. In this paper a three-sector equilibrium model of <b>monopolistic</b> banking <b>competition</b> is set up and is applied to analyze {{the impact of the}} expanding credit balances and banking reform on the Chinese economy. Through theoretical analysis, reasons for the expanding credit balance are provided and some possible solutions are given. China's accession to the WTO will present many challenges to the state-owned banks. Foreign banks will be allowed to compete directly with Chinese local banks. We found that competition will not only promote China's GDP, investment, consumption and deposits as well as bring benefits to consumers, but also provide the banking sector from Hong Kong with new opportunities. banking competition, WTO, China, Hong Kong...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{management of}} hydropower dams within <b>monopolistic</b> and oligopolistic <b>competition</b> and when hydroelectricity producers are risk averse and face demand uncertainty. In {{each type of}} market structure we analytically determine the water release path in closed-loop equilibrium. We show how a monopoly can manage its hydropower dams by additional pumping or storage depending on the relative abundance of water between different regions to smooth the effect of uncertainty on electricity prices. In the oligopolistic case with symmetric risk aversion coefficient, we determine {{the conditions under which}} the relative scarcity (abundance) of water in the dam of a hydroelectric operator can favor additional strategic pumping (storage) in its competitor’s dams. When there is asymmetry of the risk aversion coefficient, the firm’s hydroelectricity production increases as its competitor’s risk aversion increases, if and only if the average recharge speed of the competitor’s dam exceeds a certain threshold, which is an increasing function of its average water inflows...|$|R
