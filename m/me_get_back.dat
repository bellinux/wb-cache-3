6000|$|Boone May was one {{of these}} avengers. When I {{employed}} him, as a messenger, he was under indictment for murder. He had trailed a [...] "road agent" [...] across, the Bad Lands for hundreds of miles, brought him back to within a few miles of Deadwood and picketed him out for the night. The desperate man, tied as he was, had attempted to escape, and May found it expedient to shoot and bury him. The grave by the roadside is perhaps still pointed out to the curious. May gave himself up, was formally charged with murder, released on his own recognizance, and I had to give him leave of absence to go to court and be acquitted. Some of the New York directors of my company having been good enough to signify their disapproval of my action in employing [...] "such a man," [...] I could do no less than make some recognition of their dissent, and thenceforth he was borne upon the pay-rolls as [...] "Boone May, Murderer." [...] Now let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to my story.|$|E

"You {{never can}} {{know all that}} she has sacrificed for me--never can imagine what I have felt {{for years and years}} past"--his voice trembled, and the tears came into his eyes--"but I dare not trust myself to speak of that; the thought of the old happy days in the Abbey almost breaks my heart now. Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to the other subject. I must tell you that I kept the frightful vision which pursued me, at all times and in all places, a secret from everybody, knowing the vile reports about my having {{inherited}} madness from my family, and fearing that an unfair advantage would be taken of any confession that I might make. Though the phantom always stood opposite to me, and therefore always appeared either before or by the side of any person to whom I spoke, I soon schooled myself to hide from others that I was looking at it except on rare occasions, when I have perhaps betrayed myself to you. But my self-possession availed me nothing with Ada. The day of our marriage was approaching." ...|$|E

I can't. If I stopped here I shouldn't rest. If I waited till to-morrow, I should only be going back to have another look at her. I don't want to feel more ashamed of myself than I do already. I want to fight my way back to my duty and myself, without stopping to think twice about it. Darkness is nothing to me--I'm used to darkness. I have got the high-road to walk on, and I can't lose my way. Let me go, Lizzie! The only sweetheart I have any business with at my age is my ship.

60|$|I am {{remarkably well}} connected, I can tell you. I {{came into this}} world with the great {{advantage}} of having Lady Malkinshaw for a grandmother, her ladyship's daughter for a mother, and Francis James Softly, Esq., M. D. (commonly called Doctor Softly), for a father. I put my father last, {{because he was not}} so well connected as my mother, and my grandmother first, because she was the most nobly-born person of the three. I have been, am still, and may continue to be, a Rogue; but I hope I am not abandoned enough yet to forget the respect that is due to rank. On this account, I trust, nobody will show such want of regard for my feelings as to expect me to say much about my mother's brother. That inhuman person committed an outrage on his family by making a fortune in the soap and candle trade. I apologize for mentioning him, even in an accidental way. The fact is, he left my sister, Annabella, a legacy of rather a peculiar kind, saddled with certain conditions which indirectly affected me; but this passage of family history need not be produced just yet. I apologize a second time for alluding to money matters before it was absolutely necessary. Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to a pleasing and reputable subject, by saying a word or two more about my father.|$|E
6000|$|... [Here I was {{interrupted}} and informed that a stranger wished {{to see me}} down at the door. I went and confronted him, and asked to know his business, struggling {{all the time to}} keep a tight rein on my seething political-economy ideas, and not let them break away from me or get tangled in their harness. And privately I wished the stranger was {{in the bottom of the}} canal with a cargo of wheat on top of him. I was all in a fever, but he was cool. He said he was sorry to disturb me, but as he was passing he noticed that I needed some lightning-rods. I said, [...] "Yes, yes--go on--what about it?" [...] He said there was nothing about it, in particular--nothing except that he would like to put them up for me. I am new to housekeeping; have been used to hotels and boarding-houses all my life. Like anybody else of similar experience, I try to appear (to strangers) to be an old housekeeper; consequently I said in an offhand way that I had been intending for some time to have six or eight lightning-rods put up, but--The stranger started, and looked inquiringly at me, but I was serene. I thought that if I chanced to make any mistakes, he would not catch me by my countenance. He said he would rather have my custom than any man's in town. I said, [...] "All right," [...] and started off to wrestle with my great subject again, when he called me back and said it would be necessary to know exactly how many [...] "points" [...] I wanted put up, what parts of the house I wanted them on, and what quality of rod I preferred. It was close quarters for a man not used to the exigencies of housekeeping; but I went through creditably, and he probably never suspected that I was a novice. I told him to put up eight [...] "points," [...] and put them all on the roof, and use the best quality of rod. He said he could furnish the [...] "plain" [...] article at 20 cents a foot; [...] "coppered," [...] 25 cents; [...] "zinc-plated spiral-twist," [...] at 30 cents, that would stop a streak of lightning any time, no matter where it was bound, and [...] "render its errand harmless and its further progress apocryphal." [...] I said apocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanating from the source it did, but, philology aside, I liked the spiral-twist and would take that brand. Then he said he could make two hundred and fifty feet answer; but to do it right, and make the best job in town of it, and attract the admiration of the just and the unjust alike, and compel all parties to say they never saw a more symmetrical and hypothetical display of lightning-rods since they were born, he supposed he really couldn't get along without four hundred, though he was not vindictive, and trusted he was willing to try. I said, go ahead and use four hundred, and make any kind of a job he pleased out of it, but let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to my work. So I got rid of him at last; and now, after half an hour spent in getting my train of political-economy thoughts coupled together again, I am ready to go on once more.] ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{the early}} stages of the Euro 2008 {{qualification}} campaign, Spain lost 2-3 against Northern Ireland.

I know that what I'm saying is not going to help <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the national team, but it's what I feel." [...] He later commented, [...] "The only thing I wanted to say is that these are not clear times for the national squad after losing to Northern Ireland .... but it was not my intention to attack the team or Luis Aragonés"; subsequently he failed to be selected again, as the national side went on to record 35 consecutive games without defeat, winning a record 15 consecutive times and lifting the Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 trophies.|$|E
5000|$|The Black Bar Mitzvah was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed reviews from music critics. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the mixtape three out of five stars, saying [...] "The Black Bar Mitzvah is a perfect title for a Rick Ross mixtape: his vision of playalistic splendor {{has always been the}} stuff of thirteen-year-old boy fantasy. [...] "My new home look like it’s Al Capone/My new bitch look like she in En Vogue," [...] he raps over swirling strings and blinding-bright hi-hats on [...] "Us," [...] featuring Drake. Ross stomps triumphally over hits like Kanye's [...] "Mercy" [...] and [...] "Birthday" [...] by 2 Chainz, hates on Mitt Romney, and even recaps his recent micro-brawl with Young Jeezy at the BET Hip-Hop Awards: [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to my bitches 'cause you bitch niggas ain't nothing"- even when reality creeps in, he still sounds like a superhero." [...] Calvin Stovall of BET gave the mixtape three out of five stars, saying [...] "The Black Bar Mitzvah plays like every run-of-the-mill, jacking-for-beats tape we’ve heard. As novel as it is to hear Ross and his MMG fam lace some of the day’s hardest bangers, it’s not enough to keep anyone’s attention in a game where hungry MCs are putting some of their best original content onto mixtapes. He raised the bar himself, so he has only himself to blame, but Ross’ performance isn’t a complete disappointment. It’s great to hear him on underrated Southern bangers like [...] "Gone to the Moon," [...] "Bands" [...] and [...] "Us," [...] where Ross proves that his flow is still top notch. But stale remixes of G.O.O.D Music hits [...] "Clique" [...] and [...] "Mercy" [...] only exist to introduce MMG’s newest pick-up, Rockie Fresh. That's fair enough, considering it seems like the greater purpose of the entire tape was to promote upcoming projects from Meek Mill and Gunplay, but Ross owes listeners more than this head-scratcher." ...|$|E

40|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> {{to entry}} # 002, where I {{pointed out the}} value of {{distinguishing}} between inferential and descriptive techniques. I believe my first few tries at understanding statistics failed because I took classes that didn’t make this distinction. Consider good ol ’ ordinary least squares (OLS), which is often all the stats an undergrad will learn. Here are the steps: • Clean your data, producing an input matrix X and a dependent vector Y. This is via various computer-code matrix manipulations and substitutions for missing data. • Find the line of best fit, with coefficients β = (X ′ X) − 1 X ′ Y, using pure linear algebra. • Test the elements of β, using methods most folks recognize as statistical, regarding comparing a statistic against a distribution. The {{point here is that}} each of these steps is a different world from the others: computer trickery, linear algebra, and t-distributions basically have nothing in common. Like most undergrad courses, I’ll pass on the first step, and assume a perfect data set...|$|E
