5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.1 was {{powered by}} an {{arrangement}} of four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. The engines were embedded in pairs into the aircraft's wing root; {{because of the high}} mounted position of the wing, the tail had to adopt a high <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> maintain clearance of the jet turbulence, however the airbrakes were ideally situated {{to take advantage of this}} phenomenon. Difficulties were encountered with the Sapphires when stationed in tropical environments; several engines were destroyed by the turbine blades striking the outer engine casing. The Victor B.2 adopted the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan; the Conway at one point held the distinction of being the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside of the Soviet Union, and were significantly more powerful than the preceding Sapphire engines employed upon on the B.1.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E

25|$|The Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) refit for {{the four}} {{surviving}} Restigouches was announced in 1978. An effort by Maritime Command to update their existing stock of naval escorts, the DELEX program affected 16 ships in total and came in several different formats depending on the class of ship it was being applied to. On average, the DELEX refit cost $24 million per ship. For the Restigouches this meant updating their sensor, weapon and communications systems. The class received the new ADLIPS tactical data system, new radar and fire control systems and satellite navigation. They were also fitted with a triple torpedo tube <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> use the new Mk 46 torpedo. The ships began undergoing their DELEX refits in the early 1980s. However, {{by the time the}} ships emerged from their refits, they were already obsolete as the Falklands War had changed the way surface battles were fought.|$|E
25|$|The Latécoère 350, or 35-0 as it {{was first}} called, was a direct {{development}} of the successful single-engined passenger carrying Latécoère 28. To increase cruising speed and, in particular to provide reliability for night flying, the new design had three engines. Apart from the immediate changes this involved and a modest increase in wingspan, the 350 and the 28 had much in common, both in structural detail and in general appearance. Both were high wing, strut braced monoplanes with enclosed cockpits and fixed undercarriages. The two extra engines of the 350 were mounted {{at the ends of}} stub wings, more streamlined support structures than lifting surfaces, which extended horizontally from the lower fuselage longerons. Each was further stabilised by a pair of struts from {{the upper part of the}} engine <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> the wing roots. The outer engines were mounted as close together as possible, to minimize the couple resulting from the loss of power of one of them. They were housed in long, well streamlined cowlings that reached back as far as the wing trailing edge. The third engine was in the nose, as in the Latécoère 28. All the engines were 400hp (298kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V-12 twelve water-cooled units. Three separate radiators for them were fixed under the stub wing.|$|E

Her ammunition hoists were problematic and could not sustain the desired rate of fire of six rounds per gun per minute. Special ballast tanks were used {{to compensate for the}} loss of weight as ammunition was fired. Working and control of the guns required no less than 58 men. The fire-control tower {{was in the middle of}} the conning tower and had a top section that could be raised [...] when in use. The upper control room was between the tower and the pressure hull.

500|$|The opening aria, [...] "" [...] (I will gladly {{carry the}} Cross), is in bar form AAB, with two stollen (A) {{followed}} by an abgesang (B). The first stollen starts with a ritornello for full orchestra, anticipating in counterpoint the rising and then falling motif of the bass soloist, <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> an anguished augmented second marking the word [...] (Cross), followed by descending sighing figures signalling the bearing of the cross. After the entry of the soloist, with its long and expressive melismatic lines, the three groups of strings and oboes accompany in counterpoint and echoing responses drawn from motifs of the opening ritornello. The ritornello is then taken up in the second stollen, but with significant variations because of the differing text: [...] "It leads me after my torments to God in the Promised Land". After {{a repeat of the}} opening ritornello, the final abgesang illustrates the words, [...] "There at last I will lay my sorrow in the grave, there my Savior himself will wipe away my tears." [...] Declamatory triplets, dramatically spanning the whole bass register, are responded to by sighing motifs in the accompaniment. A reprise of the orchestral ritornello brings the aria to a close.|$|E

Customarily, rulers did it {{at the beginning of the}} first full year of their reign, but they could also be proclaimed at times of military conflict or crop failure. The first known ones were made by Enmetena and Urukagina of Lagash in 2400-2350 BC. According to Hudson, the purpose of these decrees was to prevent debts <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> a degree that they threatened the fighting force, which could happen if peasants lost the subsistence land or became bondservants due to the inability to repay the debt.|$|E
2500|$|Sydney {{attempted}} {{to open the}} gap between the two ships as she opened fire. This was hampered by the loss of both rangefinders, requiring each <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> be targeted and fired locally. The first two salvoes missed, but two shells from the third struck: one exploding in Emdens wireless office, another by the Germans' forward gun. [...] Heavy fire from Sydney damaged or destroyed Emdens steering gear, rangefinders, and the voicepipes to the turrets and engineering, and knocked out several guns. The forward funnel collapsed overboard, then the foremast fell and crushed the fore-bridge. A shell from Sydney landed in the aft ammunition room of Emden, and the Germans had to flood it or risk a massive explosion.|$|E

2500|$|The early {{style of}} the ceramic disc {{capacitor}} could be more cheaply produced than the common ceramic tube capacitors in the 1950s and 1970s. An American company {{in the midst of}} the Apollo program, launched in 1961, pioneered the stacking of multiple discs to create a monolithic block. This [...] "multi-layer ceramic capacitor" [...] (MLCC) was compact and offered high-capacitance capacitors. The production of these capacitors using the tape casting and ceramic-electrode cofiring processes was a great manufacturing challenge. MLCCs expanded the range of applications to those requiring larger capacitance values in smaller cases. These ceramic chip capacitors were the driving force behind the conversion of electronic devices from through-hole <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> surface-mount technology in the 1980s. Polarized electrolytic capacitors could be replaced by non-polarized ceramic capacitors, simplifying the mounting.|$|E
2500|$|The Fafnir's {{fuselage}} was oval {{in cross}} section, carefully streamlined with a ply skin and becoming slender behind the wing. The cockpit was {{just ahead of}} the wing and originally enclosed in a ply covered faring with only two side apertures for vision. [...] Later this fairing was replaced with a stepped and fully glazed canopy. [...] All the tail surfaces were fabric covered: [...] an all-moving tapered elevator with an unswept leading edge was mounted on the fuselage mid-line below a small, straight edged fin which carried a large, rounded rudder mounted at the keel and moving in a shallow elevator cut-out. [...] Launching accidents showed this exposed low <b>mounting</b> <b>to</b> be a dangerous weakness. A skid, running from the nose to under the wing trailing edge acted as an undercarriage.|$|E

Angela Hsi, for her part, cites a contemporaneous source to argue that Wu led 40,000 troops ("one of the better military forces of the day") and that he was assisted by 70,000 residents of Liaodong (遼東), [...] "who were reputed to be excellent fighters." ...|$|E
