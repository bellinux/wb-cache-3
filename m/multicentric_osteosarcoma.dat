Multifocal {{osteosarcoma}} {{is usually}} {{described as the}} occurrence of the tumour at two or more sites in a patient without pulmonary metastases and may be synchronous or metachronous. Case report. A previously well 21 -year old male, who presented with a swollen, painful right knee with no history of trauma, {{was found to have}} a high-grade osteosarcoma of the distal tibia and proximal femur. He underwent resection and prosthetic replacement of the distal femur and proximal tibia and remains well 19 months after diagnosis. Discussion. Multifocal osteosarcoma is a rare condition with a poor prognosis. There is debate about whether it represents multiple primary tumours or metastatic disease. Copyright © 2006 V. A. Currall and J. H.

BACKGROUND Multifocal or <b>multicentric</b> <b>osteosarcoma</b> was first described by Silverman [1]. It is usually defined as the occurrence of the tumour at two or more sites in a patient without pulmonary metastases [2 – 4] and may be synchronous (more than one lesion at presentation) or metachronous (new tumours developin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the head}} and neck region, {{osteosarcoma}} is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, representing 23 % of total head and neck malignancies. Osteosarcomas of the jaws are nevertheless rare lesions, representing only 2 to 10 % of all osteosarcomas. This report reviews a single-center histopathology experience with craniofacial osteosarcomas, and reports the management of unusually large synchronous mandibular and maxillary osteosarcomas in a patient. Patients and methods A search of the hospital pathology database for specimens with a histological diagnosis of osteosarcomas submitted between July 1992 and May 2011 was made. A chart review of a patient with large synchronous maxillary and mandibular osteosarcomas was performed, and is reported. Case presentation A 21 -year-old African man with large maxillary and mandibular tumors under palliative care presented with increasing difficulties with eating, speech, and breathing. Surgical debulking was performed, with histology confirming synchronous osteosarcomas of the mandible and maxilla. The patient is well after one year, with no evidence of recurrence, having undergone no further treatment. Conclusion Osteosarcomas of the jaw remain enigmatic, and a number of difficulties related to their diagnosis and treatment are yet to be resolved. True synchronous <b>multicentric</b> <b>osteosarcomas</b> of the jaws are extremely rare but, like other osteosarcomas of the jaws, have a favorable outcome, and palliative resection of such lesions, though challenging, can therefore lead to an enormously improved quality of life and self-image, and may even offer the opportunity for cure. </p...|$|R
