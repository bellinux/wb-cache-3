5|$|The Enterprise {{heads to}} Torona IV to open {{negotiations}} with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>protocol.</b> After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen (David Selburg) {{to join him in}} the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary (Gary Armagnac) brings Picard into the police station for questioning as a suspect in her murder. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is scanned from a distance by the Jaradan, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning with James Madison, every {{president}} has been an occasional attendee at St. John's due both to the overwhelmingly Episcopal religious affiliation of U.S. presidents and the church's proximity to the Executive Mansion.

St. John's is popularly nicknamed the [...] "Church of the Presidents". President James Madison established the tradition of a [...] "President's pew," [...] selecting pew 28 for his private use in 1816. During a renovation in 1843, the pews were renumbered, and the President's pew became pew 58. President John Tyler asked that pew 58 be assigned to him, and paid for its use in perpetuity by presidents of the United States. Additional renovations in 1883 renumbered the seat to pew 54, and this pew has remained reserved for the President's use when in attendance.

5000|$|The Bureau of Barbarians (scrinium barbarorum, , skrinion tōn barbarōn), was a {{department}} of government in the Roman/Byzantine Empire.

The Notitia records that four secretaries (subadiuvae), either from the existing corps of the agentes in rebus or seconded from other bureaux, were appointed for each of the four major administrative divisions of the Eastern Empire: Asiana, Pontica, Oriens, and Thrace and Illyricum jointly.

30|$|At the {{commencement}} of the meeting, I introduced myself and explained who I was and where I was from.

By introducing myself to the community I provided information about my cultural location “so that connection can be made on political, cultural and social grounds and relations established” (Moreton-Robinson 2000, p. xv). This process allowed the community to locate me in the context of ancestry, where I was from and my family relations. That said, I began a discussion about mathematics, to gain an understanding of the community views of mathematics. This question invited conversations about mathematics, what they thought it was about, what they liked and disliked, where they used maths and who they learn it from. Their responses helped me to identify the maths they used in everyday life. This illuminative experience highlighted for me that I was looking at mathematics still largely as disembodied from the elements that are constitutive of daily life on the island.|$|R

[...] Original jurisdiction between the GFP and the Einsatzgruppen in the Eastern theater was supposed to be clearly delineated and mutually reciprocal, but when the final negotiations about identified areas of responsibility took place in May 1941 between Generalquartiermeister Eduard Wagner and Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller, there was serious disagreement. Due to his expertise in <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> <b>protocol,</b> Walter Schellenberg replaced Müller and subsequently made important changes to the original draft, alterations which allowed the Einsatzgruppen to operate in both the rear areas of the army group and in the corps areas of the front.
