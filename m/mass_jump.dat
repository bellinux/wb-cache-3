The algorithm {{is based on the}} known procedure of jet clustering with variable distance parameter $R$ and adapts the jet size to its transverse momentum $p_T$.

In ideal case, {{this type of}} gyro should be insensitive {{to this kind of}} impact due to primary and secondary angular oscillations. However, experimental results reveal significant increase in output signal under external vibrations in 20 Hz - 2 kHz bandwidth, though the device natural frequencies are above 3 kHz. This effect is caused by characteristicsnonlinearity of plate-type and comb-type capacitive sensors. Method. Mathematical model of the capacitive comb-type sensors is clarified. Electromechanical interactions in the sensors under external vibrations are described. Simulink modeling of specified mathematical model is carried out.

40|$|An {{interface}} may be {{a region}} in which concepts are connected, or it {{may be a}} region in which physical processes are connected. In both cases, conditions change abruptly. In this study, the interface between physics and chemical engineering is examined {{from the point of view}} of the laws of mechanics, and the details of this particular interface are clarified from the perspective of Euler (1703 - 1783) and Cauchy (1789 - 1857). Understanding how different perspectives of the laws of mechanics are connected allows us to proceed with confidence from physics to the traditional studies of fluid mechanics that one encounters in chemical engineering. Furthermore, it allows us to proceed with confidence to the study of multi-component transport phenomena. Here we encounter the concept of the species velocity that plays a crucial role in chemical engineering. To understand the importance of the species velocity, one asks the question: What happens if all species velocities are equal? The answer to this question is: Nothing! There is no purification, no mixing, no interfacial mass transfer, no adsorption/desorption, no homogeneous reaction, and no heterogeneous reaction. To illustrate how the concepts of mechanics provide a connection between various elements of chemical engineering, we examine the species <b>mass</b> <b>jump</b> condition as a focal point for mass transfer, heat transfer, thermodynamics, adsorption/desorption, and heterogeneous chemical reaction...|$|E
40|$|In many {{industrial}} processes granular materials are mixed together in partially filled slowly rotating drums. In this paper a general theoretical framework is {{developed for the}} quasi-two-dimensional motion of granular material in a rotating drum. The key assumption is that the body {{can be divided into}} a fluid-like and a solid-like region, that are separated by a non-material singular surface at which discontinuities occur. Experiments show that close to the free surface there is a thin rapidly moving fluid-like avalanche that flows downslope, and beneath it there is a large region of slowly rotating solid-like material. The solid region provides a net transport of material upslope and there is strong mass transfer between the two regions. In the theory the avalanche is treated as a shallow incompressible Mohr‚ÄìCoulomb or inviscid material sliding on a moving bed at which there is erosion and deposition. The solid is treated as a rigid rotating body, and the two regions are coupled together using a <b>mass</b> <b>jump</b> condition. The theory has the potential to model time-dependent intermittent flow with shock waves, as well as steady-state continuous flow. An exact solution for the case of steady continuous flow is presented. This demonstrates that when the base of the avalanche lies above the axis of revolution a solid core develops in the centre of the drum. Experiments are presented to show how a mono-disperse granular material mixes in the drum, and the results are compared with the predictions using the exact solution...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the linear conductance of a stripe of spin-orbit interaction in a 2 D electron gas; that is, a 2 D region of length ‚Ñì along the transport direction and infinite in the transverse {{one in which}} a spin-orbit interaction of Rashba type is present. Polarization in the contacts is described by means of Zeeman fields. Our model predicts two types of conductance oscillations: Ramsauer oscillations in the minority spin transmission, when both spins can propagate, and Fano oscillations when only one spin propagates. The latter are due to the spin-orbit coupling with quasibound states of the non propagating spin. In the case of polarized contacts in antiparallel configuration Fano-like oscillations of the conductance are still {{made possible by the}} spin orbit coupling, even though no spin component is bound by the contacts. To describe these behaviors we propose a simplified model based on an ansatz wave function.

40|$|Chandra data on A 1795 {{reveal a}} mild {{discontinuity}} {{in the gas}} density and temperature in the southern sector of the cluster at r= 60 /h kpc. The gas inside the edge is 1. 3 - 1. 5 times denser and cooler than outside, while the pressure is continuous, indicating {{that this is a}} "cold front'', the surface of contact between two moving gases. The continuity of the pressure indicates that the current relative velocity of the gases is near zero, making the edge appear to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. However, a total mass profile derived from the data in this sector under the equilibrium assumption, exhibits an unphysical jump by a factor of 2, with the mass inside the edge being lower. We propose that the cooler gas is "sloshing" in the cluster gravitational potential well and is now near the point of maximum displacement, where it has zero velocity but nonzero centripetal acceleration. The distribution of this non-hydrostatic gas should reflect the reduced gravity force in the accelerating reference frame, resulting in the apparent mass discontinuity. Assuming that the gas outside the edge is hydrostatic, the acceleration of the moving gas can be estimated from the <b>mass</b> <b>jump,</b> a ~ 800 h km/s/(10 ^ 8 yr). The gravitational potential energy of this gas available for dissipation is about half of its current thermal energy. The length of the cool filament extending from the cD galaxy (Fabian et al.) may give the amplitude of the gas sloshing, 30 - 40 /h kpc. Such gas bulk motion might be caused by a disturbance of the central gravitational potential by past subcluster infall...|$|E
40|$|At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), {{precision}} {{tests of}} the standard model of particle physics and searches for new phenomena are performed. To make optimal use of the proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC and its increasing collision rate, both the detectors and the reconstruction algorithms have to be optimized. The identification of heavy quarks is a key component in many measurements. This thesis describes a hardware and a software project which both aim at improving the identification of heavy quarks. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, the Phase 1 upgrade of the CMS pixel detector is introduced. One of the main motivations of the replacement of the Pixel detector is the improved b jet identification at large collision rates. The Phase 1 upgradeinvolves several production and calibration steps. An x-ray calibration procedure has been developed and the corresponding experimentalsetup is described. Measurements show that the calibration of the pixel modules is temperature independent and can be performed at room temperature. The stability of the setup is tested in order to fulfill the requirements for mass production of the pixel modules. A method to stabilize the calibration is introduced which is shown to reduce the systematic uncertainty. In the second part, algorithms to identify heavily boosted top quarks ("top tagger") are described and their performance is compared. The OptimalR HEP top taggerand the shower deconstruction tagger show a better performance than existing tagging algorithms. They can be used in Run II with increased centre-of-mass energies of 13 and 14 TeV. It is also shown that existing top tagging algorithms can be improved by the usage of multivariate analysis methods. New algorithms are commissioned using CMS data with a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19. 7 fb^- 1. In order to validate these new algorithms in data,two selections are made to measure the efficiency and mistag rate. The selections aim at enriching one sample with tt events and one with QCD multijet events. In the last part of this thesis, a novel top tagging algorithm is introduced. It is capable of identifying top quarks over a large p_T range by using a p_T dependent jet size and a method to reconstruct subjets based on a <b>mass</b> <b>jump</b> criterion. The algorithm includes the possibility to remove soft and collinear radiation from the jet. The algorithm is infrared and collinear safe, has a reasonable computational time, and shows a good performance with respect to existing algorithms.

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîRecently, we {{have been}} {{developing}} several automated algorithms for detecting masses on mammograms. For our algo-rithm, we devised an adaptive thresholding technique for detecting masses, but our system failed to detect masses with a partial loss of region that were located {{on the edge of}} the film. This is a common issue in all of the algorithms developed so far by other groups. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a new method in the present study. The partial loss masses are identified by their simi-larity to a sector-form model in the template matching process. To calculate the similarity, four features are applied: 1) average pixel value; 2) standard deviation of pixel values; 3) standard correlation coefficient defined by the sector-form model; and 4) concentration feature determined from the density gradient. After employing the new method to 335 digitized mammograms, the detection sensi-tivity for the partial loss <b>masses</b> <b>jumped</b> from 70 % to 90 % when the number of false positives was kept constant (0. 2 /image). More-over, a combination of the existing method and the new method im-proved the true-positive rate up to 97 %. Such results indicate that the new technique may improve the performance of our computer-aided diagnosis system for mammographic masses effectively.
