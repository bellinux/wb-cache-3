5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes <b>modified</b> <b>by</b> {{the quality of the}} light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors <b>modified</b> <b>by</b> reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe high {{temperature}} tribological properties of surface-modified nano-diamond in colza oil were tested with SRV machine, and wear surface morphology was observed by using three dimension profiler. The {{results show that}} the <b>modified</b> nano-diamond <b>by</b> dimer ester possesses excellent anti-wear and friction reducing properties as lubricating oil additive. The friction coefficients of the <b>modified</b> nano-diamond <b>by</b> dimer ester are lower than those of nano-daimond and the <b>modified</b> nano-diamond <b>by</b> oleic ester when the temperature is lower than 200 °C, and its friction coefficients are very similar to nano-diamond's when the temperature is higher than 200 °C, but are better than that of the <b>modified</b> nano-diamond <b>by</b> oleic ester. The wear volume of the <b>modified</b> nano-diamond <b>by</b> dimer ester is far-forth lower than that of nano-daimond and the <b>modified</b> nano-diamond <b>by</b> oleic ester after the continuously heating test, and the wear volume decrease 60 % than nano-diamond's...|$|R

He further subdivided these into ten sections (Apodanthi, Aurelia, Bulbocodii, Ganymedes, Jonquillae, Narcissus, Pseudonarcissi, Serotini, Tapeinanthus, Tazettae), as did Blanchard later.|$|E
