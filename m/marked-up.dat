In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, <b>marked-up</b> version of the page is generated and submitted to the server transparently, shielding the user from this technical detail. An {{example of this is}} the VisualEditor on Wikipedia. However, WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor. Hence, many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly.|$|E

[...] On June 1, Congressman Pascrell announced proposed federal legislation, titled the [...] "BOSS ACT" [...] (Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert Ticketing), which would require primary ticket sellers to disclose how many tickets were being held back from sale, prohibit ticket brokers from buying tickets during the first 48 hours on sale, and prohibit primary ticket sellers, promoters, and artists from entering the secondary market.|$|E

The General Committee included John Bois, Andrew Downes and John Harmar, and others known only by their initials, including [...] "AL" [...] (who may be Arthur Lake), and were paid for their attendance by the Stationers' Company. John Bois prepared a note of their deliberations (in Latin)– which has partly survived in two later transcripts. Also surviving of the translators' working papers are a bound-together set of <b>marked-up</b> corrections to one of the forty Bishops' Bibles – covering the Old Testament and Gospels, and also a manuscript translation of the text of the Epistles, excepting those verses where no change was being recommended to the readings in the Bishops' Bible.

Each markup fragment is generated by a [...] "portlet", and the portal combines them into a single Web page. Portlets may be hosted locally on the portal server or remotely on a separate server.|$|E

UIF will then sell the property back to you at an agreed-upon, <b>marked-up</b> price. Down payments for our Murabaha contracts may be as low as 5% in certain states. Your down payment toward the purchase price represents your initial investment in the property. Your monthly payment is divided into two portions — acquisition and profit. As you make your monthly payments, the acquisition balance is reduced, thereby increasing your investment in the home.|$|E
5000|$|Moreover, it did {{not help}} {{that many of these}} {{recruited}} northerners were driven to destitution in the first place by a money-based capitalist economy.

Consequently, both land and individual taxes had [...] "to be paid in... solid silver piasters, which peasants often had to acquire solely for this purpose at <b>marked-up</b> rates of exchange from money lenders or landlords." [...] Hence, these peasants had to resort to borrowing at inflated rates which resulted in many of them being trapped in unending indebtedness.|$|E
50|$|From an {{essentially}} zero base, armies {{had to create}} and train interpretation units, since the aerial view and stereoscopic view was quite alien to what ground-based reconnaissance would see. Interpreters had to have extensive knowledge of military hardware. They {{had to learn how}} to use shadows for size estimation, and to detect the increasing use of camouflage and decoys. Equally importantly, interpreters learned to standardize annotations and present comprehensive <b>marked-up</b> imagery to commanders. The static fronts and fixed fortifications in Europe were especially suitable for turning the art of interpretation into a science, while the far-ranging operations in the desert and at sea put a great premium on serendipitous discovery and resourcefulness.|$|E
5000|$|Murabaḥah, murabaḥa or murâbaḥah (مرابحة, {{derived from}} ribh ربح, meaning profit) {{is a term}} of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) for a sales {{contract}} where the buyer and seller agree on the markup (profit) or [...] "cost-plus" [...] price for the item(s) being sold. In recent decades {{it has become a}} term for a very common form of Islamic (i.e. [...] "shariah compliant") financing, where the price is <b>marked-up</b> in exchange for allowing the buyer to defer payment (a contract with deferred payment being known as bai-muajjal). Murabaha financing is similar to a rent-to-own arrangement in the non-Muslim world, with the intermediary (i.e. the lending bank) retaining ownership of the item being sold until the loan is paid in full.|$|E
5000|$|Article {{spinning}} can use {{a variety}} of methods; a straightforward one is [...] "spintax". Spintax (or spin syntax) uses a <b>marked-up</b> version of text to indicate which parts of the text should be altered or rearranged. The different variants of one paragraph, one or several sentences, or groups of words or words are marked. This spintax can be extremely rich and complex, with lots of depth levels (nested spinning). It acts as a tree with large branches, then lots of smaller branches up to the leaves. To create readable articles out of spintax, a specific software application chooses any of the possible paths in the tree; this results in a wide variations of the base article without significant alteration to its meaning.|$|E
