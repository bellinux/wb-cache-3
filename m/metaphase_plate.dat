25|$|Another motor protein {{implicated in}} the initial capture of MTs is CENP-E; this is a high {{molecular}} weight kinesin associated with the fibrous corona at mammalian kinetochores from prometaphase until anaphase. In cells {{with low levels of}} CENP-E, chromosomes lack this protein at their kinetochores, which quite often are defective in their ability to congress at the <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate.</b> In this case, some chromosomes may remain chronically mono-oriented (anchored to only one pole), although most chromosomes may congress correctly at the <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels {{decreases}} 3 to 4 fold {{as compared}} to the levels at unattached kinetochores, whereas the levels of dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 decrease >10-100 fold. Thus at metaphase, when all chromosomes are aligned at the <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate,</b> all checkpoint proteins are released from the kinetochore. The disappearance of the checkpoint proteins out of the kinetochores indicates the moment when the chromosome has reached the <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate</b> and is under bipolar tension. At this moment, the checkpoint proteins that bind to and inhibit Cdc20 (Mad1-Mad2 and BubR1), release Cdc20, which binds and activates APC/CCdc20, and this complex triggers sister chromatids separation and consequently anaphase entry.|$|E
25|$|Different {{laboratories}} {{have shown}} that the Ndc80 complex is essential for stabilization of the kinetochore-microtubule anchoring, required to support the centromeric tension implicated in the establishment of the correct chromosome congression in high eukaryotes. Cells with impaired function of Ndc80 (using RNAi, gene knockout, or antibody microinjection) have abnormally long spindles, lack of tension between sister kinetochores, chromosomes unable to congregate at the <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate</b> and few or any associated kMTs.|$|E

5000|$|After the microtubules have {{located and}} {{attached}} to the kinetochores in prometaphase, the two centrosomes begin pulling the chromosomes towards {{opposite ends of the}} cell. The resulting tension causes the chromosomes to align along the <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate</b> or equatorial plane, an imaginary line that is centrally located between the two centrosomes (at approximately the midline of the cell). To ensure equitable distribution of chromosomes at the end of mitosis, the metaphase checkpoint guarantees that kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle and that the chromosomes are aligned along the <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate.</b> If the cell successfully passes through the metaphase checkpoint, it proceeds to anaphase.|$|E

As the results, 73 of 197 cases of viral infections rubella, mumps, varicella, measles, viral meningo-encephalitis, viral pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis and herpes zoster patients, showed relatively higher incidence of chromosome breakages (0 - 33 %) than the controls (0 - 7 %).

50|$|Several {{methods are}} {{postulated}} by which chromosomes biorient {{when they are}} located far from the pole with which they need to connect. One mechanism involves the kinetchore meeting microtubules from the distal pole. Another method described is based on observations that the kinetochore of one pole-oriented chromosome attaches to kinetochore fibers of an already bioriented chromosome. These two mechanisms possibly work in concert - certain chromosomes may biorient via encounters with microtubules from distal poles, which is then followed by kinetochore fibers that speed up biorientation with already-oriented chromosomes. Researchers have detached grasshopper spermatocytes from spindle fibers and moved {{them away from the}} <b>metaphase</b> <b>plate</b> via micromanipulation.
