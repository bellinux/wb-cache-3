2500|$|In 2006, Justice Kennedy of the US Supreme Court [...] cast aspersions on {{business}} method patents when he commented {{that some of}} them were of [...] "potential vagueness and suspect validity". [...] This was expressed in a concurring opinion to the case of eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C. [...] There has been considerable speculation as to how this opinion might affect future business <b>method</b> <b>patent</b> litigation, particularly where a patent owner seeks an injunction to stop an infringer. In 2006, three Justices (Breyer, J., joined by Stevens and Souter, JJ.) dissented from the dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted in Laboratory Corp. of Am. Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc., arguing that State Street enunciated an erroneous legal test under which processes that the Supreme Court had held patent-ineligible would be held patent-eligible.|$|E

40|$|Contrary to {{the belief}} that the U. S. is the only country in the world, in {{addition}} to Australia, allowing medical <b>method</b> <b>patents,</b> Europe allows medical <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> as well. In Europe, medical methods are interpreted differently than those in the U. S. In fact, many patent experts fall into the trap. This paper selected three well-known U. S. cases involving diagnostic <b>method</b> <b>patents,</b> and searched for the corresponding European patents. After examining the patents and the claims, it was found that some of the diagnostic <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> in Europe have broader scope than their U. S. counterparts. Instead of invalidating diagnostic <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> altogether, broadening thescope of "medical immunity" is a better way to protect medical practitioners from being sued, since the endless interpretation of diagnostic methods in Europe simply caused more confusion...|$|R
5000|$|The Court also {{rejected}} a categorical exclusion of business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> from eligibility, reasoning that {{the definition of}} [...] "process" [...] in § 100(b) includes the word [...] "method," [...] which appears to comprehend some forms of business <b>method</b> <b>patents.</b> [...] 35 U.S.C. § 273(b)(1) also provides as a defense to patent infringement prior use of a [...] "method of conducting or doing business." [...] By acknowledging the defense, the statute also acknowledged the possibility of business <b>method</b> <b>patents.</b>|$|R

50|$|After further proceedings, the Federal Circuit remanded {{the case}} to the {{district}} court, for it to reinstate the 2008 jury verdict of infringement and the $40 million plus lost profits award. Limelight announced its intention to appeal the judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on January 26, 2016, filed a certiorari petition. The question presented is:Whether the Federal Circuit erred in holding that a defendant may be held liable for directly infringing a <b>method</b> <b>patent</b> based on the collective performance of method steps by multiple independent parties,even though the performance of all the steps of the <b>method</b> <b>patent</b> is “not attributable to any one person” under traditional vicarious-liability standards.|$|E

5000|$|Petitions to make special are {{particularly}} important for timely examination of business <b>method</b> <b>patents.</b> Projected delays in examination of business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> range from 4 to 14 years.

40|$|In its 1998 State Street Bank decision, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit {{held that}} {{business}} methods {{are eligible for}} patent protection. 1 The decision was quickly followed by {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of applications for and grants of business <b>method</b> <b>patents.</b> 2 During the ensuing two years, these patents received an unprecedented amount of criticism from academics, journalists, and politicians. The criticisms focused on both the policy of allowing patents on such subject matter and the perception that the business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> issued were of uniquely inferior quality in comparison with patents in other fields. 3 Two of the business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> frequently cited by critics as being of questionable legitimacy were Amazon. com’s patent on its “one-click” technique for more efficiently ordering merchandise on-line 4 and Priceline. com’s patent on the reverse auction technique for buying airline tickets on the internet. 5 Although patents in other areas of technology have brought forth complaints from various quarters, 6 the magnitude of adverse commentary and reportage on business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> was unprecedented. ...|$|R

40|$|Internet {{business}} <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> {{have been}} roundly criticized by most observers as being singularly inferior to most other patents. Many have even argued that business methods {{should not be}} patentable subject matter. As a result, Congress and the Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) singled them out for special treatment. All of these criticisms were, however, voiced without empirical support. We gathered data on most Internet business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> issued {{through the end of}} 1999 and compared them with a large contemporaneous data set of patents in general. We also compared them with patents in fourteen individual technology areas within the general patent data set. Our comparison focused on several metrics that we believe serve as good proxies for patent quality and value. We found that Internet business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> appear to have been no worse than the average patent, and possibly even better than most. They also appear to have been no worse, and possibly even better, than patents in most individual technology areas. These findings lead us to question the conventional wisdom that Internet business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> were uniquely deficient.

50|$|The rate {{at which}} patent {{applications}} are abandoned can vary significantly from one technology to another. In the US, patent applications {{in the field of}} electrical connectors, for example, are abandoned at a low rate of only one abandonment for every 18 office actions (e.g. rejections). Business <b>method</b> <b>patent</b> applications, however, are abandoned at a much higher rate of one abandonment for every 5 office actions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{delay was}} {{attributed}} by spokesmen for the Patent Office {{to a combination}} of a sudden increase in business <b>method</b> <b>patent</b> filings after the 1998 State Street Bank decision, the unfamiliarity of patent examiners with the business and financial arts (e.g., banking, insurance, stock trading etc.), and the issuance of a number of controversial patents (e.g., [...] "Amazon one click patent") in the business method area.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a wide-spread {{misconception}} based on the imprecise wording of Art. 52 of the European Patent Convention (EPC) that the protection of business <b>methods</b> by <b>patents</b> is prohibited in Europe. This paper investigates the legal framework set by patent laws {{with respect to the}} patentability of business methods, contrasting the situation in Europe and the situation in the US. It is shown that in praxi business methods have never been excluded from patentability in Europe. Further, 1, 901 European patent applications relating to business methods are found by identifying European equivalents to granted USPTO patents filed in US Class 705 (i. e. business <b>method</b> <b>patents).</b> The computation of major patent indicators reveals that European applications for business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> differ from the average of all EPO patent applications with respect to the number of claims, the number of references made and the frequency of legal actions against granted patents. Additionally, a case study from the franking device industry gives evidence of the strategic use of business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> leading to comparably high opposition rates against 44 % of all granted patents. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{decade after}} the State Street decision, more than 1, 000 {{business}} <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> are granted each year. Yet only one in ten are obtained by a financial institution. Most business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> are also software patents.; Have these patents increased innovation in financial services? To address this question the author constructs new indicators of R&D intensity based on the occupational composition of financial industries. The financial sector appears more research intensive than official statistics would suggest but less than the private economy taken as a whole. There is considerable variation across industries but little apparent trend. There {{does not appear to}} be an obvious effect from business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> on the sector’s research intensity.; This working paper supersedes Working Paper No. 07 - 21 and Payment Cards Center Discussion Paper No. 07 - 10; Also issued as Payment Cards Center Discussion Paper No. 08 - 05 Patents; Financial services industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{the long}} history of monopolies, {{business}} <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> are a novel and recent edition. In the Digital Age, where time is money and speed is everything, innovative methods for undertaking business are as important to a business as the products or services it provides to its clients. In recent years several reviews, conducted in both Australia and internationally, 4 have questioned the appropriateness of <b>patenting</b> business <b>methods.</b> This paper reviews the availability of business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> in Australia in light of the 2006 decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Grant v Commissioner of Patents, 5 which confirmed the need in Australia for a 'useful product' to issue from the working of a method (business or otherwise) in order for the method to be patentable. This paper will review arguments both criticising and defending business <b>method</b> <b>patents</b> and consider whether business methods warrant special treatment...|$|R
