40|$|<b>Mediterranean</b> <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>forests</b> are coenoses {{worthy of}} great care {{because of their}} {{inherent}} bio-ecological value. The suspension of harvesting following the crisis of fuel wood market ruled the evolutive pattern of maquis over the last decades. In this phase, site quality {{seems to be the}} major driver of the holm oak-dominated forest recovery {{as well as of the}} lasting permanence of the sclerophyllous shrub forest. In this connection, stand dynamics has been monitored in three plots located in the strictly protected area of the &# 8220;Parco Regionale della Maremma&# 8221; (Grosseto - Tuscany), where natural evolution is in progress since at least five decades. The monitored stands are representative of different evolutive phases from the holm oak-dominated coppices to the typical maquis, as a function of the original stand structure and composition but also of the intensity and length of the applied coppice management system. The analysis was carried out by permanent transects; two inventories were undertaken in 1991 and 2006 to evaluate both compositional and structural variability and the dynamics in progress. Results at now highlight the role played by the residual site quality and specific composition in driving the evolutive pattern of tree species community. Under the absence of any silvicultural practice and better site conditions, the progress and specific incidence of regular mortality and the related aboveground biomass redistribution, supported the vegetation of holm oak and the other subsidiary species typical of more mature stages. The overall forest dynamics seemed anyway to proceed slowly and resulted in a steady physiognomy over a long time since the suspension of the historical disturbance made of repeated harvesting on short rotations...|$|E
40|$|The {{abatement}} programs {{implanted in}} Europe to reduce SO₂, NO₂ and NH³ emissions are here evaluated {{by analyzing the}} relationships between emissions in Spain and neighboring countries and atmospheric deposition in a Mediterranean forest in the Montseny mountains (NE Spain) for the last 3 decades. A canopy budget model was applied to throughfall data measured {{during a period of}} high emissions (1995 - 1996) and a period of lower emissions (2011 - 2013) to estimate the changes in dry deposition over this time span. Emissions of SO₂ in Spain strongly decreased (77 %) and that was reflected in reductions for nssSO 4 ² in precipitation (65 % for concentrations and 62 % for SO 4 ²-S deposition). A lower decline was found for dry deposition (29 %). Spanish NO₂ emissions increased from 1980 to 1991, remained constant until 2005, and decreased thereafter, a pattern that was paralleled by NO 3 (-) concentrations in bulk precipitation at Montseny. This pattern seems to be related to a higher share of renewable energies in electricity generation in Spain in recent years. However, dry deposition increased markedly between 1995 and 2012, from 1. 3 to 6. 7 kgha¯¹year¯¹. Differences in meteorology between periods may have had a role, since the recent period was drier thus probably favoring dry deposition. Spanish NH³ emissions increased by 13 % between 1980 and 2012 in Spain but NH₄⁺ concentrations in precipitation and NH₄⁺-N deposition showed a decreasing trend (15 % reduction) at Montseny, probably linked to the reduction ammonium sulfate and nitrate aerosols to be scavenged by rainfall. NH₄⁺-N dry deposition was similar between the compared periods. The N load at Montseny (15 - 17 kgha¯¹year¯¹) was within the critical load range proposed for <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>forests</b> (15 - 17. 5 kgha¯¹year¯¹). The onset of N saturation is suggested by the observed increasing N export in streamwaters...|$|E

40|$|Mediterranean {{ecosystems}} are global hotspots of biodiversity threaten by human disturbances. Growing {{evidence indicates that}} regeneration of Mediterranean forests can be halted under certain circumstances and that successional stages can become notoriously persistent. The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>forest</b> in central Chile is been largely transformed into savannas dominated by the invasive legume tree Acacia caven as result of interacting management and ecological factors. We used multi-temporal satellite imagery to study the transition dynamics of these major vegetation types {{over the last four}} decades (1975 – 2008). Vegetation changes were related to indicators of resource availability (topography, water availability, solar radiance), potential propagule availability (distance to forest remnant patches) and disturbance regimes (grazing, fire occurrence and distance to roads and cities). During this study period, forests were mostly converted into Acacia savannas (46. 1 %). Acacia savanna was the most persistent natural vegetation type. The probability of <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>forest</b> degradation into Acacia savanna increased on drier northern-exposed slopes, close to roads and further away from forest remnants. In contrast, forest regeneration from Acacia savanna was higher on moister southern-exposed slopes and closer to forest remnants. Acacia savannas are increasingly being converted into cultivated land on the moister locations or switching into a bare soil state in locations close to cities and further away from forest remnants. These results highlight the vulnerability of diverse <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>forests</b> and its increasing conversion into persistent Acacia savannas in the Mediterranean region of central Chile and identify the ecological conditions for successful conservation and restoration of the native <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>forest</b> vegetation {{that can be used for}} sensible land use planning...|$|R

40|$|Evergreen <b>sclerophyllous</b> Quercus <b>forests</b> in NW Yunnan (China) {{were studied}} and {{compared}} with the <b>Mediterranean</b> evergreen <b>sclerophyllous</b> Quercus <b>forests</b> in central coastal California (USA) and Catalonia (NE Spain). Forests of Q. aquifolioides, Q. pannosa, Q. longispica of NW Yunnan, Q. agrifolia of California and Q. ilex of NE Spain were analyzed as representative communities. The similarities and differences at the community level in the contemporary vegetation of the <b>sclerophyllous</b> Quercus <b>forest</b> found in the three regions are clarified. The general patterns of the evergreen Quercus forest in the three regions were similar, though different assemblages of species were involved. The species diversity in all three regions was rather low. The species richness did not significantly differ among the forests, although in the Q. longispica forest it is somewhat higher than the others. The three representative species of evergreen Quercus in NW Yunnan reached the greatest maximum height, while Q. agrifolia of California had the largest basal area per ha. The Q. ilex forest of Spain had the lowest values for maximum tree height and dbh and the highest density per ha. Frequency of dbh size classes indicated that Q. aquifolioides, Q. pannosa, and Q. agrifolia had potentially good regeneration of the sporadic type with highest values for the intermediate size classes, and the regeneration of Q. longispica and Q. ilex was strong as indicated by a reverse-J pattern. Still, in each area, most regeneration was from sprouting. In all three regions the evergreen Quercus species have adapted to environmental changes, for instance by development of sprouting and rooting abilities to resist drought, cold conditions and various disturbances. The evergreen Quercus forests in NW Yunnan were structurally more similar to the Q. agrifolia forest of central coastal California than to the Q. ilex forest of NE Spain...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{partitioning}} is {{a central}} issue in ecology because it can establish to which point similar species can coexist in the same habitat. Great tits and blue tits have been classical model species in studies of trophic competence. However, most studies on the topic have been conducted at localities where caterpillars {{are by far the}} most relevant prey brought to the nestlings. In Mediterranean mixed forests, nevertheless, the abundance of caterpillars is relatively low and it is spiders that {{play a key role in}} the diet of great tits, at least for nestlings. The aim of this paper was to study nest food provisioning to establish the degree of diet overlap of these two tit species in a Mediterranean forest. Our results showed that blue tit feeding rates were higher than those of great tits, probably to compensate for the smaller prey delivered to nestlings by blue tits. Blue tits brought more spiders than great tits, while grey tits brought larger prey and more caterpillars. This may be because larger great tits can prey upon larger prey items than blue tits. As a main result, this study supports the view of resource partitioning by great and blue tits in <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>forest</b> ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{regeneration}} of mediterranean plant communities {{has proved}} difficult in all continents. In this paper we assess whether regeneration of <b>sclerophyllous</b> <b>forests</b> shows nucleated patterns {{indicative of a}} positive effect of vegetation remnants at the landscape level and compare the regeneration patterns between sites with distinctive climate conditions.
