Moreover, a higher proportion of brokerage commissions in total revenue are associated with lower production efficiency, implying that securities houses should expand profit-making sources outside their brokerage business. securities business; internet securities brokers; revenue management; frontier productivity function; production efficiency; Japan; small firms; operating revenue; brokerage commissions. ...|$|E

For this reason we have developed the iterative portfolio procedure IPA which is fundamentally different from the conventional procedure in that representation is done using tables whose axes are marked with (sub) systems and reengineering measures rather than with assessment criteria. IPA is based on our general phase model for portfolio analyses which distinguishes between the three phases gatheri ng, consolidation and evaluation of information.

40|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} {{is regarded as}} one of the key problems affecting the environment. In order to demonstrate the significance {{of biodiversity}}, the value of individual species or ecosystems today is generally determined in science and practice. The underlying thought is that a species or ecosystem is worthy of being conserved provided its value exceeds the benefit of its loss. This is, at first glance, a rational line of thought typical of economists. As this study shows, however, this way of looking at the situation is inadequate. Biodiversity, rather like a share portfolio or a portfolio of insurance risks, is concerned with a portfolio of different genes, species or ecosystems. The finding from portfolio theory that in portfolios returns are additive whereas risks diversify and that well managed portfolios frequently also contain securities which, viewed in isolation, appear to hold little attraction, is now generally acknowledged in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities.</b> Portfolio theory is not currently brought into discussions on biodiversity issues, and that is regrettable. The way in which biodiversity is generally viewed at present lags more than fifty years behind securities management. This study shows how portfolio managers would look at and manage biodiversity. Probably the most surprising and provocative finding is that it may be assumed that portfolio managers would conserve more species than appears appropriate from the way the situation is usually viewed at present.

40|$|The {{technological}} dependency {{of securities}} exchanges on internet-based (IP) platforms has dramatically increased the industry's exposure to reputation, market, and operational risks.

These {{include the use of}} XML (extensible markup language) as the industry IP language, STP or straight through processing of data, pervasive or diffuse computing and grid computing, as well as the increased use of Internet and wireless. The fraud is not new, rather, the magnitude and speed by which fraud can be committed has grown exponentially due to the convergence of once private networks on-line. It is imperative that senior <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> markets and brokerage houses be properly informed of the negative externalities associated with e-brokerage and the possible critical points of failure that exist in today's digitized financial sector as they grow into tomorrow's exchanges. The overwhelming issue regarding e-finance is to determine the true level of understanding that senior management has about on-line platforms, including the inherent risks and the depth of the need to use it wisely. Kellermann and McNevin attempt to highlight the various risks that have been magnified by the increasing digitalization of processes within the brokerage arena and explain the need for concerted research and analysis of these as well as the profound consequences that may entail without proper planning. An effective legal, regulatory, and enforcement framework is essential for creating the right incentive structure for market participants. The legal and regulatory framework should focus on the improvement of internal monitoring of risks and vulnerabilities, greater information sharing about these risks and vulnerabilities, education and training on the care and use of these technologies, and better reporting of risks and responses. Public/private partnerships and collaborations also are needed to create an electronic commerce (e-commerce) environment that is safe and sound.

40|$|Subtitle: Being {{a survey}} of the methods {{currently}} favoured by Australian international investors for <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> portfolios - in particular, the extent to which use is made of modern (Markowitz) portfolio theory. © 1983 R. W. MoyleThe Australian securities market exists to channel savings and funds of individuals, companies and institutions into the hands of firms and governments who are in need of additional funds to finance their activities. Since these activities are {{at the core of the}} business community, the capital market is a vital factor in the health of the economy of this country. The financial institutions which provide the greater part of monies into the Australian securities market are: - Banks - Life Insurance Companies - Pension Funds - Cash Management Trusts. The task of the fund manager is to identify and value worthwhile enterprises in which to invest and in order for him to do this he needs to find acceptable, appropriate and objective criteria on which to base his judgements. These criteria generally revolve around a critical evaluation of the capital structure and dividend policy of a firm in relation to its valuation as a whole with a view to assessing its prospects for future growth and continued high dividend potential. The arguments of the theorists of the 1950 's and 60 's that with efficient financial markets without imperfections, the debt and dividend policies of firms were really of no consequence has not turned out to be the case. However these theories did have an impact on the thinking of the Fund Managers in the application of the techniques with which they were already familiar so that much of the work done since then has been directed at the identification of market imperfections and their likely effect on the valuation of firms. It was during the fifties that a development occurred which was considered at the time to be a major advance in the techniques available to Fund Managers to assist them in the placement and assessment of their performance in their portfolio management. This was the Markowitz Portfolio Theory which was later extended and refined by Sharpe, Treynor and Jensen. This theory in essence suggests that individual assets in a portfolio should not be judged on the merit of their performance on a short term basis but rather in relation to their marginal contribution to an overall portfolio of assets. Thus the overall risk of a portfolio of such assets is considerably reduced when a diversity of these assets has been selected. It is the Fund Managers' attitude to the utilisation of this tool as a result of a significant period of availability and experience within the financial community in Australia which is the subject of this report.

Information on these incidents, threats and vulnerabilities are important to security. It is therefore necessary for this security information to be effectively and efficiently managed, so that correct decisions may be made on the implementation <b>of</b> <b>security</b> risk control measures. This study explored the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> information in the security industry by undertaking the following: • establishing the “status quo” of the collection and analysis <b>of</b> <b>security</b> information and the implementation <b>of</b> <b>security</b> risk control measures in practice; • identifying {{the nature and extent of}} problems experienced in the collection and analysis <b>of</b> <b>security</b> information and the implementation <b>of</b> <b>security</b> risk control measures; and the • discovery <b>of</b> a new <b>Security</b> Information Management Model (SIMM). Mixed methods research was used to study the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> information in the security industry. The explorative research design was used for this purpose. Semi-structured and focus group interviews were conducted with senior security managers and operational security officers, respectively. The grounded theory research design was used to analyse the qualitative data in order to generate a substantive grounded theory. The theory is that security officers operate without a standardised framework to manage security information. The data from the semi-structured and the focus group interviews were used to design a questionnaire to conduct a survey using the quantitative approach. The non-experimental research design was used to conduct this self-administered questionnaire survey. The data from this questionnaire survey helped validate and confirm the substantive grounded theory. The study found that there was the need for a Security Information Management Model to manage security information in the security industry.
