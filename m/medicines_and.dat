5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw.|$|E
5|$|Mason devoted {{much effort}} during the American Revolutionary War to {{safeguarding}} Fairfax County and the rivers of Virginia, since the British several times raided areas along the Potomac. Control of {{the rivers and}} of Chesapeake Bay was urgent as Virginians tried to obtain hard currency by trading tobacco to the French and other European nations. The export of tobacco, generally via the West Indies, allowed Mason and others to obtain, via France and Holland, British-made items such as cloth, clothing patterns, <b>medicines,</b> <b>and</b> hardware.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{concepts}} of <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health are becoming conflated. This {{can be seen}} in the language of <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health: <b>medicine</b> is discussed in terms of health and health in terms of medicine. A review of literature by <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health scholars gives evidence of the conflation and of its effects. The collapse of two concepts into one constrains the development <b>and</b> utilization of <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> the meaning and pursuit of health. The conflation also obscures the distinction and separate relevance of disease and illness to both <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health. The claim is that <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health are distinct concepts and that a recognition of them as separate is beneficial. Medicine is a means for humans. Health is an end of humans and is the prototypical condition of "how life ought to be. " An understanding of <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health as separate concepts is beneficial to the development <b>and</b> utilization of <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> to the meaning and pursuit of health. Furthermore, the separation of <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> health clarifies the importance of <b>medicine</b> to disease <b>and</b> the significance of illness to health...|$|R

5|$|On May 11, {{two days}} after the cyclone had hit, the Indian Government {{launched}} a massive relief and rescue operation. The Indian Army and Naval helicopters took surveys of areas affected by the cyclone, and also dropped food packets. Although the Indian Government did not request international assistance, the Red Cross provided food, oil, <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> water tanks for the affected families; the wcc/cicarws issued an appeal for $ (1990USD) so they could provide immediate needs with World Vision providing $ (1990USD) for food blankets and utensils.|$|E

5|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated acetyl {{chloride}} with sodium salicylate to produce acetylsalicylic acid {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate <b>medicines,</b> <b>and</b> identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Qutb Shahi {{rulers and}} Nizams {{attracted}} artists, architects and men {{of letters from}} {{different parts of the world}} through patronage. The resulting ethnic mix popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia). The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani Urdu literature leading to works such as the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan poetry, which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu. Lazzat Un Nisa, a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual arts. The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. In 1824, a collection of Urdu Ghazal poetry, named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, authored by Mah Laqa Bai—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad.|$|E

5|$|On October10, 1984, the Government of Cape Verde {{appealed for}} {{international}} assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month {{supply of food}} for 1,124families, 1,064mattresses, 532kerosene stoves, 2,128sets of dinner ware, 2,128mugs, 1,064cooking pots and pans, 532water buckets, 2,128sheets, 1,064blankets, 2,660articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094houses. In January1985, the government of Cape Verde announced that they had made significant progress with relief assistance. However, repairs to roads, infrastructure, and crops were still required. Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the Cape Verde Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984USD). France, Finland, the Soviet Union, and the United States supplied 4000tons of cereals, $79,000 (1984USD) to the Red Cross, $250,000 (1984USD) for home repairs, 32packages of <b>medicines,</b> <b>and</b> 17packages of blankets.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others {{remain to be}} explored scientifically. There {{is no reason to}} presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant <b>medicines,</b> <b>and</b> dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E

5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including <b>medicines,</b> <b>and</b> had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E
5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues.

When families dine together, sharing the same meal, {{it can be difficult}} to separate the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult.

Later reports stated that {{the cause of death was}} unnatural; the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences gave a preliminary autopsy report that revealed injury marks on her body.

The autopsy indicated that she died of drug overdose, most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong <b>medicines</b> <b>and</b> probably alcohol.
