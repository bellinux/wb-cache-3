Pine Island Glacier retreated 31 km at its center, with most retreat in 2005 - 2009 when the glacier ungrounded from its ice plain. Thwaites Glacier retreated 14 km along its fast flow core and 1 to 9 km along the sides. Haynes Glacier retreated 10 km along its flanks. Smith/Kohler glaciers retreated the most, 35 km along its ice plain, and its ice shelf pinning points are vanishing.

40|$|In April 2002, 24 Engineered Log Jams (ELJs) {{were built}} within a 2 km {{treatment}} reach {{of what was}} a degraded ephemeral sand-bed stream at Stockyard Creek, Wollombi, NSW. Coupled with ~ 20 years of ongoing native revegetation this project aimed to increase the geomorphic diversity and ecological characteristics of the ephemeral stream. Commencing in 2002, the experiment was set up as a standard BACI design, with a control reach situated in the upstream limit of the study site. This thesis aims to assess the geomorphic response to the re-introduction of wood by comparing treatment and control reaches. Since construction, the ELJs have experienced a 5 year period of low or no flow conditions, {{as well as two}} <b>major</b> <b>bed</b> mobilising flood events which occurred in June 2007 and February 2013. Four detailed topographic surveys of the study reach were completed during the 12 year study period and have been used to construct Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the in-channel bed topography. Differencing between successive DEMs and the development of longitudinal profiles for the study reach indicate the ELJs have been successful in promoting the colonisation of riparian vegetation, as well as increasing the geomorphic diversity of the bed topography. Significantly, the magnitude of change was much greater in the treatment reaches, with one of the treatment reaches (treatment A) having a depth range 1. 5 times greater than that of the control, with a maximum scour depth of ~ 2. 5 m. The most pronounced response to ELJ introduction was the development of persistent pools, with 46 - 50 % of new pool volume estimated to have occurred in direct association with the ELJs. Patterns of scour and bar development were observed to vary in association with ELJ design, with the ELJs within the treatment A reach facilitating significant bar development (13. 5 %) with a net gain of (48. 90 m³/ 1000 m² of bed) compared to the preconstruction survey. Despite the influence of the ELJs, the control reach also experienced a significant level of change due to the presence of outcropping bedrock, native re-vegetation and the natural recruitment of woody debris. Both control and treatment reaches are excellent examples of riparian rehabilitation using native species.

40|$|International audienceThe {{complexity}} of local aquifers and {{the scarcity of}} the available data lead to consider different approaches for modeling specific groundwater flows. The proximity with lakes or retention basins, the interaction between groundwater, rivers and water bodies, heterogeneities into the aquifer contribute to increase the complexity. This paper focuses on the comparison of two different approaches, with the analytics elements method (AEM) and the well-known finite difference method (FDM), for the groundwater flow modelling. The AEM {{is based on a}} vectorial structure and the FDM on a raster structure. There is no competition between them. However, they can be more or less appropriated if we consider the spatial variability of the hydrosystem features and the resolution of the available data. They can also be used as two complementary approaches in a global way of simulation. In a global process of groundwater modeling, a good representation of the physical behaviour of the aquifer is necessary and decisive. Since the knowledge of the aquifer system must allow to identify and to formalize the hydrological features in a rigorous way, each model is combined with a GIS (Geographic Information System). An appropriate interface for the management of the modelization becomes available. The object oriented and vector representation of the Analytic Elements is an interesting alternative to the classical representation made with the FDM. This natural structure allows improving the interaction with the GIS, becoming more popular with the recent development of the computers technologies. Thus, it becomes efficient to well organize the geodatabase within a conceptual model to be well exploited by the numerical models. After recalling the global process of groundwater modeling, from the design of the conceptual model to the numerical results provided by the simulations, the paper focuses on the analysis of the approximations made and on the evaluation of the errors induced. This work focuses on a particular case study where groundwater resources management include gravel extraction, well for drinking water supplying and for irrigation. The area of interest is set in an alluvial aquifer along the banks of a major French river (the Loire River). This is a monolayer aquifer in an alluvial plain, which extends about 40 km along the river and about 6 km inside the <b>major</b> <b>bed.</b> This zone must take into account ecological constraints and foster the development of the fauna and flora in wetlands. Those wetlands are connected to the lagoons resulting from the previous gravel extraction.

Moreover, {{there is increasing}} consumer demand for crops produced by environment-friendly practices. The application of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can present an appropriate approach to avoid excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides. Here, we report studies {{of the interaction between}} Petunia hybrida and the AM fungus Glomus mosseae in abiotic and biotic stress situations. Root colonisation by G. mosseae, although very low, was able to compensate phosphate deficiency in the substrate and resulted in increased plant dry matter, water and phosphorus content in the shoots. However, these positive effects were attenuated at high salt concentrations (abiotic stress). In contrast, disease symptoms caused by the root pathogen T. basicola (biotic stress) were significantly reduced in G. mosseae-colonised plants. Such protective effects were not achieved with the AM fungi Glomus intraradices and Gigaspora rosea, and a negative effect of the pathogen on root colonisation by G. intraradices was observed. This shows for the first time under nursery practice conditions that G. mosseae can compensate the negative impact of lower levels of phosphate fertilisation on plant growth in a soilless production system and induce bioprotection of petunia against T. basicola. Based on the different effects observed with the three AM fungi, petunia can provide an experimental system to define the molecular mechanisms underlying mycorrhiza-induced resistance against root pathogen...|$|R
