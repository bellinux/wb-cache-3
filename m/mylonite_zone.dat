50|$|The 10 {{kilometer}} wide Ross Lake fault system (RLFS) {{is part of}} a 500 kilometer long zone of high-angle faults in the North American Cordillera. The RLFS {{consists of}} two major sets of faults. The eastern set of the Hozameen and Slate Creek faults and more southerly North Creek fault form the western boundary of the Jurassic-Cretaceous Methow River basin and in part separate it from metamorphic equivalents of Methow strata. Minor structures along the North Creek fault record dextral strike-slip events that occurred between approximately 88 and 50 Ma. The same formations lie {{on both sides of the}} faults, implying modest slip (10s of km?). The northernmost strand of the western fault set, the Ross Lake fault itself, is a vertical zone of horizontally-lineated mylonite that separates upper-amphibolite-facies rocks of the Cascades crystalline core from sub-greenschist-facies rocks to the east. Some dextral shear and 6-12 km of NE-side down normal slip occurred from 50(?) to post-45 Ma. At Elijah Ridge, the Ross Lake fault steps westward across a gently dipping extensional zone to the Gabriel Peak tectonic belt. This approximately 100 kilometer long, northeast-dipping <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> is dominated by flattening, but kinematic indicators record dextral shear in the north and reverse shear farther south. This transpressional deformation occurred from 65 Ma (and earlier?) to 58 Ma when at least 7-24 km of dextral slip was probably transferred to the eastern faults by ENE-striking shear zones. Younger (< 50 Ma) ENE-striking sinistral faults at least locally accommodated 5-10 km of dextral strike slip by vertical axis rotation. The fault sets merge southward to form the Foggy Dew fault zone where mylonites record oblique dextral-normal slip (down-to-E). Slip is bracketed between 65 and 48 Ma; some occurred after 60 Ma and the zone records the regional transition from approximately 65-58 Ma transpression to approximately 57-45 Ma transtension. The fault zone is truncated to the SE by the 48 Ma Cooper Mountain batholith, which also obliterates its intersection with the southern continuation of the Pasayten fault. South of this batholith, only a narrow, discontinuous shear zone is on strike with the Foggy Dew fault and similar units lie on both sides of this projection of the RLFS.|$|E

The study of ultrahigh-pressure terranes informs {{our understanding of}} continental collision, subduction, and exhumation in both ancient and modern orogens. However, these studies rarely focus on the metamorphosed continental crust that forms the bulk of ultrahigh-pressure terranes. Here, we document a combined petrologic and structural investigation of mylonite zones in metamorphosed continental crust of the ultrahigh-pressure Western Gneiss Region of Norway that sheds light on the exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure terranes through {{the study of the}} continental crust. One of these shear zones, the Salt <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone,</b> {{is a prime example of}} the importance of the quartzofeldspathic gneiss that is associated with ultrahigh-pressure (coesite-bearing) eclogite. Eclogite in the Salt <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> preserves quartz fabrics formed near UHP conditions (prism fabric) and omphacite fabrics that are consistent with constrictional deformation near UHP conditions. Ti-in-quartz thermobarometry indicates equilibration of eclogite at temperatures > 750 °C and for quartzofeldspathic gneiss indicates quartz deformation/recrystallization took place over a range of temperatures from near UHP conditions to amphibolite facies conditions. Gneiss in the Salt <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> preserves two dominant microstructures: phase-separated gneiss and phase-mixed gneiss. Despite preserving the same assemblage and being in close proximity (shared pressure and temperature conditions), fabrics between the two gneiss types differ due to habit. In both gneiss types, reverse zoning in plagioclase (Na-rich cores, Ca-rich rims) is ubiquitous. The compositional zoning records grain growth by grain boundary migration during exhumation-induced decompression. The study of the Salt <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> is proof that shear zones in continental crust preserve a vital record of exhumation of ultrahigh-pressure terranes. Preliminary studies were conducted on two additional shear zones, The Finnøya <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> and the Svartberget <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone.</b> Like the Salt <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone,</b> both contain evidence of deformation over a wide range of conditions. The Finnøya <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> contains clinopyroxene-garnet gneiss with a composition similar to associated deformed eclogite pods. This shear zone, in particular, suggests that eclogite may have experienced extensive melting and mylonitization during exhumation from peak conditions. The Svartberget <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> is composed of paragneiss and was deformed at sillimanite-stable conditions. The associated mafic material was synkinematically deformed as evidenced by elongate, foliation-parallel amphibolite and retrogressed eclogite pods. The abundant shear zones in the Western Gneiss Region of Norway record local exhumation from UHP to amphibolite-facies conditions. Understanding the deformational history of these individual shear zones can contribute to the overall understanding of the exhumation of the WGR...|$|E

40|$|A {{combined}} {{field and}} laboratory {{study of the}} seismic reflection response and seismic properties of the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> capping the Kettle dome metamorphic core complex provides important constraints on reflectivity of mylonites. Because of its structural and petrologic characteristics, this <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> {{can be regarded as}} a model for mid- to deep-crustal mylonite zones. CDP reflection profiling revealed that the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> is reflective. Laboratory measurements of compressional wave velocities (V,) at high confining pressures in samples collected directly up-dip from the CDP reflection line revealed a wide variation of v, in common mid-crustal lithologies. Mafic and carbonate rock mean V, values range from 6. 67 to 7. 31 km s- * at 600 MPa, and quartzite and quartzo-feldspathic values range from 6. 16 to 6. 52 km s-'. Seismic anisotropy at low pressures can be related to open microcracks and preferred mineral orientation, whereas the latter effect controls anisotropy at high pressures. The laboratory data provide the basis for a seismic model which indicates that the Kettle dome <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> can generate reflections from zones where high- and low-velocity lithologies are interlayered. These reflections correlate with those observed on the CDP data, thus demonstrating that the reflectivity of the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> {{is a direct result of}} its lithologic diversity and layered nature.

The Salt <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> {{is dominated by}} quartzofeldspathic gneiss with a strong foliation and lineation. Coesite-bearing eclogite within the shear zone contains a foliation and lineation (defined by elongate omphacite) consistent {{with that of the}} host gneiss, suggesting that gneiss and eclogite were deformed in the same kinematic framework. In eclogite, omphacite preserves LS- to L-type crystallographic preferred orientation, and quartz preserves prism fabrics that developed in quartz near coesite–quartz transition conditions. The quartzofeldspathic gneiss in the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> records prism and rhomb slip in quartz and reverse zoning in plagioclase (higher Ca rims) consistent with re-equilibration during decompression. The Ti concentration in quartz in gneiss is higher than that in quartz in eclogite, suggesting that quartz recrystallized at a lower pressure in the gneiss.

40|$|The Grenville Front Tectonic Zone (GFTZ) is a {{polyphase}} deformation belt in {{the northwest}} of the Grenville Province which was shaped in the continent-continent-collision-induced Grenvillian Orogeny. This thesis focuses {{on the evolution of}} deformation fabrics in the GFTZ between the Sudbury Basin and French River in Ontario, Canada. Geological mapping using a new digital mapping system was conducted within this segment of the GFTZ, in its northwest vicinity in the Southern Province, and in its southeast vicinity in the Grenville Province. The new digital mapping system includes a personal digital assistant equipped with an internal GPS and a mobile GIS mapping software, and the ArcGIS software, which together worked seamlessly in the whole mapping process. Mapping in Whitefish Falls in the Southern Province enables us to identify two generations of folds in the Gowganda Formation of the Huronian Supergroup. The first generation is explained by bedding-parallel shear perhaps in a fold-and-thrust belt system in the Penokean Orogeny between 1850 and 1830 Ma. The second generation folds are km-to-tens-of-km-scale folds which compose the fold belt of the Penokean Orogeny. Mapping in the Grenville Province allows us to establish three phases of deformation which correspond respectively to a mid- to lower crustal sub-horizontal flow in a thickened crust, a regional folding during the NW-SE lithosphere extension, and a NW-SE crustal shortening and top-to-the-NW thrusting. The GFTZ underwent all three phases of deformation. Regional structural correlation and zircon dating suggest that the three phases of deformation occurred during 1079 - 1030 Ma, 1028 - 1018 Ma, and 1000 - 953 Ma respectively. <b>Mylonite</b> <b>zones</b> were developed at the NW margin of the GFTZ.

30|$|Lithological {{heterogeneity}} of low P/T metamorphic rocks in southern area of Hidaka metamorphic belt (HMB) was formed through historical development of HMB while these rocks {{had been laid}} in ductile lower crust. Many strain-localized <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones</b> (< 100 m in thickness) are preferentially developed within S-type tonalite and pelitic gneiss, which are characterized by a large modal amount of phyllosilicates (biotite+muscovite+chlorite) and quartz, compared to other lithofacies in HMB. Mylonitic foliations are more conspicuous with close {{to the center of}} the shear zone associated with increase in amounts of phyllosilicate minerals, indicating fluidenhanced weakening mechanisms were operated in plastic shear zones. Pseudotachylyte veins are observed exclusively in these <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones,</b> which were generated during exhumation stage of HMB. We conclude the seismic slip zones in southern HMB had been initiated in the ductile lower crust by concentration of localized plastic shear zones within the phyllosilicate- and quartz-rich lithofacies, which were heterogeneously formed by old metamorphic and magmatic events. Then these zones were further weakened by fluid-enhanced plastic deformation, and finally seismic slips occurred at the bottom of seismogenic upper crust, during exhumation of HMB.|$|R

On the basis of field observations of the pseudotachylytes and related fault rocks, nature of seismogenic faulting in the Hidaka crust is examined. The field observations suggest the following conclusions. (1) Two structural types of pseudotachylytes are distinguished: layer-parallel and layer-oblique. The latter are scattered in the metamorphic belt, but the former occur only {{in the southern part of}} the metamorphic belt. (2) An abundance of the layer-parallel pseudotachylytes suggests that earthquakes occurred repeatedly and frequently in the southern part, where complicated and duplicated crustal structures occur with many low-temperature thin <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones.</b> The southern part with such crustal structures was an ancient seismogenic area containing asperities and having a radius of a few tens of kilometers in the Hidaka crust. In the seismogenic area, the layer-parallel pseudotachylytes resulted from seismic slip on the mylonitic foliation within the low-temperature <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones</b> with strong preferred orientation of micas. (3) The layer-parallel pseudotachylytes and the subsequent layer-oblique pseudotachylytes post-date the latest and very-low-temperature mylonitization in the metamorphic belt. The former pseudotachylytes formed just above the upper side of the brittle-plastic transition zone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The tectonic {{setting of}} the {{southern}} Menderes Massif, part of the western Anatolide belt in western Turkey, {{is characterized by the}} exhumation of deeper crustal levels onto the upper crust during the Eocene. The lowermost tectonic units of the Menderes Massif are exposed in the Çine Massif, where Proterozoic basement orthogneisses of the Çine nappe are in tectonic contact with Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Selimiye nappe. In the southern Çine Massif, orthogneiss and metasedimentary rocks are separated by the southerly dipping Selimiye shear zone, preserving top-to-the-S shearing under greenschist facies conditions. In contrast, in the western Çine Massif, the orthogneiss is deformed and mylonitic near the contact with the metasedimentary rocks. The geometry of the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> and the observed shear directions change from north to southwest. In the north, the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> dips shallowly to the north, with top-to-the-N shear sense indicators showing northward thrusting of the orthogneiss over the metasedimentary rocks. In the southwest, the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> resembles a steep N–S striking strike-slip shear zone associated with top-to-the-SSW sense of shear. Overall, the geometry of the mylonite shear zone is consistent with northward movement of the orthogneiss relative to the metasedimentary rocks.

40|$|In this work, {{a number}} of key localities have been {{investigated}} in detail in order to provide precise constraints on models for the tectonic evolution of southern Sweden. The new data presented in this thesis show that there are large differences in terms of pre-Sveconorwegian tectonic evolution between the Eastern and Median-Western Segments situated {{on either side of the}} <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone,</b> a major shear zone as well as a structural and lithological boundary. This has a direct influence on the possible tectonic scenarios that can be suggested when reconstructing the formation of the south-western part of the Fennoscandian Shield. At Viared in the central Eastern Segment, Sveconorwegian eclogite facies metamorphism is dated at 0. 97 Ga using mainly U-Pb on zircon. This is similar to other localities showing high-pressure granulite or eclogite facies metamorphism in the Eastern Segment and suggests that this high grade event was a regional feature east of the <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone.</b> On the well exposed Nordön Island in the Western Segment, both pre-Sveconorwegian and Sveconorwegian metamorphism and deformation was dated using several isotope methods, including U-Pb SIMS zircon and Sm-Nd garnet dating. In the Median Segment, veining was dated using U-Pb SIMS zircon methods. In addition to age determinations, thermobarometry was done on several samples and the results compared with published data. The results show that Sveconorwegian peak metamorphism reached amphibolite to granulite facies west of the <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> at 1. 02 - 1. 04 Ga. This is 50 - 70 Ma before the orogenic activity started in the Eastern Segment. In the central Eastern Segment, Pre-Sveconorwegian veining is dated at 1. 42 Ga, thus belonging to the 1. 42 - 1. 46 Ga Hallandian veining found elsewhere in the Eastern Segment. Pre-Sveconorwegian veining and isoclinal folding in the Western Segment is dated at 1. 55 Ga. Neither the 1. 55 Ga nor the 1. 02 - 1. 04 Ga events have been found in the Eastern Segment. Further, the 1. 42 - 1. 46 Ga veining event documented in the Eastern Segment has not been found in the Western or Median Segments. Only a few 0. 97 Ga zircon U-Pb ages have been found in the Western and Median Segments west of the <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone.</b> In the Western Segment, Ar-Ar dating of muscovite related to late Sveconorwegian uplift gives 981 ± 4 Ma, interpreted to reflect the crystallization of muscovite below 400 °C. This indicates that the Western Segment already was exhumed at the time when the Eastern Segment experienced its Sveconorwegian high-pressure peak metamorphism. Additionally this work shows that there is an age difference between the 1. 34 Ga Askim, the 1. 30 Ga Göta and 1. 31 Ga Kärra granites west of the <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> and the 1. 38 - 1. 40 Ga granites and monzonites east of the <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone,</b> thus disproving the previous concept of “stitching granites” that was used as an argument for a pre-Sveconorwegian correlation between the Eastern and Western Segments. The differences in pre-Sveconorwegian history between the segments east and west of the <b>Mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> suggest that the zone originally formed as a Sveconorwegian first order crustal suture. However, no ophiolites have been found along the zone and no calk-alkaline magmatism related to subduction of oceanic crust slightly before 0. 97 Ma has yet been documented. If such features were found it would strengthen the idea that the <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> is a crustal suture, however their lack does not preclude it. Geothermobarometry on retrograde eclogite facies rocks exposed at Viared indicates that those rocks experienced metamorphic conditions of 15. 0 – 16. 7 kbar at temperatures of 719 to 811 °C. The equivalent burial depth of ~ 50 km is compatible with metamorphism in a subduction setting. The partial preservation of a high pressure paragenesis indicates rapid exhumation after burial. A two-dimensional model involving continental subduction of the Eastern Segment is proposed to explain the cycle of eclogite and high-pressure granulite facies that took place during the ~ 0. 97 Ga Falkenberg phase of the Sveconorwegian Orogeny...|$|E

Furthermore, during deformation the incremental strain axis maintains a 45 degree angle to the shear zone boundary. The finite strain axes are initially parallel to the incremental axis, but rotate away during progressive deformation.|$|R

Mylonitization is a process in which mineral components of a rock undergo large and dominantly ductile deformation. (4) Except for mechanical abrasion at the boundaries, quartz and mica are highly strained and flattened, and recrystallize by subgrain formation. This results in grain size reduction and development of strong preferred orientation in quartz and mica. However, during mylonitization, harder components such as feldspars remain largely coherent as clasts. In the extreme case of phyllonite and ultramylonite (highly deformed rocks), even the harder mineral components succumb, and the grain size becomes extremely small. All samples used in this study were collected in upper Palm Canyon area of the Santa Rosa <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone.</b> The <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> lies on {{the eastern edge of the}} Peninsular Ranges batholith and was pervasively deformed in a ductile regime shortly after the emplacement of the batholith [...] ...|$|E

Garnet-bearing granulite facies metabasic dykes of the Tournefort Dyke Swarm, emplaced during or prior to orogenesis, have been used to constrain the timing of peak metamorphism attributed to the Kimban Orogeny, via Sm-Nd mineral isochrons, at 1716 +- 14 Ma, approximately 100 Ma younger than previously believed. Estimates of P-T conditions recorded by the rocks were also calculated, in order to reconstruct a basic section across the Kimban Orogen. The dykes generally consist of the assemblages garnet-hornblende-plagioclase-ilmenite and garnet-hornblende-plagioclase-clinopyroxene-ilmenite. Peak assemblages involve garnet-orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene-plagioclase-hornblende-ilmenite. P-T estimates suggest a baric section across the Kimban Orogen is asymmetrical, and centred on the Kalinjala <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone</b> with metamorphic conditions of 840 +- 95 degC and 10. 1 +- 1. 2 kbar adjacent to and within the Kalinjala <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone,</b> declining shallowly to the east to about 600 degC and 5. 4 +- 1. 6 kbar about 24 kms across strike. This data in concert with structural evidence, suggests that the Kimban Orogen may have developed in an environment of oblique convergence, with associated strains partitioned between strike-slip movement along the Kalinjala <b>Mylonite</b> <b>Zone,</b> and a strike-normal component away from the zone, leading to the differential exhumation of granulite facies Lincoln Complex rocks east of the KMZ, and their juxtaposition against amphibolite-greenschist Hutchison Group rocks to the west.

40|$|The {{upper part}} of three deep seismic lines running across the Penninic Swiss Alps of Valais have been studied. Numerous reflectors {{illustrate}} the nappe structure of this internal part of the orogen. These reflectors, even at great depths (20 - 25 km), can be correlated with outcropping geological features and are most likely produced by lithological boundaries rather than by <b>mylonites</b> <b>zones,</b> which are hardly reflective in such an environment. Our interpretations, largely constrained by projections of the outcropping geology, have improved {{our knowledge of the}} deep structure of this segment of the Alpine belt, enhancing the importance of the backfolding and the crustal scale deformation phase which produced the Rawil-Valpelline depression and the Aar-Toce culmination. Furthermore we have here the possibility of correlating seismic patterns produced by ductile folds with the outcropping structures...|$|R
40|$|The Athens Schist Formation {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of metasedimentary rocks, varying from strong or medium strong rocks such as sericite metasandstone, limestone, greywacke, sericite schist through to weak rocks such as metasiltstone, clayey and silty shale and phyllite. The overall rock mass is highly heterogeneous and anisotropic owing to the combined effect of advanced weathering and severe tectonic stressing that gave rise to intense folding and shearing followed by extensional faulting, which resulted in highly weathered rock masses and numerous shear and/or <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones</b> with distinct downgraded engineering properties. This paper is focused on the applicability of the GSI classification system to these highly heterogeneous rock masses and proposes an extension of the GSI system to account for the foliated or laminated weak rocks in the lower range of its applicability...|$|R
30|$|The third {{possible}} explanation is that the mylonite was originated from the pseudotachylyte veins. In the surrounding anorthositic rock body, there are many pseudotachylyte veins (Austrheim and Boundy 1994; Austrheim et al. 1996) and the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones</b> can be followed into these pseudotachylyte veins. Also, structure of the mylonite is quite {{similar to that of the}} pseudotachylyte: sharp boundary and porphyroclast poor matrix. Exact timing of the pseudotachylyte generation is not clear, but during the Caledonian orogenic event, preexisting pseudotachylyte is reactivated. Increased pressure and temperature during the orogenic event and free fluid channeled through the pseudotachylyte vein-enhanced grain growth, and the mylonite may have evolved from a crystallized frictional melt or ultra-comminuted material (Spray 1995) as described by Ueda et al. (2008). These newly formed small grains act as a weak layer, accelerating shear localization.|$|R
30|$|The fabric {{strengths}} (M-index) {{of samples}} {{are listed in}} Table  1. The M-index of samples in the wall rock area ranged from 0.06 to 0.27. The M-index of samples in the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> was much lower than that in the wall rocks, meaning a weaker LPO in the mylonite. The M-index of the medium-grained area ranged from 0.04 to 0.06 and was approximately 0.04 for the small-grained area.|$|E
30|$|Hundskjeften {{peridotite}} {{samples from}} the Lindås Nappe complex are preserving two fluid-induced fabrics which resulted from two different orogenic events: Grenvillian wall rock fabric (ca. 1, 000  Ma) and Caledonian mylonite fabric (ca. 400  Ma). Compared to the material in the wall rock area, the mylonite has very fine grains and contains many hydrous inclusions (Figures  3 D and 9 B). Three types of LPOs of olivine are observed in a large-grained area (wall rock): B-type LPO of olivine, E-type LPO of olivine, and A-type[*]+[*]B-type LPO of olivine. In the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone,</b> there {{is a change in}} the LPO of olivine from the wall rock to mylonite; it changes from a combination of A- and B-type LPOs to B- and E-type LPOs of olivine. FTIR analysis of olivine in the large-grained area (wall rock) reveals that the olivine grains have water contents of about 350 [*]±[*] 50  ppm H/Si, which correspond to medium water contents (Jung et al. 2006). Hence, the LPO of olivine in the large-grained area is believed to have originated under conditions of medium water content. The water content of olivine in the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> is much higher than that of olivine in the wall rock (Table  1). In addition, amosite inclusions and antigorites are found in the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone.</b> These observations indicate that differences between olivine fabrics of the wall rock and mylonite resulted from differences in water content. Observations of water-induced fabric change in Hundskjeften peridotite are consistent with previous experimental studies of olivine fabrics under water-rich conditions (Jung et al. 2006).Differences in fabric strength and dislocation density of olivine in the wall rock and mylonite suggest that different deformation mechanisms were involved during the two-stage deformation. A strong LPO and high dislocation density of olivine in the wall rock indicate that the dominant deformation mechanism of olivine was dislocation creep. On the other hand, a weak LPO of olivine, a lower dislocation density of olivine, and four-grain junctions in the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> are clear evidence of deformation by dislocation creep accompanied by grain-boundary sliding. Calculating seismic properties {{in the context of a}} two-stage deformations, we found that as the percentage of mylonite (second-stage deformation) increases, the P- and S-wave velocity anisotropies become significantly weaker (Figure  11). This study suggests that multi-stage deformations should be examined to better understand seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle and crust.|$|E
30|$|Foliation {{of samples}} from the large-grained (wall rock) area was {{determined}} as a compositional layering defined by modal variation of orthopyroxene (opx), clinopyroxene (cpx), garnet, and olivine (Figure  1 B). Note that garnet is confined to the pyroxene rich parts as a garnet pyroxenite and is not in equilibrium with olivine (Kühn et al. 2000). Lineation was determined by examining the shape-preferred orientation of minerals in foliation using the projection-function method (Panozzo 1984). For {{samples from the}} <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone,</b> foliation and lineation were determined independently of the wall rock area. The mylonite layer itself was defined as foliation of the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone,</b> and lineation for the <b>mylonite</b> <b>zone</b> was determined using the same method as applied to the wall rock area. After lineation and foliation were determined, a thin section was prepared in the x-z plane (x, lineation; z, normal to foliation) to study the LPO of minerals. An electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) detector attached to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM- 6380) housed at the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES) in Seoul National University (SNU) {{was used to determine}} the LPO of each mineral. For the EBSD analysis, we used an HKL system with Channel 5 software. The accelerating voltage was 20  kV, and the working distance in the SEM was 15  mm. The EBSD pattern of an individual grain was analyzed manually to ensure an accurate solution. To estimate the fabric strength of the LPO, M-index proposed by Skemer et al. (2005) was used because it is insensitive to the number of grain measured and arbitrary numerical parameters compared to the J-index (Skemer et al. 2005). M-index ranges from 0 to 1 : 0 for the random fabric and 1 for the single crystal.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} three field seasons the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) has {{undertaken}} mapping in the south-eastern part of the Nuuk region in southern West Greenland, and here we present new zircon ages that help constrain the northern boundary of the Tasiusarsuaq ter-rane. The Archaean geology of the Nuuk region is commonly interpreted as a tectonic collage assembled through lateral accretion and collision of oceanic and continental slivers and blocks (e. g. Friend & Nutman 2005). Popular jargon de-scribes these as terranes, bounded by faults or <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones</b> and characterised by rocks of contrasting origin {{on either side of}} their tectonic boundaries (Coney et al. 1980). The Isukasia and Færingehavn terranes (Figs 1, 2) are the oldest terranes at ≥ 3. 75 Ga, and extend from the outer part of Godthåbsfjord in the south-west to the margin of the Inland Ice in th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recurrent ductile {{and brittle}} {{displacements}} characterize the steep boundary <b>mylonite</b> <b>zones</b> that enclose Proterozoic gncisses of the Rosslare Complex in SE Ireland. The northern exposed {{limit of the}} Complex is a wide displacement zone containing greenschist facies mylonites derived from two protoliths: (a) basement gncisses and (b) supracrustal metasediments. Important sinistral transcurrent movements produced these mylonites probably during the late Precambrian. Docking of the Precambrian 'Monian' sediments to the Rosslare basement may indicate remobilization of a basement/cover relationship. The transpression, uplifted and eroded the mylonites into early Palaeozoic (?Cambrian and Arenig) overstep sediments. Renewed ip-slip displacement, possibly during the Ordovician, was distributed through the mylonites and deformed the sedimen-tary cover ocks. Finally, the initially wide displacement zone along the northern boundary of the Complex narrowed to discrete brittle faults during subsequent Palaeozoic reacti-vations. Following pre-Arenig ductile sinistral shear along the probable southern margin of the Complex, each bounding fault strand had divergent histories which involved decoupling of an anastomosing transpressive system...|$|R
40|$|The mylonitised {{granitic}} rocks were {{object of}} the study in the Zobor part of the Tribeč Mts. They were metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions during simple shear deformation. The shear (<b>mylonite)</b> <b>zones</b> are oriented in the NE–SW direction in the investigated area. Prevailing of the shear zones has sinistral sense of displacement. The origin of the sinistral shear zones is connected with compression oriented in the N–S direction during the Latest Cretaceous to Palaeocene. The dextral shear zones together with folds observed in the Lower Triassic sediments of the Lúžna Fm. were generated under the WNW–ESE oriented compression. The origin of the dextral shear zones is interpreted {{as a consequence of}} thrusting of the Central Carpathians tectonic units (Veporic and Fatric units) during the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian). The sinistral shear zones were most probably superposed on dextral shear zones because of reorientation of the stress field to the N–S direction during the Latest Cretaceous–Earliest Palaeogene...|$|R
