He reached the gold medal match in the singles competition, whilst losing {{in the first and}} second rounds of the men's doubles and mixed doubles competitions respectively. After a 4-hour final, Murray defeated Juan Martín del Potro and successfully retained his title as Olympic champion, achieving a second Olympic gold medal – a feat which no other singles player has achieved. Murray attributed the <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> his win as coming from Mo Farah's 10,000m win.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of an {{apprentice}} Shaper, a sect of mages who can create living creatures through force of will. The apprentice is cast away on Sucia, an island abandoned by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers' creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding their creators in the intervening years. The primary <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> the player is to escape the island and, in the process, deal with the forces working to steal the Shaper secrets abandoned on Sucia Isle.|$|E
5|$|According to Croatian {{political}} scientist Vladimir Filipović, {{it is unclear}} whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades; according to Hague, the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash. Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present). However, Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent.|$|E

Based on the survey data from 93 software firms in Beijing, Fuzhou and Xiamen, we use Chi-square test to do the empirical analysis. The empirical results indicate that firms that aim to carry out development-oriented R&D are usually with <b>motivations</b> <b>of</b> complementary resources, economies of scale and government relationship, while firms that aim to carry out research-oriented R&D are usually with <b>motivations</b> <b>of</b> risk sharing and market access...|$|R

5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as {{the driving force behind the}} plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses over the course of the game.|$|E
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E
5|$|Others {{point out}} that in philosophy, a {{critical}} and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out {{the negative consequences of}} uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> their philosophical arguments {{can be traced back to}} 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented the <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E
