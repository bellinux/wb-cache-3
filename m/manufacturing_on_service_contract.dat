500|$|After {{the virtual}} {{closure of the}} Chinese market, Bovet {{continued}} to manufacture pocket watches, though at a much reduced rate, and would frequently offer its <b>manufacturing</b> <b>services</b> <b>on</b> a <b>contract</b> basis to other watch companies. The Landry Freres purchased Bovet in 1888 but did not invest in it. [...] In 1901, the Bovet trademark was sold at auction in Paris to Cesar and Charles Leuba, sons of Ami Leuba. [...] Jacques Ullmann and Co., another successful produce of watches for the Chinese market, purchased the Bovet brand in 1918. After Jacques Ullmann {{went out of business}} in 1932, the Bovet name was acquired by Albert and Jean Bovet, who were successful watch makers and registered several patents for chronographs, such as the mono rattrapante—a device that would pause the second hand for a reading while the mechanism continued to run. [...] The company Favre-Leuba purchased the name and manufacturing facilities from the Bovet brothers in 1948.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the transition from traditional <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> at Department of Defense Field Contracting Activities. There {{has been an increase}} in spending <b>on</b> <b>services</b> over the past decade that has forced the Federal Government to review its policy <b>on</b> <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> In 1991, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy established policy for the acquisition of <b>services</b> using performance-based <b>contracting.</b> Interviews of Government contracting personnel and review of professional literature highlight barriers to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> These barriers are: management of cultural change, education and training of Government and contractor personnel, adoption of best commercial practices, writing of performance-based statements of work, and the tasks involved in contract administration. This thesis makes recommendations for overcoming these barriers and provides guidance for successful implementation of performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> within the Department of Defense.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the service parts {{end-of-life}} inventory problem in a circumstance that demands for service parts are differentiated. Customer differentiation {{might be due to}} criticality of the demand or based <b>on</b> various <b>service</b> <b>contracts.</b> In both cases, we model the problem as a finite horizon stochastic dynamic program and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that when customers are differentiated based on the demand criticality then the optimal structure consists of time and state dependent threshold levels for inventory rationing. In case of differentiation based <b>on</b> <b>service</b> <b>contracts,</b> we show that in addition to rationing thresholds we also need contract extension thresholds by which the system decides whether to offer an extension to an expiring contract or not. By numerical experiments in both cases, we identify the value of incorporating such decisions in service parts end-of-life inventory management with customer differentiation. Moreover, we show that these decisions not only result in cost efficiency but also decrease the risk of part obsolescence drastically...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} an attempt to analyse and deep the {{insurance}} premium rate/load as a factor that influences the premium revenues for the Social Security Administration by using the Laffer curve logic and to identify the premium load that maximizes premium revenues and the improvement it would bring to the Administration. Turkish Social Security system separates the employees three main groups: Indıvıduals working <b>on</b> <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> who are subject to SSK(Social Insurance Administration), Individuals working on their own names and accounts who are subject to Bag-Kur(Craftsmen And Artisans And Other Self-Employed Social Insurance Institution) and public employees who are subject to ES (Retirement Fund General Directorate) before the social security reform. The previous study, “Model Proposal for Investigating and Increasing the Social Security Administration's Premium Collection Revenue” analysed the relationship between the premium revenue and premium rate/load for all the employees and make a total analyse for premium rate and revenue. In this study it will be focused on: Indıvıduals working <b>on</b> <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> who are subject to SSK(Social Insurance Administration) before the reform. The monthly data for the period between October 2008 and December 2012 were used in the study. The results of the analysis revealed a significantly parabolic relationship between the Administration's premium revenues and insurance premium load, which is similar to the Laffer curve. The insurance premium rate that would maximize the Administration's premium revenues was found to be 36. 9 % and it was determined that an improvement amount of 6. 8 billion TL would have been obtained for the premium revenues in 2012 if this rate had been applied. In fact the explanatory power of this study (% 96) is more than the explanatory power of previous study (% 80) because the ex-study consisted of the public employees and trades people whose elasticity is lower against the social security premium rate...|$|R

40|$|Goods are {{distribution}} mechanisms for service provision. In a new emerging paradigm, tangible products, embodied with knowledge, {{are seen as}} "appliances" {{for the performance of}} services (Vargo & Lusch 2004 a). In this dissertation, we look at the transition from products to services within the manufacturing business. Increasingly, <b>manufacturing</b> companies rely <b>on</b> <b>services</b> for both growth and increased profitability. The objectives of this study are (1) to describe, conceptualize, and illustrate the transition from focusing on products to focusing <b>on</b> <b>services</b> through a number of case examples in manufacturing companies, (2) to examine the requirements for the transition, (3) to explore the motives for the transition, and (4) to analyze the implications of the transition. To tackle these questions, we use both qualitative methods (case studies) and quantitative methods (survey-based regression analysis). The main contribution of this study is the identification of information technology innovations as an important requirement and an enabling factor for this transition. Companies need new information systems, for example, in the form of condition monitoring from a distance and knowledge sharing through information systems. We argue {{that it would not be}} possible for manufacturing companies to move towards the service focus without these systems. Another contribution of the study is the observation that this transition requires manufacturing firms to move closer to the customer companies and to adopt a more relational form of interaction with their customers. Compared to the transactional type of interaction, the relational type exhibits stronger operational linkages, more extensive information exchange, and more adaptations by the seller. The results also indicate that coercive and economic pressures act as the main motives for this transition. Customer companies are demanding more complete offerings including a greater degree of services (coercive pressures). There are also important economic incentives for manufacturing companies to move towards services. Services generate steadier revenue streams than product sales, and hence, manufacturing companies can protect themselves against market fluctuations by focusing <b>on</b> <b>service</b> <b>contracts.</b> In addition, <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> can be seen as a good way to ensure the MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations) product busines...|$|R
