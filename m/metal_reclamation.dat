40|$|Biological N 2 {{fixation}} {{represents the}} major source of N input in agricultural soils including those in arid regions. The major N 2 -fixing systems are the symbiotic systems, which can {{play a significant role in}} improving the fertility and productivity of low-N soils. The Rhizobium-legume symbioses have received most attention and have been examined extensively. The behavior of some N 2 -fixing systems under severe environmental conditions such as salt stress, drought stress, acidity, alkalinity, nutrient deficiency, fertilizers, heavy metals, and pesticides is reviewed. These major stress factors suppress the growth and symbiotic characteristics of most rhizobia; however, several strains, distributed among various species of rhizobia, are tolerant to stress effects. Some strains of rhizobia form effective (N 2 -fixing) symbioses with their host legumes under salt, heat, and acid stresses, and can sometimes do so under the effect of heavy <b>metals.</b> <b>Reclamation</b> and improvement of the fertility of arid lands by application of organic (manure and sewage sludge) and inorganic (synthetic) fertilizers are expensive and can be a source of pollution.

40|$|Mining {{of mineral}} {{resources}} results in extensive soil damage, altering microbial communities and affecting vegetation leading to destruction of {{vast amounts of}} land. Reclamation is the process to restore the ecological integrity of these disturbed mine land areas. It includes the management {{of all types of}} physical, chemical and biological disturbances of soils such as soil pH, fertility, microbial community and various soil nutrient cycles that makes the degraded land soil productive. Productivity of soil can be increased by adding various natural amendments such as saw dust, wood residues, sewage sludge, animal manures, as these amendments stimulate the microbial activity which provides the nutrients (N, P) and organic carbon to the soil. The top soil gets seriously damaged during mineral extraction. The consequences of physical disturbance to the top soil during stripping, stockpiling, and reinstatement cause unusually large N transformations and movements with eventually substantial loss. Management of top soil is important for reclamation plan to reduce the N losses and to increase soil nutrients and microbes. Revegetation constitutes the most widely accepted and useful way to reduce erosion and protect soils against degradation during reclamation. Mine restoration efforts have focused on N-fixing species of legumes, grasses, herbs, and trees. Metal tolerant plants can be effective for acidic and heavy <b>metals</b> bearing soils. <b>Reclamation</b> of abandoned mine land is a very complex process. Once the reclamation plan is complete and vegetation has established, the assessment of the reclaimed site is necessary to evaluate the success of reclamation. Evaluation of reclamation success focuses on measuring the occurrence and distribution of soil microflora community which is regulated by interactions between C and nutrient availabilities. Reclamation success also measures the structure and functioning of mycorrhizal symbiosis and various enzymatic activities in soil.

The purpose of this research was the identification of heavy metals and other potentially harmful elements emitted during the combustion and baling of polyvinyl chloride insulated copper wire. Analysis of the smoke produced during the burning was conducted and compared to the airborne dust samples collected during the baling process. From these results, occupational exposures to heavy <b>metals</b> during the <b>reclamation</b> of PVC insulated copper wire were assessed. Bulk ash and dust samples were ?aken to compare {{to each other and to}} the air samples to examine the similarities and/or differences that existed between the samples. Neutron activation analysis was used to determine the components found in the bulk ash and dust samples. Atomic absorption was used to analyze the air samples collected during the baling and combustion of PVC insulated copper wire. Particle size distributions were measured using an Anderson 2000 cascade impactor. All tests were performed according to existing standards. The air sampling data yielded some surprising results. These results indicated potentially high occupational exposures to lead and copper while antimony, cadmium, and barium were not detected. This was startling considering previous research indicated the potential for antimony, cadmium, and barium, to be found in quantities that could exceed occupational exposures, but not for lead or copper. The combustion samples taken for five minutes in the smoke plume showed lead and copper results exceeding the allowed daily exposure in 5 to 8 minutes. Although the lead and copper samples taken during the baling operation did not exceed the allowed daily exposure, the results did show potentially high exposures to workers if the baling of burned copper wire continued for the duration of the workshift. The bulk ash and dust samples showed antimony, bromine, and chromium in concentrations exceeding 100 ppm by mass.

In the same period they measured high dioxin emissions at the <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> plant concerned. Predictions by the dioxin chain model in the basis of the emissions didn't exclude a exceeding of the Dutch standard of 6 pg (i) TEQ/gram milkfat for cow's milk from diary farms on the Dutch side of the border. Therefore, the Dutch government decided to start a monitoring program to measure the dioxin levels in cow's milk from two selected diary farms {{in the neighborhood of}} Sas van Gent, 5 km North-east of the <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> plant, on a monthly basis. In the period October 1998 - June 2000 dioxin levels in cow's milk from these two diary farms were measured. None of the values exceeded the Dutch standard. The highest levels were measured {{at the start of the}} monitoring program; 3. 0 +/- 0. 2 and 5. 1 +/- 0. 3 pg (i) -TEQ/g milkfat, for the two farms respectively, in October 1998. During the same period, October-December 1998, the dioxin levels of consumers milk, sampled on a monthly basis were monitored. The samples were collected per region of the Netherlands (North, East, South and West). The measured dioxin levels in this period resulted in a background level of 0. 5 - 0. 8 pg (i) -TEQ/g of fat. At the end of the period, in June 2000, dioxin levels were decreased to a level round 1 pg (i) TEQ/g of fat. These values are in the same order of magnitude as the back ground level of 0. 3 - 0. 4 pg (i) TEQ/g of fat found for consumers milk in the second quarter of 2000. It can be concluded that the measures taken by the <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> plant, imposed by the Belgian government, presumably have led to decreasing dioxin levels in locally produced cow's milk.

Dioxin levels in milk from the vicinity of the former MSWs of Zaandam and Alkmaar of June-August 1990, were strongly decreased when compared to the levels of April-May 1990. From July 1990, levels were below the critical level of 6 pg TEQ/g milk fat. 2. Levels in milk of June and July of farms near the MSW of Amsterdam were between 1. 8 +- 0. 1 and 2. 6 +- 0. 2 pg TEQ/g of fat, and are comparable to the levels of July 1989 and April-May 1990. 3. In the vicinity of the MSWs of Duiven and Leiden and the <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> plant in Culemborg, dioxin levels were comparable to the corresponding levels of April and May 1990.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{one aspect of}} {{occupational}} dioxin exposure that is novel and unexpected.

The same procedure involving virgin steel in steel trade and mass production of steel objects gave no such evidence, even though no final conclusions can be drawn because of the low number of samples analyzed. Low dioxin exposures during inert gas electric arc welding confirm previous literature findings, whereas soldering and thermal oxygen cutting in the presence of polyvinyl chloride give rise to concern. The consequences of occupational dioxin exposure were studied by analysis of the dioxin-blood concentration, the body burden, of men performing thermal oxygen cutting at scrap <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> and demolition sites, in steel trade and producing plants as well as for industrial welders and white-collar workers. The results concerning body burdens are in excellent agreement with the dioxin exposure as characterized by dioxin air concentration in the workplace.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study on dioxin levels in samples of curly kale, collected in deposition areas of municipal waste incinerators and a <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> plant as well as in background locations in the Netherlands. From earlier reports on environmental contamination with dioxins it is known that in areas within a few kilometers of waste incinerators, elevated dioxin levels can be found in top soil, grass and a consequence of this, in cow's milk from locally situated dairy farms. Therefore, it was assumed that in the same areas elevated levels can be found in outside growing crops especially curly kale. For these reasons, the first objective was to obtain more insight in levels of the seventeen toxic polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans in samples of kale collected in suspected and non-suspected areas, whereas the second objective was to produce more data on dioxin levels in kale to enable assessments of the additional intake of dioxins by the Dutch population by consumption of kale and other leafy vegetables. In February 1991, {{at the end of the}} growth period, fourteen samples of kale were collected in deposition areas of two municipal waste incinerators and one <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> plant and two background locations. Strategy in sampling preparation was directed to obtain representative data on dioxin levels in kale for each of the five regions at a limited number of 15 - 20 samples reserved for this study. Analyses were performed by the use of in-house standard operating procedures for extraction, isolation and GC/MS-analysis of purified extracts. It appeared that no elevated levels chould be found in samples of kale from depostion areas. The dioxin levels of the fourteen samples ranged between 0. 52 and 1. 3 with a mean of 0. 87 +- 0. 06 pg 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD-equivalents (using International REFs) per g dry weight (pg TEQ/g dry weight). According to consumption data from the Dutch Food Consumption Study 1987 - 1988, a yearly average of 2 g of kale per person per day is consumed. Using a dioxin level of 1 pg TEQ/g dry weight and an average dry matter content of 15 wt%, and additional daily intake of 0. 3 pg TEQ per person can be calculated. When compared to an earlier reported median intake of 70 pg TEQ per person per day by consumption of food products mainly derived from animal fats and oils, a negligible additional intake is obtained by consumption of kale. By extrapolation of these figures to other (leafy) vegetables and fruits, a maximal additional daily intake has been estimated of about 8 pg TEQ per person per day. ...|$|E

These chemicals are typical POPs and are of constantly high concern for their potential adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. PCBs were mainly used by the power industry in electrical transformers, capacitors, hydraulic equipment, and as lubricants. PCDD/Fs are formed as unintentional by-products of chemical manufacturing and incineration processes, as well as natural processes such as volcanic eruptions, and biomass burning. Emissions from incineration of industrial wastes such as <b>metal</b> <b>reclamation</b> and domestic heating (especially in central Europe) are considered as current sources of PCDD/Fs to the environment. A database of published observed concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in air, soil sediments and water was built as described in details in the report. As continental scale assessment is aimed more at the evaluation of the regional distribution of contamination, we excluded from the database those measurements taken close to known PCB or PCCD/F pollution sources of exceptional entity such as waste incinerators or contaminated sites.
