500|$|In 1998, on {{learning}} of {{his interest in}} pursuing a political career, the National Party president John Slater began working actively to recruit him. Former party leader Jenny Shipley describes {{him as one of}} the people she [...] "deliberately sought out and put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> the line–either privately or publicly–to get them in there".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} shows Rihanna sexually seducing her love interest, while {{revealing}} her [...] "nasty secrets". According to Julianne Shepherd of Spin, Rihanna [...] "coyly dares" [...] 'her lover to [...] "sex her up"'. In [...] "Roc Me Out", Rihanna uses her [...] "militaristic alternate persona" [...] and interprets the lyrics [...] "with a command and directness befitting" [...] of it. Rihanna complains to her lover throughout the lines [...] "You’re taking {{too long to}} get <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> the ground / And my feet in the clouds," [...] before cooing, [...] "I’ve been a bad girl, daddy". She gives him instructions while singing [...] "Get <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> the ground and my feet in the clouds". Priya Elan of NME commented that the song sounds like a [...] "‘Rude Boy’ re-tool from the vocal delivery to her 'Come on boy' line." [...] In the end, Rihanna reveals the [...] "dirtiest secret" [...] through the line [...] "I’ll let you in on a dirty secret, I {{just want to be}} loved". David Amidon of PopMatters described the line as the song's [...] "not exactly a dangerous sentiment".|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{was chosen}} to curate the 2007 High Line Festival, {{selecting}} musicians and artists for the Manhattan event, including electronic pop duo AIR, surrealist photographer Claude Cahun and English comedian Ricky Gervais. Bowie performed on Scarlett Johansson's 2008 album of Tom Waits covers, Anywhere I Lay <b>My</b> <b>Head.</b> <b>On</b> the 40th anniversary of the July 1969 moon landing—and Bowie's accompanying commercial breakthrough with [...] "Space Oddity"—EMI released the individual tracks from the original eight-track studio recording of the song, in a 2009 contest inviting {{members of the public}} to create a remix. A Reality Tour, a double album of live material from the 2003 concert tour, was released in January 2010.|$|E

500|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{for lunch}} Gordon-Cumming {{returned to the}} witness box, where he was cross-examined by Russell. During the session Russell provided {{a model of the}} table used and a photograph of the room, and questioned Gordon-Cumming about the bets where cheating had been suspected. Russell also asked him about why he had signed the document agreeing not to play cards: Gordon-Cumming stated that he had [...] "lost <b>my</b> <b>head...</b> <b>on</b> that occasion. If I had not lost my head I would not have signed that document". Gordon-Cumming's cross-examination ran into the second day, after which he was then re-examined by Clarke; his time in the witness box lasted until 1pm. The Illustrated London News considered that [...] "Gordon-Cumming made an admirable witness... leaning easily on the rail, his grey-gloved left hand resting easily on the bare right, perfectly dressed, his tones equable, firm, neither over-hurried nor over-deliberate, cool, but not too cool".|$|E
500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough. [...] I watched him play a few overs and I thought, [...] "This is good", and then they brought Laker on to bowl. [...] The third and the fifth balls of Laker's over disappeared over <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>on</b> the way up, and they both finished in the crowd for six[...] [...] [...] I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership [...] [...] [...] and it did so much for my future cricket career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Călinescu {{remained}} in office during the royal dictatorship established by King Carol in 1937, serving as vice-premier under Miron Cristea. [...] According to historian Joseph Rothschild, {{he was actually}} the real power in the government. [...] He was also {{a founding member of}} the National Renaissance Front (FRN) created by as the sole legal party in December 1938, and was generally seen as very close to Carol. He soon became involved in a virulent dispute with historian Nicolae Iorga, when the latter issued harsh criticism regarding Carol's January 1939 initiative to dress large sections of the society, including Romanian Academy members, in various uniforms (a measure backed by Călinescu); Iorga remarked with irony: [...] "I'm prepared to wear the FRN uniform, but allow me to wear a speared helmet on <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>on</b> which to place [...] the Minister of the Interior". Eventually (in May of the same year), Iorga gave in to the demands and became a supporter of the regime.|$|E

2500|$|... "Viva la Vida" [...] {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of}} the album, critic Chris Willman wrote: [...] "Take the title track... on which [...] imagines himself as a paranoid monarch. 'Who would ever want to be king?' Martin asks. 'Revolutionaries wait/For <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> a silver plate!' The confident majesty of the music, however, belies {{how he and his}} bandmates [...] have invigorated their rock-lite reign." [...] Josh Hathaway from The Plain Dealer noted [...] "Viva la Vida" [...] as the [...] "catchiest" [...] song on the album. Chris Jones of the BBC noted: [...] "The string/brass mutations that bolster a track like 'Viva La Vida'... conjure tunes so sweetly melancholy." [...] In the IGN review, critic Chad Grischow wrote, [...] "It is their one and only foray into unabashed orchestral pop, but the punchy strut of the strings and fantastic marching vocals make it far too charming and lively to dislike, and even harder not to love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Givens pitched {{for five}} more {{seasons in the}} majors—in 1996, when he went 3-1 with a 2.86 earned-run average in four games. [...] He had begun the season on a 30-day {{rehabilitation}} assignment with New Orleans after injuring his back in his final throwing session at home in Aurora, Colorado {{the day before he}} left for 1996 spring training. [...] After his 30-day rehab assignment, Givens unexpectedly ended up staying longer in AAA instead of being promoted to the major leagues. [...] "I was chapped at the time", Givens said of his frustration with not being called up sooner in 1996. [...] "I didn't pitch well the first few games, then I finally got <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> straight." [...] Givens was called up in June and was hit hard in four starts. [...] While at New Orleans in 1996, however, Givens pitched well, going 10–9 with a 3.02 earned-run average. [...] He filed for free agency on October 15, 1996, after he and the Brewers decided to part ways by mutual agreement.|$|E
