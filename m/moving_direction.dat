40|$|Conventionally, {{information}} {{is represented by}} spike rates in the neural system. Here, we consider the ability of temporally modulated activities in neuronal networks to carry information extra to spike rates. These temporal modulations, commonly known as population spikes, are due {{to the presence of}} synaptic depression in a neuronal network model. We discuss its relevance to an experiment on transparent motions in macaque monkeys by Treue et al. in 2000. They found that if the <b>moving</b> <b>directions</b> of objects are too close, the firing rate profile will be very similar to that with one direction. As the difference in the <b>moving</b> <b>directions</b> of objects is large enough, the neuronal system would respond {{in such a way that}} the network enhances the resolution in the <b>moving</b> <b>directions</b> of the objects. In this paper, we propose that this behavior can be reproduced by neural networks with dynamical synapses when there are multiple external inputs. We will demonstrate how resolution enhancement can be achieved, and discuss the conditions under which temporally modulated activities are able to enhance information processing performances in general.

40|$|Key Words: {{vehicular}} ad-hoc network (VANET), routing, intersection, routing path, delay This paper {{proposes a}} vehicle ad-hoc network (VANET) routing algorithm {{to reduce the}} probability of routing path discontinuity in urban intersections. In urban intersections, the vehicles may frequently change their <b>moving</b> <b>directions.</b> It can cause the disconnection of routing path and the increase of a packet transmission delay. In order to resolve this problem, the proposed routing algorithm exploits the information of <b>moving</b> <b>directions</b> in urban intersections. In this way, the proposed algorithm can reduce the probability of the local maximum which causes the increase {{of the number of}} routing hops and packet transmission delay.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{solution}} for steering microrobotic swarm by dynamic actuating fields. In our approach, {{the motion of}} micro-robots is controlled by changing the actuating direction of a field applied to them. The time-series sequence of actuating field’s directions can be computed automatically. Given a target position {{in the domain of}} swarm, a governing field is first constructed to provide optimal <b>moving</b> <b>directions</b> at every points. Following these directions, a robot can be driven to the target efficiently. However, when working with a crowd of micro-robots, the optimal <b>moving</b> <b>directions</b> on different agents can contradict with each other. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a novel steering algorithm to compute a statistically optimal actuating direction at each time frame. Following a sequence of these actuating directions, a crowd of micro-robots can be transported to the target region effectively. Our steering strategy of swarm has been verified on a platform that generates magnetic fields with unique actuating directions. Experimental tests taken on aggregated magnetic micro-particles are quite encouraging. Author accepted manuscriptAdvanced Manufacturin...|$|R

50|$|From the {{theoretical}} point of view, population coding {{is one of}} a few mathematically well-formulated problems in neuroscience. It grasps the essential features of neural coding and yet is simple enough for theoretic analysis. Experimental studies have revealed that this coding paradigm is widely used in the sensor and motor areas of the brain. For example, in the visual area medial temporal (MT), neurons are tuned to the <b>moving</b> <b>direction.</b> In response to an object moving in a particular direction, many neurons in MT fire with a noise-corrupted and bell-shaped activity pattern across the population. The <b>moving</b> <b>direction</b> of the object is retrieved from the population activity, to be immune from the fluctuation existing in a single neuron’s signal.In one classic example in the primary motor cortex, Apostolos Georgopoulos and colleagues trained monkeys to move a joystick towards a lit target. They found that a single neuron would fire for multiple target directions. However it would fire fastest for one direction and more slowly depending on how close the target was to the neuron's 'preferred' direction.|$|E

40|$|A pure spin current {{formed by}} {{opposite}} spins <b>moving</b> in opposite <b>directions</b> is a rank- 2 axial tensor which breaks the inversion symmetry. Thus a spin current has a second-order optical susceptibility, with unique polarization-dependence {{determined by the}} symmetry properties of the current. In particular, a longitudinal spin current, in which the spin polarization directions are parallel or anti-parallel to the <b>moving</b> <b>directions,</b> being a chiral quantity, leads to a chiral sum-frequency effect. Microscopic calculations based on the eight-band model of a III-V compound semiconductor confirm the symmetry analysis and show that the susceptibility is quite measurable under realistic conditions. The second-order nonlinear optical effects {{may be used for}} in-situ and non-destructive detection of spin currents, as a standard spectroscopy tool in research of spintronics.

40|$|In this paper, an {{automatic}} method of counting the passing {{people through the}} gate by using two space-time images is proposed. In the proposed method, the images are obtained in series by using a camera which is hung straight from {{the ceiling of the}} gate, so that the data of the passing people are not overlapped each other in the images. First, a spacetime image which includes the data of the passing people over the measurement line is generated. But in this system arrangement, each <b>moving</b> <b>direction</b> of the passing people can not be recognized from one space-time image. Therefore, two measurement lines are set on the inside and outside of the gate and two space-time images are generated. By detecting which line the person passes early, each <b>moving</b> <b>direction</b> is recognized. Finally, the incoming and outgoing persons could be measured by counting the people data on two space-time images of each <b>moving</b> <b>direction.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Proper {{adjustment}} of <b>moving</b> <b>direction</b> after external mechanical stimulation {{is essential for}} animals to avoid danger (e. g. predators), and thus is vital for survival. This process involves sensory inputs, central processing and motor outputs. Recent studies have made considerable progress in identifying mechanosensitive neurons and mechanosensation receptor proteins. Our understandings of molecular and cellular mechanisms that link mechanosensation with the changes in <b>moving</b> <b>direction,</b> however, remain limited. Results In this study, we investigate the control of movement adjustment in Drosophila. In response to gentle touch at the anterior segments, Drosophila larvae reorient and select a new direction for forward movement. The extent of change in <b>moving</b> <b>direction</b> is correlated with the intensity of tactile stimuli. Sensation of gentle touch requires chordotonal organs and class IV da neurons. Genetic analysis indicates an important role for the evolutionarily conserved immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily protein Turtle (Tutl) to regulate touch-initiated directional change. Tutl is required specifically in post-mitotic neurons at larval stage {{after the completion of}} embryonic development. Circuit breaking analysis identified a small subset of Tutl-positive neurons that are involved in the {{adjustment of}} <b>moving</b> <b>direction.</b> Conclusion We identify Tutl and a small subset of CNS neurons in modulating directional change in response to gentle touch. This study presents an excellent starting point for further dissection of molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling directional adjustment after mechanical stimulation. </p...|$|E
