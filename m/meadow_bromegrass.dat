40|$|Bromegrass species (Bromus) {{can produce}} high forage yields under the short growing season of western Canada and have {{excellent}} nutritive value. Smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus riparius Rehm.) {{are the most}} commonly cultivated bromegrass species. Hybrid bromegrass (B. riparius X B. inermis) was developed in Canada by hybridizing smooth and <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass.</b> Regrowth potential differs among these three bromegrass species, but the morphological and physiological basis for these differences is unclear. Regrowth characteristics of three bromegrass species following defoliation to 5 cm at the vegetative and stem elongation stages of growth were studied {{in the field and}} greenhouse. Above-and below-ground dry matter production, leaf area index (LAI) development, individual leaf area expansion, leaf-to-stem ratio, photosynthetic rate, tiller and axillary bud development, etiolated regrowth, and nitrogen concentration in stem bases were evaluated. Regrowth was similar among the three species when defoliated at the vegetative stage. <b>Meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> consistently produced more (P¡Ü 0. 05) above-and below-ground dry matter than smooth bromegrass following defoliation at the stem elongation stage, while that of hybrid bromegrass was generally intermediate to the other two species. Individual leaf photosynthetic rates did not differ among the three species. Individual leaf area expansion rate was faster (P¡Ü 0. 05) in smooth bromegrass than meadow and hybrid bromegrass. LAI of the three bromegrass species increased linearly with days of regrowth (r 2 ¡Ý 0. 88, P¡Ü 0. 05), and the increase was greatest in <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass,</b> intermediate in hybrid bromegrass, and least in smooth bromegrass in all stages of defoliation. Similarly, the leaf-to-stem ratio was highest in <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass,</b> intermediate in hybrid bromegrass, and lowest in smooth bromegrass following all defoliations. Defoliation at the vegetative stage had no effect (P¡Ý 0. 05) on tiller development relative to the undefoliated treatment, whereas tiller development was negatively affected by defoliation at the stem elongation stage. After 60 days of regrowth, final tiller density was greatest in <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass,</b> intermediate in hybrid bromegrass, and least in smooth bromegrass in the field. A lower proportion of tillers in <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> reached the reproductive stage compared to the other two species. The final tiller density following defoliation was similar among species in the greenhouse. Total buds tiller- 1 and elongated buds tiller- 1 were similar (P¡Ý 0. 05) among three species following defoliation at each growth stage; however, defoliation at stem elongation stage visually delayed bud development. Etiolated regrowth was greater in meadow and hybrid bromegrass (P¡Ü 0. 05) than smooth bromegrass 10 days after defoliation, but was similar thereafter. Concentration of N in stem bases was similar among species, but decreased with advancing maturity. Rapid regrowth of <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> appears to be associated with more tillers, rapid remobilization of organic reserves during early regrowth, and allocation of more biomass to leaf tissue than to stems compared to the other two bromegrasses. Variation in regrowth among the species was not associated with expansion of individual leaf area, photosynthetic rates, total organic reserve remobilization, or nitrogen concentration in stem bases. Based on these characteristics, <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> is the most suitable species for grazing, and smooth bromegrass the least suitable...|$|E

40|$|<b>Meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus riparius Rehm.) is a {{recently}} introduced pasture grass in western Canada. Its leafy production and rapid regrowth {{have made it}} a major grass species for pasturing beef animals in this region. As relatively little breeding {{work has been done}} on this species, there is little information on its breeding behaviour. The main objective {{of this study was to}} estimate total genetic variability, broad-sense heritability, phenotypic and genetic correlations. Forty-four <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> clones were evaluated for agronomic characters. Genetic variation for dry matter yield, seed yield, fertility index, harvest index, plant height, plant spread, crude protein, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, was significant. Broad-sense heritability estimates exceeded 50 % for all characters. Heritability estimates were at least 3. 5 times greater than their standard errors. Phenotypic and genetic correlation between all possible characters were measured. There was general agreement in both sign and magnitude between genetic and phenotypic correlations. Correlations between the different characters demonstrated that it is possible to simultaneously improve seed and forage yield. Based on the results, it appears that the development of higher yielding cultivars with higher crude protein, and lower acid and neutral detergent fibers concentration should be possible...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted during 2005 and 2006 to evaluate five perennial grass species for forage yield and quality, steer performance and grazing capacity, animal intake, plant energy reserves and economic return under grazed conditions.

Its leafy production and rapid regrowth {{have made it}} {{the most widely used}} grass species for pasturing beef animals in this region. As relatively little breeding work has been done on this species, there is little information on its breeding behaviour. The main objective {{of this study was to}} estimate genetic parameters and assess breeding methodologies for <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass.</b> Forty-four <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> genotypes from the three available cultivars and forty half-sib (polycross (PX) and open-pollinated (OP)) and selfed (S 1) progenies were evaluated for morphological and agronomic characters, and molecular (RAPD) markers. Genetic variation for total biological yield, head weight, seed yield, harvest index, height, growth habit, spread, and volume was significant in the OP and S 1 tests. Genetic variation estimates for dry matter yield were negative (PX), not significant (OP), or moderate (S 1). Estimated geneticvariation for quality traits and those characters which were visually evaluated was not significant, except for growth habit (OP and S 1) and acid-detergent fiber (ADF) (S 1). Among progeny lines, RAPD marker variation found in the half-sib progenies accounted for about 15 % of the total variation. In the S 1 test the variation among progeny lines was twice that of the half-sib progenies. Correlations between the different characters demonstrated that is possible to simultaneously improve both seed and forage yield. Since leafiness was found to be correlated with dry matter yield but not with seed yield it may be possible to simultaneously improve all three characters. Rankings of progenies by the half-sib tests for forage and seed yield were not changed by the use of the synthetic parental value (SVi) which includes information from selfed progeny. The PX progeny test did not discriminate parents as well as the OP and S 1 tests, which may be due to non-random pollination in the polycross. The S 1 progeny test showed the highest predicted response to selection, followed by the OP test. Heritability estimates from the OP and S 1 tests for total biological yield, seed yield, harvest index, and height, were similar to those found in the clonal evaluation test. Therefore, a clonal evaluation test will provide sufficient information to choose parents for breeding an improved synthetic cultivar for these characters. Observed dissimilarity of ranking of progeny lines over progeny tests for some traits (head weight, seed yield, and harvest index) was due to discrepancies between the PX and OP tests. No differences in progeny line ranking among the progeny tests were observed for all other traits. Analysis of variance on marker frequency means showed that interaction between genotypes and progeny lines was also not significant...|$|E
40|$|<b>Meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus riparius Rehm.) is an {{important}} forage grass in western Canada. Economical seed production is critical to its use. Seed yield usually declines rapidly after two to three seed crops. Field and growth chamber experiments were conducted to {{determine the influence of}} (a) residue removal and N fertilization on tiller density and size, panicle density, silvertop incidence, seed yield and stand longevity, (b) filler size and stand age on panicle production, and (c) daylength and temperature during primary and secondary induction on panicle production. Removing residue after harvest and applying N (100 kg ha- 1) increased yield from 200 to 450 kg ha- 1 compared to not removing residue or adding N in the second seed crop. The difference between treated and untreated plots was only 30 to 90 kg ha- 1 in the third seed crop. The increase was related to an increase in panicle production, however, the correlation between panicle number and seed yield was low. Silvertop incidence (% of panicles affected) increased as the stand aged, but removing residue after harvest reduced silvertop. In pot studies, the percentage of plants that produced panicles increased as tiller basal diameter increased from one mm to three mm, regardless of the age of the stand. However, fewer large tillers were observed in older stands. Large tillers from a four-yr-old stand produced fewer particles than large tillers from a two-yr-old stand indicating that tiller size alone is not responsible for the decline in panicle production. Panicle production increased as the temperature during primary induction decreased. However, daylength during primary induction had no effect on panicle production. Varying temperature or daylength during secondary induction had no effect on panicle production; panicles were produced in 85 % of plants regardless of temperature, and 67 to 77 % of the plants regardless of daylength. In conclusion, residue removal after harvest and N fertilization improve seed yield in young <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> stands. However, these practices were not effective in prolonging seed yield beyond two to three seed crops. Drought, winter injury, competition amongst tillers and silvertop incidence all play a role in reducing seed production...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{varieties}} and a commercial mix of perennial cool-season grasses were planted in four replicated plots in two counties in southwestern Kansas to evaluate yield and adaptability when produced under irrigation. The varieties were smooth bromegrass, ‘Slate’ intermediate and ‘Hycrest’ crested wheatgrass, ‘Kentucky 31 ’ and ‘Max-Q®’ tall fescue, ‘Profile’ orchardgrass, ‘Hykor’ festulolium, and ‘Dixon®’ and ‘Lakota®’ matua grass. The mix was Sharp Brothers’ ‘Pasture Mix # 6 ®’, {{a blend of}} smooth bromegrass, ‘Regar’ <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass,</b> Slate, Profile, and ‘Garrison’ creeping foxtail. Grasses were planted in September 2002. Forage samples were collected {{in the spring and}} fall of 2003 and 2004 to measure dry matter content and yield. Fall 2003 samples were not collected at Stevens County because calves grazed them. The greatest grazing preference was for orchardgrass. The least preferred was crested wheatgrass. Spring cuttings yielded less forage than expected in Ford County in 2004 and in Stevens in both years due to dry winters and higher than normal spring temperatures in 2004. Annual dry matter yields ranged from 10, 565 to 13, 694 lb per acre in Ford County during 2003, 5661 to 9032 lb per acre in Ford in 2004, and 6189 to 14, 552 lb per acre in Stevens County in 2004. The consistently highest-producing grasses for both years were the fescues, intermediate wheatgrass, orchardgrass, and the pasture mix. The matuas had high yields in Ford County during 2003, but winter kill reduced the other spring yields. However, new grass plants from a high 2003 and 2004 seed production improved fall 2004 matua yields. The overall lowest-producing grass was crested wheatgrass...|$|E
40|$|Experiences {{early in}} life {{influence}} preferences for the forages which animals eat as adults, but {{little is known about}} how such experiences affect forage intake and digestibility. We hypothesized that experience with high fiber (HF) diets in utero enables cattle to better utilize HF diets by enhancing intake and digestibility of HF diets. We exposed cows to either HF or low fiber (LF) diets from October 20 until parturition on March 15. The HF diet was primarily ammoniated wheat straw (AWS), while the LF diet was mainly grass hay (700 g/kg orchardgrass and 300 g/kg <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass).</b> The two diets were iso-net energy (NEm), isonitrogenous, and similar in mineral and vitamin contents, but they varied 10 -fold in neutral detergent soluble carbohydrates. Following weaning, the 8 mo old calves from mothers fed HF or LF diets during pregnancy were fed AWS and a high fiber supplement, and dry matter (DM) intake and digestibility were measured during the last half of a 40 d experiment (i. e., 26 d adaptation, 14 d measured DM intake, 5 d measured DM digestibility). Intake (5. 6 versus 5. 3 kg/d; P= 0. 04) and digestibility (545 versus 523 g/kg; P= 0. 03) of AWS were higher for calves fed HF than for those fed LF diets. As a result, digestible DM intake of AWS was higher for HF than LF (3. 1 versus 2. 8 kg/d; P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Calves fed HF diets ate more straw as a proportion of their diet than did calves fed LF (733 versus 723 g/kg; P= 0. 05). Total digestible DM intake (i. e., AWS + supplement) was higher for calves fed HF than LF diets (4. 7 versus 4. 4 kg/d; P 3 ̆c 0. 01), as was total diet DM digestibility (613 versus 600 g/kg; P= 0. 07). Calves were weighed {{at the conclusion of the}} DM intake and digestibility measurement periods, and then fed an AWS/processed wheat middlings diet for an addition 28 d to determine daily gain. Collectively, increases in intake and digestibility affected body weight gains such that HF diet fed calves numerically gained more than LF fed calves even during this short period (0. 45 versus 0. 41 kg/d; P= 0. 13). Higher DDM intake is likely important for pregnant cows and their offspring which winter for many months under extensive range conditions on dormant forages where their NEm requirements are marginally satisfied. These effects on offspring, further magnified by experiences with their mothers {{early in life}}, make cows and their progeny better adapted to using dormant forages during winter...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} at three different sites in Saskatchewan, Canada (Colonsay, Vanscoy and Rosthern) {{over two years}} (2005 and 2006) {{to determine the effect}} of dribble banded and coulter injected liquid fertilizer applied in the spring of 2005 at 56, 112 and 224 kg N ha- 1 with and without P at 28 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1. A similar study was conducted in 2006 at one site in Mongolia to determine the effect of granular N and P fertilizer application on dry matter yield, and N and P concentration in plant biomass in the year of application (2006) only. The three Saskatchewan sites were unfertilized, 7 - 8 year old stands of mainly <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus riparius) dominated haylands, while the Mongolia site was mixed species of native rangeland. All fertilization treatments produced significantly (p&# 8804; 0. 05) higher dry matter yield than the control in the year of application at the three Saskatchewan sites. The addition of 28 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 P fertilizer along with the N fertilizer did not {{have a significant effect on}} yield in most cases. In the year of application, increasing N rates above 56 kg N ha- 1 did not significantly increase yield over the 56 kg N ha- 1 rate in most cases but did increase N concentration, N uptake and protein content. A significant residual effect was found in the high N rate treatments in 2006, with significantly higher yield and N uptake. In 2005, the forage N and P uptake were in all cases significantly higher than the control in the fertilized treatments. The N uptake at the three Saskatchewan sites increased with increasing N rate up to the high rate of 224 kg N ha- 1, although the percent recovery decreased with increasing rate. The P fertilization with 28 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 also increased P uptake at the three Saskatchewan sites. The site in Mongolia was less responsive to fertilization than the three Saskatchewan sites, with only a significant response in yield, N uptake and no significant effect of P fertilization. For incubation soil cores collected in the fall of 2006, mean respiration rates were similar among the fertilized treatments at all the sites and the pattern of CO 2 and N 2 O evolution measured over a two-week period showed similar trend at the three sites, with no significant difference between treatments. However a significant increase in gas production occured as the soils were wetted during the incubation. By the fall of 2005, the fertilization effect had likely diminished along with available substrate for the soil microbial biomass. Overall, rates of fertilizer of approximately 50 kg N ha- 1 appear to be sufficient to produce nearly maximum yield and protein concentration of the grass in the year of application for the Saskatchewan and Mongolia sites. Surface banding placement was as effective as in soil placement and there was limited response to P fertilization. A small amount of N fertilizer that is surface-placed on these grass dominated forage systems appears to be an effective means of increasing production in the year of application. Higher rates are needed to sustain the rejuvenation beyond one year...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of grazing stockpiled perennial forage in field paddocks relative to feeding similar quality round bale hay in drylot pens on rumen degradation characteristics of forage; beef cow performance, cow reproductive efficiency, estimated dry matter intake and forage utilization, forage yield and quality, soil nutrients and system costs. Winter feeding systems were (i) stockpiled perennial forage (TDN = 58. 9 %; CP = 8. 5 %) grazing (SPF) and (ii) drylot feeding (DL) of round bale hay (TDN = 57. 9 %; CP = 8. 4 %). Experiment I was an in situ study, where five Hereford heifers (398 ± 14 kg) fitted with rumen cannulae were fed a grass hay (DM = 93. 2 %; TDN = 50. 8 %; CP = 9. 8 %; NDF = 66. 2 %) diet. In situ degradability of both stockpiled forage (SPF) and round bale hay (BH) samples collected at start (October) and end (December) of the field study were determined. The soluble fraction (S) of DM was greater (P = 0. 01) in SPF October forage compared to SPF December, BH October and BH December forages. The potentially degradable fraction (D) of CP was lowest (P = 0. 04) in BH December forage than in SPF October, SPF December and BH October forages suggesting that hay quality declined more rapidly than stockpiled forage and method of preservation may have affected overall hay quality. Furthermore, D fraction of both ADF and NDF was higher in SPF samples suggesting stockpiled forage may be more digestible than hay. However, the D fraction of NDF in both SPF and BH forages declined with later sampling date possibly due to effect of weathering and leaf loss. In Experiment II, 6, 4 -ha paddocks consisting of <b>meadow</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus riparius Rehm) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa), were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 replicated (n = 3) winter feeding systems. In this study 58 dry pregnant (120 ± 16 d) Angus cows (675 kg ± 51 kg), stratified by body weight (BW; corrected for conceptus gain), were allocated to either the SPF or DL systems. Cows in winter feeding systems were provided additional energy supplement (rolled barley) (TDN = 86. 4 %; CP = 12. 4 %) depending on environmental conditions to maintain body condition, with no weight gain above that of conceptus growth. Dry matter intake (DMI) and forage utilization were estimated using the herbage weight disappearance method. The effects of winter feeding systems on soil nutrients were determined the following spring after winter grazing. Forage yield in DL (4683 ± 495 kg ha- 1) and SPF (4032 ± 495 kg ha- 1) systems was not different (P = 0. 18) between treatments. However, forage utilization was lower (P 0. 05) between winter feeding systems. Reproductive performance of beef cows was not affected (P > 0. 05) by either winter feeding methods as cows in both systems maintained body condition score (BCS) at 2. 5 to 3. 0 throughout the study. Average total production cost was 19 % lower in SPF system compared to DL system. In conclusion, the rumen degradation characteristics of stockpiled perennial forages focused in this study support the utilization these forages in a winter feeding system to meet the nutrient requirements of dry beef cows in early to mid-gestation. It may be cost effective to manage beef cows in field grazing of stockpiled perennial forages in western Canada, without any negative impact on beef cow performance or reproductive efficiency...|$|E
