5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be little more than an extravagant nail in Price Brothers' coffin. The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interior of the building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1990, {{the company}} had $488 million in assets and $654 million in liabilities. During bankruptcy, the company {{ultimately}} had to address claims for $142 million in back-pay for its striking drivers, and $384 million of pre-bankruptcy debts owed <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> investor group led by Fred G. Currey.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the art department, Bob Bell and Keith Wilson, divided their efforts so that Bell contributed <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film and Wilson to the Series Two episodes. Sets {{constructed}} by Bell especially for Thunderbirds Are Go included the Glenn Field Control Tower and Press Conference Room, the interiors of The Swinging Star, and re-designed versions of various locations on Tracy Island.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, several U.S. Navy {{submarines}} {{were forced}} back to base to repair {{damage caused by}} cookiecutter shark bites to the neoprene boots of their AN/BQR-19 sonar domes, which caused the sound-transmitting oil inside to leak and impaired navigation. An unknown enemy weapon was initially feared, before this shark was identified as the culprit, and the problem was solved by installing fiberglass covers around the domes. In the 1980s, some thirty U.S. Navy submarines were damaged by cookiecutter shark bites, <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Again, the solution was to apply a fiberglass coating. Oceanographic equipment and telecommunications cables have also been damaged by this species.|$|E
5|$|Howard Winchester Hawks {{was born}} in Goshen, Indiana, the first-born child of Frank W. Hawks (1865–1950), a wealthy paper manufacturer, and his wife, Helen (née Howard; 1872–1952), the {{daughter}} of a wealthy industrialist. Hawks's family on his father's side were American pioneers and his ancestor John Hawks had emigrated from England to Massachusetts in 1630. The family eventually settled in Goshen and by the 1890s was one of the wealthiest families in the Midwest, due <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highly profitable Goshen Milling Company.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil. This {{was part of a}} large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to make {{minor changes to the}} film, <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shower scene. In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{won their}} last major trophy in 1973, in a 1–0 victory over Don Revie's Leeds United in the FA Cup Final. A Second Division club at the time, Sunderland {{won the game}} thanks <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> efforts of their goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery, who saved two of Leeds shots at goal in quick succession, one being from hot-shot Peter Lorimer. Ian Porterfield scored a volley in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy. Since 1973 only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have equalled Sunderland's {{achievement}} of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.|$|E

5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as lunisolar precession, as it is due <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Blue Water {{was built to}} house workers and their {{families}} in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation {{and at one point}} had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North End, to make way for expansion of the chemical industry. The village was demolished, and all that remains now is an historical marker at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Avenue. This neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams penned two books about it and was instrumental in the dedication of the plaque.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred {{displaced}} {{more than}} 50families and caused CVE$250million ($2.5million) in damage, <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> agricultural {{and private sectors}} of the Barlavento region. It was the first hurricane {{to move through the}} islands with documented impacts, as well as the nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds. Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{effects from}} the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of Josephine. The center {{was found to have}} shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5-day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid-morning, Josephine re-intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly.|$|E
5|$|From the 16th century, the landowners {{were the}} Carre family, who {{operated}} tight {{control over the}} town, and it grew little in the early modern period. The manor passed from the Carre family to the Hervey family by the marriage of Isabella Carre to John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in 1688. The town's common land and fields were legally enclosed by 1794, giving ownership <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hervey family; this coincided with making the Slea into a canal, and heralded the first steps towards modern industry. The Sleaford Navigation brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. In the 20th century, the sale of farmland around Sleaford by Bristol Estates {{led to the development}} of large housing estates. The subsequent availability of affordable housing combined with the town's educational facilities and low crime rates made it an attractive destination for home-buyers. As a result, the town's population underwent the fastest growth of any town in the county in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1570, the Sultan of Bijapur, Ali Adil Shah I, {{entered into}} an {{alliance}} with the Sultan of Ahmadnagar, Murtaza Nizam Shah, and the Zamorin of Calicut for a simultaneous attack on the Portuguese territories of Goa, Chaul, and Mangalore. He attacked Goa in 1571 and ended Portuguese influence in the region. The Bijapur Sultans were especially renowned for their loathing of Christianity. Fearing persecution, many Goan Catholics fled to South Canara during this second wave of migrations, and settled in Barcoor, Kallianpur, Cundapore, and Basroor. For the next century, there was continual migration of Goan Catholics southwards, so that by 1650, {{a considerable number of}} Catholics were settled around Mangalore, Moolki, Shirva, Pezar, Bantval, Cundapore, Kallianpur, and Kirem. The Christian Goud Saraswat Brahmins who came during this wave belonged <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shenvi subcaste.|$|E

5|$|On {{its first}} advisory, there was {{disagreement}} among forecast models regarding its eventual track, with projected tracks deviating from a Georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea. Alpha {{was also a}} climatological outlier at the time; the NHC HURRAN model, {{which was based on}} previous storms with similar characteristics, found no analogs for the storm. Subtropical Storm Alpha was initially well-defined as it moved southwestward. The very small center was located along {{the eastern edge of the}} convection, while low-level cloud bands formed east of the center. At the time, the temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm, although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months. The winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on May 27, and the heavy rainfall persisted <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and west of the center.|$|E
5|$|Since Roman times, silting {{and land}} {{reclamation}} in the Pevensey Levels {{have pushed the}} coastline out by about , leaving the castle landlocked. The land between the castle and the sea is now a flat marshland drained by a network of ditches and sewers or field drains. The modern village of Pevensey is situated <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the castle, {{at the end of}} the ancient peninsula. Castle Road (the B2191) curves around the Roman north wall and connects Pevensey to the nearby village of Westham. A public footpath crosses the interior of the castle, linking the two villages. An area of reclaimed land, formerly part of the Pevensey tidal lagoon but now marshland and fields crossed by the Eastbourne to Hastings railway line, is situated immediately to the south of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The Great Famine of 1845–1851 devastated Ireland, as {{in those}} years Ireland's {{population}} fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, while an additional two million people emigrated, <b>mostly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States and Canada. By {{the end of the}} decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed {{until the end of the}} 19th century is referred to as the Land War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census. The population has never returned to this level since. The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland (County Leitrim) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so.|$|E
