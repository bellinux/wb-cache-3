5|$|Two sets of <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust {{the direction of the}} pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> not solidly developed.

5000|$|<b>Muscle</b> (myocytes) <b>are</b> {{elongated}} cells {{ranging from}} several millimetres to about 10 centimetres {{in length and}} from 10 to 100 micrometres in width. These cells are joined together in tissues that may be either striated or smooth, depending on the presence or absence, respectively, of organized, regularly repeated arrangements of myofibrillar contractile proteins called myofilaments. Striated <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> further classified as either skeletal or cardiac muscle.

5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cases of}} {{poliomyelitis}} result in only temporary paralysis. Nerve impulses {{return to the}} formerly paralyzed muscle within a month, and recovery is usually complete in six to eight months. The neurophysiological processes involved in recovery following acute paralytic poliomyelitis are quite effective; <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> able to retain normal strength even if half the original motor neurons have been lost. Paralysis remaining after one year {{is likely to be}} permanent, although modest recoveries of muscle strength are possible 12 to 18 months after infection.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long lower leg, an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E

50|$|Smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} non-{{striated}} muscle, and, unlike striated muscle, {{contraction of}} smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> not under conscious control. Smooth muscle may contract spontaneously or rhythmically and be induced {{by a number of}} physiochemical agents (hormones, drugs, neurotransmitters).

5|$|The body of {{the soft}} tick, family Argasidae, is pear-shaped or oval with a rounded {{anterior}} portion. The mouthparts cannot be seen from above as {{they are on the}} ventral surface. The cuticle is leathery; there is often a centrally positioned dorsal plate, with ridges which project slightly above the surrounding surface, but there is no decoration. A pattern of small, circular depressed areas show where <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> attached to the interior of the integument.

5|$|The {{duodenum}} and the jejunum are {{the first}} and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters {{the upper part of the}} mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) {{is short}} and deep. The mental foramen, an opening {{at the front of}} the mandible, just before the first molar, opens to the side.

50|$|The {{third option}} is the pectoralis minor <b>muscle,</b> which <b>is</b> mainly used in children. Advantages of this <b>muscle</b> <b>are</b> its {{relatively}} small size and flat and fan-like shape, obviating {{the need for}} trimming without bulkiness as a result. In addition, the pectoralis minor muscle has a muscle fibre orientation that is much alike with the facial muscles. However, as dissection of this <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> rather difficult and the neurovascular anatomy is variable, nowadays surgeons tend to use it less frequently. Furthermore, the pectoralis minor <b>muscle</b> <b>is</b> not a parallel-fibered <b>muscle,</b> and it <b>is</b> oversized in adults.|$|R
5|$|The panniculus carnosus is a {{layer of}} {{striated}} muscle deep to the panniculus adiposus. Although absent in hominoids, the panniculus carnosus is common in non-hominoid primates and non-primate mammals. In lower mammals {{the area of the}} panniculus carnosus can be extensive, almost covering the entire body {{in the case of the}} short-beaked echidna. Several human <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> considered discrete muscles originating from the panniculus carnosus, and some researchers classify the axillary arch as a sporadic vestigial muscle of this type.|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> {{located in}} the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve.

Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
5|$|These <b>muscles</b> <b>are</b> {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The {{left and right}} genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue.

The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, {{involved in}} the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E
