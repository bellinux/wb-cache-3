40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} {{anomalous}} transmittance in the EUV spectral region is considered theoretically. The effect consists in a resonant enhancement of the transmittance of a periodic multilayer structure {{compared with that of}} a uniform film.

The important geometric {{feature of the}} filters, which SU 8 is able to increase, is {{the thickness of the}} cross-shaped micromachined slots. This is five times its width. This thickness offers an extra degree of control over the resonance characteristics. The large thickness not only strengthens the structures, but also enhances the resonance quality factor (Q-factor).

40|$|Optical {{absorption}} losses {{limit the}} efficiency of thin-film solar cells. We demonstrate how to increase the absorption in hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cells by using a directionally selective optical <b>multilayer</b> <b>filter</b> covering the front glass. The filter transmits perpendicularly incident photons in the wavelength range 350 nm - 770 nm. In the regime of low absorptance, i. e. large optical absorption lengths, however, it blocks those photons impinging under oblique angles. Thus, the incoming radiation is transmitted with almost no loss while the emitted radiation is mostly blocked due to its wider angle distribution. We determine the enhancement in the optical path length from reflectivity measurements. In the weakly absorbing high wavelength range (650 nm - 770 nm) we observe a peak optical path length enhancement of 3. 5. The effective path length enhancement calculated from the external quantum efficiency of the solar cell with filter, however, peaks at a lo wer value of only 1. 5 in the same wavelength range.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} demonstration {{of a novel}} type of narrowband and wavelength-tunable multilayer transmission filter for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region. The operating principle of the filter is based on spatially overlapping the nodes of a standing wave field with the absorbing layers within the multilayer structure. For a wavelength with a matching node pattern, this increases the transmission as compared to neighboring wavelengths where anti-nodes overlap with the absorbing layers. Using Ni/Si multilayers where Ni provides strong absorption, we demonstrate the proper working of such anomalous transmission filter. The demonstration is carried out at the example of 13. 5 nm wavelength and at normal incidence, providing a 0. 27 nm-wide transmission peak. We also demonstrate wavelength tunability by operating the same Ni/Si filter at different wavelengths by varying the angle of incidence. As the <b>multilayer</b> <b>filter</b> is directly deposited on the active area of an EUV-sensitive photodiode, this provides an extremely compact device for easy spectral monitoring in the EUV.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is described to couple light from high-power blue LEDs (1 x 1 mm 2) into a thin large area light guide using a dielectric interference multilayer as an angular filter. The {{goal is to}} achieve large area luminaires such as backlight systems. The method overcomes the drawback of structuring holes or recessions in light guides when using a system with side-emitting LEDs. Several new LED-masking filters {{have been designed to}} improve the polarization dependency and coupling efficiency from a previous design that used a stack of inorganic bi-layers. Firstly, a polymeric multilayer manages to increase the coupling efficiency from 52 % to 69 %. Secondly, a birefringent <b>multilayer</b> <b>filter</b> enables to fully suppress the Brewster’s angle effect and to realize identical behaviour for both s- and p- polarized light at large angles. Thirdly, by adding layers of a third inorganic material to the original bi-layer stack with refractive index in between the other two, the transmittance equality is improved and the coupling efficiency can reach up to 63 %. A novel angular filter is proposed for a large area planar collimating luminaire. A planar collimator of 2 x 18 o cone angle with scalable and simplified structure is demonstrated.

40|$|In this research, novel meta {{material}} structures {{based on}} microstrip integrated circuit technology {{have been investigated}} for filter application {{in the next generation}} of microwave wireless communication systems. A number of novel microstrip planar filter structures have been developed that are able to meet the stringent requirements for high-performance systems and subsystems, such as sharp-cutoff frequency response, low passband insertion-loss and high return-Joss, high out-af-band rejection, compact size, low cost and ease of integration. The filters are approximately 70 % smaller than their conventional counterparts. Analysis and mathematical modeling of these microstrip devices involved the use of transmission-line theory and EM simulation tools which were based on the method of moments and finite element analyses. Measured results were used to validate the predicted behavior and performance of these devices. In fact there was good agreement with the theory and simulation modeling. A Composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial unit-cell whose ground-plane is defected with a rectangular dielectric slot was used to develop a single and multi-pole bandpass filters. The unit-cell comprises of serial inter-digital capacitors whose junction is connected to a short-circuited inductive stub. By defecting the ground-plane of the unit-cell 's structure with a dielectric slot, which is located immediately below the unit-cell, enables substantial tuning of the filter's centre frequency in the order of 26. 5 %. This was achieved with minimal effect on the unitcell's insertion- and return-loss performance as well as its selectivity. The filters were fabricated on conventional dielectric substrate and their performance measured to verify the design methodology. The proposed technique eases the trade-off constraints that plague conventional filter designs and makes possible the realization of challenging filter specifications constituted from CRLH unit-cells using distributed transmission-lines. A novel multilayer technique is presented that enables (i) the control of the filter's bandwidth, (ii) significantly improves its passband selectivity, and (iii) enhances its out-of-band rejection without affecting the filter's overall dimensions. The technique involves implementation of identical filter structures {{on both sides of the}} dielectric substrate that are interconnected through vias. The filter circuit is laid on top of another identical substrate with a ground-plane. This structure results in a device that exhibits a sharp selectivity that is substantially smaller than traditional filter constructions. The sharpness of the filter is due to the upper and lower transmission zeros present on either side of the filter's passband being shifted closer together which causes reduction in its bandwidth. This effect is opposite to that encountered in conventional <b>multilayer</b> <b>filter</b> structures. It is shown the filter's bandwidth can be controlled while maintaining a good passband insertion- and return-loss performance, i. e. 10 dB, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed filter is relatively easy to fabricate using conventional technology. A diplexer was developed based on the proposed multilayer technique and was shown to yield a high out-af-band rejection and high isolation between the two very closely spaced channels. Normally isolators are used to provide isolation between channels in order to prevent inter-channel interference. The technique is relatively simple to realize and cost effective to manufacture. Design methodology and experimental results are presented that show good correlation between the measured and simulation results. This diplexer should find application in multi band wireless communication systems. A triplexer deSign is also presented whose multiband performance was created using CRLH unit-cell structures. The three passband channels of the triplexer have a common input splitter and transmission-line matching network is used to ensure high isolation between the channels is maintained in order to prevent undesired interaction between the channels which would otherwise adversely affect the triplexer's passband response. This was achieved using stepped impedance lines (SIL). No isolators were necessary using the proposed technique. It is also shown that by curving the SIL can provide enhancement in the triplexer's loss performance, bandwidth, and suppression of high order spurii. The design analysis and performance of the triplexer was verified via fabrication and measurement. A novel compact microstrip wideband bandpass filter was presented for wideband application that possesses good insertion- and return-loss, sharp frequency selectivity and high out-of-band rejection. The proposed filter comprises of two inter-digital capacitors with four inductive stubs. It employs a T-shaped open stub that is inserted between the symmetrical unitcell structures.

Challenges associated with obtaining visibility of objects have been difficult to overcome due to the physical properties of the medium. In the last two decades, sonar is usually used for the detection and recognition of targets in the ocean or underwater environment. However, because of the low quality of images by sonar imaging, optical vision sensors are then used instead of it for short range identification. Optical imaging provides short-range, high-resolution visual information of the ocean floor. However, due to the light transmission’s physical properties in the water medium, the optical imaged underwater images are usually performance as poor visibility. Light is highly attenuated when it travels in the ocean. Consequence, the imaged scenes result as poorly contrasted and hazy-like obstructions. The underwater imaging processing techniques are important {{to improve the quality of}} underwater images. As mentioned before, underwater images have poor visibility because of the medium scattering and light distortion. In contrast to common photographs, underwater optical images suffer from poor visibility owing to the medium, which causes scattering, color distortion, and absorption. Large suspended particles cause scattering similar to the scattering of light in fog or turbid water that contain many suspended particles. Color distortion occurs because different wavelengths are attenuated to different degrees in water; consequently, images of ambient in the underwater environments are dominated by a bluish tone, because higher wavelengths are attenuated more quickly. Absorption of light in water substantially reduces its intensity. The random attenuation of light causes a hazy appearance as the light backscattered by water along the line of sight considerably degrades image contrast. Especially, objects at a distance of more than 10 meters from the observation point are almost unreadable because colors are faded as characteristic wavelengths, which are filtered according to the distance traveled by light in water. So, traditional image processing methods are not suitable for processing them well. This thesis proposes strategies and solutions to tackle the above mentioned problems of underwater survey systems. In this thesis, we contribute image pre-processing, denoising, dehazing, inhomogeneities correction, color correction and fusion technologies for underwater image quality improvement. The main content of this thesis is as follows. First, comprehensive reviews of the current and most prominent underwater imaging systems are provided in Chapter 1. A main features and performance based classification criterion for the existing systems is presented. After that, by analyzing the challenges of the underwater imaging systems, a hardware based approach and non-hardware based approach is introduced. In this thesis, we are concerned about the image processing based technologies, which are one of the non-hardware approaches, and take most recent methods to process the low quality underwater images. As the different sonar imaging systems applied in much equipment, such as side-scan sonar, multi-beam sonar. The different sonar acquires different images with different characteristics. Side-scan sonar acquires high quality imagery of the seafloor with very high spatial resolution but poor locational accuracy. On the contrast, multi-beam sonar obtains high precision position and underwater depth in seafloor points. In order to fully utilize all information of these two types of sonars, it is necessary to fuse the two kinds of sonar data in Chapter 2. Considering the sonar image forming principle, for the low frequency curvelet coefficients, we use the maximum local energy method to calculate the energy of two sonar images. For the high frequency curvelet coefficients, we take absolute maximum method as a measurement. The main attributes are: firstly, the multi-resolution analysis method is well adapted the cured-singularities and point-singularities. It is useful for sonar intensity image enhancement. Secondly, maximum local energy is well performing the intensity sonar images, which can achieve perfect fusion result [42]. In Chapter 3, as analyzed the underwater laser imaging system, a Bayesian Contourlet Estimator of Bessel K Form (BCE-BKF) based denoising algorithm is proposed. We take the BCE-BKF probability density function (PDF) to model neighborhood of contourlet coefficients. After that, according to the proposed PDF model, we design a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator, which relies on a Bayesian statistics representation of the contourlet coefficients of noisy images. The denoised laser images have better contrast than the others. There are three obvious virtues of the proposed method. Firstly, contourlet transform decomposition prior to curvelet transform and wavelet transform by using ellipse sampling grid. Secondly, BCE-BKF model is more effective in presentation of the noisy image contourlet coefficients. Thirdly, the BCE-BKF model takes full account of the correlation between coefficients [107]. In Chapter 4, we describe a novel method to enhance underwater images by dehazing. In underwater optical imaging, absorption, scattering, and color distortion are three major issues in underwater optical imaging. Light rays traveling through water are scattered and absorbed according to their wavelength. Scattering is caused by large suspended particles that degrade optical images captured underwater. Color distortion occurs because different wavelengths are attenuated to different degrees in water; consequently, images of ambient underwater environments are dominated by a bluish tone. Our key contribution is to propose a fast image and video dehazing algorithm, to compensate the attenuation discrepancy along the propagation path, and to take the influence of the possible presence of an artificial lighting source into consideration [108]. In Chapter 5, we describe a novel method of enhancing underwater optical images or videos using guided <b>multilayer</b> <b>filter</b> and wavelength compensation. In certain circumstances, we need to immediately monitor the underwater environment by disaster recovery support robots or other underwater survey systems. However, due to the inherent optical properties and underwater complex environment, the captured images or videos are distorted seriously. Our key contributions proposed include a novel depth and wavelength based underwater imaging model to compensate for the attenuation discrepancy along the propagation path and a fast guided multilayer filtering enhancing algorithm. The enhanced images are characterized by a reduced noised level, better exposure of the dark regions, and improved global contrast where the finest details and edges are enhanced significantly [109]. The performance of the proposed approaches and the benefits are concluded in Chapter 6. Comprehensive experiments and extensive comparison with the existing related techniques demonstrate the accuracy and effect of our proposed methods. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 367 号　学位授与年月日:平成 26 年 3 月 25 日CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION|CHAPTER 2 MULTI-SOURCE IMAGES FUSION|CHAPTER 3 LASER IMAGES DENOISING|CHAPTER 4 OPTICAL IMAGE DEHAZING|CHAPTER 5 SHALLOW WATER DE-SCATTERING|CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSIONS九州工業大学平成 25 年...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a stacked spiral resonator (SSR) structure for designing very compact multiband bandpass filters. The resonant frequencies {{of the proposed}} SSR structure can be determined by designing the spiral geometry and controlling the mutual coupling in a stacked structure. The multiple passband bandwidths can then {{be determined by the}} spacing of different layer patterns between two coupled SSRs. An adequately designed geometry of the input/output resonator with a tapped-line feed can achieve matching conditions for all passbands simultaneously. Moreover, multiple transmission zeros created on both sides of each passband provide high stopband roll-off rates.

This paper compares {{the capabilities of}} the plasma assisted reactive magnetron sputtering (PARMS) process with the compound-assisted reactive sputtering process (CARS). Compared with FARMS, CARS exhibited superior process accuracy, stability and uniformity by being less sensitive to equipment and process temperatures, and to cathode and machine conditioning. A uniformity deviation of less than +/- 0. 15 % is demonstrated for different optical <b>multilayer</b> <b>filters</b> over substrates of 200 mm diameter.
