50|$|Proteins <b>without</b> <b>signal</b> {{peptides}} {{can also}} be secreted by unconventional mechanisms. E.g. Interleukin, Galectin. The process by which such secretory proteins {{gain access to the}} cell exterior is termed unconventional protein secretion (UPS). In plants, even 50% of secreted proteins can be UPS dependent.|$|R

40|$|Promoter binding by TraR and LuxR, the {{activators}} of two bacterial quorum-sensing systems, requires their cognate acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) signals, but {{the role}} the signal plays in activating these transcription factors is not known. Soluble active TraR, when purified from cells grown with the acyl-HSL, contained bound signal and was solely in dimer form. However, genetic and cross-linking studies showed that TraR is almost exclusively in monomer form in cells grown <b>without</b> <b>signal.</b> Adding signal resulted in dimerization of the protein in a concentration-dependent manner. In the absence of signal, monomer TraR localized to the inner membrane while growth with the acyl-HSL resulted in the appearance of dimer TraR in the cytoplasmic compartment. Affinity chromatography indicated that the N-terminus of TraR from cells grown <b>without</b> <b>signal</b> is hidden. Analysis of heterodimers formed between TraR and its deletion mutants localized the dimerization domain to a region between residues 49 and 156. We conclude that binding signal drives dimerization of TraR and its release from membranes into the cytoplasm...|$|R

30|$|The {{presented}} procedure targets {{those kinds}} of signal processing systems whose processing functionality is based on input signals. This means that systems <b>without</b> <b>signal</b> inputs cannot be verified based on the procedure.

50|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{stations}} between Cowbridge and Aberthaw Low Level, St Mary Church Road was underused from the outset. The signal box was closed in 1900 and the station was <b>without</b> <b>signals</b> from then on. The loop was retained as a siding and new ground-frames were added to control it.|$|R
50|$|Trains {{must stop}} here {{to wait for}} visual or verbal signal to proceed. Found on lightly-used lines where {{telephone}} block operation (<b>without</b> <b>signals)</b> is in force and at double-tracked lines at the left track at the entry to a station if no other signal is installed; it effectively replaces a station's entry signal.|$|R
25|$|The {{rules of}} {{operation}} of the Sheffield Supertram {{are similar to those}} of a traditional railway. Unlike normal trains, tramways can be operated <b>without</b> <b>signalling,</b> although block signalling is sometimes necessary on single-line sections. The trams are driven on a line-of-sight basis, so that the tram can be stopped if an obstruction is spotted ahead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 【Objective 】 The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to successfully express the Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxin receptor protein located on internal membrane of larval midgut of cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera Hübner), within eukaryotic expression system. 【Method 】 PCR method was used to separately amplify the fragments <b>without</b> <b>signal</b> peptide of Aminopeptidase N 1 gene from midguts of susceptible and resistant H. armigera, and separately cloned into pUC 19 vector. After sequencing the gene, the fragments encoding for APN 1 <b>without</b> <b>signal</b> peptide were cloned into the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system transfer vector pFastBacHTB under the polyhedron gene promoter. The recombinant transposing plasmid pFastBacHTB/APN 1 was screened and then transformed into E scherichia coli DH 10 Bac. It was cultured in LB plate which contained Te, Kan, Ge, X-gal and IPTG. The resulting recombinant bacmid was transfected into cells of the insect Trichoplusia ni (Tn) and recombinant baculovirus was obtained...|$|R

40|$|Retrodirective arrays, when {{illuminated}} by an interrogator signal, transmit a sig-nal {{back towards the}} interrogator {{in the same direction}} as the incoming <b>signal,</b> <b>without</b> any prior knowledge of the source direction. With a retrodirective array the system efficiently transmits a <b>signal</b> <b>without</b> any digital <b>signal</b> processing. The added feature of being frequency autonomous allows it to transmit back at the same frequency as the incoming <b>signal,</b> <b>without</b> knowing the exact source frequency as well. The system is modelled using a system simulator from Elanix, SystemView Simulink. The system shows good retrodirectivity at various frequencies...|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of this design over the standard distant signal of the Reichsbahn was that it displayed a clearly visible signal aspect in each position. As a result, it did not need a distant signal board (Vorsignaltafel). This was hesitantly retrofitted by the Reichsbahn from 1936. After the Second World War, however, distant <b>signals</b> <b>without</b> <b>signal</b> boards could still be found in Bavaria.|$|R
