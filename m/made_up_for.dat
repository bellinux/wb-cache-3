5|$|Shed Light’s Second phase {{eventually}} {{turned out}} {{to be based on the}} B-57. B-57 aircraft had already been deployed to southeast Asia and had been the subject of initial sensor evaluations under Tropic Moon II. Tropic Moon III was envisioned as an SCNA that <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the gross shortcomings of Tropic Moon I and II.|$|E
5|$|A set of Lambert's clothes, {{together}} with his armchair, walking stick, riding crop and prayer book, are on permanent display at the Newarke Houses Museum in Leicester. Stamford Museum exhibited a tailor's dummy, dressed with Daniel Lambert's clothes {{as if they are}} being <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> him, plus his hat and a portrait. The Daniel Lambert pub in Ludgate Hill no longer exists, and the memorabilia formerly displayed there are now on permanent display at the George Hotel in Stamford. The Daniel Lambert pub in Stamford has also closed.|$|E
5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. He <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness. Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{losses are}} given at Evere as 32 fighters, 22 {{twin-engine}} aircraft and 13 four-engine aircraft destroyed, plus another nine single, six twin and one four-engine aircraft damaged. In total, II./JG 26 losses included 13 Fw 190s destroyed and two damaged. Nine of its pilots were missing; five {{were killed and}} four captured. III./JG 26 lost six Bf 109s and four pilots. Only {{one of them was}} captured, the remainder were killed. The amount of damage the Germans inflicted <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the losses; the Evere strike was a success.|$|E
5|$|Bowling as a {{participation}} sport {{flourished in}} the early 1960s, but its popularity was diluted due to overbuilding; the number of bowling alleys sanctioned by the then-American Bowling Congress peaked at about 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was {{one of more than}} 30 in southern California alone. A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the customer base remained steady because an increase in open bowling <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> fewer league bowlers.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut fumbled {{the ball}} for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think I've ever <b>made</b> <b>up</b> {{anything}} <b>for</b> print," [...] said Kipps; [...] "----ever. I'd have a thundering good try, though, if ever I got a chance. I would that! I've written window tickets often enough. <b>Made</b> 'em <b>up</b> and everything. But that's different." ...|$|R
50|$|Born {{with a heart}} defect, she {{suffered}} from cardiac problems which hampered her growth. She underwent open cardiac surgery when she was 13, and she <b>made</b> <b>up</b> quickly <b>for</b> her growth delay. She stands 1.78 m (5' 10") tall.|$|R

5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and staying on his feet. Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and reluctance to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the suggestion that he didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent crosser of the ball when he did venture forward. He scored his first professional goal during his 59th game. By comparison, Gibbs' long-term successor at right-back, Lloyd Doyley, scored his first professional goal on his 269th appearance.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar {{was not a}} disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of the}} JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the loss of the town.|$|E
5|$|McNamara showed {{early on}} {{that he was a}} clutch performer, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82-80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February. In a March game at Georgetown, McNamara missed a free-throw with 10 seconds left that allowed the Hoyas to force {{overtime}}. Until that point, McNamara had been a perfect 41-for-41 in conference play. However, McNamara <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his miss, hitting two 3-pointers and adding another jumper in an 11-3 run to start overtime as Syracuse beat Mike Sweetney and the Georgetown Hoyas, 93-84. Ten of McNamara's 22 came in the extra frame.|$|E
6000|$|Patty {{gazed at}} the dress with horror-stricken eyes. [...] "Caroline Lea, that is your organdie! And you've gone and <b>made</b> it <b>up</b> <b>for</b> me! Carry Lea, {{what are you going}} to wear to the wedding?" ...|$|R

5|$|Vainio {{returned}} to {{teaching in the}} early 1970s. Vainio <b>made</b> <b>up</b> nicknames <b>for</b> all his pupils, who in return called him Junnu. He {{had a habit of}} coming up with very unorthodox methods of punishment but in general got on well with his pupils.|$|R
5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
5|$|Overall wages rose {{much more}} slowly {{throughout}} the period than planned: wages across the entire state (not only industrial wages) rose by 22.9 percent between 1959 and 1965, against a plan for growth of 26 percent. Wage rises during the reform were <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> by increases in industrial productivity. For example, in the RSFSR (Russia) wages rose by 7 percent between 1959 and 1962, whilst productivity increased by some 20 percent.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{had trouble}} moving {{the ball at}} first, but were helped by a 15-yard {{personal}} foul penalty against Virginia Tech that gave them a first down. Weiss completed a pass that gave the Falcons another first down and drove Air Force inside Tech territory. On the first play within Hokie territory, Weiss fumbled the ball, but fell {{on it for a}} loss, and Air Force retained possession. Weiss <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his fumble two plays later when he scrambled for a first down that kept the drive going. Despite that effort, Tech was able to force a stop and Air Force punted with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{suspects}} have the letters S and W or M in their initials and the intention was that several [...] "obvious" [...] suspects could be eliminated by the letters. Several characters already had names with those initials, but some were <b>made</b> <b>up</b> specifically <b>for</b> this episode.|$|R
60|$|Rawdon minor had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> {{his face}} <b>for</b> a {{tremendous}} howl--the {{severity of the}} blow indeed authorized that indulgence; but {{just as he was}} going to begin, the father interposed.|$|R
5|$|The {{music for}} Soma Bringer was {{composed}} and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, whose previous notable work included titles such as Chrono Trigger, Xenogears, Chrono Cross, and Xenosaga Episode I. Mitsuda was involved {{from the very}} beginning of development, as Takahashi did not want to work on a game without Mitsuda's music. Mitsuda accepted due to their past work on Xenogears and Xenosaga, considering it a kind of reunion. Mitsuda's music formed a key part in compensating for the lack of proper cutscenes, as the music <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> any lack in dramatic character movement during story sequences.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli looked to be in trouble with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea faced Greek side Olympiacos in {{the first}} {{knockout}} round. The first leg in Athens ended in a 0–0 draw, but a 3–0 win in the second leg, with goals from Michael Ballack, Frank Lampard and Salomon Kalou, saw Chelsea through to the quarter-finals. There, they were drawn against Fenerbahçe of Turkey. The first leg {{was held at the}} Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul, and ended in a 2–1 defeat, as Deivid <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> an early own goal by scoring the winner nine minutes from time after Colin Kazim-Richards' equaliser. Chelsea won the second leg at Stamford Bridge 2–0, with goals from Ballack and Lampard, to claim a 3–2 aggregate victory over the Turkish side.|$|E

25|$|After {{more than}} 30 years of not {{speaking}} to each other, Suzanne Somers and Joyce DeWitt finally <b>made</b> <b>up</b> and reunited <b>for</b> Suzanne's web series Breaking Through which aired February 2, 2012.|$|R
5|$|In Cleveland, the Bears started strong after Demontre Hurst intercepted Brian Hoyer's pass, {{which led}} to Robbie Gould's field goal, {{followed}} by Jordan Palmer's touchdown pass to Joseph Anderson, which Cleveland retaliated with James Michael-Johnson intercepting Trent Edwards and scoring. Late in the game, the Bears led 16–9, and Sherrick McManis intercepted Hoyer, who <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the pick by throwing a touchdown pass to Dan Gronkowski. Later, Armonty Bryant forced Harvey Unga to fumble, which was recovered by Cleveland's L. J. Foyt, {{which led to}} Spencer Lanning kicking the go-ahead field goal to put the Browns up 18–16. With {{a little over a}} minute left in the game, Gould missed a 57-yarder wide left, giving Cleveland the win.|$|E
5|$|In the women's event, Germany's Silke Kraushaar {{leads the}} medal count with three, {{one of each}} color. Steffi Martin and Sylke Otto—at 36, the oldest female {{individual}} gold medalist at the Winter Games—are the only lugers with two gold medals in their career. Ortrun Enderlein, representing the Unified Team of Germany, {{was the first woman}} to win the singles event in 1964. She {{was on the verge of}} defending her title at the 1968 Grenoble Games, having the best overall time after all the runs, but was disqualified together with fellow countrywomen Anna-Maria Müller (2nd) and Angela Knösel (4th) when it was discovered that the runners in their sleds had been illegally heated before the runs. Müller <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> this by taking the gold medal at the following Games, in Sapporo, Japan.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E
