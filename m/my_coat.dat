500|$|When Behan {{said he had}} {{disarmed}} them, Virgil {{attempted to}} avoid a fight. [...] "I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and {{when he said he}} had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand." [...] Wyatt said I [...] "took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under <b>my</b> <b>coat,</b> and put it in my overcoat pocket."

500|$|Despite {{retiring}} officially {{from the}} company, Marcus {{continued to be}} closely involved as an advisor even through the final weeks of his life. He established a sideline as a retailing consultant, maintaining regular business hours in his offices at Crescent Court {{for more than a}} decade and offering advice locally to luxury car dealership Sewell Corporation and hotelier Rosewood Corporation as well as internationally to such businessmen as Mohamed Al-Fayed of Harrods. Called on to consult for Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos, the 94-year-old businessman recalled arriving in his customary expensive tailored suit to discover 300 casually dressed employees: [...] "I took off <b>my</b> <b>coat,</b> my necktie and my shirt, down to my T-shirt. And then I said, 'Okay. Let’s talk.' I couldn’t have planned it better. It broke the ice. I was on stage for two hours." ...|$|E
500|$|General d'Arco now ordered de la Colonie's French {{grenadiers}} into reserve {{on top of}} the Heights (above the breastworks {{manned by}} the Bavarians), ready to plug any gaps in their defences at the appropriate time. However, due to the flatness of the summit this position offered his men limited protection from the Allied guns. This exposure was noted by Colonel Blood who, sighting his artillery upon the summit, was able to inflict serious casualties upon de la Colonie's men. De la Colonie later recorded– [...] "They concentrated their fire upon us, and with their first discharge carried off Count de la Bastide... so that <b>my</b> <b>coat</b> was covered with brains and blood." [...] Notwithstanding this barrage, and despite losing five officers and 80 grenadiers before firing a shot, de la Colonie insisted his French regiment stayed at their post, determined as he was to maintain discipline and ensure his troops would be in good order when called into action.|$|E

500|$|This {{morning at}} 11 o'clock I have {{attacked}} the enemy.... All my troops have worked wonders, {{but at a}} cost of innumerable losses. Our men got into confusion. I assembled them three times. In the end I was in danger of getting captured and had to retreat. <b>My</b> <b>coat</b> is perforated by bullets, two horses of mine have been shot dead. My misfortune is that I am still living... Our defeat is very considerable: To me remains 3,000 men from an army of 48,000 men. At the moment in which I report all this, everyone is on the run; I am no more master of my troops. Thinking of the safety of anybody in Berlin is a good activity... It is a cruel failure that I will not survive. The consequences of the battle will be worse than the battle itself. I do not have any more resources, and—frankly confessed—I believe that everything is lost. I will not survive the doom of my fatherland. Farewell forever! ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of jockey Sam Chifney, Waxy was a [...] "handsome, rich bay, with a white {{stocking}} on the off-hind [...] leg, good length, and especially beautiful quarters." [...] In {{the words of}} his exercise rider (who wrote an anonymous letter to The Sporting Magazine in 1828), Waxy was [...] "one of the finest formed horses, perfect in symmetry, beautiful in colour, admirable in all his paces, and of the finest temper when in work." [...] However, when Waxy was confined to a stall during the winter months, his temperament became unruly and unpredictable leading the anonymous writer to remark that, [...] "Oft has he kicked the lappets of <b>my</b> <b>coat</b> over my head." [...] One of the few, possibly only, surviving portraits of Waxy was painted by Francis Sartorius in 1794 or 1795, and the depiction was praised in commentary for Sporting Magazine for its [...] "neatness" [...] and for [...] "the truth of representation it so evidently display." [...] While most breeding stallions and racehorses of the era had stable companions, Waxy reportedly was fond of rabbits {{in his later years}} and [...] "was never happy without a rabbit in his paddock" [...] with one female rabbit making her nest {{in the middle of his}} stall and raising generations of rabbits at the site that were never harmed by Waxy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, he {{was given}} the title of Lance Corporal, which he was very proud of. Alexei's {{favorites}} were the foreigners of Belgium, Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and Serbia, and in favor, adopted him as their mascot. Hanbury-Williams, whom Alexei liked, wrote [...] " [...] As time went on and his shyness wore off he treated us like old friends and… had always some bit fun with us. With me it was to make sure that each button on <b>my</b> <b>coat</b> was properly fastened, a habit which naturally made me take great care to have one or two unbuttoned, in which case he used to at once to stop and tell me that I was 'untidy again,' give a sigh at my lack of attention to these details and stop and carefully button me up again.” ...|$|E

6000|$|Now {{the rain}} came down faster, and my {{companion}} declared that I ought {{to stop and}} put on <b>my</b> <b>coat.</b> I agreed to this, and when I came to a suitable tree by the road-side, I carefully leaned her against it and detached <b>my</b> <b>coat</b> from my bicycle.
