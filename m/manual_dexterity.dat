He comes home with a magic gun that never misses a shot. A story from Inaba Province, related by Inoue Enryō, tells of a girl with poor <b>manual</b> <b>dexterity</b> who is suddenly possessed by a tengu. The spirit wishes to rekindle the declining art of swordsmanship in the world. Soon a young samurai appears to whom the tengu has appeared in a dream, and the possessed girl instructs him as an expert swordsman. Some rumors surrounding the ninja indicate that they were also instructed by the tengu.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of <b>manual</b> <b>dexterity</b> and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Precision {{grasping}} critically {{relies on}} {{the integrity of the}} corticospinal tract as evidenced in congenital hemiplegia by the correlation found between corticospinal dysgenesis and hand-movement deficits. Therefore, corticospinal dysgenesis could be used to anticipate upper-limb deficits in young infants with congenital hemiplegia. However, most studies have quantified corticospinal dysgenesis by measuring the cross-sectional area of cerebral peduncles on T 1 MRI, a measure biased by other structures present in the peduncles. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the extent to which this may have hampered the conclusions of previous studies. We also aimed to investigate the relationship between upper-limb deficits and a more accurate measure of corticospinal dysgenesis to provide a tool for anticipating upper-limb deficits in infants with congenital hemiplegia. METHODS: To address this issue, we measured corticospinal tract areas in 12 patients with congenital hemiplegia and 12 matched control subjects by using the diffusion tensor imaging technique. Corticospinal dysgenesis was quantified by computing a symmetry index between the area of the contralateral and ipsilateral corticospinal tracts. This value was then compared with that resulting from the conventional MRI method. RESULTS: The symmetry indexes gathered with these 2 methods were highly correlated, although the diffusion tensor imaging symmetry indexes were significantly smaller. This indicates that, in patients with congenital hemiplegia, the conventional MRI measurement has led to a systematic underestimate of corticospinal dysgenesis. These 2 estimates of corticospinal dysgenesis were also correlated with upper-limb impairments and disabilities. Although the symmetry index computed from peduncle measurements was correlated solely with deficits in stereognosis, the diffusion tensor imaging index correlated with stereognosis, digital and <b>manual</b> <b>dexterities,</b> and ABILHAND-Kids, a measure of manual ability in daily life activities. CONCLUSIONS: The diffusion tensor imaging symmetry index provides a useful prognostic tool for anticipating upper-limb deficits and their consequences in daily life activities...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether an intensive program of precision grip training could improve hand functioning of patients at more than 6 months after a stroke. This was a cross-over study; hence, at inclusion, the patients were randomly divided into two groups: one group started with the bilateral movement therapy and the other group started with the unilateral movement therapy. The patients were assessed on four separate occasions across a 12 -week period: (a) at inclusion in the study, (b) 4 weeks later, immediately before the first rehabilitation session, (c) after 4 weeks of one therapy, and (d) after a further 4 weeks of the other therapy.

We studied the corticospinal tract in right- and left-handers by diffusion tensor imaging and tractography. The present study aimed at revealing a morphological difference resulting from a region of interest (ROI) obtained by functional MRI (fMRI). METHODS: Twenty-five healthy participants (right-handed: 15, left-handed: 10) were enrolled in our assessment of morphological, functional and diffusion tensor MRI.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hand {{and upper}} limb {{involvement}} {{is common in}} patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, its impact on manual activities of daily life has not been fully evaluated. A measure of manual ability was developed, through the Rasch measurement model, by adapting and validating the ABILHAND questionnaire, which measures the patient's perceived difficulty in performing everyday manual activities. METHODS: 112 patients with RA were evaluated. The following tests were performed: the ABILHAND questionnaire, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the Jamar grip and key pinch strength tests, the Box and Block dexterity test and the Purdue pegboard dexterity test. In total, 35 patients were reassessed to determine the test-retest reliability of the ABILHAND, and 6 patients were studied before and after therapy with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers to address sensitivity to change. RESULTS: The Rasch refinement of the ABILHAND led to a selection of 27 items rated on a 3 -point scale. The resulting ability scale was targeted {{to the ability of}} the patients. The item-difficulty hierarchy was stable across demographic and clinical subgroups and over time. Grip and key pinch strength and <b>manual</b> and digital <b>dexterity</b> on both hands were significantly, though moderately, correlated with the ABILHAND measures. Manual ability was also significantly related to the number of affected hands, disease duration, tender and swollen joint counts on upper limbs, disease activity and the HAQ.

CONCLUSION: The ABILHAND questionnaire is a clinically valid person-centred measure of manual ability that could be useful in longitudinal RA studies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to advance}} the {{evaluation}} and rehabilitation of precision grip in chronic stroke patients. Stroke is {{a leading cause of}} permanent deficits worldwide, and fine manipulation skills are often disturbed in the paretic hand. The evaluation of predictive and reactive control in this population highlighted deficits in the paretic hand under both conditions. Patients also displayed a significant decrease in digital dexterity and an increase in the time taken to lift the manipulandum with the paretic hand compared with the non-paretic hand and control subjects. A specific rhythmic bilateral grip-lift task oriented therapy undertaken three times per week for 8 weeks did not modify grip-lift task parameters, digital <b>dexterity,</b> <b>manual</b> ability or subjects’ satisfaction with their participation in activities of daily living. Patients’ perceptions of increased ease and fluency of manipulation after therapy was not measured through these evaluations. The suggestion of changes in cortical activity related to the task led us to develop a fMRI compatible manipulandum and concomitant EMG recording setup. With a specific evaluation protocol, this proved to be accurate at least in healthy adults. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the fMRI method. Two of them are the subjects’ supine position and the restriction of their view of the manipulated object during image acquisition. These parameters have been shown to influence grip-lift task performance in healthy adults. There is a strong recommendation to consider position and view during rehabilitation and to assess the patient under the same conditions during fMRI. The literature also recommends adding at least one further brain mapping technique to complete the evaluation. In conclusion, chronic stroke subjects have manipulation disabilities that should be considered for rehabilitation. There is a strong need to combine structure and function specific evaluation in determining which type of therapy is appropriate for each patient in terms of functional recovery level, cortical lesion site and cortical excitability.

The article introduces teaching philosophy, content and method of Basic Design I and II for first year students of architecture at the Faculty of Architecture, Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT) University, Ahmedabad, India. It is framed within the Indian perspective of architectural education from the British colonial times. Commencing with important academic literature and biases of the initial colonial period, it quickly traces architectural education in CEPT, the sixteenth school of post-independent India, set up in 1962, discussing the foundation year teaching imparted. The school was Modernist and avant-garde. The author introduced these two courses against the back drop of the Universalist Modernist credo of architecture and education. In the courses, the primary philosophy behind learning design emerges from heuristic method. The aim of the first course is seen as infusing interest in visual world, development of <b>manual</b> skills and <b>dexterity</b> through the dictum of ‘Look-feel-reason out-evaluate’ and ‘observe-record-interpret-synthesize transform express’. Due to the lack of architectural orientation in Indian schooling; the second course assumes vernacular architecture as a reasonable tool for a novice to understand the triangular relationship of society, architecture and physical context and its impact on design. The students are analytically exposed to the regional variety of architectures logically stemming from the geo-climatic forces, human and material resources and techniques that satisfy the socio cultural needs and desires of a given people. Research analysis, large scale model making, simulation, actual size mockups and such engage the students in make-believe world of architectural learning in this course...|$|R
