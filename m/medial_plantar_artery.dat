50|$|The {{anterior}} medial malleolar artery passes {{behind the}} tendons of the extensor hallucis longus and tibialis anterior muscles, to the medial {{side of the}} ankle, upon which it ramifies, anastomosing with branches of the posterior tibial and <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries</b> and with the medial calcaneal from the posterior tibial.|$|R
25|$|In {{the lower}} leg, the {{anterior}} tibial enters the extensor compartment near the upper {{border of the}} interosseus membrane to descend between the tibialis anterior and the extensor hallucis longus. Distal to the superior and extensor retinacula of the foot it becomes the dorsal artery of the foot. The posterior tibial forms a direct continuation of the popliteal artery which enters the flexor compartment of the lower leg to descend behind the medial malleolus where it divides into the <b>medial</b> and lateral <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries,</b> of which the posterior branch {{gives rise to the}} fibular artery.|$|R

50|$|The PT {{gives rise}} to the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery,</b> lateral plantar artery, and {{gives rise to}} the fibular artery. Often, the branch of the fibular artery is said to rise from the {{bifurcation}} of the tibial-fibular trunk and the posterior tibial artery.|$|E
50|$|The main deep {{neurovascular}} bundle at risk is the posterior tibial. It {{lies on the}} posterior aspect of the tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus muscles, and medial to the belly of flexor hallucis longus.

40|$|Unusual {{course and}} {{branching}} {{pattern of the}} tibial arteries were discovered during routine anatomical dissection of the right lower extremity of a 61 -year-old female cadaver. The arteries of the crural region arose from the popliteal artery, as usual. However, the anterior tibial artery was hypoplastic and supplying the anterior calf muscles ended above the ankle joint. Instead, the posterior tibial artery gave off a large anterior branch, which crossed the lowest portion of the interosseous membrane and prolonged as the most distal continuation of the anterior tibial artery –the dorsalis pedis artery. The rest of the posterior tibial artery continued its course distally and divided into the usual <b>medial</b> and lateral <b>plantar</b> <b>arteries.</b> We briefly review the reported variations of the tibial arteries and discussed their clinical relevance...|$|R
40|$|The pedicled <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> (MP) flap is {{an optimal}} {{solution}} for defects involving the weight-bearing {{areas of the}} foot. However, venous congestion is a frequently encountered complication, especially with the reverse-flow variants of the flap, and several strategies {{have been reported in}} literature both to prevent and to manage it. In this article, we present the use of a <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> flap based distally on the lateral <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> with the adjunct of an extra metatarsal perforator from the dorsalis pedis artery as a vascular enhancement to avoid the venous congestion and to improve the overall circulation. This bipedicled flap was successfully advanced to cover a 5 × 3 cm soft-tissue defect located {{at the level of the}} first and second metatarsal heads of the right foot resulting from the excision of a squamous cell carcinoma in an 80 -year-old male patient with a history of cardiovascular disease. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged 7 days after the operation and was able to walk after 6 weeks wearing normal shoes. We believe that preserving plantar metatarsal perforators during the harvesting of an MP flap based distally on the lateral <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> may be a precious adjunct as it increases blood supply, especially the venous drainage of the flap...|$|R
50|$|The proper plantar digital nerves of <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> nerve are nerves of the foot.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{children}} with {{lateral plantar artery}} pseudoaneurysms are presented. Both cases were associated with a plantar laceration and were successfully treated with ligation. Only one other report of a lateral plantar artery pseudoaneurysm {{was found in the}} literature; no reports involving the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> have been reported. A cadaver dissection supports the hypothesis that the lateral plantar artery is more superficially located and therefore more vulnerable to injury compared with the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery.</b> Clinicians treating patients with lacerations of the foot should be aware that an arterial injury may be present, {{even in the absence of}} active bleeding.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To study use of {{the medial}} plantar flap for {{reconstruction}} of the heel and foot. METHOD: The authors share their clinical experience with the {{use of the}} <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> flap for coverage of tissue defects around the foot and heel after trauma. Twelve cases of <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> flap performed from January 2001 to December 2013 were included. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, ten were male and two were female. The indications were traumatic loss of the heel pad in ten cases and the dorsal foot in two cases. All the flaps healed uneventfully without major complications, except one case with partial flap loss. The donor site was covered with a split-thickness skin graft. The flaps had slightly inferior protective sensation compared with the normal side. CONCLUSION: From these results, the authors suggest that the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> flap is a good addition to the existing armamentarium for coverage of the foot and heel. It is versatile flap that can cover defects on the heel, over the Achilles tendon and plantar surface, as well as the dorsal foot. It provides tissue to the plantar skin with a similar texture and intact protective sensation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Coverage of the weightbearing heel poses {{a unique}} {{technical}} {{challenge to the}} reconstructive surgeon. In the present study, we share our clinical experience {{with the use of}} the medial plantar artery-based flap for coverage of tissue defects around the heel. Eighteen <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> flaps performed from January 1996 to December 2009 were included. All the procedures were performed by 2 surgeons at Aga KhanUniversity and Hospital (Karachi, Pakistan) and Bahawal Victoria Hospital (Bahawalpur, Pakistan). Of the 18 patients, 16 were male and 2 were female. The indications were traumatic loss of the heel pad in 13, pressure sores in 2, and unstable plantar scars in 3. All the flaps were raised as sensate fasciocutaneous pedicled flaps based on the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery.</b> All the flaps healed uneventfully without major complications. The donor site was covered with a split-thickness skin graft, and we had partial graft loss in 1 case. The sensate flaps had slightly inferior protective sensation compared with the normal side. From our results, we suggest that the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> flap is a good addition to the existing armamentarium. It provides tissue to the plantar skin with a similar texture and an intact protective sensation. The technique is easier to master compared with free microvascular flaps and has less risk of any functional donor site morbidity...|$|E

During routine dissection of 50 -year-old female cadaver, we found the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> nerve and vessels variably located between plantar aponeurosis and the muscles of the first layer of the sole of the right foot. Due to this variant position, the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> nerve and vessels lose their protection from the muscles of the first layer of the sole of the foot and became vulnerable for compression...|$|R
40|$|The plantar {{metatarsal}} arteries of some mammals were studied. In the dog, {{raccoon dog}} and cat, the second proximal perforating branch was fully developed and produced the plantar metatarsal arteries. These plantar metatarsal arteries {{ran on the}} plantar surfaces of the interosseous muscles along the metatarsal bones or intermetatarsal spaces, and {{gave rise to the}} digital arteries of the second to fifth toes. In the rabbit, a branch of the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> ran transversely on the plantar surfaces of the metatarsal bones at a level distal to the bases of these bones, and produced the plantar metatarsal arteries. These plantar metatarsal arteries ran deep in the interosseous muscles along the metatarsal bones or intermetatarsal spaces, and joined with the digital arteries which were derived from the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery.</b> The plantar metatarsal arteries could be classified into four kinds of arteries (sM, sI, dM and dI) in relation to the interosseous muscles and metatarsal bones. This classification largely coincides with that of the human hand and foot (Murakami, 1969, 1971), the monkey hand and foot (Nakai et al., 1987; Hinenoya et al., 1987), and the forepaws of some animals, including the dog and cat (Murakami et al., 1987). </p...|$|E
40|$|Contractile {{responses}} to phenylephrine and high-K+ were investigated in vitro in microvascular preparations from the rat <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery,</b> a branch from the saphenous artery, obtained after short-term denervation in vivo. Two groups of animals were studied: (1) animals undergoing surgical resection of the saphenous nerve, and (2) animals undergoing surgical resection {{of both the}} sciatic and saphenous nerves. The animals were operated on one side only. Microvascular preparations (diameter about 325 microns) were obtained 10 days after surgery. Vessels from the non-operated side served as controls. Immunocytochemistry showed a decreased number of both neuropeptide Y (NPY) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactive nerve fibres in vessels after resection of the saphenous nerve only. Resection of both the saphenous and the sciatic nerve caused a complete loss of immunoreactive nerve fibres. Mechanical measurements were performed using a wire myograph. In vessels subjected to resection of the saphenous nerve the sensitivity to phenylephrine was similar to controls. Vessels denervated by resection of both the saphenous and sciatic nerves showed significant increases in phenylephrine and potassium sensitivity. When depolarized in high-K+ solution the denervated vessels showed an increased sensitivity to extracellular Ca 2 +. The results show that complete short-term denervation of the rat <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> in vivo causes a pronounced supersensitivity in the vascular smooth muscle. The supersensitivity appears not to be restricted to the sympathetic alpha-receptors but also associated with changes in the cellular excitation-contraction coupling. Such altered reactivity of the vascular smooth muscle may contribute to vascular disturbances observed in vivo after nerve damage or surgical denervation...|$|E

40|$|Vascular injury {{resulting}} in pseudoaneurysm {{formation in the}} plantar aspect of the foot is an uncommon injury after trauma. Such injuries are more often reported in the lateral plantar artery rather than the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery,</b> most likely because of its more superficial location. Traditional modalities in diagnosis have included ultrasound and digital subtraction angiography. We present a case of traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the lateral plantar artery following a foot laceration.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Defects in the {{weight-bearing}} {{region of}} the foot sole can represent a substantial restriction in {{quality of life and}} pose a challenge for reconstructive plastic surgery. The {{purpose of this article is}} to report our experience with the use of <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> perforator (MPAP) flap for reconstruction of defects of the foot sole in 3 different regions: heel, middle foot sole and plantar forefoot. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2003 to May 2016, 28 patients (13 males and 15 females) with an average age of 54 years (range 12 to 84 y. o.) received reconstruction with 28 MPAP flaps. 26 flaps were harvested as pedicle perforator flaps and 2 as free perforator flaps. All flaps were raised from the ipsilateral instep area. The defect locations included the heel (20 cases), middle foot sole (4 cases) and forefoot (4 cases). The causes of reconstruction were tumors in 18 patients (64...|$|E

40|$|Although rarely used, the {{abductor}} hallucis muscle has its indications {{in coverage}} of small defects at the medial {{aspect of the}} hindfoot as a proximally based muscle flap. The authors describe a 69 -year-old female patient in whom the abductor hallucis muscle {{was used as a}} distally based flap to reconstruct a defect in the forefoot. An anatomic study was undertaken on two cadaveric feet to explore the practicality of the distally based abductor hallucis muscle flap before it was applied clinically. The distally based abductor muscle flap receives its blood supply from minor and major pedicles in a retrograde fashion from both the dorsal arterial network and the deep plantar system, through communicating branches with the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> distally. Transposition of the distally based hallucis flap is only advisable in individuals who have no vascular compromise in the lower leg and foot.

40|$|Full {{thickness}} defects to the plantar heel {{present a}} challenge to the foot and ankle surgeon. Skin grafts and flaps have been described to resurface this area. This article describes a technique that provided coverage to a plantar ulceration without creating a donor site. Methods: This article presents three cases of defects closed utilizing V-Y medial plantar neurovascular island flap. Medially, the abductor hallucis brevis muscle was exposed. Then laterally, the flexor digitorium brevis muscle was exposed on its lateral border. Distally, the <b>medial</b> <b>plantar</b> <b>artery</b> was divided and the flap was raised from distal to proximal in the plane between the muscle layer and fascia incorporating the artery. Interfascial dissection of the medial plantar nerve preserved digital nerves and muscle branches and retained cutaneous branches in the flap. Then the fascial septa {{along the length of the}} flap were divided to allow mobilization of flap proximally into the defect; after which time, primary closure was performed on the donor site. Results: Patients were followed for one year post-operatively. All three patients continued to have full sensation and normal gait with even distribution of weight. The flap provided sufficient sof...|$|E
40|$|Os aneurismas periféricos merecem atenção pela sua baixa frequência e associação com outros aneurismas arteriais, principalmente o de aorta abdominal. O aneurisma de artéria plantar verdadeiro é ainda mais raro. A escassa {{literatura}} disponível concentra-se nos casos de pseudoaneurisma pós-traumático dessa artéria. Relata-se o caso de uma paciente do sexo feminino, 85 anos, com queixa de dor no pé direito ao deambular durante um ano, acompanhada de nódulo pulsátil em região plantar, próximo da base do primeiro pododáctilo. Não havia história prévia de trauma ou cirurgia na região plantar acometida. Realizou-se ecografia vascular e angiorressonância, que diagnosticaram aneurisma de artéria plantar. A paciente foi então submetida à aneurismectomia com ligadura das artérias nutricionais, apresentando boa evolução pós- operatória. Peripheral aneurysms deserve {{attention because}} of their low frequency and potential association with other aneurysms, especially of the abdominal aorta.
