50|$|Pivovar Holba a.s. is a brewery {{situated}} in Hanušovice. Major owner is a brewer company PMS Přerov a.s. Annual production is over 350 000 hectoliters. The most notable product is Holba Šerák, <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> <b>beer,</b> {{named after the}} nearby mountain. The motto of the brewery is Pure Beer from Mountains.|$|E
5000|$|The next success came in 1965 {{when the}} {{so-called}} [...] "mellanöl", or medium alcohol beer, {{was introduced in}} Sweden. The beer contained less alcohol than strong beer and could be sold outside the government controlled retail chain Systembolaget. This was an injection which was badly needed by the beer industry. Krönleins had a best seller with a <b>medium</b> <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> called Three Hearts Middle Beer. Structural changes {{were made in the}} beer industry, which also affected Halmstad's two breweries. The competitor Östra Bryggeriet was bought by Krönleins in 1979. The same year Krönleins also stopped producing their own malt.|$|E

50|$|The modern {{trend is}} toward {{consumers}} increasingly choosing <b>stronger</b> <b>beer</b> than the 3.5% abv brands, generally {{referred to as}} folköl (people's beer) sold at grocery stores. Any <b>stronger</b> <b>beer</b> is sold exclusively at the government owned retail monopoly Systembolaget.|$|R

50|$|The brewery {{was well}} ahead among its {{competitors}} {{and a lot}} of effort was put into product development. During the 30's and 40's only beer of 2.8% alcohol by volume had been brewed - pilsner. It was now time to develop a <b>stronger</b> <b>beer.</b> As the first brewery in Sweden, Krönleins began to produce a high grade <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> {{in the beginning of the}} 50's. The beer was given the name Three Hearts Export. In the beginning the <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> was made solely for export, since beer of this strength was prohibited in Sweden at the time.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first known}} {{use of the}} word stout for beer was in a {{document}} dated 1677 found in the Egerton Manuscript, the sense being that a stout <b>beer</b> was a <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> not a dark beer. [...] The name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer that had been made with roasted malts. Because of the huge popularity of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths. The <b>stronger</b> <b>beers</b> were called [...] "stout porters", so the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined, and the term stout has become firmly associated with dark beer, rather than just <b>strong</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> festival {{takes place}} {{annually}} during Lent in the Paulaner main hall at Hoch Street 77.

The festival {{is associated with the}} traditional ‘Holy Father Feast’ on April 2, commemorating Francis of Paola, founder of the Paulaner religious order.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} between the original gravity of the wort and the final gravity of the beer {{is an indication of}} how much sugar has been turned into alcohol. The bigger the difference, the greater the amount of alcohol present and hence the <b>stronger</b> the <b>beer.</b> This is why <b>strong</b> <b>beers</b> are sometimes referred to as high gravity beers, and [...] "session" [...] or [...] "small" [...] beers are called low gravity beers, even though in theory the final gravity of a <b>strong</b> <b>beer</b> might be lower than that of a session beer because of the greater amount of alcohol present.|$|R

500|$|The {{strength}} of beers has climbed during the later {{years of the}} 20th century.

Since then, some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers. Samuel Adams reached 20% abv with Millennium, and then surpassed that amount to 25.6% abv with Utopias. The <b>strongest</b> <b>beer</b> brewed in Britain was Baz's Super Brew by Parish Brewery, a 23% abv beer.
