5000|$|The concept [...] "innovative {{financing}} for development" [...] was first mentioned and introduced at the International Conference on Financing for Development in 2002.

They include reducing extreme poverty, reducing child mortality rates, improving maternal health and combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases such as Tuberculosis. So far, most donor states have failed to meet their 0.7% commitment from the <b>Monterrey</b> <b>Consensus</b> of their Gross National Income (GNI) dedicated to Official Development Assistance.Furthermore, in most developing countries the budget allocated for the social, and especially the Health sector, has been insufficient as it fails to meet the 15% Gross National Product (GNP) requirement dedicated to the Health Sector stated in the Abuja declaration of African leaders in 2001.|$|E

They wanted it to play its optimum role in helping poor countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals, the set of targets agreed by 192 countries in 2000 which aimed to halve world poverty by 2015.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Monterrey</b> <b>Consensus</b> agreed at the UN {{summit on}} Financing for Development in 2002 promised a {{breakthrough}} in terms of donor generosity, aid effectiveness and new means of financing. However, the development orientation of world leaders proved to be short-lived. This is even though our evaluation reveals progress since Monterrey in some areas, notably debt relief and private (FDI) flows. Calls for substantially scaling up regular aid had little effect, and financial innovations contributed only marginally to overall development financing so far. There is not much progress either {{from the perspective of}} critics focusing on the quality of aid. In particular, we find that the targeting of aid according to need and merit leaves much to be desired. The gap between words and deeds continues to be wide with regard to aid proliferation and donor coordination, too...|$|E
40|$|Are recent donor {{approaches}} {{compatible with}} a political understanding of policy processes in partner or recipient countries? This question is given increased urgency with the recent calls for and commitment to increasing financial flows, scaling-up of aid, and promoting donor coordination. Do these commitments sharpen the potential dilemma between increased aid and the political processes, and the changes that inevitably accompany this? This paper discusses {{the nature of the}} partnership enshrined in the <b>Monterrey</b> <b>consensus,</b> budget support and poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSP) approaches, and assistance directly targeted to the poor, as one way of increasing aid flows to poorest countries. It also discusses approaches to the role of aid in economic growth, and argues for better understanding of the politics of growth. The papers questions whether the current ?institutions? or governance paradigm brings sufficient political context to aid delivery, and discusses the relationship between domestic revenue generation and foreign aid. A concluding section draws out implications for aid delivery, and for a potential role of socio-political analysis in new aid modalities. aid, donors, governance...|$|E
