40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} generic {{security}} architecture {{designed for a}} multidomain and <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> based on programmable networks. The <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> allows users of an IP network to run programmable services using programmable nodes located in {{the architecture of the}} network. The programmable nodes execute codes to process active packets, which can carry user data and control information. The <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> model defined here considers the more pragmatic trends in programmable networks. In this scenario, new security risks that do not appear in traditional IP networks become visible. These new risks are {{as a result of the}} execution of code in the programmable nodes and the processing of the active packets. The proposed security architecture is based on symmetric cryptography in the critical process, combined with an efficient manner of distributing the symmetric keys. Another important contribution has been to scale the security architecture to a multidomain scenario in a single and efficient way. Publicad...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The role {{of traffic}} {{engineering}} {{is to ensure}} that a telecommunications network has just enough capacity to meet expected demand with adequate quality of service. A critical requirement is to understand the three-way relationship between demand, capacity and performance, each of these being quantified in appropriate units. The degree to which this is possible in a future <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> remains uncertain, due notably to the inherent self-similarity of traffic and the modelling difficulty that this implies. The purpose of the present chapter is to argue that sound traffic engineering remains the crucial element in providing quality of service and that the network must be designed to circumvent the self-similarity problem by applying traffic controls at an appropriate level. Quality of service in a <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> depends essentially on two factors: the service model which identifies different service classes and specifies how network reso...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{researches}} {{have been}} done on modeling the traffic flows in a <b>multiservice</b> <b>network.</b> Recently, an alternative proposal was made by Addie et al. The authors argued that because the central limit theorem {{can be applied to}} heavy traffic processes, therefore as more traffic is aggregated together through the sharing of a transmission link, the aggregated traffic will weakly converges to a Gaussian process. In this paper, we apply this Gaussian model to the Connection Admission Control (CAC) of a <b>multiservice</b> <b>network.</b> We also make efficiency comparison with a CAC based on an Effective Bandwidth model. Two scenarios were considered: the first assumes that all a priori traffic specifications are known before a CAC acceptance/rejection decision is made; while the second assumes that only the peak rate of a new (requesting admission) connection is declared to the CAC mechanism. The latter scenario entails measurement-based CAC approach. 1. INTRODUCTION We consider a store-and-forward (p [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{convergence}} of voice and data communications over a single network infrastructure is the most appealing objective for the network operators. This requires appropriate network control tools that allow guaranteeing different QoS levels for each provided service.

40|$|A {{much clearer}} {{picture of the}} {{progress}} towards an integrated high speed <b>multiservice</b> <b>network</b> is now emerging. Such networks were anticipated over twenty years ago, {{at a time when}} packet switching was just another way to transmit data. Now the technology is so mature that media barons are organising their investments in order {{to take advantage of the}} profit. Many of the technical problems are now solved and the fundamental protocols required for these networks are sufficiently well-defined to support a rapidly expanding industry. However, consensus on how to talk about the statistics of the data which is transmitted around these networks has not been readily forthcoming. Nevertheless, there now exists a family of models with sufficient richness to describe real traffic fairly well, which can be parametrised conveniently, and which degenerates to a readily analysable Gaussian model in the situation of very large networks. This analysis leads to important architectural conclusions which accord with common sense, in particular the conclusion that integrated networks of the future should be able to provide better and better service with efficiency tending toward perfect. This is a rather happy conclusion which thoroughly confirms the current rapid drive towards an all-encompassing integrated <b>multiservice</b> <b>network.</b> Rather than the increase in traffic and the diversity of service types leading to greater and greater complexity, it seems that the flow of traffic in our networks may become steadily more manageable. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is becoming a}} fundamental technology in future generation wireless communications. Call admission control is an effective mechanism to guarantee resilient, efficient, and quality-of-service (QoS) services in wireless mobile networks. In this paper, we present several call admission control algorithms for OFDM-based wireless <b>multiservice</b> <b>networks.</b> Call connection requests are differentiated into narrow-band calls and wide-band calls. For either class of calls, the traffic process is characterized as batch arrival since each call may request multiple subcarriers to satisfy its QoS requirement. The batch size is a random variable following a probability mass function (PMF) with realistically maximum value. In addition, the service times for wide-band and narrow-band calls are different. Following this, we perform a tele-traffic queueing analysis for OFDM-based wireless <b>multiservice</b> <b>networks.</b> The formulae for the significant performance metrics call blocking probability and bandwidth utilization are developed.
