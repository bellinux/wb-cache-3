Moreover, PV pumping is getting more attention in recent days mainly in remote areas where connection to the grid is technically not possible. Power generation by Photovoltaic is reliable. The simplest PV water pumping system consists of a PV array connected to boost converter feeding power directly to a DC motor or PMDC <b>motor</b> and a <b>pump.</b> This paper deals with the simulation of PV based DC <b>motor</b> <b>pumping</b> system and PMDC <b>motor</b> <b>pumping</b> system. The comparison of the two systems has been done and proved a simple but efficient photovoltaic water pumping system among them. <b>Motors</b> and centrifugal <b>pumps</b> operate at variable speed in a photovoltaic pumping system. However, the characteristics of <b>motors</b> and <b>pumps</b> are usually only given for a single voltage and speed.

5000|$|Through his {{previous}} {{experience as a}} parcel post truck driver, Williams had become proficient {{in the operation of}} motor vehicles. It was {{at this point in the}} history of the Department, horses were being replaced by two-wheel Christie tractors, thus motorizing both steamers and aerial trucks. An 84-hour work week came into being, a system that was to remain practically unchanged until 1939 when the three-platoon eight-hour plan was adopted. The shortage of firemen who possessed the mechanical ability to operate the new gasoline-driven tractors led to Williams being asked to take the apparatus out of quarters and then back it in. He executed the maneuver so expertly he was assigned as the apparatus driver. This assignment caused much resentment against Williams among the members of Engine 55. It prompted Assistant Chief of Department Patty Walsh to comment that [...] "Of all the men in this Department, he (The Captain) had to pick that man to drive the apparatus!" [...] Tradition dictated that the <b>Motor</b> <b>Pump</b> Operators should be the senior most experienced members of a Fire Company; the fact that Wesley Williams had little seniority, coupled with the fact that he was black, was not offset by the fact that he was the best qualified to operate the apparatus.|$|E

40|$|This paper calls {{attention}} {{to the importance of}} social cooperation in irrigation farming. It argues that a mere focus on the technical aspect of irrigation, disregarding its social aspects undermines the long-term benefits of irrigation to rural livelihoods. This assertion draws on lessons from small-irrigation practices in Fogera, in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia, where I conducted fieldwork-based qualitative research. In recent years irrigation farming has drawn a growing interest among farmers in rural Fogera. Farmers practise small-scale irrigation that includes traditional irrigation and <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Farmers assert that irrigation has brought farming benefits through cultivation of more crops as well as new crops that serve food and cash purposes. Such benefits have particularly spurred the enthusiasm for <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. However, the practice of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation largely relies on the motor-pump technology, overlooking the social scheme of irrigation. While traditional irrigation involves more social cooperation involving joint activities, water allocations and irrigation schedules, lack of social cooperation and such institutional conditions is widespread in <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Local classification of irrigation practices also associate the mechanism of irrigation use and management including water use regulations and water use turns with traditional irrigation in contrast to <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. The neglect of social cooperation within current practices of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation will have significant adverse implications on long-term practices. Farmers have been already concerned about how competitions for water are growing, limiting the duration of water availability and creating water shortage. The study suggests that while farmers’ willingness to practise <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation in Fogera has been stimulated by its livelihood benefits, sustained benefits of this irrigation scheme require social cooperation and feasible institutional conditions that can mediate water usage across user villages...|$|E
40|$|In agriculture, the {{coexistence}} of {{different forms of}} land tenancy or labour contract has been explained so far by several theories related to Marshallian inefficiency, incentives, risk sharing, and transaction costs, including supervision costs. These theories and the empirical evidences have greatly contributed to explain the reasons behind land tenancy or labour contract choice. This study follows up on this. Moreover, it intends to take a further step by focusing particularly on the production technologies at plot level, and by designing and testing a theoretical model based on household profit optimization. This model will {{take into account the}} supervision costs of labour (i) to compare optimum profit derived from plots based on household labour, a sharecropping labour contract, and a wage labour contract, controlling for irrigation equipment (ii) to test the efficiency of the labour contract choice using data from Senegal’s horticultural zone. As expected, the production elasticity of labour decreases when improved irrigation equipment like a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> is used. The technology displays an increasing return to scale on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> and a constant return to scale on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump.</b> While on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> the sharecropping contract is the efficient labour contract choice, leading to a higher optimum profit for the household, on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump,</b> the wage contract is the best labour contract choice. Consequently, we can conclude from this finding that the use of a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> drives out the sharecropping contract in favour of household labour and the wage labour contract. land tenancy, labour, sharecropping, wage, contract, supervision, household, profit optimization, efficient, irrigation equipment, horticulture, Senegal, Agricultural Finance,...|$|E
