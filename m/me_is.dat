5|$|Bleed Like <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} studio album by American-Scottish {{alternative}} rock band Garbage. It {{was released on}} April 11, 2005 by A Records and Warner Bros. Records. The group chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of Garbage's live performances instead of the electronica that permeated the previous album, Beautiful Garbage (2001).|$|E
5|$|The Drug in <b>Me</b> <b>Is</b> You is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Falling in Reverse. Production for the album took place {{following}} lead singer Ronnie Radke's departure from Escape the Fate in 2008. Recording {{took place in}} December 2010 and lasted until February 2011 at Paint it Black Studios in Orlando, Florida. Michael Baskette, who worked with Radke on Escape the Fate's Dying is Your Latest Fashion, returned as the executive producer for the album, alongside former bandmate Omar Espinosa and others as additional composers and production aids in the studio. The Drug in <b>Me</b> <b>Is</b> You was released on July 25, 2011, in Europe and Japan, and on July 26, 2011, in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The Drug in <b>Me</b> <b>Is</b> You was speculated by news source Perez Hilton to sell {{anywhere}} from 17,000 to 20,000 copies in the United States {{during its first}} week of sales, placing it close behind predicted debuting chart toppers Eric Church (Chief), Kelly Rowland (Here I Am), and Joss Stone (LP1). The album ended up selling 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. This almost exactly matched the first week sales of Escape the Fate (2010), the third album by Radke's former band, though Escape the Fate only charted at number 25, six spots lower than The Drug in <b>Me</b> <b>Is</b> You, despite equal sales. In its second week on sales, The Drug in <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> You dropped about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|The album charted {{at number}} 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies {{in its first}} week in the United States. It also charted inter{{national}}ly on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Upon release, The Drug in <b>Me</b> <b>Is</b> You received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being cliché while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band {{in many of the}} album's tracks. The Drug in <b>Me</b> <b>Is</b> You was chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011.|$|E

5|$|Donen's {{next film}} was Kiss Them for Me. He was {{personally}} asked by Cary Grant to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles On the Town, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike On the Town, Kiss Them for <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> a dark comedy that contrasts the officers' selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film {{was released in}} 1957 to mostly poor reviews.|$|E

Released in 2013, My Mom is a Foreigner, But Not to <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> based on her experiences of growing up with a mother from another country. The book had a negative reception from Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews; while recognizing it as well-intentioned, Moore's use of verse and rhyme was criticised.|$|E

5|$|Once you're a Catholic, you're {{always a}} Catholic—in {{terms of your}} {{feelings}} of guilt and remorse and whether you've sinned or not. Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E

Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, who also co-starred in Kaminey in 2009, portray three couples {{from three different}} eras.

5|$|The Spy Who Loved <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> {{the ninth}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It {{is the shortest}} and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, {{as well as a}} clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.|$|E
5|$|All That Is Within <b>Me</b> <b>is</b> {{the fifth}} studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe. Produced by Brown Bannister, it was {{released}} on November 20, 2007 through INO Records. The album, intended by the band to be a worship album split between covers and original songs, was recorded following the band's tour with Audio Adrenaline in promotion of their previous studio album Coming Up to Breathe (2006). Although the band intended to write material for a new album during the tour, they had only written one song {{by the time they}} entered their recording studio, Cider Mountain Studio in Athol, Idaho. The band wrote so many songs at the studio that they decided not to include any cover songs; all of the songs on the album but were written or co-written by the band. The album was described as being a rock and worship album, being aimed directly at a Christian audience.|$|E

5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to <b>me</b> <b>is</b> a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
