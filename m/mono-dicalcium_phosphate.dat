40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunitySix Holstein steers (118 kg BW) were fed two diets (DW and Control) in a crossover treatment design to examine nitrogen and phosphorus utilization. In the DW diet, sundried duckweed was substituted {{for a portion of}} the soybean meal in the control diet to make the two diets isonitrogenous. Since duckweed was high in phosphorus content (1. 61 % DM basis), the control diet was supplemented with <b>mono-dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> to make both diets isophosphoric. Phosphorus digested (g/d), percentage phosphorus digested, phosphorus retained (g/d) and percentage phosphorus retained were greater (P< 0. 01) for calves fed the duckweed diet. Results regarding the efficiency of nitrogen utilization from both treatments were inconclusive...|$|E
40|$|Ten {{replications}} of individually penned gilts from a high-lean strain {{were used}} to determine the effect of ractopamine (RAC) on the optimum dietary available phosphorus (AP) regimen. At 70 kg body weight, pigs were randomly allotted to a corn-soybean meal basal diet (. 08 % AP) adequate in all nutrients except AP. The basal diet was supplemented with <b>mono-dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> to create six AP concentrations (. 08,. 13,. 18,. 23,. 28,. 33 %) and ractopamine HCl to create two RAC concentrations (0 and 20 ppm). A constant Ca/AP ratio of 2. 5 : 1 was maintained in each diet. BW gain and feed intake were recorded weekly for 5 weeks, and total urine output was collected via urinary catheter the last 2 days of each 7 -day period. After this 5 -week collection period pigs remained on their diets until they achieved a body weight of 114 kg and were the...|$|E

Experiments were conducted to determine the elects of cottonseed meal (CSM) on growth and performance of Coturnix quail when diets are formulated on a digestible amino acid basis in the presence of high and low concentrations of iron. Concentrations of total, (+) - and (-) - isomers of gossypol were determined in heart, liver and blood plasma. For Experiment 1, various concentrations (0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 %) of an expander solvent cottonseed meal (CSM) were fed to Coturnix quail using feed-grade <b>mono-dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (21 % Ca, 16 % P, 1. 5 % Fe) as a source of inorganic phosphorous. All diets were formulated using true digestibility coefficients for essential amino acids. There were no significant effects of CSM on body weights, feed intakes, feed conversions or mortality. The CSM levels did not significantly affect relative heart or liver weights. Total, (+) - and (-) -gossypol concentrations in plasma, heart and liver increased as levels of gossypol in the diet increased. Experiment 2 was designed to determine maximum safe levels of an expander solvent cottonseed meal (CSM) in Coturnix quail diets while utilizing USP-grade <b>mono-dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (23. 7 % Ca, 18. 3 % P,. 025 % Fe). There were no significant differences seen in mortality or feed conversion. Tissue and serum gossypol increased as dietary levels of CSM increased. During Week 5, quail fed 28 % CSM had significantly lower body weights than all other treatments. However, by Week 6, {{there were no significant differences}} in body weights among treatments. In Experiment 3, to determine if the use of cottonseed in a low iron diet would alter blood iron concentrations, quail were fed diets with either feed-grade phosphorous or USP-grade phosphorous and ground cottonseed meats to achieve either 0 ppm gossypol or 400 ppm gossypol. No significant differences were seen among treatments due to the elects of cottonseed. When fed a diet formulated on a true digestibility basis, up to 28 % CSM may be safely used when utilizing a high-iron phosphorous source and up to 21 % CSM when utilizing a low-iron phosphorous source without affecting performance or serum iron concentrations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments 1 and 2 were {{conducted}} to establish a technique for the recovery of dietary phosphates from commercial layer manure. Solutions of ethanol, 60 % ethanol: 40 % water (vol/vol), 50 % ethanol: 50 % water, 40 % ethanol: 60 % water, and 100 % water were tested to determine the efficacy of dicalcium phosphate recovery. Solutions containing 50 % or greater ethanol {{were found to be}} most effective. Experiments 3 and 4 {{were conducted}} to determine factors that influence in vivo phosphate solubilization in commercial Leghorn hens. In Experiment 3, <b>mono-dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (Biofos®), di-monocalcium phosphate (Dynafos®), and tricalcium phosphate (Multifos®) were fed to layers at 1. 67 and 3. 3 g hen/d levels. In vivo phosphate solubilization was higher (P <. 05) for Biofos® and Dynafos ® than for Multifos®. Dietary phosphate level did not consistently influence in vivo phosphate solubilization in hens. In Experiment 4, a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement consisting of three types of phosphates (Biofos®, Dynafos®, and Multifos®), two dietary levels of added P (. 3 and. 6 %), and two levels of dietary Ca (. 88 and 3. 75 %) were used. In vivo phosphate solubilization decreased as Ca level was increased. In vivo solubilization of Multifos ® was lower than Biofos ® or Dynafos ® at both dietary Ca levels tested. These results indicate that phosphate source and calcium level, but not phosphorus level, consistently influence in vivo solubilization of phosphates.
