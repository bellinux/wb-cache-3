In this contribution we report on measurements of the electrical conductivity of nonideal zinc and carbon plasmas, which are produced by evaporating a wire placed in a capillary (exploding wire) within some hundred nanoseconds. The particle density is in the range of 1022 cm− 3. The plasma temperature, which is obtained by fitting a Planck function to the measured spectrum, is between 8000 and 20000 K. We compare the measured electrical conductivies with theoretical results using quantum kinetic theory for partially ionized plasmas.

40|$|Ruminants {{depend on}} hepatic gluconeogenesis to meet {{most of their}} {{metabolic}} demand for glucose which relies on availability of precursors from diet supply and animal requirements (Loncke et al., 2010). Several mechanistic models of the metabolic fate of nutrients across the liver exist that have been parameterized for dairy cows. They cannot be directly used to predict hepatic gluconeogenesis in all types of ruminants in different physiological status. A hybrid mechanistic model of nutrient fluxes across the liver is presently being developed (Bahloul et al., 2012), that is calibrated empirically based on meta-analysis (Sauvant and Mertens, 2008) to be applicable to all types of ruminants in different physiological status and to usual nutritional practices. The objectives of the present work were to test the hybrid liver model in its present state of development to simulate the net hepatic release of glucose when the glucogenic/ketogenic/nitrogenous nutrient profile entering the liver varies. This first application of the model was limited to ruminants in positive calculated energy balance, in which the nutrient fate across the liver is mostly directed by <b>mass</b> <b>action</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R
