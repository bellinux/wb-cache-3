50|$|<b>Minaprine</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand names Brantur, Cantor) is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} antidepressant drug {{that was used}} in France for the treatment of depression until it was withdrawn from the market in 1996 because it caused convulsions.|$|E
50|$|Pyridazines {{are rare}} in nature, {{possibly}} reflecting {{the scarcity of}} naturally occurring hydrazines, common building blocks for the synthesis of these heterocycles. The pyridazine structure is a popular pharmacophore which is found within a number of herbicides such as credazine, pyridafol and pyridate. It is also found within the structure of several drugs such as cefozopran, cadralazine, <b>minaprine,</b> pipofezine, and hydralazine.|$|E
40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{effects of}} <b>minaprine,</b> a new psychotropic drug, were investigated on striatal dopaminergic neurons in the rat. <b>Minaprine</b> did not displace [3 H]spiperone in-vitro binding from striatal membranes but had clear effects on dopamine (DA) metabolites. Homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner after intraperitoneal administration of <b>minaprine</b> 30 min before killing. In rats injected with <b>minaprine</b> 15 mg kg- 1 i. p. at different intervals, {{the decrease in}} striatal HVA and DOPAC was time-dependent and a concomitant rise in 3 -methoxytyramine (3 -MT) concentrations was observed. The maximum of these effects was reached 30 min after <b>minaprine.</b> When administered 5 min after a monoamineoxidase (MAO) inhibitor (pargyline, 100 mg kg- 1 i. p.) and 30 min before killing, <b>minaprine</b> did not affect pargyline-induced changes in HVA, DOPAC and 3 -MT levels. This together with other data suggests that <b>minaprine</b> affects DA metabolism by acting, at least partially, at presynaptic level through in-vivo inhibition of MAO activity...|$|E
40|$|Subchronic (5 mg/kg {{daily for}} 9 {{consecutive}} days) but not acute <b>minaprine</b> treatment enhanced in vivo dopamine release in the limbic {{part of the}} striatum of rats as revealed by intracerebral microdialysis. Moreover, the same subchronic treatment with <b>minaprine</b> reduced immobility in the forced swimming test. The anti-immobility effect of <b>minaprine</b> was not evident after a single injection of the antidepressant. Finally, the subchronic treatment with <b>minaprine</b> was devoid of effects in an activity test. These results suggest that enhanced dopaminergic transmission {{may contribute to the}} pharmacological and clinical profile of this drug...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the antidepressant effects of <b>minaprine</b> and amitriptyline in a group of 60 outpatients suffering from a major depressive episode as defined by the DSM III. The 6 -week study was double-blind with a random allocation of treatment. Patients were treated with flexible daily doses of 200 - 300 mg of <b>minaprine</b> and 50 - 75 mg of amitriptyline. Both drugs showed significant global antidepressant efficacy with {{no significant difference between the}} two treatment groups. The Hamilton item 'psychomotor retardation' improved earlier with <b>minaprine</b> than amitriptyline. The incidence of anticholinergic adverse effects was significantly higher in the amitriptyline treatment group...|$|E
40|$|The {{psychomotor}} {{and cardiovascular}} effects of <b>minaprine</b> 100 mg, a novel antidepressant, {{were compared with}} amitriptyline 25 mg, as a positive control, and placebo in a single dose randomised double-blind crossover trial using an automated psychomotor test battery (APT), postural sway (PS), blood pressure (BP) and pulse in nine young and nine elderly healthy subjects. Analysis of variance, taking into account baseline values, showed that continuous attention test (CAT), critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT), decision making test (DMT) and paired word association (PWA) were significantly impaired with amitriptyline compared with <b>minaprine</b> and placebo. <b>Minaprine</b> {{did not differ from}} placebo. Amitriptyline significantly lowered supine systolic blood pressure (BP) and all treatments produced significant decreases in heart rate in young and elderly. No age effect on psychomotor performance was seen. <b>Minaprine</b> compared favourably with amitriptyline using the APT with the doses used. The APT is useful in the evaluation of new drugs on psychomotor performance...|$|E
40|$|Post-training {{administration}} of <b>minaprine</b> (2. 5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently improved retention of an inhibitory avoidance response in mice. Animals receiving nine daily injections of 5 mg/kg and administered a challenge dose post-training showed {{an improvement in}} memory consolidation similar to that produced by acute injection of 10 mg/kg. The effects on retention performance induced by the drug appear {{to be due to}} an effect on memory consolidation. They were observed when drugs were given at short, but not long, periods of time after training, i. e. when the memory trace was susceptible to modulation. Moreover, these effects are not to be ascribed to an aversive or a rewarding or non-specific action of the drugs on retention performance, as the latencies during the retention test of those mice that had not received a footshock during training were not affected by post-training drug administration. The effects of an acutely injected dose (10 mg/kg) of <b>minaprine</b> {{as well as those of}} a challenge dose (5 mg/kg) of the drug administered to repeatedly treated animals were reversed by pretreatment with either selective D 1 or D 2 dopamine receptor antagonists SCH 23390 and (-) -sulpiride administered at per se non-effective doses (0. 025 and 6 mg/kg, respectively), thus suggesting that D 1 and D 2 receptor types are similarly involved in the effects of <b>minaprine</b> on memory consolidation. These results show that <b>minaprine</b> improves memory consolidation and that repeated drug administration leads to potentiation of this effect. Moreover, the effects of <b>minaprine</b> on memory consolidation are related to its dopaminergic action...|$|E
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{clinically}} effective antidepressants prevent the behavioral effects of experimental stress, {{and some of}} these treatments affect mesolimbic dopamine (DA) functioning. Animal studies have demonstrated that repeated psychostimulant administration and repeated or chronic stressful experiences also affect mesolimbic DA functioning. These results could suggest homologies among stress, psychostimulants and antidepressants. The present experiments show that either repeated stress (120 min restraint daily for 10 consecutive days) or subchronic treatment with the antidepressant <b>minaprine</b> (5 mg/kg daily for 10 consecutive days) significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of 120 min of restraint on climbing, a behavioral response dependent on mesolimbic DA functioning. However, the antidepressant did not induce the altered sensitivity of presynaptic DA receptors promoted by repeated stress. Chronic stressful experience (13 days of food restriction) and repeated amphetamine (2. 5 mg/kg daily for 10 consecutive days) were as effective as subchronic <b>minaprine</b> in reducing immobility in the Porsolt's swimming test. However, whilst both stress and amphetamine enhanced struggling, <b>minaprine</b> promoted swimming. Finally, chronically stressed mice and mice pretreated with amphetamine showed enhanced sensitivity to amphetamine-induced locomotion, whilst this effect was absent in animals pretreated with the antidepressant. These results indicate that although chronic and repeated stress as well as amphetamine have some antidepressant-like behavioral effects, their mode of action could be different from that of clinically active substances...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} thienocycloheptapyridazines (3 aa-dd), {{structurally}} related to <b>Minaprine,</b> was synthesized and compounds tested for their affinity towards muscarinic receptors. All of them showed Ki {{values in the}} micromolar range towards both the antagonist 3 H-QNB and the agonist 3 H-OXO-M, thus indicating that they act as antagonists at the muscarinic receptors. Moreover a theoretical study was performed on their interaction behaviour with a three dimensional (3 -D) model of the human m 1 muscarinic receptor...|$|E
40|$|CYP 2 D 6 {{substrate}} {{status is}} a critical Go/No Go decision criteria in central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery efforts because the polymorphic nature of CYP 2 D 6 can lead to variable patient safety and drug efficacy. In addition, CYP 2 D 6 is disproportionately involved in the metabolism of CNS drugs compared with other drug classes. Therefore, identifying trends in small molecule properties of CNS-penetrant compounds that can help discriminate potential CYP 2 D 6 substrates from nonsubstrates would allow additional prioritization in the synthesis and biological evaluation of new therapeutic candidates. We report here {{the conversion of the}} CNS drug <b>minaprine</b> from substrate to nonsubstrate, as well as the conversion of the related CNS drug minozac from nonsubstrate to substrate, through the use of analog synthesis and CYP 2 D 6 enzyme kinetic analyses. No single molecular property strongly correlated with substrate status for this 3 -amino- 4 -methyl- 6 -phenylpyridazine scaffold, although molecular volume and charge appeared to be indirectly related. A parsed database of CYP 2 D 6 substrates across diverse chemical structures was assembled and analyzed for physical property trends correlating with substrate status. We found that a complex interplay of properties influenced CYP 2 D 6 substrate status and that the particular chemical scaffold affects which properties are most prominent. The results also identified an unexpected issue in CNS drug discovery, in that some property trends correlative with CYP 2 D 6 substrates overlap previously reported properties that correlate with CNS penetrance. These results suggest the need for a careful balance in the design and synthesis of new CNS therapeutic candidates to avoid CYP 2 D 6 substrate status while maintaining CNS penetrance...|$|E
