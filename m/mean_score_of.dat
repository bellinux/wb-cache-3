The aim {{of this study was to}} explore whether patients with chronic daily headache (CDH) and patients with chronic cancer pain (CCP) present with different pain, mood, and sleep quality profiles. Forty-seven patients diagnosed with CDH were matched by age and gender with 47 patients with CCP. The research instruments included the Brief Pain Inventory-Chinese version, the Profile of Mood States Short Form, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Taiwan Form (PSQI-T). Results revealed that there was no difference in pain intensity between the patients with CDH and those with CCP; however, the CCP group reported significantly higher mean levels of pain interference with daily life than did the CDH group. These two groups did not differ on the Total Mood Disturbance score; however, the CCP group reported significantly lower mean levels of vigor than did the CDH group. Moreover, there was no difference on the PSQI-T total score between these two groups; however, the CDH group reported higher <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> sleep disturbance, higher <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> use of sleep medications, lower <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> sleep efficiency, and lower <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> daytime dysfunction than did the CCP group.

Methods: Twenty seven male 7 to 9 year old students with learning disability and 27 age and sex matched normal conrols were selected with unprobable simple sampling. 27 In order to evaluate auditory selective and divided attention, Farsi versions of speech in noise and dichotic digit test were used respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{administer}} to Indian and Metis student in northern Saskatchewan, the Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test,which,purports to measure perceptual disorders, and to relate the HOD scores to criteria such as age, sex, academic achievement and the menstrual cycle. The sample consisted of three hundred and four male and female subjects between the ages of twelve and eighteen. Seven hypotheses were proposed. The Hoffer-Osmond Diagnostic Test consists of one hundred and forty-five true and false questions which are designed to measure visual, auditory, olfactory, touch, taste and time perception. High HOD scores indicate abnormality. The greater the degree of distortion evident in these areas, the greater the probability the individual suffers from subclinical pellagra, a term recently introduced to refer to these per­ceptual abnormalities. Previous data indicate that perceptual disorders interfere with learning. The results of this investigation and those of previous studies provide evidence as to the feasibility of using the HOD as a diagnostic tool for detecting perceptual changes which are associated with learning and behavioral problems. The findings clearly indicate that subjects with high HOD scores were also experiencing academic difficulties. 1. The <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> female subjects were significantly higher than the <b>mean</b> HOD <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> male subjects. 2.

The sample chosen for this study included 19 fourth year undergraduate students. The WBT was based on the five disciplines according to Senge (1991) as well as the seven habits of highly effective people (Covey, 1989). The tools for pre-and post- testing were LO model evaluation and knowledge of LO. The reliability of the instruments was 0. 9274 and 0. 9905 respectively. The data were analyzed by using mean (M) and standard deviation (SD), t-test and Pearson product-moment correlation. When pre- and post- tests <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> the LO model evaluation and the knowledge of LO were compared, the <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> post-test training were greater than the <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> pre-test training.
