30|$|The {{selection}} of battery bank depends on nominal system voltage, required load current {{to run the}} boat at a particular speed and selected day of autonomy. There are different types of batteries available at the market—valve-regulated lead acid (VRLA) battery, Lithium ion battery, etc. VRLA batteries are <b>maintenance-free</b> <b>battery</b> bank, whereas the depth of discharge of lithium ion batteries is twice of that of VRLA batteries. VRLA battery is selected as the energy storage for our proposed system due to comparatively lesser cost. The batteries can be charged by its roof top solar panel or by national grid at a dock. The onboard automatic battery charger controls the correct charging rate and is always plugged-in.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} change the {{existing}} status of big turning radius of the large direct seeding machines with diesel and gasoline as fuel and improve the low efficiency and time-consuming condition of the machine driven by human or animal, an electric rice planter was designed. The mechanical parts and circuit design had been finished. The rear wheel shaft, seeding wheel, seeding frame and other key parts had been designed. The charging circuit of the maintenance-free storage battery and the power supply circuit of the DC motor had been given. The main technical parameters of the rice planter as follows, L * B *H: 1700 * 1200 * 1200 (mm), row distance* planting distance*width = 250 * 200 * 1000 (mm).

40|$|The {{conventional}} Lead-acid batteries contain antimony as the {{alloying element}} that poisons the negative plate thereby facilitating premature evolution of hydrogen {{gas from the}} surface of the negative plate requiring periodical maintenance by way of adding distilled H 2 O. In order to eliminate these effects, either low antimony – low cadmium or antimony free alloys are employed resulting in low maintenance or <b>maintenance-free</b> <b>batteries</b> that are presently in use in large quantities for various applications. In this paper, the authors compare the performance of flooded lead-acid cells with grid substrates containing Pb- low Sb- low Cd, Pb-Ca and a combination of both for positive and negative plates by subjecting the assembled cells at 5 hr discharge rates at different temperatures...|$|R

5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in <b>maintenance-free</b> automotive <b>batteries,</b> in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of innovative modular standard technologies with an interdisciplinary approach can meet all {{the requirements for}} the creation of a sustainable rural electrification strategy. This concept has been applied to the electrification of the village of Darsilami in Gambia, where a North-South partnership-based collaboration between different stakeholders has been initiated. The first steps towards the sustainable electrification of Darsilami village have been realized. The power station is based on AC coupling (single phase, 230 V, 50 Hz) and fed by two strings of photovoltaic modules, each of 1500 Wp, oriented south with a 15 degrees of inclination angle. When solar radiation is insufficient to supply the loads, these are fed from <b>maintenance-free</b> solar <b>batteries</b> (30 x 2 V, 300 Ah). A 9 kW back-up diesel generator starts whenever the power from PV and batteries is insufficient to meet the load. All the generators are coupled on the AC side using innovative inverter technology, which will allow the capacity of the power system to be easily expanded according to the future needs of the village population. The training of staff for local operation and maintenance increases the system's reliability. Additionally, a long-term monitoring system has been integrated and will provide highly valuable historical data. In order to promote the future replication of such rural electrification projects with renewable energies, it is essential to establish a local scientific structure which goes far beyond the training of local technicians...|$|R
