5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for games like Spec Ops: The Line is too small.

5|$|The Han dynasty {{inherited}} the ban liang coin type from the Qin. In {{the beginning of}} the Han, Emperor Gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private minting of coins. This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow Grand Empress Dowager Lü Zhi (d. 180 BC), who abolished private minting. In 182 BC, Lü Zhi issued a bronze coin that was <b>much</b> <b>lighter</b> in weight than previous coins. This caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2.6g (0.09oz) in weight.|$|E
5|$|Zeus had {{initially}} been proposed {{in an era}} when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the Soviet fleet was thought to contain a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US deterrent fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, even a small number of missiles aimed at Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One was a heavy defensive system that would provide protection over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a <b>much</b> <b>lighter</b> system that would use only 1200 missiles.|$|E
5|$|During McCartney's {{early years}} with the Beatles, he {{primarily}} used a Höfner 500/1 bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, {{in contrast to the}} <b>much</b> <b>lighter</b> Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.|$|E

5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became <b>much</b> <b>lighter.</b> Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
5|$|Patch {{initiated}} a new offensive {{just as the}} 38th Division began {{to withdraw from the}} inland ridges and hills that it had occupied. On 20 January, the 25th Infantry Division, under Major General J. Lawton Collins, attacked several hills, designated Hills 87, 88, and 89 by the Americans, that formed a ridge that dominated Kokumbona. Encountering <b>much</b> <b>lighter</b> resistance than anticipated, the Americans seized the three hills by the morning of 22 January. Shifting forces to exploit the unexpected breakthrough, Collins quickly continued the advance and captured the next two hills, 90 and 91, by nightfall, placing the Americans in position to isolate and capture Kokumbona and trap the Japanese 2nd Division.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} partly migratory, northernmost populations deserting their {{breeding}} areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia {{south of the}} breeding range. Birds in northern Fennoscandia and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights. Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the Isle of May in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983. Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring passage is <b>much</b> <b>lighter</b> than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration.|$|E

5|$|Variety subreticulatus, like variety boralis, has a {{generally}} darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies {{much more than}} either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and purple red. With age it changes to a cinnamon red or a rusty rose color, with yellowing toward the margin. The pore surface {{is similar to that}} of the main speciesyellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is <b>much</b> <b>lighter</b> and sometimes not appearing to stain when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety subreticulatus is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south to Florida, and west to Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Prudente {{was badly}} damaged in the {{engagement}} and had lost heavy casualties, including 27 killed and 22 wounded. Losses and damage on Daedalus were <b>much</b> <b>lighter,</b> {{with only one}} sailor and one Royal Marine killed and eleven wounded. Ball conducted hasty repairs and then brought the captured Prudente into Table Bay on 15 February. There the captured ship was condemned by the port commander Captain George Losack: although Prudente was a high-quality ship the naval facilities at the Cape Colony were insufficient to conduct the necessary repairs and the French frigate was not subsequently commissioned into the Royal Navy. As a result, there were few rewards for the action, unusually the junior officers of Daedalus were not promoted {{in the aftermath of}} the battle. Among the prisoners taken from Prudente was a deserter from the Royal Navy named Thomas Tring, who was subsequently court martialed and hanged.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though {{there is still much}} debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a <b>much</b> <b>lighter,</b> farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E

5|$|Unhexquadium {{should be}} a soft metal like mercury, and {{metallic}} unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently. It {{is also expected to}} be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4eV. It should also have some similarities to oganesson {{as well as to the}} other group 12 elements. Unhexquadium {{should be a}}t most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum. Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158pm, very close to that of the <b>much</b> <b>lighter</b> magnesium, despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474u, about 19.5times as much as that of magnesium. This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61g·cm−3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47g·cm−3). Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable, as the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding. Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point.|$|E
