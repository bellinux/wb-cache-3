40|$|The <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>method</b> (<b>MT)</b> {{consists}} in {{the observation of}} the surface natural variations of the electromagnetic field in {{a broad range of}} periods. The apparent resistivity is proportional to the modulus of the surface impedance, which is the tensorial relation between the horizontal components of the electric with the magnetic field. The subsurface resistivity distribution is obtained by inverting the apparent resistivity. The method of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been applied to investigate the dynamics of apparent resistivity, which. represents {{one of the most important}} scientific challenges in the studies devoted to the geophysical monitoring. Our results show that during July 2003 the time series representing variations of the apparent resistivity in the seismic area of Val d'Agri (southern Italy) are persistent at all the periods considered, tending to pure randomness with the increase of the period. Due to the relationship between the period and the depth, the observed variations are compatible with resistivity changes in the shallow layers...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, the <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>method</b> (<b>MT)</b> {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} cost-effective technique for subsurface resistivity monitoring (see Rees et al. 2016, for a general introduction). As this {{is a relatively new}} application for MT, there are few modelling tools available. Peacock et al. (2012) have used differences in MT phase tensors to qualitatively interpret resistivity changes due to fluid injection in an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) at Paralana, South Australia. This technique has also be used by Didana et al. (2017) interpreting change at the Habernero EGS. Recent work includes parameterising resistivity changes as a three-dimensional (3 D) plume structure and inverting using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Rosas-Carbajal et al. 2015). Another approach has been to use 1 D layer-stripping, where the effect of overlying structures is removed to model the time-varying magnetotelluric responses at depth (Ogaya et al. 2016). Standard MT modelling tools such as inversion can also be adapted, for example Rees et al. (2016) use cascading two-dimensional (2 D) inversions to model a coal-seam gas depressurisation, where the results from the pre-injection inversion are used as a prior-model for the post-injection. An improvement on cascaded inversion has been implemented by Rosas-Carbajal et al. (2012), where differenced 2 D MT inversions have achieved high accuracy by subtracting the prior-model response from all data and reducing the data error. High-accuracy simultaneous time-lapse 1 D MT inversions have also been approximated using 2 D MT codes (e.g. Rees et al. 2016; Didana et al. 2017); however, this approximation leads to small errors in the calculation of the forward-model and hence inversion result.|$|E

Data were modelled to derive a geo-electrical model using 2 -dimensional inverse techniques. Low resistivity values ( 981 Ohm. m) coincide with the southern part of the Pontide Magmatic Arc, the KÝrßehir Block and the Tauride-Anatolide Belt and are interpreted as upper crust of igneous and metamorphic origin. Low resistivity values (< 981 Ohm. m) are identified below the upper crust and the layer accepted as lower crust ranges from 10 — 15 km beneath the high resistive zones. Total crust thickness is approximately 45 km in the Tokat Massif, KÝrßehir Massif and Tauride-Anatolide Platform. Two vertical conductive zones have been detected beneath the Ankara-Erzincan Suture in the north and the DivriÛi-PÝnarbaßÝ Ophiolitic Belt in the south. The northern conductive zone identifies the Ankara-Erzincan Suture and the southern conductive zone corresponds to the DivriÛi-PÝnarbaßÝ Ophiolitic Belt where it provides evidence for an Inner Tauride Suture. The relationship between the gravity and resistivity data has been researched and the high gravity anomalies were found to be consistent with high conductive zones along the MT profile...|$|R
30|$|In {{the study}} {{reported}} here, I provide the first {{detailed description of the}} deep crustal geo-electric structure for this unexplored region from Chinchpada to Godhra using the <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method.</b> The <b>MT</b> <b>method</b> is considered {{to be one of the}} best methods for imaging models that envisage the presence of fluids, underplated material, and melt at the deep crustal depths (for a review, see Jones, 1992). Consequently, the use of MT in delineating deep crustal structures, as discussed here is a well-accepted and popular method that is applied world-wide. For example, MT studies (Wannamaker and Doerner, 2002) conducted in the Ruby mountains imaged resistive structures close to deep crustal, steeply dipping fault zones. It has been inferred that the zones acts as conduits for upper crustal-induced electric current flow and, therefore, that the lower crust is heterogeneous. It has also been inferred that the crustal breaks would decrease the effective elastic thickness and represent the deep crustal fault zones in which major earthquakes nucleate (Wannamaker and Doerner, 2002). Some of the more recent studies have linked high-conducting anomalies in the deep crust with the presence of graphite and resistive anomalies in the upper-middle crust and with igneous complexes of variable age (Almeida et al., 2005). MT studies (Bologna et al., 2005) from the Alto Paranaiba igneous province identified silicic dry rocks in the lower crust (20 – 40 km) based on high resistivities (1, 000 – 10, 000 ohm-m).|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of fluids in rocks {{can change the}} mechanical {{response of the medium}} by micro-cracking, hydro-fracturing, inducing the pore connectivity and reducing the effective normal stress (Bürgmann and Dresen 2008). As a consequence, temporal and spatial fluid variations at crustal depths are proposed to influence the tectonic processes and earthquake generation (Rice 1992; Byerlee 1993; Sibson 2014). Aqueous saline fluids and partial melts within the rock matrix of geological formations could enhance the bulk conductivity of rocks by several orders of magnitude via ionic conduction. <b>Magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> is able to investigate the geo-electric structure up to several hundreds of kilometers depth and has proven to be capable in designing hypotheses for fluid-induced tectonic mechanisms (e.g., Ritter et al. 2005; Jiracek et al. 2007; Wannamaker et al. 2009; Unsworth 2010).|$|R
30|$|The <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> {{has been}} applied to show {{resistivity}} variations {{in the vicinity of the}} epicenter of the 1999 Düzce earthquake (Mw = 7.2) where a large rupture velocity difference was seen between the western and eastern parts of the epicenter. MT data for frequencies ranging between 320 and 0.0005 Hz were acquired along two parallel profiles to the west and the east of Düzce earthquake’s epicenter. Both profiles crossed the Düzce basin and the Düzce fault in the north and the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) in the south. MT data analysis shows almost two-dimensionality in the region, at the depth starting from 2 – 3 km beneath the surface. According to two-dimensional MT modeling, a higher resistive layer extends beneath the eastern side of Düzce earthquake epicenter, compared with the western side. This resistivity structure correlates well with the aftershock distribution of the Düzce earthquake.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> {{has been}} among the {{favorite}} supporting tools for seismic imaging of sub-salt and sub-basalt targets. In this paper we present an example from Kachchh, India (where basaltic rocks overlie Mesozoic sedimentary rocks) and discuss the feasibility of using MT as an exploration tool in a geological setting such as this. Our results highlight the difference in magnetotelluric response caused by the thin intrabasalt layering. The key issue addressed in this paper is what MT can and cannot provide in such geological settings. First, we compute apparent resistivity and phase response curves using representative resistivity-depth models and borehole data from the study area. Later, we compare these results to assess the plausibility of using MT to image the subvolcanic sediments at Kachchh. Finally we substantiate our discussion through one-dimensional inversion of the field observed MT data from this region that exhibits poor sensitivity of MT for thin basalt layers...|$|R
30|$|We {{investigated}} the deep crustal resistivity structure across Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL), {{one of the}} most dangerous active intraplate faults in Japan, by use of wide-band <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method.</b> The 28 <b>MT</b> stations were aligned perpendicular to the ISTL. A two-dimensional model was created in transverse magnetic (TM) mode where electric currents flow in N 60 °W-N 120 °E directions. The model showed good correlations with the surface geology. In particular, we found a thick (∼ 6 km) surface conductor to the east of ISTL which corresponds to the heavily folded sedimentary layer. The Japan Alps to the west of the ISTL is characterized by the resistive upper crust, where the pre-Tertiary rocks crop out. The Japan Alps is underlain by a conductor below 15 – 20 km depth, which is consistent with the low seismic velocity anomaly. We also found a localized shallow conductor corresponding to the Mt. Tateyama volcano. The most important feature is the conductor in the mid-crust directly under the area of active folding to the east of the ISTL. This may imply a localized zone of fluids because of the enhanced porosity in a shear zone. The recent seismicity clusters in the resistive crust underlain by the conductor, and this suggests the fluid involvement in earthquake generation processes.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for the filtering of magnetotelluric data in urban areas. The <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> is a valid technique for geophysical exploration of the Earth’s interiors. It provides information about the rocks’ resistivity and in particular, in volcanology, it allows to delineate the complex structure of volcanoes possibly detecting magmatic chambers and hydrothermal systems. Indeed, geological fluids (e. g. magma) are characterized by resistivity of many orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding rocks. However, the <b>MT</b> <b>method</b> requires the presence of natural electromagnetic fields. So in urban areas, the noise strongly influences the MT recordings, especially that produced by trains. Various denoising techniques have been proposed, {{but it is not}} always easy to identify the noise-free intervals. Thus, in this work we propose a neural method, the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to perform the clustering of impedance tensors, computed on a Discrete Wavelet (DW) expansion of MT recordings. The use of the DW transform is motivated by the need of analyzing MT recordings both in time and frequency domain. The results of the SOM based clustering analysis applied to synthetic data have shown the capability of greatly reducing the effect of the noise on the retrieved apparent resistivity curves...|$|R

40|$|The <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> is {{introduced}} as a geophysical tool to monitor hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs {{and to help}} constrain how injected fluids propagate. The <b>MT</b> <b>method</b> measures the electrical resistivity of earth, which is altered by the injection of fracturing fluids. The degree to which these changes are measurable at the surface is determined by several factors, such as the conductivity and quantity of the fluid injected, {{the depth of the}} target interval, the existing pore fluid salinity, and a range of formation properties, such as porosity and permeability. From an MT monitoring survey of a shale gas hydraulic fracture in the Cooper Basin, South Australia, we have found temporal and spatial changes in MT responses above measurement error. Smooth inversions are used to compare the resistivity structure before and during hydraulic fracturing, with results showing increases in bulk conductivity of 20 %– 40 % at a depth range coinciding with the horizontal fracture. Comparisons with microseismic data lead to the conclusion that these increases in bulk conductivity are caused by a combination of the injected fluid permeability and an increase in wider scale in situ fluid permeability.

30|$|The {{fundamental}} assumption {{underlying the}} <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> is that external source fields have wavelengths that are large {{compared to the}} fundamental length scale characterizing electromagnetic (EM) induction in the Earth—that is, the skin depth (e.g., Weidelt and Chave 2012). With the assumption of a quasi-uniform source, the impedance (transfer function, TF, relating electric to magnetic fields at a point on the Earth’s surface) is well defined and independent of the actual (large-scale) spatial structure of the source fields. Because EM induction in a conductor is a diffusive process, the impedance and other uniform source TFs used in MT (e.g., vertical magnetic field TFs) should be very smooth functions of frequency (Weidelt 1972). Indeed, excessively rapid variations in TF curves estimated from field data are often taken as evidence of source complications, most often due to relatively short-wavelength anthropogenic EM signals such as electric trains (e.g., Larsen et al. 1996; Egbert 1997; Egbert et al. 2000). Possible biases in MT TFs due to complications in naturally occurring external sources are also occasionally considered, but generally only at long periods (>  1000  s) and near the auroral or equatorial electrojets (e.g., Viljanen 2012, and references therein).|$|R
40|$|The <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> {{has been}} applied to the {{determination}} of the deep resistivity structure of the northeastern margin of the Parnaiba Basin.

The MT data were processed to yield the TE- and TM-mode responses and then corrected for static shift using central-loop and single-loop TEM data, respectively. Regularized 2 D MT inversion was subsequently undertaken using a structured initial model with the near-surface constrained by TEM inversion results. As a consistency check, we performed another set of 2 D inversions using different smooth initial models. The various optimal 2 D inversion models show clearly the presence of a major basement trough, over 2 km deep, located about 70 km from the coast. We interpret it as possibly marking the main basin margin and suggest that it may have implications for groundwater resource development in the area...|$|R
40|$|The {{depressurization}} of {{coal seam}} gas formations causes in situ fluids to migrate through pores and fractures in the earth. The removal or discharge of {{large volumes of}} water from coal measures reduces in situ fluid pressure allowing natural gas {{to be released from}} the coal matrix. This process results in a time-dependent resistivity variation in the subsurface. Increasing the connectivity of in situ fluids may lead to a reduction in resistivity of the targeted lithologies. A correct assessment of such resistivity variations is of significant interest not only for the industry to optimize production and extraction well locations but also for the regulatory bodies, in which a desire for a reliable method for monitoring changes in subsurface fluid distribution allows sound risk assessment of potential environmental hazards. From an industrial field study conducted in Queensland, Australia, we have found that the <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> in the bandwidth of 100 Hz to 100 s could be used to monitor changes in the bulk resistivity of depressurized lithologies.

Continuous MT recording could allow us to evaluate whether possible variations are significantly correlated with the seismic activity of investigated area. To assess the significance of such observations we must be able to say how well an apparent resistivity curve should be reproduced when measurements are repeated at a later time. To do this properly it is essential to know that the estimated error bars accurately represent the true uncertainties in comparing the transfer functions. In this work we will show the preliminary results obtained from the analysis of the data coming from the new MT monitoring network installed in Agri Valley. This analysis gives us the possibility: i) to better study the temporal stability of the signals, ii) to better discriminate the noise affecting the measures by remote reference estimation.

40|$|William Gilbert {{announced}} in 1600 that the Earth {{is a great}} magnet. Since that time, numerous methods and techniques {{have been developed to}} utilise the many properties of the Earth’s natural magnetic field. One such geophysical technique utilises the time changes in the natural geomagnetic ﬁeld, which occur with frequencies from kilohertz to periods of the order of one day, to investigate the electrical properties of the Earth. When time changes with periods of the order of several seconds to one day are used, the technique {{is referred to as the}} <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method.</b> The <b>MT</b> <b>method</b> is a way of determining the distribution of the Earth’s electrical conductivity structure from measurements of the naturally occurring time changes in the electric and magnetic fields on the ground surface. For a complete description of the geo-electromagnetic field, five orthogonal field components must be recorded. The ﬁve data components are referred to as X, Y, H, D and Z, all being functions of time. The first two data components are the potential differences between two points on the Earth’s surface. X is a measure of the induced electric ﬁeld in the north-south direction, Y is a measure of the electric field in the east-west direction. H, D and Z represent the three orthogonal components of the magnetic field. H is a measure of the magnetic field in the north-south direction, D is a measure in the east-west direction and Z is the vertical component. In practice, a sixth data channel is also recorded. This channel is temperature which is used to correct the instruments response to thermal effects. The six-channel MT instrumentation produces analogue output of the ﬁeld values. These voltages are sampled at a discrete rate that defines the sampling interval simultaneously on all six channels. A discrete six-channel time series, suitable for computer analysis, is thus formed. The goal of each field MT system is to obtain such data over a long continuous period of time (say six months) to act as a data base for subsequent analysis. The data base will consist of time variations of the Earth’s electric and magnetic fields recorded every 5 s. Five such field systems are arranged in a spatial array, giving 30 data channels of simultaneous magnetotelluric data. Such an MT-based ﬁeld monitoring system is to be set up in western Turkey, a region which is seismically active and earthquake prone. The purpose of the experiment is to use the recorded data base to investigate stress-induced changes in the crust of the region which may be detected by the fields recorded...|$|R

Mishina (2009) conducted MT surveys along three survey lines across the northern edge, central part, and southern edge of the aftershock area (Figure  1) and estimated resistivity distributions based on two-dimensional (2 -D) inversions. The models showed low-resistivity anomalies around the earthquake area that imply crustal fluid flows. They also showed significant differences among the resistivity profiles, which indicate strong three-dimensionality. However, 2 -D inversion of a strong three-dimensional (3 -D) resistivity structure often results in inaccurate models (e.g., Siripunvaraporn et al. 2005 b). Additionally, MT data were not measured around the epicenter of the main shock. In this study, we conducted wide-band MT measurements around the epicentral area and updated the resistivity models based on a 3 -D inversion. Then, we interpreted the geological and thermal heterogeneity based on the estimated resistivity model and discussed the relationship between the earthquake and these heterogeneities.|$|R

The assumptions of a plane wave and of an electrical resistivity that varies only with depth imply that the fields can be measured in any direction {{as long as they are}} orthogonal. The impedance is said to be invariant under rotation of coordinates. On the other hand, when the resistivity distribution varies laterally this azimuthally symmetric model breaks down. The data are no longer a scalar but a 2  ×  2 tensor whose elements depend on the coordinate system. However, it is still possible to compute scalars that are invariant under rotation and that may benefit the interpretation process. The effective impedance of Berdichevsky and Dmitriev (1976) obtained from the determinant of the tensor is the archetypical that exemplifies the incentives of using invariants in the interpretation of two-dimensional (2 D) data. These assets have been illustrated by Pedersen and Engels (2005), who remarks as the most important asset that the sounding curves are the same regardless of the assumed azimuth. In fact, the sounding curves are the same regardless of the variations of azimuths from site to site and from frequency to frequency.|$|R

Phreatic eruptions are intrinsically {{connected to the}} hydrothermal systems present within volcanic edifices, given that these eruptions often contain ash consisting of hydrothermally altered minerals (e.g., Ohba and Kitade 2005). In addition, volcanic hydrothermal systems are often associated with low permeable clayey layers that consist of hydrothermally altered minerals and commonly develop within the shallow levels of volcanic edifices (e.g., Wright et al. 1985; Pellerin et al. 1996).

The primary goals of the survey were to determine the first order nature of major crustal and upper mantle boundaries and to define electric structures that may provide information on the structural and tectonic evolution of the region.

Electrical geophysical imaging using the <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> first detected thick, electrically conductive sequences believed to represent late Cretaceous to Oligocene marine sedimentary rocks. The conductive section occurs at depths from about 1 km to 10 km in the area west of a line between Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, extending westward to a line between Mt.

The anomalous rocks appear to be very near the surface in the axis of anticlines that bring Eocene marine shales to shallow depths. Careful consideration of physical properties and the correspondence of the morphology of the units to known fold sets suggests that the high conductivities are related to lithologic/stratigraphic units rather than to variations in physical properties. Our preference for the lithology of the anomalous section, based upon a study of regional geology and structure, is one dominated by marine shales of Eocene and older age.

40|$|Based on the geochemical results {{presented}} by Kraml et al. (this volume) the proposed high-temperature reservoir was traced by resistivity methods. To cover an exploration depth down to approximately 10 km {{a combination of}} the transient electromagnetic (TEM) and <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>methods</b> have been applied. 2 -dimensional resistivity models have been calculated and used for horizontal resistivity maps at several depth levels. The resulting resistivity structure may be interpreted as a high-temperature geothermal reservoir: • high resistivity at shallow depth down to approximately 500 m, • very low resistivity between 500 and 1000 m depth interpreted as clay cap fingering out laterally, and • localized slightly increasing resistivities interpreted as advancement into the hottest part of the reservoir at about 2200 m depth below the surface. At greater depth around 4000 m below surface the major NW-SE rift trend within the high-resistive Precambrian basement can be distinguished by its resistivity structure. The interpretation of an intense alteration in the subsurface only to the W of Ngozi volcano deduced from MT and TEM measurements is supported by a prominent magnetic low with coinciding lateral extent, indicating demagnetization by alteration of the originally magnetic volcanic rocks forming the clay cap of the geothermal reservoir. Deep exploration wells (about 2200 m) could be located according to the resistivity model derived. However, additional MT measurements are recommended to define the southward extension of the geothermal upflow zone more precisely. Additionally, deep temperature gradient wells reaching the top of the clay cap in about 500 m depth would further constrain the presented model and reduce resource related risk for the drilling of deep exploration wells. 1...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} are {{a potential}} energy resource and hazard for drilling and infrastructure, yet estimates of global volume vary by over three orders of magnitude. Hydrates are electrically resistive compared to water saturated sediment and so electromagnetic methods provide an additional tool to seismic surveys and drilling for determining hydrate saturations. A marine electromagnetic survey {{was carried out}} at Hydrate Ridge, Oregon, USA, {{with the aim of}} testing the use of controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) and <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>methods</b> to map gas hydrate and free gas below the gas hydrate stability zone. A 2 -D CSEM inversion supports the scenario deduced from previous seismic and drilling results, which indicate two mechanisms of hydrate emplacement: a transport-dominated and reaction-dominated regime. A prominent resistive region of 2. 5 – 4 ?m at a depth of about 130 mbsf, near the seismic bottom simulating reflector (BSR), suggests that 27 to 46 per cent of the bulk volume is filled with hydrate, depending on whether Archie's Law or the Hashin-Strikman bounds are used. This is representative of a reaction-dominated regime for hydrate emplacement, and where a significant low velocity zone exists based on a seismic tomography inversion, suggests large quantities of free gas below the BSR. Electrical resistivity logging while drilling (LWD) data show general agreement with the CSEM inversion model except for a CSEM-derived resistive region at seismic horizon A, known to transport free gas into the gas hydrate stability zone. Inversion of MT data collected simultaneously during the CSEM survey provides a complimentary low-resolution image of the shallow sediments and shows folding in the accretionary complex sediments similar to that imaged by a tomographic seismic velocity model...|$|R

This application affords the unusual opportunity to study the percolation of water from a lake into a fault system {{and its effect on}} the induced seismicity. MT measurements were carried out in the period range 0. 0046 – 420 s at nine sites along a 15 km-long North–South profile crossing the Kalabsha Fault, on the western bank of Lake Aswan. Data were analysed by 2 D simultaneous inversion of both polarisations. The resulting model is compared with the local seismicity map and reveals the conductive signature of the fault, as well as geological and tectonic stresses prevailing in the Aswan area. Our MT investigations show the following features: The measured MT strike aligns with the seismic epicentre axis corresponding to the Kalabsha Fault. While crossing the Fault, enhanced conductivity is found down to depths of 5 km on a 1 – 2 km profile segment. At mid-crustal depths (20 km), a very high conductive body is found to coincide with the main seismic cluster in the Aswan area. These observations indicate that seismic activity and high electrical conductivity are related. The link between them is the presence of crustal fluids which are presumably the cause of the high conductivity observed. Their presence is also required to trigger the observed seismicity. In addition, we explain the lower conductivity of the local upper crust in terms of stress-modulated rock porosity. We believe that these results are of general significance, as they could explain the mid-crustal seismicity of tectonically active zones...|$|R

Exploring The Mediterranean: New Concepts In An Ancient Seaway, 8 - 10 April 2013, Barcelona, SpainOn the Western {{edge of the}} Mediterranean, {{the slow}} {{convergence}} of the Iberian and African plates is marked by very intricate tectonic activity, marked {{by a combination of}} small-scale subduction and sub-lithospheric downwelling. Delamination or convective instability has also been proposed to have occurred beneath this domain during the past 25 My. And different geodynamic models have been proposed to explain the lithospheric structure of the arc-shaped belt (Betic and Rif orogenies) and the opening of the Alboran Basin. As part of several international projects carried out in this area, <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>methods</b> have been used to explore the crust and upper mantle. We present results of electromagnetic studies in the Western Mediterranean, focusing specially in the recently work on the Alboran sea as part of a marine MT survey. Land MT studies have already imaged an area of low resistivity coincident with an area of low velocities without earthquake hypocenters, interpreted as asthenospheric material intruded by the lateral lithospheric tearing and breaking-off of the east-directed subducting Ligurian slab under the Alboran Domain. The marine data show complex MT response functions with strong distortion due to seafloor topography and coast effect, suggesting a fairly resistive lithosphere beneath the seafloor. The 3 D marine MT inversion model shows an anomalous conductive slab towards the Eastern Alboran basin, suggesting a possible hydration of mantle material from an Eastward subducting slab. Both the land and marine MT data suggest that the most likely scenario for the opening of the Alboran Basin is related to the westward rollback of the Ligurian subducting slabPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful {{geophysical}} tool to discover even the deep subsurface structures. The target function of the MT data processing is the surface electromagnetic (EM) impedance. In case of practical MT exploration the surface EM impedance is computed based on a simplification related to the nature of the ionospheric source of the surface EM signals. Assuming that the ionospheric current systems result in homogeneous surface electromagnetic variations, the uncertainty of the computed surface electromagnetic impedance tensor depends only the duration of the EM observation. However the surface EM field can only be approached by plane waves in certain time periods and besides given uncertainty. The EM impedance may be sensitive to magnetospheric and -indirectly- interplanetary circumstances and solar activity. Four years continuous observation of telluric and surface geomagnetic components allowed to perform a representative survey to discover if geomagnetic activity has any effect on observed EM impedance tensor. Geomagnetic indices (Dst, ULF-index, ASY-H, SYM-H) have been used to classify dates according to geomagnetic activity. Processing to estimate the mean surface EM impedance tensor has been performed in each dataset, each class separately. The sensitivity and the characteristics of the answer of the EM impedance tensor to the geomagnetic disturbances seems to be definite. This presentation aims to briefly summarize the preliminary results of our study based on the unique dataset of the Széchenyi István Geophysical Obsevatory (Intermagnet code:NCK). In addition, pointing out the limitations of the routine way of practical MT data processing and interpretation is an important duty of this study. This study was supported by the TAMOP- 4. 2. 2.

40|$|Non-invasive, {{high-resolution}} imaging of {{the shallow}} subsurface {{is needed for}} delineation of buried waste, detection of unexploded ordinance, verification and monitoring of containment structures, and other environmental applications. Electromagnetic measurements at frequencies between 1 and 100 MHz are important for such applications, because the induction number of many targets is small due, {{and the ability to}} determine the dielectric permittivity in addition to electrical conductivity of the subsurface is possible. Earlier workers were successful in developing systems for detecting anomalous areas, but no quantifiable information was accurately determined. For high resolution imaging, accurate measurements are necessary so the field data can be mapped into the space of the subsurface parameters. The authors are developing a non-invasive method for accurately imaging the electrical conductivity and dielectric permittivity of the shallow subsurface using the plane wave impedance approach, known as the <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method</b> at low frequencies. Electric and magnetic sensors are being tested in a known area against theoretical predictions, thereby insuring that the data collected with the high-frequency impedance (HFI) system will support high-resolution, multi-dimensional imaging techniques. The summary of the work to date is divided into three sections: equipment procurement, instrumentation, and theoretical developments. For most earth materials, the frequency range from 1 to 100 MHz encompasses a very difficult transition zone between the wave propagation of displacement currents and the diffusive behavior of conduction currents. Test equipment, such as signal generators and amplifiers, does not cover the entire range except at great expense. Hence the authors have divided the range of investigation into three sub-ranges: 1 [...] 10 MHz, 10 [...] 30 MHz, and 30 [...] 100 MHz. Results to date are in the lowest frequency range of 1 [...] 10 MHz. Even though conduction currents dominate in this range, as in traditional electromagnetic exploration methods, little work has been done by the geophysical community above 500 kHz. ...|$|R
40|$|In the <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method,</b> {{naturally}} occurring electromagnetic fields {{are used to}} study the electrical structures of the Earth. The impedance estimates are dependent on the natural sources and conventional Fourier transform techniques are not particularly suitable. The main focus in this dissertation is to automatically detect and process the magnetotelluric signals and enhance the signal-to-noise ratios of the recordings with the wavelet transform method. It is shown that a MT transient can be identified and its signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced {{by taking advantage of}} the time-scale localization properties of these natural sources. When a complex Morlet wavelet is used, it is proved that the impedance can be directly calculated in the wavelet transform domain. Wavelet coherency and apparent wavelet impedance ratio are defined. The MT signals can be easily detected on the wavelet transform plane with the definition of wavelet coherency and the apparent impedance ratio. Synthetic and real examples are presented in the thesis. The MT c-response test for one dimensionality has been extended to data with errors. Two scalar indices are defined so that we can ascertain whether or not a structure is one-dimensional. This knowledge is important prior to any attempt at inversion or migration. For quickly imaging the near surface structure, the regularized Hopfield neural network inversion scheme and a fast imaging technique with EM migration are presented. The massively parallel processing of the Hopfield neural networks makes them suitable for hardware implementation; therefore, using the artificial neural networks has the potential of greatly speeding up MT inversion even in field operations. The EM migration technique can also effectively construct the conductivity discontinuities (i. e. reflection surfaces). Both methods are fast and can be easily implemented on a personal computer...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Phase Tensor marked a major breakthrough in the understanding, analysis and treatment of galvanic distortion of the electric field in the <b>Magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>method.</b> We build upon a recently formulated impedance tensor decomposition into the known Phase Tensor and an Amplitude Tensor that is shown to be complementary and algebraically independent of the Phase Tensor. This recent decomposition demonstrates that the Amplitude Tensor contains inductive and galvanic information of the subsurface and that the inductive information is physically coupled to the one contained in the Phase Tensor. In this work we present an algorithm that employs this last finding {{to show that the}} MT galvanic electric distortion tensor can be separated from the inductive Amplitude Tensor and hence, that this distortion can be recovered for any given data up to a single constant usually denoted as galvanic shift. Firstly, to illustrate distortion effects on the Amplitude Tensor, we manually apply distortion by matrix multiplication to synthetic impedance tensor data. Then, we use the observations of that analysis to define an objective function, which minimises when there is no distortion present in the Amplitude Tensor. Secondly, we describe our algorithm that employs a genetic algorithm to find the optimal distortion tensor needed to correct the Amplitude Tensor, and therewith the impedance tensor. Lastly, we test the performance of the proposed methodology on synthetic data of known distortion and random distortion, and on four real data sets. The real data sets, lit 007 /lit 008 and lit 901 /lit 902, demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm by revealing geological expected results in the impedance data for the first time, which could not be achieved before by alternative methods.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to use the {{transient}} electromagnetic (TEM) and <b>magnetotelluric</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>methods</b> to determine the electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface and locate possible structural features controlling groundwater distribution in the northern and south-eastern margins of Parnaiba basin, Brazil. MT data from 24 stations along two profiles across the margins of the basin have been processed using standard tensorial techniques to obtain the interpretable response functions. The TEM data recorded at the same sites facilitated the removal of static shift and the recovery of the near-surface structure. One-dimensional (1 -D) joint inversion of TEM and MT data yielded an approximate geoelectric structure for each profile. Subsequent two-dimensional (2 -D) modelling revealed a more realistic resistivity distribution for each profile. The result of 2 -D regularized inversion of MT data delineated the main sedimentary sequences and deep basement features. A resistive crystalline basement (â‰¥ 200 &OHgr;m) is overlain by relatively conductive sedimentary sequences of varying resistivities and thicknesses. The existence of a major basement trough at the expected position of a concealed fault in the north-eastern margin of the basin was proved by the MT model. This anomalous zone is interpreted to have a thick development of granular sediments and may be a good site for groundwater development. The 2 -D model for the south-eastern profile defined the position of a major fault, which is interpreted as Picos fault and may have implication for groundwater development. A graben-like structure is also suggested âˆ¼ 10 km further east from Picos fault and considered to be a good target for groundwater development. Overall, the 2 -D MT inversion results are consistent with the available geological information and offer new insights into the deep structure of the basin margins of Parnaiba basin. ...|$|R
40|$|Southwestern Tibet plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{protection}} of the ecological environment and biodiversity of Southern Asia but lacks energy in terms of both power and fuel. The widely distributed geothermal resources in this region could be considered as potential alternative sources of power and heat. However, most of the known geothermal fields in Southwestern Tibet are poorly prospected and currently almost no geothermal energy is exploited. Here we present a case study mapping the Mapamyum (QP) geothermal field of Southwestern Tibet using audio magnetotellurics (AMT) and <b>magnetotellurics</b> (<b>MT)</b> <b>methods.</b> AMT in the frequency range 11. 5 – 11, 500 Hz was used to map the upper part of this geothermal reservoir to a depth of 1000 m, and MT in the frequency range 0. 001 – 320 Hz was used to map the heat source, thermal fluid path, and lower part of the geothermal reservoir to a depth greater than 1000 m. Data from 1300 MT and 680 AMT stations were acquired around the geothermal field. Bostick conversion with electromagnetic array profiling (EMAP) filtering and nonlinear conjugate gradient inversion (NLCGI) was used for data inversion. The AMT and MT results presented here elucidate the geoelectric structure of the QP geothermal field, and provide a background for understanding the reservoir, the thermal fluid path, and the heat source of the geothermal system. We identified a low resistivity anomaly characterized by resistivity in the range of 1 – 8 Ω∙m at a depth greater than 7 km. This feature was interpreted as a potential reflection of the partially melted magma in the upper crust, which might correlate to mantle upwelling along the Karakorum fault. It is likely that the magma is the heat source of the QP geothermal system, and potentially provides new geophysical evidence to understand the occurrence of the partially melted magmas in the upper crust in Southwestern Tibet...|$|R
