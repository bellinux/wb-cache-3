This focus on changes in <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> differs from much previous work that examines <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> status (i. e., whether or not a person has a <b>mental</b> <b>illness).</b> It was found that maintaining employment after the onset of illness was associated with both <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> improvement and stability.

5|$|Health {{issues in}} American {{football}} comprise {{a large number}} of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses</b> like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various <b>mental</b> <b>illnesses,</b> such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

Methods: The sample included all working-age participants (ages 18 – 64) from the 2009 and 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N= 77, 326). Two well-established scales of mental health distinguished participants with none, mild, moderate, and serious <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Analyses compared employment rate and income by <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> se-verity.

40|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement that {{children should be}} educated about a parent‘s <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> For this to occur {{there are a number}} of areas which require further research. To date, little is known about what parents themselves think about the disclosure of <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> to their children. It is also unclear how the process of disclosure occurs in families with <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Children‘s own knowledge of parental <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> has not been systematically explored and it is not known what children know about aspects of their parent‘s illness. This thesis explored how families, where a parent has <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> discuss or do not discuss a parent‘s <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> This was explored from the perspective of different family members, including children whose parent has <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> the parent with <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> the partner of a parent with <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> ex-partners of parents with <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> and step parents of children who have a parent with <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Study One was an explorative qualitative study which aimed to examine parental beliefs about the disclosure of <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Semi-structured, face to face interviews were conducted with parents (n= 26) regarding their thoughts about disclosure to their children about the <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> of a parent. Participants included parents with <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> partners of parents with <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> ex-partners of parents with <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> and step parents of children whose parent has <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Participants ranged in age from 27 to 50 years old (mean age of 39 years). Interviews were audio taped and interview data was analysed using thematic analysis. Analysis suggested that disclosure about <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> is a difficult process and rarely are parents able or willing to provide their children with information about all aspects of their illness. Study two was an explorative study, utilising the Leventhal (1980) framework of illness understanding, which aimed to examine children‘s knowledge of their parent‘s illness. Children‘s ideas about the disclosure process were also examined. Semi-structured, face to face interviews were conducted with 40 children who had at least one parent with <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Participants ranged in age from 7 to 17 years old (mean age of 11. 9 years). Interviews were audio taped and subsequently analysed. Thematic analysis of the data suggested that children had varying degrees of understanding about their parent‘s <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> and that this was not often associated with the age of the child. The data within the second study also highlighted that {{there are a number of}} children who would prefer not to know about their parent‘s illness. In order to provide a comprehensive view of the disclosure of <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> within a family context, this thesis briefly examined the family view of disclosure as well as familial beliefs about <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Study three was a secondary analysis of selected findings from both studies one and two which aimed to compare three families‘ views about familial communication regarding <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> Individual family member‘s accounts of their beliefs about aspects of <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> were examined and compared with other family members‘ beliefs. The congruence and incongruence of family accounts was highlighted. This exploratory thesis provides a much needed insight into the experience of disclosure from both a parent and child perspective. It is also the first study to provide a structured examination of children‘s beliefs about parental <b>mental</b> <b>illness.</b> There are a number of key clinical implications which are informed by the findings of this thesis. The assumptions which underpin the claim that all children should be educated about a parent‘s <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> need to be carefully considered. Parents have difficulty explaining aspects of <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> to children and, importantly, some parents actively choose not to explain specific elements of <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> to their children. Some children do want more information about their parent‘s <b>mental</b> <b>illness,</b> however others actively avoid talking about the illness or avoid seeking out further information. From a clinical perspective, people working with parents with <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> or their children need to be mindful of the difficulties for both parents and children around the disclosure of <b>mental</b> <b>illness</b> to children.
