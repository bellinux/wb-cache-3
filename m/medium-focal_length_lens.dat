Both configurations are build upon state-of-the-art image-based rendering methods allowing the formal deduction of precise parameters of the cameras depending on the scene to be acquired. We present a proof of concept with the acquisition of a representative simplified scene. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each configuration...|$|R

5000|$|A lens with a {{focal length}} about {{equal to the}} {{diagonal}} size of the film or sensor format {{is known as a}} normal lens; its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance of the print diagonal, which therefore yields a normal perspective when viewing the print; this angle of view is about 53 degrees diagonally.

40|$|Calculation of the {{saturation}} ratio inside vortices formed {{below the}} filament in a sub-saturation zone {{in a cloud}} chamber was given.

However, when longer filaments were formed with the same laser pulse energy but longer focal <b>length</b> <b>lenses</b> (f = 50 and 80 cm), only condensation (mist) was observed.

50|$|Camera {{controls}} are interrelated. The {{total amount of}} light reaching the film plane (the 'exposure') changes with the duration of exposure, aperture of the lens, and on the effective focal <b>length</b> of the <b>lens</b> (which in variable focal <b>length</b> <b>lenses,</b> can force a change in aperture as the lens is zoomed). Changing any of these controls can alter the exposure. Many cameras may be set to adjust {{most or all of}} these controls automatically.

5000|$|Focusing {{distance}} range limiter switch: This switch {{is found}} on most longer focal <b>length</b> <b>lenses,</b> and macro lenses. It {{is used for}} limiting the focusing distance range of the lens when using it in autofocus mode. Most lenses have two settings; these are usually full focus range (from minimum focus distance to infinity), and distant focus range (from halfway point of focus range to infinity). Other lenses have three settings, with the additional setting usually being near focus range (from minimum focus distance to halfway point of focus range). Longer focal <b>length</b> <b>lenses</b> and macro lenses have a relatively long travel distance for the focusing mechanism inside the lens; this feature shortens the autofocus time. When the photographer knows they will not need a certain part of the focus distance range, limiting it will help shorten the autofocus time, and possibly prevent [...] "focus hunting".|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of microlens for data storage {{applications}} that has improved off-axis performance is described. The lens consists of a micro Fresnel pattern on a curved substrate. The radius of the substrate {{is equal to the}} focal <b>length</b> of the <b>lens.</b> If the pattern and substrate are thin, the combination satisfies the Abbe sine condition. Therefore, the lens is free of coma. We analyze a 0. 5 numerical aperture, 0. 50 mm focal <b>length</b> <b>lens</b> in detail.

5000|$|Also, when {{considering}} lens design, the [...] "APO" [...] designation is used more conservatively in astronomy-related optics (e.g. telescopes) and microscopy than in photography. For example, telescopes that are marked [...] "APO" [...] are specialized, fixed focal <b>length</b> <b>lenses</b> that are optimised for infinity-like distances whereas in photography, even certain relatively low-priced general-purpose zoom lenses {{are given the}} APO designation.|$|R
50|$|Designers of zoom lenses {{with large}} zoom ratios often trade {{one or more}} aberrations for higher image sharpness. For example, {{a greater degree of}} barrel and pincushion {{distortion}} is tolerated in lenses that span the focal length range from wide angle to telephoto with a focal ratio of 10× or more than would be acceptable in a fixed focal <b>length</b> <b>lens</b> or a zoom lens with a lower ratio. Although modern design methods have been continually reducing this problem, barrel distortion of greater than one percent is common in these large-ratio lenses. Another price paid is that at the extreme telephoto setting of the lens the effective focal length changes significantly while the lens is focused on closer objects. The apparent focal length can more than halve while the lens is focused from infinity to medium close-up. To a lesser degree, this effect is also seen in fixed focal <b>length</b> <b>lenses</b> that move internal lens elements, rather than the entire lens, to effect changes in magnification.|$|R
50|$|If the camera's angle {{was always}} the same, an optimal viewing {{distance}} could be easily calculated. However the camera's horizontal angle varies as the focal <b>length</b> of its <b>lens</b> changes. If the camera's sensor has fixed dimensions, a shorter focal <b>length</b> (wide angle) <b>lens</b> captures a wider angle of view, requiring the viewer to sit closer to the screen. Conversely, a longer focal <b>length</b> (telephoto) <b>lens</b> captures a narrower angle of view, demanding a more distant viewer position.|$|R
