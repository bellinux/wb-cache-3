5000|$|A maximum {{capacity}} 30 litre fuel <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be fitted. The factory <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be removed.|$|R
5000|$|Filling: {{the fuel}} <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be filled in a secure way, without sparks.|$|R
50|$|The propane <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> {{be placed}} {{as far away}} from the cooker as possible.|$|R
5000|$|If used underwater, the liquid-oxygen <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be well {{insulated}} against heat {{coming in}} from the water. As a result, industrial sets of this type may not be suitable for diving, and diving sets of this type may not be suitable for use out of water. The set's liquid oxygen <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be filled immediately before use. They include these types: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> be {{designed}} to safety standards appropriate for a pressure vessel, such as ISO 11439.|$|R
50|$|Every {{two levels}} the player <b>must</b> defeat a <b>tank</b> by {{shooting}} it {{a certain number}} of times within a time-limit.|$|R
50|$|The player, {{controlling}} a <b>Tank,</b> <b>must</b> destroy enemy <b>tanks</b> in each level, which {{enter the}} playfield {{from the top}} of the screen. The enemy tanks attempt to destroy the player's base (represented on the map as a bird, eagle, or Phoenix), as well as the human tank itself. A level is completed when the player destroys all 20 enemy tanks, but the game ends if the player's base is destroyed or the player loses all available lives.|$|R
5000|$|La Chapelle - In this scenario, US {{infantry}} forces {{supported by}} a section of <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> seize the village from a Germany Infantry force.|$|R
5000|$|Provide {{a method}} for {{determining}} level of fuel in tank, gauging (the remaining quantity of fuel in the <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be measured or evaluated).|$|R
50|$|An {{adequate}} {{system to}} carry water used for cooking, washing, toilet, bath or shower to a sewer, cesspool or settlement <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be in place.|$|R
50|$|In every entry Chief Engineer <b>must</b> record <b>tank</b> number, location, type of oil, {{description}} of operation, and quantity. For every operation a combined numerical and letter coding is applied. MEPC.187(59) describes the codes applicable as from 1 January 2011. Also comparison tables between older Oil Record Book coding with MEPC.187(59) {{are available in}} the web.|$|R
50|$|The Green and Tan armies {{are once}} again at war, this time by air. Players can select either the Huey, Chinook, Super Stallion or the Apache. In {{addition}} to the Tan Army are hordes of insects that players must also fight off. Players <b>must</b> protect <b>tanks,</b> trucks, other helicopters, a train, a teddy bear, and a UFO.|$|R
5000|$|When {{operated}} {{within an}} atmosphere, pressurization of the typically very thin-walled propellant <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> guarantee positive gauge pressure {{at all times}} to avoid catastrophic collapse of the tank.|$|R
50|$|Septic tanks {{also have}} a higher capital cost if they are being {{installed}} for new homes or if the existing septic <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> be replaced. If there is a suitable septic tank in place, pumping the effluent from the tank is the lowest cost option for initial costs. Whether the septic tank is the lowest cost option over time depends {{on the cost of}} electricity in the area, how often the <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be emptied and how much it costs to have the solids pumped out of the tank.|$|R
5000|$|Cryogenic storage <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> {{be able to}} {{withstand}} high pressure. High-pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and practicality.|$|R
50|$|Each non-bulk package, container, {{or small}} <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be labeled with a label code {{corresponding}} to the hazard class of the hazardous material being transported, and must follow design and placement requirements.|$|R
50|$|Grinder pumps can be {{installed}} in the basement or in the yard. If installed in the yard, the holding <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be buried deep enough that the pump and sewage pipes are below the frost line.|$|R
50|$|A {{cesspool}} or settlement <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be impermeable to liquids {{and have}} adequate ventilation. It {{must also have}} means of access for emptying, not harm the health of any person and not contaminate water or water supply.|$|R
5000|$|Escort - The EU forces <b>must</b> escort a <b>tank</b> past {{enemy lines}} and repair it if struck down, while the NRF {{forces will be}} tasked with {{preventing}} this, usually by constantly taking the tank down with RPGs.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{surge tanks}} are {{used on a}} select few {{aircraft}} to ensure that fuel does not spill over onto the ground when the fuel expands. These <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> be periodically emptied to prevent fuel from spilling, which they do fairly often.|$|R
50|$|To operate {{properly}} and efficiently, Quickmix's mixing <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> constantly rotate. However, the tank often gets stuck. On those occasions when it contains volatile chemicals that {{are allowed to}} settle for too long, the tank - and Quickmix - can be seriously damaged.|$|R
5000|$|Race mode, {{in which}} <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> race around an {{off-road}} course {{while attempting to}} stop other tanks from completing the course. Common techniques include using the in-game weapons to attack opponents and using physical tank contact to temporarily 'push' opponents off the course.|$|R
40|$|Polymer Matrix Composite (PMC) {{hydrogen}} tanks {{have been}} proposed as an enabling technology for reducing the weight of Single-Stage-to-Orbit reusable launch vehicles where structural mass has a large impact on vehicle performance. A key development issue of these lightweight structures is the leakage of hydrogen through the composite material. The rate of hydrogen leakage can {{be a function of}} the material used, method of 6 fabrication used to manufacture the tank, mechanical load the <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> react, internal damage-state of the material, and the temperatures at which the <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> operate. A method for measuring leakage through a geometrically complex structure at cryogenic temperature and under mechanical load was developed, calibrated and used to measure hydrogen leakage through complex X- 33 liquid-hydrogen tank structure sections...|$|R
25|$|Limit of boiler {{diameter}}: The boiler {{and water}} <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> fit within the loading gauge of the railway being run on. Above a certain diameter of boiler {{there is little}} or no room for water tanks to be added and still fit within the loading gauge.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tanks</b> <b>must</b> {{be cleaned}} {{from time to}} time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a tank. Also, when tanks are to be {{inspected}} or maintenance must be performed within a <b>tank,</b> it <b>must</b> be not only cleaned, but made gas-free.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles are {{required}} to meet certain safety regulations. Roll-cages must be fitted and be built to a suitable standard, recovery points must be fitted front and rear and fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> meet certain standards. A 4-point harness for all occupants is required and a fire extinguisher is recommended.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tanks</b> <b>must</b> {{be cleaned}} {{from time to}} time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a tank. Also, when tanks are to be {{inspected}} or maintenance must be performed within a <b>tank,</b> it <b>must</b> be not only cleaned, but made gas-free.|$|R
50|$|First, the <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be 'inerted' to {{eliminate}} the risk of explosion. An inert gas plant burns diesel in air to produce a mixture of gases (typically less than 5% O2 and about 13% CO2 plus N2). This is blown into the tanks until the oxygen level is below 4%.|$|R
50|$|Arcadia Valley State School is a {{government}} co-educational primary (P-7) school at 4831 Arcadia Valley Road. In 2013 the school had five students and two teachers (one full-time equivalent). The children come from local farms. The school does {{not have access to}} reticulated water and <b>must</b> depend on <b>tanks</b> filled by rainwater.|$|R
5000|$|Systems without drainback <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> {{circulate}} the HTF - {{regardless of}} {{the temperature of the}} storage tank - to prevent the HTF from degrading. Excessive temperatures in the tank cause increased scale and sediment build-up, possible severe burns if a tempering valve is not installed, and if used for storage, possible thermostat failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{player is}} given a budget {{which is to be}} used on buying tanks, making repairs and using {{different}} weapons. Every time the player wins, they earn more money. Replacement <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> be purchased, so if a player runs out of money and their last tank is destroyed, they are out of the game.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tanks</b> <b>must</b> {{be cleaned}} {{from time to}} time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a tank to prevent cross contamination. Another is to allow the tank to be {{inspected}} or for maintenance to be performed within a tank and to prevent product build-up on tank interior walls.|$|R
50|$|Maraetai's {{residents}} {{do not use}} city {{mains water}} and instead <b>must</b> use water <b>tanks</b> and bore water. Many residents prefer it to be kept this way to maintain the town's rural aspect. Maraetai's beaches are popular destinations for other Aucklanders and are often crowded in the summer months. The town {{is also home to}} the controversial pastor Brian Tamaki.|$|R
50|$|The tip tanks provide {{additional}} fuel capacity to enable longer times aloft. A jet pump installed in each tip tank transfers fuel into the wing tanks. Fuel can also flow via the flapper check valves into the wing tanks, but {{the lower half}} of the fuel in the tip <b>tanks</b> <b>must</b> be transferred with the jet pump.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of a {{liquefied}} gas such as hydrogen or chlorine, or a compressed gas such as compressed natural gas or MAPP, the storage <b>tank</b> <b>must</b> be made to withstand the sometimes immense pressures exerted by the contents. These tanks may be called cylinders and, being pressure vessels, are sometimes excluded from the class of [...] "tanks".|$|R
50|$|The player {{commands}} the platoon of 16 tanks presented on screen split in four pieces. Each piece is a command center for four units. The player <b>must</b> control the <b>tanks</b> by moving them and shooting on arcade screen and planning their moves on the tactical screen. Action is purely mouse-driven. A major consideration involves destroying buildings {{for money and}} preventing other from being destroyed.|$|R
