2500|$|At {{its lowest}} levels, the RMA can be {{implemented}} as a subsumption architecture, in which the world model is <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> to the controlled process or real world, avoiding {{the need for a}} mathematical abstraction, and in which time-constrained reactive planning {{can be implemented}} as a finite state machine. [...] Higher levels of the RMA however, may have sophisticated mathematical world models and behavior implemented by automated planning and scheduling. [...] Planning is required when certain behaviors cannot be triggered by current sensations, but rather by predicted or anticipated sensations, especially those that come about as result of the node's actions.|$|E

50|$|Instantaneously trained neural {{networks}} (ITNNs) {{were inspired by}} the phenomenon of short-term learning that seems to occur instantaneously. In these networks the weights of the hidden and the output layers are <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> from the training vector data.

50|$|Instances {{of these}} types are {{immutable}} and in optimized code are <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> to SIMD registers. Operations expressed in Dart typically are compiled into a single instruction with no overhead. This is similar to C and C++ intrinsics. Benchmarks for 4×4 matrix multiplication, 3D vertex transformation, and Mandelbrot set visualization show near 400% speedup compared to scalar code written in Dart.|$|E
50|$|The {{reachability}} graph of stochastic Petri nets can be <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> to a Markov process. It {{satisfies the}} Markov property, since its states depend {{only on the}} current marking. Each state in the reachability graph is mapped to a state in the Markov process, and the firing of a transition with firing rate λ corresponds to a Markov state transition with probability λ.|$|E
50|$|The library {{functions}} declared by conio.h vary somewhat from compiler to compiler. As originally {{implemented in}} Lattice C, the various functions <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> {{to the first}} few DOS INT 21H functions. The library supplied with Borland's Turbo C {{did not use the}} DOS API but instead accessed video RAM directly for output and used BIOS interrupt calls. This library also has additional functions inspired from the successful Turbo Pascal one.|$|E
50|$|An attractor's {{basin of}} {{attraction}} is {{the region of}} the phase space, over which iterations are defined, such that any point (any initial condition) in that region will eventually be iterated into the attractor. For a stable linear system, every point in the phase space is in the basin of attraction. However, in nonlinear systems, some points may <b>map</b> <b>directly</b> or asymptotically to infinity, while other points may lie in a different basin of attraction and map asymptotically into a different attractor; other initial conditions may be in or <b>map</b> <b>directly</b> into a non-attracting point or cycle.|$|R

Games released under the program may have the DualShock controls overlaid {{on top of the}} touchscreen, however for devices which have analog buttons such as the PlayStation Vita and Xperia Play, the controls are <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> to them. Developers can also make purely touch screen games, if they so choose.|$|E

All of these functions can be controlled directly through the CayenneModeler, a fully functional GUI tool. No XML- or annotation-based configuration is required. An entire database schema can be <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> to Java objects quickly, all from the comfort of the GUI-based CayenneModeler. These things together make Cayenne interesting for a user who is new to the enterprise world.|$|E

The VIC-II chip, {{also found in the}} Commodore 64, was <b>mapped</b> <b>directly</b> into main memory - the video memory and CPUs (the 8502 and Z80A processors) shared a common 128 KB RAM, and the VIC-II control registers were accessed as memory locations (that is, they were memory mapped).|$|E
