40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the evaluation of the useableness of the minimum intensity projection (MinIP) as additional method to the conventional 16 -channel CT-datasets, compared with MRCP as a reference method, in patients with biliary obstructions. 25 patients with biliary obstruction who received MDCT of the abdomen and MRCP without subsequent interventions were analysed. Coronal and axial MinIP were reconstructed from the MDCT-data. The evaluation of image quality and the quantitative comparison to MRCP was performed. The presence or absence of image quality limitations was recorded (movement artefacts, overlapping hypodense structures, delineation of dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and image noise), also the extent (most proximal level) of bile duct dilatation, as well as location and cause of biliary obstruction. Further the additional value in the visualization and diagnosis of the biliary system in MinIP compared to conventional MDCT was assessed. Motion artefacts caused by breathing were present in 3 / 25 scans, but the diagnostic evaluation was in all images allowed. Concerning bile duct visualization, the dilated intrahepatic bile ducts were clearly or fairly delineated. In the morphological comparison of dilatated bile ducts the results of the <b>messurements</b> in the MinIP images were superior to <b>messurements</b> of the conventional MDCT. Concerning the determination of ductal diameters with MRCP as the reference method, MinIP (r, 0. 979) was slightly superior to conventional MDCT (r, 0. 942). Conventional MDCT with averaged coronal and axial slices revealed correct classification in 10 of 25 cases (40 %; r, 0. 699). There were 14 cases with underassessment and one case with overassessment of the extent of the intrahepatic duct dilatation. With MinIP, the level of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation was consistent with MRCP in 25 of 25 cases (100 %; r, 1. 000). The evaluation of the additional diagnostic value of the MinIP revealed, that in 73 % of cases an improvement of the visualization of bile ducts was achieved. In 13 % of cases a better evaluation of bile duct obstruction was achieved, in one patient the suspected diagnosis was changed. Thus, MinIP reconstruction are a usefull addition to existing CT-datasets. However, {{there is a need for}} further studies to evaluate the MinIP reconstructions in comparison to MRCP or ERCP...|$|R

40|$|N-phthaloyl {{chitosan}} {{is able to}} form cholesteric liquid crystalline {{phase in}} concentrated solutions of some organic solvents, including DMF, DMSO, DMAc and pyridine [...] Circular dichroism was applied to investigate the change of handedness for the above four systems. CD spectra suggested two kinds of absorption peaks when the concentration was higher than a critical concentration for forming liquid crystalline phase. One is a sharp peak at 330 nm, {{the other is a}} broad peak with a maximum at about 400 - 450 nm. However only sharp peak at 330 nm was observed for isotropic solutions. The sharp peak was induced by the helical conformation of molecular chains, and the broad peak was induced by the cholesteric helices of liquid crystal. Therefore the determination of the critical concentration for N-phthaloyl chitosan solutions by monitoring {{the very beginning of the}} appearance of the broad peak is feasible. The critical concentrations measured by CD were 1 wt % lower than those measured by polarized optical microscopy (POM) for all four solvents used. It means, as a method to measure the critical concentration, CD is more sensitive than POM.

40|$|The {{subjects}} {{study were}} consisted of 20 nomal healthy males, {{two groups of}} 20 women each with normal menstrual cycle, one group of proliferative phase and the other of secretory phase, 10 castrated women, 11 climacteric women and 11 of various diseases. With 24 -hours urine collected carefully from these subjects, 10 fractions of 17 -KS were measured. For the estimation of fractions, 2 -step hydrolysis of β-glucuronidase hydrolysis and solvolysis was conducted first, then ether extraction, rinsed with water, washed again with alkali, dehydrated, dried and fixed, the separation of C(10) fractions was done by Florisil column chromatography with the methanol-chloroform system, and 10 fractions of 17 -KS were finally isolated by TLC using 55 cm glass plate. For colorimetry alcoholic Zimmemann's technic was conducted and each 17 -KS fraction of the 24 -hour urine was estimated. By these procedures, the following results were obtained. 1) After TLC of the purified extracts prepared by the two step hydrolysis, the percentage of β-glucuronidase hydrolysate and solvolysis hydrolysate was determined. As a result, {{it was found that}} urinary 17 -KS contains 67 % of β-glucuronidase hydrolysate and 33 % solvolysis hydrolysate. Of the fractions, Ⅳ, Ⅵ, Ⅷ and Ⅸ fractions in β-glucuronidase hydrolysate were over two-fold those in solvolysis hydrolysate. 2) By measuring 10 fractions of 17 -KS in 24 -hour urine from normal females at proliferative phase, secretory phase and from normal male, values and their ratios were established, The ratios of 10 fractions showed no appreciable difference due the sex gland but the values of Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅴ and Ⅵ fractions of normal males were more than twice those of normal females. These 11 -deoxy- 17 -KS said to compose the so-called sex gland system show distinct sex differences. Namely, in sum total normal males showed the values 1. 9 times of those of normal females. However, these could be seen no significant differences in these values between the women of proliferative phase and those of secretory phase. 3) In the comparative study of the effects of sex gland and adrenals on urinary 17 -KS and on the fraction ratio in the groups of castrated women and climacteric women on one hand, and nomal women and men on the other, Ⅳ, Ⅴ and Ⅵ fractions of the 11 -deoxy- 17 -KS groups seem to be derived from the sex glands. Especially, androsterone in normal men is six times that of castrated women, and that of normal women is 3 -fold that of castrated women. On the other hand, the excretin of the 11 -oxy- 17 -KS group is not much affected by castration, but as the fraction ratio is increased, this 11 -oxy- 17 -KS group seems to be derived from adrenals. Opinions are divided in that these are many who contend (9) 10) 11)) that the values of urinary 17 -KS are not affected by oophorectomy, and some (12)) claim that these can be observed no decrease in the 11 -deoxy- 17 -KS. However, these differences in the opinions seem to be due to the methods of <b>messurements</b> and the development of those. By the author's own results, the values of 11 -deoxy- 17 -KS are decreased by castration while 11 -oxy- 17 -KS values are somewhat increased. The sum total value of the fractions in the castrated women {{has been found to be}} 87 % that of normal women at proliferative phase. 4) In the fractionratios between castrated women and climacteric women Ⅲ, Ⅳ and Ⅴ fractions show higher values in the latter group but Ⅵ fraction said to belong to the sex gland system is found to show higher values in castrated women. This seems to be due to the formation etiocholanolone by passing the pathway of THS→ 11 -deoxy-cortol. 5) A new finding that cannot be overlooked and the like of which is not seen in the available literature is the fact average value of androstanedione excreted into urine is 840 μg in normal women, 1190 μg in nomal men, 900 μg in castrated women and 470 μg in climacteric women. 6) Some discussion was made simultaneously about estimated values of urinary 17 -KS fractions in several diseases with abnomality in the sex gland and adrenals, though the cases studied were only a few in number...|$|R

Para isso, foram selecionados nove pacientes adultos, edêntulos da maxila e com seu reborde alveolar com pelo menos três meses de cicatrização pós exodontias, os quais receberam seis implantes de hexágono externo, instalados de forma intercalada e aleatória, ou seja, um implante de plataforma expandida (XP) e o siguinte de plataforma regular (ST) até completar os seis implantes. Todos os casos foram reabilitados em um período máximo de 24 horas após a instalação dos implantes, por meio de próteses provisórias fixas parafusadas de acrílico sem reforço metálico fundido. Os controles radiográficos ocorreram imediatamente depois da instalação das próteses denominado Tempo 0 = T 0; seis meses (Tempo 6 = T 6) e 12 meses (Tempo 12 = T 12). Também foi avaliada durante esses mesmos períodos a estabilidade dos implantes através da Análise de Frequência de Resssonância (Osstell Mentor) e denominados período 0, 6 e 12 = P 0, P 6, P 12, respectivamente. Dos 54 implantes instalados, um implante não osseointegrou e foi removido no controle de seis meses. Os resultados radiográficos mostraram perda óssea cervical presente em ambos os tipos de implantes. Os implantes ST com seis e 12 meses mostraram 1, 61 e 1, 99 mm de perda no sentido vertical respectivamente e no sentido {{horizontal a}} perda foi de 1, 07 e 1, 35 mm. Entretanto os implantes XP mostraram redução estatisticamente significante, apresentando no sentido vertical perda ossea de 1, 21 e 1, 76 mm em seis e 12 meses, e no sentido horizontal perda de 0, 89 e 0, 96 mm, respectivamente. Dentro dos limites deste estudo, pode-se considerar que a utilização do conceito platform switching nos implantes constitui uma opção viável para a redução da perda óssea peri-implantar durante o primeiro ano de observação deste trabalho. In the present study, {{the main purpose}} was to evaluate radiographically during six and twelve months after implants installation the cervical bone around external hexed implants with expanded platform (XP 5. 0 mm) and regular platform (ST 4. 1 mm) using 4. 1 mm diameter abutments for both implants system and supporting a full fixed temporary acrylic bridge submitted to immediate loading. Nine maxillary edentulous patients were treated {{in this study and}} each one received six external hexed implants, three of these implants were 5 mm diameter expanded cervical platform (XP, Biomet 3 i, USA) and the other three implants were regular diameter cervical platform (ST 4. 1 mm, Biomet 3 i, Brazil). All installed implants received standard diameter components (4. 1 mm Biomet 3 i), characterizing the platformswitching concept on the XP implants. The implants installation was performed in an alternating fashion. The installation process always was initiated from {{the right side of the}} mouth with one type of implant; the next implant had a different diameter at the cervical part. It all finalized with the installation of six implants on the left side of the maxilla. All cases were treated in a single surgical procedure to reduce trauma, using less drilling sequence to increasing the initial implant stability and the prosthetic components were installed during surgery to perform the ISQ analisys with the Osstell Mentor system. Final impression was taken for the fabrication of the fixed screw retained acrylic bridges, using the provisional metal sleeves for micro-unit abutments and delivered to the patients within 24 hours after surgery. At the placement of the restorations, 6 and 12 months later (named Time 0 = T 0, Time 6 = T 6 and Time 12 = T 12) radiographs were performed using the conventional parallel cone technique to observe the cervical bone behavior during these three periods. These x-rays were digitalized and measured with the Radio Cef/Radio Imp software. Also the ISQ of all implants was messure at abutment connection during surgery or Period 0 = P 0, six and 12 months later (P 6 and P 12, respectively). From the 54 implants placed, only one failed during the first control time, six months later. Peri implant cervical bone loss was found for both types of implants.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} the present study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that intravenous quinidine, unlike procainamide, causes direct vasodilation and reflexly mediated increases in sympathetic nerve activity. Background. Intravenous quinidine can cause significant hypotension. Animal ejsprimente have suggested that quinidine blocks alpha-receptors and also refers vascular smootSi muscle by a nonadrenergic mechanism. In a recent study we showed that intravenous procainamide causes peripheral vasodilstion, hypotension and inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity in humans. Intraarterial procainamide, however, did not cause vasodilation. Methods. Postganglionie muscle sympathetic nerve traffic was recorded from the peroneal nerve at the fibular head with tungsten microeiectrodes, and forearm blood flow was measured with venous occlusion plethysmography. Central venous pressure was measured directly. The direct effects of quinidine on vascular resistance were determined with brachial artery quinidine infusions and <b>messurement</b> of ipsilateral forearm blood flow. Results. In eight normal subjects intravenous quinidine (8 mg/kg body weight infused for 27 min) decreased mean arterial pressure from 87 ± 3 (mean ± SE) to 83 ± 3 mm Hg, central venous pressure from 6. 3 ± 0. 6 to 5. 0 ± 0. 7 mm Hg and forearm vascular resistance from 32. 2 ± 5. 5 to 25. 3 ± 4. 7 U (all p < 0. 05). Heart rate increased from 67 ± 4 to 77 ± 5 beats/min and muscle sympathetic nerve activity from 288 ± 70 to 660 ± 151 U/min (both p < 0. 05). In five subjects intravenous nitroprusside that caused similar hemodynamic effects produced similar increases In sympathetic nerve activity. In eight subjects graded infusions of quinidine into the brachial artery (0. 37, 0. 74 and 1. 48 mg/min) produced dose-dependent decreases in ipsilateral forearm vascular resistance and marked attenuation of forearm vasoconstriction caused by the cold pressor test. Conclusions. These data show that quinidine, unlike procainamide, causes vasodilation directly and, when given intravenously, is associated with barorefles-mediated increases in sympathetic nerve activity...|$|E
