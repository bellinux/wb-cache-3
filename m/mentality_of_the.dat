5|$|The story {{focuses on}} the {{activities}} of the three species {{in a part of the}} Milky Way known as the Koprulu Sector. Millennia before any of the events of the games, a species known as the Xel'Naga genetically engineer the Protoss and later the Zerg in attempts to create pure beings. These experiments backfire and the Xel'Naga are largely destroyed by the Zerg. Centuries before the beginning of StarCraft in 2499, the hardline international government of Earth, the United Earth Directorate (UED), commissions a colonization program as part of a solution to overpopulation, however the computers automating the colony ships malfunction, propelling the Terran colonists far off course to the edge of Protoss space. Out of contact with Earth, they form various factions to maintain their interests. Intrigued by the behavior and <b>mentality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Terrans, the Protoss remain hidden to examine the humans, while protecting them from other threats without their knowledge. The Zerg, however, target the Terrans for assimilation to harness their psionic potential, forcing the Protoss to destroy tainted Terran colonies to contain the Zerg infestation.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the 7th Armoured Division {{encouraged}} {{a belief in the}} Royal Tank Regiment, that manoeuvre could win battles but the engagement with the Babini Group on 24 January, also led to the conclusion that armoured divisions needed more artillery. No integration of tanks and infantry was considered necessary or that anti-tank guns should be used offensively and the lack of cover from air observation in the desert encouraged dispersion to avoid air attack, where the British lacked air superiority, {{at the expense of the}} concentration of fire power at the decisive point. Due to the exiguous nature of supply and transport, conservation during lulls also encouraged the use of small jock columns, of a motorised infantry company, a field-gun battery and several armoured cars. The success of such columns against the Italians, led to exaggerated expectations which were confounded, when better equipped and trained German troops arrived in Libya. The 7th Armoured Division concluded that the defensive <b>mentality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italians, had justified the taking of exceptional risks which would be unjustified against German troops.|$|E

The team was in a four-way tie for first place. The Hawks however failed to reach the MCAL Finals. The Hawks were the #6 seed in the NCS playoffs. The Hawks faced the MCAL champions in a NCS playoff game and came away with a convincing 10-3 victory.

500|$|The Workmans {{struggled}} with labor problems continually, needing local porters to carry gear {{for them because}} they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi-month expedition.

The locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman, which made Fanny's position difficult. The Workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high-handedness. Kenneth Mason maintains in his history of Himalayan mountaineering, written in 1955, that [...] "The Workmans were, on their journeys, the victims of their own faults.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the authoritarian ideology and educational policy of two dictatorial regimes of 20 th century Greece: <b>the</b> Metaxas' dictatorship <b>of</b> 1936 - 1941 (<b>the</b> 4 th <b>of</b> August regime); and <b>the</b> military junta <b>of</b> 1967 - 1974 (<b>the</b> 21 st <b>of</b> April regime). Although viewed comparatively, the regimes in question are {{shown to have}} been different, due to crucial differences stemming from their contemporary international and domestic settings. Moreover, their ideologies were shaped by the way dictatorial rulers perceived and interpreted their reality. Influenced by the inter-war fascist context, <b>the</b> 4 th <b>of</b> August regime tried to accommodate a radical fascist rhetoric to a nationalistic and traditionalist set of beliefs. Metaxas' perception of reality was exemplified in his educational policy, through which the dictator unsuccessfully tried to mobilise from above the youth, on <b>the</b> imported model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fascist youth movements. <b>The</b> 21 st <b>of</b> April regime contrasted sharply with the post-war international liberal environment, while its ideology was marked by the distinct and often contradictory <b>mentalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonels. The contradictions and inconsistencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military mind were reproduced at the educational level, as the military rulers attempted to demobilise a highly organised youth, to reverse the previous liberal educational reforms and to appoint loyalists to key posts. So, while <b>the</b> 4 th <b>of</b> August saw <b>the</b> legitimation <b>of</b> its authority in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> an openly authoritarian discourse and <b>the</b> mobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> youth, <b>the</b> 21 st <b>of</b> April regime, by contrast, torn by <b>the</b> conflicting <b>mentalities</b> <b>of</b> its military rulers, sought legitimacy through clientelistic networks <b>of</b> support and <b>the</b> demobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> youth...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor millennia, {{the woman}} has been marginalized by society, her place being near {{children}} and husband and less within the male-dominated world, <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> business, politics, and economy. <b>The</b> <b>mentalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, the traditions and the prejudices have led to laws restricting <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> women to work, in general, or to practice certain professions. Regarding the professions exercised by women throughout history, {{there is in the}} Romanian language a rich terminological material, which can prove, on one hand, a socio-economic reality - persistent discrimination against working women, and on the other hand, the lexical processes underlying <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class <b>of</b> feminine names <b>of</b> professions. <b>The</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary Romanian society's spirituality, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation's aspirations, is emphasized by the states in which the “working woman” appears. Moreover, sociologists emphasize the fact that, in time, although the women's emancipation led to <b>the</b> broadening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizon as far as choosing a profession goes, there continues to exist a clear discrimination against women in <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> some professions and, especially, <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> occupying leadership positions. Our paper, made based on an inventory of terms excerpted from various documents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixteenth century - until the nineteenth century, but also from texts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current Romanian language, highlights the fact that feminine names of professions represent a heterogeneous lexical group, both in terms of form and terms of provenance...|$|R
