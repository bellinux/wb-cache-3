As an emerging professional development strategy, educator <b>micro-credentials</b> can enable our public education system to continuously identify, capture, recognize, and share the best practices of America’s educators so all teachers can hone their existing skills and learn new ones.|$|E
40|$|This study, {{commissioned}} by Digital Promise and conducted by research firm Grunwald Associates, examines {{the attitudes of}} a nationally representative sample of 856 K- 12 teachers toward professional development and competency-based <b>micro-credentials.</b> Survey questions included asking teachers: {{what they know about}} <b>micro-credentials</b> under which circumstances would they earn them what would convince them to earn one Their answers reinforce the critical role professional development plays in expanding teachers' skills, knowledge and careers [...] both formally and informally. Although only 15 percent of teachers were initially aware of the concept of <b>micro-credentials,</b> after learning more, 65 percent are interested in trying to earn one. These teachers value that <b>micro-credentials</b> are both competency-based and personalized. Teachers also emphasize that they must be easy to use and accessible if educators are going to try them...|$|E
40|$|Learners and {{employees}} constantly acquire new skills, competencies, knowledge and capabilities in both {{formal and informal}} environments. This fragmentation of learning and diversity of environments presents a unique challenge to employers, educational organisations and learners. How can all the learning that has occurred be accurately measured, recognised, validated and acknowledged? Recent investigations of micro-credentialing ecosystems at the Waikato Institute of Technology (Wintec) have focused on English language learning. Wintec are investigating both the infrastructure and framework to empower learners to create a holistic view of their achievements through the pictorial display of earned <b>micro-credentials</b> collections. These collections enable learners to signal current capabilities and personal achievement to their peers, lecturers, teachers and social groups. They allow institutions to review and assess the abilities of individuals and then guide the creation of personal, educational development plans. This presentation reviewed four interwoven and overlapping activities 1 : Critical features, both pedagogical and technical, of mature and maturing micro-credentialing ecosystems will be explored. 2 : How Self-Reflective frameworks, guiding learners to appropriate level of activity, are created. 3 : How badges / <b>micro-credentials</b> are earned and displayed within a learning management system. 4 : How e-portfolios {{can be used to}} display credentials earned...|$|E

40|$|Higher Education Institutions are {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} provide more flexible student learning pathways – in degree {{programs as well as}} through the introduction of methods for <b>micro-credentialing.</b> However, the rhetoric of establishing such open and personalised learning pathways is far easier than the reality of implementation and organisational change. For instance, universities have long struggled to break away from the “credit hour ” even while learners are being challenged to be more independent in their learning choices and education needs. The intent {{of this paper is to}} explore new models of education that embrace open learning pathways for lifelong learning and productive participation in the information age. The paper draws on the recent research and experiences gained from running a simultaneous xMOOC and cMOOC (a dual layer MOOC) using newly developed software based on the principles of student self-regulated learning. The software, ProSOLO, links a user’s nominated learning goals and experiences directly with their achievement of stated competencies. This process provides learners with greater autonomy in their study by removing the rigidity of more traditional education programs and offers new models of <b>micro-credentialing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} explored how e-portfolios {{and digital}} badges {{could be used}} in health education and nursing. It demonstrated, through a practical example, how individual performance was monitored through the award of <b>micro-credentials</b> / digital badges. Digital awards are used as valid indicators of accomplishment, skill, knowledge, or interest. In formal educational environments endorsed badges, with defined assessments, can be used for certification purposes. Indeed, it can be argued a badge ecosystem could create a broader picture of educational achievement by providing the infrastructure for individual learners to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and achievements through the display of endorsed badge collections...|$|E
30|$|This study, {{especially}} the full 2 -phase study, {{is likely to}} have implications for policy with respect to teacher certification, endorsements, and credentialing, including the possibility of alternative credentialing. State endorsement and/or certification requirements can drive new teacher certification programs offered by institutions of higher education. With many certified teachers feeling ill-equipped to implement integrated STEM, and recognizing needed shifts in the mindsets and practices of teachers and students that it entails, educational opportunities that are more substantial than isolated in-service workshops appear to be needed. So as not to reproduce the requirements and investments of a pre-service education for teacher certification, however, alternative credentials or “stackable” <b>micro-credentials</b> may be desirable, allowing teachers to flexibly apply STEM in various areas of specialization.|$|E
30|$|It is also notable how digital {{technologies}} are also {{often used to}} promote the reconfiguration of education into a commodity state – i.e. framing education processes and practices into ‘market forms’ that have calculable and quantifiable value, and that are therefore exchangeable. One of the values implicit in many popular instances of digital education is the reconfiguration of educational practices and relations into forms that can be quantified and exchanged; governance practices are increasingly directed by market rationales, supported and fostered by principles of international ranking based competition (Diez, 2018). This {{can be seen in}} the increased use of online metrics, measurements and ‘analytics’, as well as the ‘unbundling’ of components of university learning in the form of <b>micro-credentials,</b> blockchain based programs and certifications, or digital portfolios.|$|E

40|$|Foreign {{language}} learning has been increasingly influenced by constructivist approaches to learning and teaching. These approaches, placing the learner at {{the centre of}} the teaching and learning experience, requires educationalists to critically review existing teaching strategies, techniques, methods and beliefs. For Japanese medical professionals English has become increasingly important. There is growing need for these professionals to understand and use English at conferences and/or workshops, to keep up to date with medical processes and procedures published in Western medical journals and there are ever increasing opportunities to communicate with other medical staff and patients in English. However, the curricula at medical schools in Japan are so extensive that the time allocated for English classes is usually very limited, which means those classes often do not have the depth or scope to improve the English communication skills of medical students to the level necessary for their future career. This paper explores the development of a design framework that provides learners with the motivation and skills to access learning materials independent of time-tabled study. It outlines how the authors integrated a self-reflective framework and <b>micro-credential</b> / badge ecosystem in the learner centric courses created. It illustrates how this design framework was implemented in a medical terminology course...|$|R
40|$|There is now {{a plethora}} of Massive Open On-line courses (MOOCs) offered worldwide. Whilst many MOOCs focus on discipline-specific content, little {{attention}} has been paid to how MOOCs can explicitly help participants develop generic employability skills such as communication, digital literacy, global citizenship and the like. Similarly little attention been paid to explicitly assuring the quality of MOOCs with respect to alignment with regulatory body standards. Deakin University 2 ̆ 7 s first MOOC, DeakinPrimer, is an introduction to humanitarian responses to 21 st century disasters. It has been designed to assist participants to explicitly evidence generic or employability skills, some of Deakin 2 ̆ 7 s eight Graduate Learning Outcomes (GLOs) including communication, digital literacy, critical thinking and global citizenship. Other key features of DeakinPrimer include opportunities for networking with fellow participants and experts within the humanitarian field, and the opportunity to apply for credit towards the Graduate Certificate in International Community Development (level 8 in the Australian Qualifications Framework [AQF]) and for those with a prior Bachelor degree, the Masters in Humanitarian Assistance or the Masters of International Community Development (level 9 in the AQF). DeakinPrimer is designed as a test bed for a learning innovation, particularly <b>micro-credentialing</b> GLOs using digital badges to enable self and peer endorsement of evidence of learning. Badging is integrated in two ways. Firstly, DeakinPrimer participants build portfolios of learning artefacts associated with learning activities, then assess their work against a set of holistic, generic learning outcomes standards rubrics. If they judge their evidence as meeting the required standard, they can claim a badge (self endorsement) associated with particular GLOs. Secondly, participants can request and provide peer feedback and endorsement (using peer badges). The integration of self and peer review in the assessment tasks helps participants develop important employability skills, the ability to critically self-reflect on their own work and critically analyse the work of others and provide evidence-based feedback. DeakinPrimer is scheduled to commence in July 2013. This paper explains the way in which the course curricula has been designed to use technologies to enable participants to curate evidence of learning, and self and peer endorse such learning against defined standards...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} made about the "disruption" afforded by open {{learning}} to higher education. While {{it is the case}} that open learning offers opportunities for free content and courses within university studies, self-determined student-generated learning has yet to create meaningful pathways towards credentialing in higher education. In this chapter we explore open learning and a learning journey through an Imaginarium {{from the perspective of a}} citizen in the context of a global human rights campaign. The chapter speculates the possibilities for gaining recognition of graduate attributes developed informally outside the institution, yet weaving through open education resources, when the citizen applies to study in an Australian University. We conclude by arguing the importance of seeing emerging developments in Australia related to open learning, <b>micro-credentials,</b> aligned learning outcomes (ALOs) and criterion referenced assessments (CRAs) through a recognition lens. 22 page(s...|$|E
40|$|For {{the last}} 20 years the {{benefits}} of networked communities, interactive media, online tutorials, and e-learning applications have been investigated {{for the provision of}} education in New Zealand In monitoring individual performance, a range of measures can be used, such as allocated grades, credits earned, and activities completed. These specific measures are institutionally controlled, have limited reach beyond the institution and, in isolation, do not truly represent a learner’s progress, proficiency or acknowledge a learner’s achievements. This paper argues that digital <b>micro-credentials,</b> often called badges, can be used as valid indicators of accomplishment, skill, knowledge or interest. In formal educational environments endorsed credentials, with defined learning outcomes, can be used for certification purposes. This paper will contend that micro-credentialing ecosystems create a broader picture of a learner’s educational achievement by providing the infrastructure for individual learners to demonstrate their knowledge, skills and achievements through the display of endorsed digital micro-credential collections...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Badges enable {{academic}} and non-academic learners {{to collect and}} display their achievements and to enhance their training and qualification repertoire. To support engagement in class-based and online modules we have introduced badge ecosystems backed up by University quality assurance procedures. This paper presents two case studies which exemplify the application of badges at the University of Derby and the possibilities for future developments of badge ecosystems. Class-based: Forensic anthropology/Osteology A sequence of badges in the Forensic Anthropology module was implemented to support students as they develop their understanding of osteology and anatomy. In this context, the implementation of badges relies {{on the use of}} learning outcomes that support learning and the assessment of practical knowledge as well as student’s ability to observe key features in the subject. Online MOOCs The University of Derby (UoD) have incorporated badges in a series of MOOCs that include: “Bridging the Dementia Divide: Supporting People Living with Dementia (2015); Digital. Me: Managing your Digital Self (2015); Operations Management (2016); a re-run of Supporting People Living with Dementia (2016) and Autism, Asperger’s and ADHD (2016). Throughout these, badges were used to reward degrees of completion and have an association with a favourable average completion rate across four of the MOOCs. The use of badges at the University has been led by academics staff and the Innovation Hub as part of a Badges Working Group. The innovative approaches to badges and badge ecosystems have been supported by the development of a University infrastructure for badge development including: •	Schema to back-up <b>micro-credentialing</b> •	Quality assurance processes and •	University badge server The UoD Working Badges Group and Quality Assurance The use of digital badges supported by the University’s quality framework means that we are rewarding meaningful learning, have increased badge credibility with our own badge server for issuing badges. In this way we have assured the integrity of the badges not just being University of Derby by branding but through the University as the issuing organization. Conclusion The UoD has incorporated badges to provide recognition for the learning, achievements and contributions of our class-based and MOOC learners, and the credibility of our badges will increase further as we move towards further implementation by academics and departments through the use of the badge framework. This could allow our digital credentials to be used by partners and other educational institutions and will act as an incentive for the UoD to continue its focus on badge development, quality and credibility...|$|R
