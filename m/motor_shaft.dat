25|$|In {{magnetic}} motors, {{magnetic fields}} are formed {{in both the}} rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields {{gives rise to a}} force, and thus a torque on the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft.</b> One, or both, of these fields must be made to change with the rotation of the motor. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.|$|E
25|$|In a WRIM, {{the rotor}} winding {{is made of}} many turns of {{insulated}} wire and is connected to slip rings on the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft.</b> An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power {{that would otherwise be}} wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft</b> engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|E
50|$|A more {{sophisticated}} form of splash lubrication, long-used for rotating <b>motor</b> <b>shafts</b> rather than reciprocating engines, was the ring oiler.|$|R
25|$|Early exchanges were {{electromechanical}} systems using <b>motors,</b> <b>shaft</b> drives, rotating {{switches and}} relays. Some types of automatic exchanges were the Strowger switch or step-by-step switch, All Relay, X-Y, panel switch and the crossbar switch.|$|R
40|$|A motor {{controller}} system uses a rotary sensor with {{a plurality of}} signal conditioning units, coupled to the rotary sensor. Each of these units, which {{is associated with a}} particular range of <b>motor</b> output <b>shaft</b> rotation rates, generate a feedback signal indicative of the position of the <b>motor</b> s output <b>shaft.</b> A controller (i) converts a selected <b>motor</b> output <b>shaft</b> rotation rate to a corresponding incremental amount of rotational movement for a selected fixed time period, (ii) selects, at periodic completions of the selected fixed time period, the feedback signal from one of the signal conditioning units for which the particular range of <b>motor</b> output <b>shaft</b> rotation rates associated therewith encompasses the selected <b>motor</b> output <b>shaft</b> rotation rate, and (iii) generates a motor drive signal based on a difference between the incremental amount of rotational movement and the feedback signal from the selected one of the signal conditioning Units...|$|R
500|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft</b> ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. [...] Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|E
2500|$|The rotor is {{supported}} by bearings, which allow the rotor to turn on its axis. [...] The bearings are in turn supported by the motor housing. [...] The <b>motor</b> <b>shaft</b> extends through the bearings {{to the outside of}} the motor, where the load is applied. [...] Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be overhung.|$|E
2500|$|A {{standard}} 20MPa, 5L steel bottle has {{a mass of}} 7.5kg, {{a superior}} one 5kg. High-tensile strength fibers such as [...] carbon-fiber or Kevlar can weigh below 2kg in this size, consistent with the legal safety codes. One cubic meter of air at 20°C has a mass of 1.204kg at standard temperature and pressure. Thus, theoretical specific energies are from roughly 70kJ/kg at the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft</b> for a plain steel bottle to 180kJ/kg for an advanced fiber-wound one, whereas practical achievable specific energies for the same containers would be from 40 to 100kJ/kg.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the kinematic {{design of a}} 10 link “inparallel” mechanism {{for use in a}} three degree of freedom forcereflecting haptic interface. The mechanism linkage couples three coplanar rotary electric <b>motor</b> <b>shafts</b> to the endpoint grasped by the human operator. The linkage permits all motor housings to be supported on a common base, thereby reducing the inertia and weight that the interface actuators and human operator must support and move. Furthermore, because only rigid links and rotary ball bearings are used, the linkage avoids the compliance, friction, and/or backlash associated with other types of transmission elements. The linkage workspace is bounded by the singular sphere of maximum reach and separated into two hemispheres by singularities in the plane of the <b>motor</b> <b>shafts...</b>|$|R
50|$|The robot has 23 active {{degrees of}} freedom. It {{is powered by}} Maxon DC motors rated at 20 Watts, 90 Watts and 150 Watts.

2500|$|Thus if 1.0m3 of {{air from}} the {{atmosphere}} is very slowly compressed into a 5L bottle at , the potential energy stored is 530kJ. A highly efficient air motor can transfer this into kinetic energy if it runs very slowly and manages to expand the air from its initial 20MPa pressure down to 100kPa (bottle completely [...] "empty" [...] at atmospheric pressure). Achieving high efficiency is a technical challenge both due to heat loss to the ambient and to unrecoverable internal gas heat. If the bottle above is emptied to 1MPa, the extractable energy is about 300kJ at the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{rotating}} armature {{consists of}} one or more coils of wire wound around a laminated, magnetically [...] "soft" [...] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft.</b> The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.|$|E

Motor driver, electric <b>motor,</b> <b>shafting,</b> sealing, propeller, nozzle and thruster outer geometry and surface all affect the efficiency.|$|R

The accuracy is very bad and does not allow many resolution options. This technology does not typically offer UVW or Z pulse outputs.

5000|$|Gear-drive ceiling fans.

The shape of this guide has a relation with the circular shape of the cutting tool (4). The cutting tool makes an adjustable circular movement with the cutting tool holder following the sliding guide (2). The sliding guide (1) gives linear movement freedom to the cutting tool holder when it follows the sliding guide (2).

50|$|Anglewinder {{is a type}} of slot car or {{motorized}} model car {{in which}} the <b>motor</b> <b>shaft</b> runs at an angle to the driven axle (usually the rear) and drives it through a bevel or other angled gear arrangement.

The anglewinder arrangement allows use of a slightly longer motor than a pure sidewinder. It also moves the motor's weight forward in the car, which some racers believe improves handling.|$|E
