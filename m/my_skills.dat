500|$|After his {{departure}} from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante became more serious about his longtime dream to make electronic music. As he explained on his blog, [...] "I started {{to learn how to}} program all the instruments we associate with Acid House music and some other hardware. [...] Then I started recording, playing 10 or so synced machines through a small mixer into a CD burner. This was all experimental Acid House, <b>my</b> <b>skills</b> at making rock music playing no part in it whatsoever. I had lost interest in traditional songwriting and I was excited about finding new methods for creating music." [...] During that time Frusciante began an electronic trio with Aaron Funk and Chris McDonald under the name Speed Dealer Moms. Their first EP was released in December 2010 on Planet Mu Records.|$|E

This came about after an anonymous person, believed to be a former male student, circulated an email entitled [...] "Save Barker Cricket Now" [...] in the school community attacking the selection as a [...] "disgrace" [...] and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team. The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as [...] "gutless" [...] and maintained that Healy's selection was based on merit. Ian Healy and Alex Blackwell, a cricketer for the Australian women's team and former Barker student, also defended the selection and criticised the email author.

He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen <b>my</b> <b>skills</b> and get better.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Because the Jordan {{team was}} taken over and renamed Midland for the 2006 season, the {{management}} change prompted some doubt over Karthikeyan's future at the team.
