5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} of all dinosaurs, Stegosaurus has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics, as children's toys, and was even declared the State Dinosaur of Colorado in 1982. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early Stegosaurus fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of these animals could be produced. The earliest popular image of Stegosaurus was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of Scientific American, which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the Stegosaurus as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might {{have been based on}} a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> small dermal spines.|$|E

He founded the Union of Democratic Control in early 1914 to promote international socialist aims, but it was overwhelmed by the war. His 1916 book, National Defence, revealed his own long-term vision for peace. Although disappointed at the harsh terms of the Versailles Treaty, he supported the League of Nations – but by 1930 {{he felt that the}} internal cohesion of the British Empire and a strong, independent British defence programme <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the wisest British government policy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{payoff matrix}} in Figure 1 {{provides}} a simple two-player, two-strategy {{example of a}} game with two pure Nash equilibria. The strategy pair (Hunt,Hunt) is payoff dominant since payoffs are higher for both players {{compared to the other}} pure NE, (Gather, Gather). On the other hand, (Gather,Gather) risk dominates (Hunt,Hunt) since if uncertainty exists about the other player's action, gathering will provide a higher expected payoff. [...] The game in Figure 1 is a well-known game-theoretic dilemma called stag hunt. [...] The rationale behind it is that communal action (hunting) yields a higher return if all players combine their skills, but if it is unknown whether the other player helps in hunting, gathering <b>might</b> <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the better individual strategy for food provision, since it does not depend on coordinating with the other player. In addition, gathering alone is preferred to gathering in competition with others. Like the Prisoner's dilemma, it provides a reason why collective action might fail in the absence of credible commitments.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early in}} the war as 1793, a major city {{manufacturer}} and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and a doubling of the poor rate.

Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, at which [...] "Citizen Stanhope" [...] spoke.

Also, a worker recruited for a given job may possess the wrong type of general training. All this imposes substantial information-based costs on firms that recruit rather than train.

2500|$|Paleontologists have {{expressed}} concern that the cladistic analysis compared only 30 traits when standard practice is to analyze 200 to 400 traits and to include fossils such as anthropoids from Egypt and the primate genus Eosimias which {{were not included in the}} analysis. This contrasts with the motive openly stated by the authors, which was to list 30 anatomical and morphological characteristics [...] "commonly used" [...] to distinguish extant strepsirrhine and haplorrhine primates. Paleontologist Richard Kay of Duke University thought the data could have been cherry-picked. Paleontologist Callum Ross of the University of Chicago considered the claim that Darwinius should be classified as haplorhine was [...] "unsupportable in light of modern methods of classification." [...] The opinion of Chris Beard, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, was that Darwinius was not a [...] "missing link" [...] between anthropoids and more primitive primates, but that further study of this remarkably complete specimen would be very informative and could reveal relationships amongst [...] "the earliest and least human-like of all known primates, the Eocene adapiforms."

Melipona marginata var. torrida Friese, 1916, described from three workers putatively collected in Costa Rica, never had its identity properly recognized.
