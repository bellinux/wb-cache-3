5|$|Homer test {{drives a}} new {{electric}} car {{so that he}} can get a free gift. After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E
25|$|His rule lasted {{long and}} after the {{sacrifice}} of his father Domalde, the crops were plentiful and peace reigned. Consequently there is not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about his reign, and when he died at Uppsala, he was transported over the Fyris Wolds (Fyrisvellir) and burnt {{on the banks of}} the river, where a stone was raised over his ashes.|$|E
25|$|The {{apartment}} {{resembles a}} prison or a hospital. Silence weighs heavily {{on all of}} us. As none of us do much, we haven’t got <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> each other. Incapable of sharing our emotions, we each enclose ourselves in our own fear and distress. Since everyone {{is in the same}} black pit, there isn’t much point in repeating time and again that we can’t see clearly.|$|E
60|$|Holroyd {{understood}} the Portuguese {{to say the}} body was too <b>much</b> eaten <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Thar ain't <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> nor <b>much</b> use <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it, as I can see," [...] said Bill, moodily. [...] "He {{never could}} be cured, the doctors said, {{for he had}} what they called monomania,--was always talking about his wife and darter that {{somebody}} had stole away years ago, and plannin' revenge on that somebody. And six months ago he was missed. I tracked him to Carson, to Salt Lake City, to Omaha, to Chicago, to New York,--and here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but you ain't him," [...] {{interrupted}} Mrs Crashington, testily, [...] "so it won't do him <b>much</b> good <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{what you}} would or wouldn't do." ...|$|R
25|$|In the Short Parliament {{that started}} on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House {{in the debate}} on 4 May in its {{opposition}} to the grant of twelve subsidies {{in return for the}} surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the Scots. During the eventful months which followed, when Strafford was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his Scottish war, rumour has <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{should not}} think it an {{outrageous}} paradox", writes Carr, [...] "if someone were to say that Grote's History of Greece has quite as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us about {{the thought of the}} English philosophical radicals in the 1840s as about Athenian democracy in the fifth century B.C." [...] Prof. Carr credits the philosopher R. G. Collingwood as being his inspiration for this line of thinking.|$|E
2500|$|Molly and the Weasleys {{are staying}} at the Order headquarters, Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, where she and Sirius fight over how <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Harry about the Order's operations. Days later, Molly {{is found in the}} drawing room, with a boggart that {{transforms}} into her dead family members and Harry, and confesses her nightmares of losing more family members to Voldemort and the Death Eaters. At the beginning of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Molly clashes with Bill's fiancée, Fleur Delacour; however, {{at the end of the}} novel, when Molly rushes to Hogwarts with her husband and Fleur to tend to her son Bill, who had been ferociously attacked by Fenrir Greyback, Fleur is greatly offended when Molly jumps to the conclusion she will break up with Bill due to his scarring, letting her know in no uncertain terms that as far as she is concerned, she is [...] "good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave!" [...] Fleur and Molly unexpectedly hug and begin to see each other in a much more positive light.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Henderson {{could not}} say that her success was great, but she ventured as <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her that Captain Henderson could prevent any attempt to send her away without her consent.|$|R
60|$|There {{he stopped}} and turned scarlet, for a lie was on his lips,--a lie so <b>much</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> than the honest truth that many would have forgiven its {{utterance}} at that minute.|$|R

60|$|NEWTE. Well--couldn't {{tell him}} much, of course. Wasn't <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|E
60|$|Phineas Duge {{looked at}} him for a moment in silence, while he decided how <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|E
60|$|When Geoffrey {{returned}} to camp, Halliday, {{who had arrived}} that day from Vancouver, had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only this," [...] she said; [...] "would {{you begin}} already to chafe and rebel if I {{were to ask}} you not to send that telegram? It would be so <b>much</b> nicer <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her after she gets back." ...|$|R
60|$|HOPE. Yes, {{and fled}} from {{not only my}} sins, but sinful company too, and betook me to {{religious}} duties, as praying, reading, weeping for sin, speaking truth to my neighbors, etc. These things did I, with many others, too <b>much</b> here <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We didn't {{give him}} <b>much</b> responsibility; <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth, {{we wanted to}} get him away for a while. There was a young grass-widow that it seemed {{possible}} he might make a fool of himself about. Rather a dangerous woman, I believe, and Andrew's confiding." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} wouldn't! If I could have thought you would, I hope I shouldn't have wished--and feared--so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is not <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> sir. On {{the first}} occasion, I freed Count Eulenfurst of some rascals who were maltreating {{him and his}} family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there ain't really <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> about her," [...] Fulkerson resumed {{when they}} were seated in the car. [...] "She's an {{invention}} of mine." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, my father, {{there is}} <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> but shall I tell it? The snow has melted, your cattle {{have been found}} where I told you they should be, and you wish to be gone. And I also, I would be gone upon a longer journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> Ramiro swore before God that if I {{gave him}} the clue he would let me go, and then--then, well, then, after I {{had fallen into the}} pit and disgraced myself, he said that it was not sufficient, and that the {{marriage}} must take place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes!' cried Mrs Varden, {{bursting}} into tears, 'yes, you would. I don't doubt it, Varden. Certainly you would. That's as <b>much</b> as <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{me that you}} would be hovering round me like a vulture, waiting till the breath was out of my body, that you might go and marry somebody else.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “She won’t have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> poor girl!” Jackson freely commented. “I {{must really}} insist on seeing with more freedom the person I wish to marry.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've {{no doubt}} you have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about your trip, and if you'll talk about Edinburgh and London, I won't let anybody in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> {{but must}} begin with a {{confession}} which I have often longed but never dared to make before, because I am a coward." ...|$|E
50|$|One {{story in}} Donald Duck comics was based around Donald {{spending}} so <b>much</b> time trying <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his three nephews apart that {{he developed a}} heightened sense of sight.|$|R
6000|$|... 'God forbid!' was the reply. 'And yet {{the name}} is a strange one; it were too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> fancy two. <b>Tell</b> me, landlord, is he old?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O no,' {{said the}} miller cheerfully. ''Tis only my son John's trumpeter chaps {{at the camp}} of dragoons just above us, a-blowing Mess, or Feed, or Picket, or some other of their vagaries. John will be <b>much</b> pleased <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the meaning on't when he comes down. He's trumpet-major, as you may know, ma'am.' ...|$|R
60|$|Dechamp was {{a sturdy}} young {{half-breed}} {{and an old}} playmate of La Certe. He spoke with obvious impatience at the delay caused by having so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, let us sit down. We have so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> each other, and, moreover, I am ravenous for breakfast, as I have ridden {{forty miles}} since sunrise." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had been}} talking earnestly about past and present, for the son had much to learn about old friends and comrades, and the mother had <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "God forbid!" [...] was the reply. [...] "And yet {{the name}} is a strange one; it were too <b>much</b> <b>to</b> fancy two. <b>Tell</b> me, landlord, is he old?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother, {{there are}} not many post-offices in Hayti, and I should not have cared to trust any letters to them if there had been. There is the advantage, you see, that there is <b>much</b> more <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you now than if I had written to you before. You don't get papers very {{regularly}} here, I think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And has he {{consented to}} ask him {{at the end of}} twelve months?" [...] asked Selina, <b>much</b> astonished, and, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth, {{considerably}} shocked at this instance of what she considered her father's weakness.|$|R
