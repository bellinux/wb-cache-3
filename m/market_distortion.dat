The economists Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster showed in 1956, that if one optimality condition in an economic model cannot be satisfied, {{it is possible that the}} next-best solution involves changing other variables away from the values that would otherwise be optimal.

The results of this paper {{cast doubt on the}} generality of the proposition on the sensitivity of economic efficiency to <b>market</b> <b>distortions.</b> Our results show that removing labor <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> would increase output by less than 1 % of the base year GDP. Even when capital <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> are also removed, the GDP increases only by 3. 2 %, and welfare by 5. 6 %. The study also examines a consequence of capital <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> which suggests that distortions may lead to more rapid capital formation and higher concentration of capital stock.

40|$|In {{response}} to rising international debt in many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) nations, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have implemented structural adjustment programmes (SAPs). SAPs {{are designed to}} forward foreign currency to SSA nations {{while at the same}} time securing commitment on the part of SSA governments to restructure their economies. SAPs are based on neoclassical economic ideals which indicate, among other things, that <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> create significant barriers to economic progress. Neoclassical economics is shown in this thesis to be based on gender bias, formal sector bias, and ethnocentric assumptions which prohibit the conceptualization that gender-based discrimination can make up <b>market</b> <b>distortions.</b> Given the specific cultural and economic role of women in SSA, this omission has lead to the inability of SAPs to target the full range of <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> effectively. It is the finding of this thesis that gender discrimination, when re-conceptualized as <b>market</b> <b>distortions,</b> reveals that the asymmetrical access women in SSA have to formal economic relations is halting economic progress.

I have considered implications of sector-specific foreign capital inflows on national income (or social welfare, crudely however) of the economy under two different scenarios: when entire income from foreign capital is fully repatriated back to the source country; and when supply of FDI is a positive function of net return to foreign capital in the recipient country, coupled with labour-augmenting type technology transfer. It is found {{that the possibility of}} non-immiserising growth improves in the presence of labour <b>market</b> <b>distortion</b> in the organised sector while credit market imperfection in the unorganised sector deteriorates it. However in the presence of technology transfer, existence of labour <b>market</b> <b>distortion</b> is no longer a necessary condition for obtaining such result due to foreign capital inflows to the foreign enclave of this small open developing economy. Existence of output-generated increasing returns in the sector within the foreign enclave will not alter our results; while under the second scenario it will enhance the possibility of non-immiserising growth by raising the tax-revenue from foreign capital income in the host country through increasing the rental to foreign capital. These results are counter-intuitive with respect to the existing theoretical results suggesting immiserising growth owing to sector-specific foreign capital inflows using 3 × 3 or 2 × 3 full-employment models without any linkages. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare gains from strategic trade and industrial {{policy in the}} U. S. steel industry, focusing particularly on the potential gains from capturing labor rents. I take into account product <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> such as price-setting firms, factor <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> {{in the form of}} union-created labor rents, and the presence of fixed capital and underutilized capacity in U.

At the same time, the union takes advantage of protection to "skim off" rents, further reducing the effectiveness of the optimal policy. Taking into account these endogenous responses substantially reduces the welfare gains from optimal policies. And simply reducing domestic labor <b>market</b> <b>distortions</b> results in a welfare gain nearly as large as that from optimal policies. This suggests that the focus on labor rents as the subject of U. S. trade and industrial policy is overstated, at least in manufacturing industries such as integrated steel.
