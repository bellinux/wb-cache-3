5|$|Of all the refereeing appointments, the {{two that}} {{attracted}} most attention were that of Gilberto de Almeida Rêgo in the match between Argentina and France, in which the Brazilian referee blew for full-time six <b>minutes</b> <b>early,</b> {{and that of the}} Bolivian Ulises Saucedo's in the Argentina and Mexico encounter, which Argentina won 6–3. During the game Saucedo, who was also the coach of Bolivia, awarded three penalties.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks' first-half {{play was}} {{generally}} considered poor—with aimless kicking to Welsh fullback Winfield who returned much better kicks into touch. The first ten minutes saw New Zealand's Roberts break the line twice only, {{to be caught}} by Winfield without support. Eventually Wales had a scrum-feed 25 yards out from the All Blacks' try-line. From this Wales executed a planned move—Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right to Bush. He then turned left and passed to Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then passed to Gabe, who passed to Bush, who eventually passed to Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion—leaving the score at 3–0. In {{the final stages of}} the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two <b>minutes</b> <b>early,</b> and Wallace that it was three <b>minutes</b> <b>early.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{first group}} {{was the only}} one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries {{hindered}} France; goalkeeper Alex Thépot had to leave the field after 20minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by Luis Monti, spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti free kick. The game featured an officiating controversy when referee Almeida Rêgo erroneously blew the final whistle six <b>minutes</b> <b>early,</b> with Frenchman Marcel Langiller clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players. Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match. They faced Mexico the following day, gaining a comfortable 3–0 win.|$|E

25|$|In {{their first}} season {{back in the}} League, the club {{attained}} a twelfth-placed finish despite suffering their record defeat; 10–1 at Small Heath. The referee blew the whistle for time four <b>minutes</b> <b>early,</b> with the score 9–1, and did not realise until the players had reached the dressing room and the crowd had all left. He took them out for the remaining four minutes, during which Small Heath scored a tenth goal. No joy was to be had in the FA Cup yet again.|$|E

The receptionist nevertheless phoned James, who promptly came out of his office, welcomed Epstein and quickly got down to business. Epstein played the single and James remarked that it was a number one record. Epstein replied that if James could achieve that then he would be prepared to offer him a long-term publishing deal. James then phoned Philip Jones, producer of ITV television show Thank Your Lucky Stars, played the song down the telephone to him and gained The Beatles a slot on the next edition of the programme. The two then shook hands on a deal that would make them, and the Beatles, extremely wealthy.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Samu {{left the}} WWF {{to recover from}} {{injuries}} {{and was replaced by}} Sione (formerly The Barbarian). They were called The New Headshrinkers. The storyline reason for Samu’s departure was that he was not coping well with manager Lou Albano’s attempts to civilize him, particularly about wearing boots. The New Headshrinkers made only two PPV appearances, at the 1994 Survivor Series, where they were eliminated from their ten-man tag match, but helped their team win and at the 1995 Royal Rumble; Sione lasted about seven <b>minutes</b> <b>early</b> on and Fatu over five nearer the end. They entered a tournament to crown new WWF tag team champions in late 1994/early 1995, and lost to Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka in the semifinals. For most of 1995, they worked with Jacob & Eli Blu, usually putting them over. Their final match was a loss to Men on a Mission at a June 22 house show in London, England, after which Sione left for WCW.|$|E

25|$|To {{make up for}} {{the lost}} time on the first two days, play started 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>early</b> on day 3. Both Cook and Trott reached half-centuries early on in the day before Trott was caught at second slip by Blackwood off the bowling of Bishoo for 59. Cook batted on to make 76 before he was bowled by Gabriel, and Bell {{followed}} {{in much the same way}} two overs later, allowing Gary Ballance and Joe Root to take up the reins. The pair put on 165 runs before Ballance was bowled by Samuels for 77. Moeen Ali (0) then ran himself out attempting a single and Stokes (8) holed out attempting to pull Bishoo over deep midwicket, where he was caught by Blackwood. As Stokes walked off, he was saluted by Samuels in response to Stokes' sledging from earlier in the match. Meanwhile, Root passed the century mark and was joined at the crease by Jos Buttler as the day came to a close with England on 373/6.|$|E
25|$|Play started 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>early</b> {{again on}} day 4, but Buttler lasted {{less than four}} overs into the day's play, stumped by Ramdin off Bishoo, but Root and Jordan managed a quick 39-run {{partnership}} for the eighth wicket before Jordan was deemed to have been just run out by Holder for 16, followed by Broad for a duck after a review found the ball brushed his glove on the way through to slip. Root continued to farm the strike opposite Anderson for the final wicket, only for the innings {{to be brought to}} an abrupt end when Anderson was run out, having failed to ground his bat behind the crease when he could have easily saved himself. The wicket denied Root the chance of a double-century, as he finished not out on 182, with England all out for 464. England made an early breakthrough yet again as the West Indies began their second innings, Anderson bowling Devon Smith for 2 runs, but a 142-run partnership between Brathwaite and Bravo restored the West Indies to 145/2 following the dismissal of Bravo by Broad. The home side were on 202/2 at stumps, helped by a century from Brathwaite, leaving them 37 runs ahead of England going into {{the final day of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|England added just 25 more {{runs for}} their last two wickets {{at the start}} of Day 2, Hilfenhaus {{trapping}} Anderson LBW for 0 in the second over of the day (ending his 54 innings sequence without a duck), before dismissing Broad for 37. Shane Watson and Simon Katich took Australia to 66/0 before rain forced lunch to be taken three <b>minutes</b> <b>early,</b> with the resumption of play delayed until almost 14:30. After lunch the Australian openers lasted just two overs before the start of a massive Broad-inspired batting collapse. First to fall was Watson, LBW on 34, then Ricky Ponting was deceived by a cutter from Broad and played onto his own stumps for just eight runs. Michaels Hussey and Clarke were next to go, Hussey LBW for a duck, before Clarke was caught low at short extra cover by Jonathan Trott. After a spell in which Broad took four wickets for just eight runs, Swann returned to the attack and immediately took the wicket of Marcus North, although replays subsequently showed that the Australian number 6 got an inside edge to the ball before it struck his pad. Katich reached his half-century in the 37th over of the innings, but was out the very next ball, caught by Alastair Cook at short leg. Broad completed his five-wicket haul in the 39th over, bowling Brad Haddin to give him wicket-to-wicket figures of 5/19 and leave only the Australian bowlers to dismiss. Swann took the next two wickets – albeit that of Stuart Clark was given incorrectly – leaving it to Flintoff to bowl Hilfenhaus and end the Australian innings for 160 runs. The English openers returned to the crease and put on 27 before Cook edged North to first slip for just nine. Mitchell Johnson then combined well with Simon Katich at short leg for the next two wickets, Katich catching Bell low before Johnson thumped a bouncer into Collingwood, looping the ball up for Katich to catch easily, leaving the home side at 39/3. Nevertheless, Strauss and Trott recovered well to take England into the third day at 58/3.|$|E

500|$|The {{breakaway}} {{was again}} swift {{to form in}} the early part of the stage. It included six riders: Mickaël Delage (...) , Bert-Jan Lindeman (LottoNL-Jumbo), Nikolas Maes (Etixx-Quick Step), Jimmy Engoulvent (Europcar), Kristijan Đurasek (Lampre-Merida) and Markel Irizar (Trek Factory Racing). Their lead extended to thirteen <b>minutes</b> <b>early</b> in the stage, but it was quickly cut down by [...] along with Movistar and Katusha, to around seven minutes at the halfway point of the stage.
