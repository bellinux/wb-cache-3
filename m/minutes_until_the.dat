5|$|The race began {{without a}} {{formation}} lap {{and despite the}} slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. After three laps under the safety car, conditions were unchanged; drivers reported on the circuit's condition via radio and the race was suspended. Light rain prevented the resumption of the Grand Prix for over forty-five <b>minutes</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> marshals and road sweeping trucks removed some of the excess water and dirt on the track. Resin on the newly laid track surface had prevented water from soaking into the ground. The rain had eased slightly during the suspension. Teams were allowed to change the set-up of their cars, which were largely optimised for dry weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several <b>minutes</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E

25|$|Whole Peking Ducks can {{be ordered}} as takeaways. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a {{temperature}} of 150°C (300°F) for 20 minutes, and then at 160°C (325°F) for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70cm (28in) above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3–4 <b>minutes</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> duck's skin is piping hot.

This study aims to prove the differences of effectiveness of slow frontcrawl swimming recovery with a slow breaststroke swimming recovery to accelerate pulse rate recovery of male Bayusuta swimmer group in Denpasar. Experimental research was done with the method of randomized pre and post test control group design, conducted on February 2014. Samples were selected by simple random sampling. The two intervention groups with each group of 17 samples that randomized selected. The first group was given intervention as slow frontcrawl swimming and the second groups given intervention as slow breaststroke swimming after maximal exercise 50 meter sprint swimming. Pulse rate recovery was measured using Brouha method that is  pulse rate in <b>the</b> first <b>minute</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>minute.</b> Statistical analysis with the Wilcoxon test showed a decrease in pulse rate in both groups from <b>the</b> first <b>minute</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>minute</b> showed a significant decrease (p 0, 05), while the third to fifth minute pulse recovery in both groups showed significant differences (p < 0, 05). The decrease of pulse rate in both groups in <b>the</b> first <b>minute</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>minute</b> showed significant results (p < 0, 05). In conclusion is slow freestyle swimming recovery methods is more effective than  slow breaststroke swimming recovery method in accelerate swimmer pulse rate recovery.

25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few <b>minutes,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E
25|$|When the car {{reached a}} {{pre-established}} spot, eight SAS members opened-fire from close range, riddling the Vauxhall with over 200 rounds of high-velocity automatic fire. Tony Doris was immediately hit, and the out-of-control Vauxhall crashed into two parked cars. The shooting continued {{for about ten}} <b>minutes,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> car exploded in flames and set one of the parked vehicles (a Volkswagen Golf) alight. According to an eyewitness, one of the PIRA volunteers returned fire on the SAS after the car crashed. Some reports claim {{at least two of}} the men fled the blazing car and were found lying half out of the vehicle. Some relatives believe the two men had escaped but were then shot and dragged back into the car by SAS members. A crime-scene report stated that a balaclava of one of the men was found some distance away. The bodies were so badly burnt that they had to be identified using dental records. Two rifles were recovered from the charred car. Forensics later found that the weapons had been used in the killings at Leslie Dallas's garage in 1989.|$|E
25|$|After {{the victory}} at the Saintes, and {{during a period of}} calm weather, Rodney {{detached}} a squadron under his second in command, Sir Samuel Hood, to pursue some of the crippled French ships. Valiant was one of the ships detached with Hood, and on 19 April the squadron caught two ships of the line and three frigates {{at the entrance to the}} Mona Passage. The French force, consisting of the 64-gun ships Caton and Jason, and the frigates Astree, Aimable and Ceres attempted to escape, Hood signalling for them to be engaged before they could run themselves ashore. In the ensuing Battle of the Mona Passage, Valiant found herself the headmost ship, and with most of the other British ships becalmed or chasing other ships, Goodall pressed on sail to catch the Caton, and managed to rake her bows, on which she immediately struck. Goodall did not stop to take possession, but instead pressed on after the fleeing Jason, opening fire on her and fighting a fierce engagement for 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> French ship surrendered.

25|$|At about 07:50 the {{southern}} outskirts of Haderslev, a Danish 37mm anti-tank gun {{with a crew}} of five attacked the approaching armour. Two tanks lined up adjacent {{to one another and}} opened fire. The Danes landed all three of their shots -one in a tank's tracks- but two of the gun crew were killed and the rest wounded. One tank then drove over the gun. Just around the bend the wagon roadblock on Sønderbro Street covered by two 20mm cannon and a machine gun put up resistance. The Germans laid down heavy fire and a Danish soldier was killed and two more wounded, but the Germans were effectively pinned down. The fighting continued for ten more <b>minutes</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> order to surrender was received from Copenhagen by telephone. The Germans were then allowed to proceed into the town of Haderslev, but the Danish garrison stationed there had not received the order to surrender and fired on the Germans. Two German tanks and a motorcycle proceeded unsuspecting towards the barracks, which were defended by the anti-tank unit from Lundtoftbjerg. They opened fire, killing the motorcyclist and blowing the tracks off one tank, sending it crashing into a house. However, the Danish garrison capitulated at 08:15 when the order to surrender from Copenhagen finally came through. One Danish soldier was killed while defending the barracks; three Danish civilians were killed in the crossfire.|$|E

500|$|The {{artificial}} propagation of American paddlefish {{began with the}} efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery. [...] However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. [...] Artificial propagation requires broodstock which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. [...] The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. [...] The number of eggs a female may produce depends {{on the size of the}} fish and can range anywhere from 70,000–300,000 eggs. [...] Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. [...] To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. [...] The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes. [...] The oocytes are boiled in water for a few <b>minutes</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus. [...] The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity.|$|E

Batista and JBL began the match, performing a variety of offensive maneuvers until the first five-minute interval had passed, and Kane entered the match. Later, JBL attempted to strike Kane with his forearm, a move JBL calls a [...] "Clothesline from Hell", but was caught by Kane. Kane then chokeslammed JBL and covered him for a pinfall, becoming the interim champion. Soon after, the second five-minute interval expired and Rey Mysterio entered the match. The match continued for several <b>minutes,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> final five-minute interval expired and Jericho entered the match as a replacement for CM Punk, shocking everyone. Soon after Jericho's entrance, Batista performed a spinebuster on Kane, covering him for a pinfall and becoming temporary champion.
