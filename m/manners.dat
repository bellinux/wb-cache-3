5|$|Etal Castle is {{a ruined}} medieval {{fortification}} {{in the village}} of Etal, Northumberland, England. It was built around 1341 by Robert <b>Manners,</b> and comprised a residential tower, a gatehouse and a corner tower, protected by a curtain wall. The castle was involved both in local feuding and the border wars between England and Scotland. There was a battle between the rival <b>Manners</b> and Heron families outside the walls in 1428, and in 1513 it was briefly captured by King James IV of Scotland during his invasion of England.|$|E

5|$|From 1886, Worthington {{began to}} acquire public houses, which {{provided}} a captive market for their product. In order to raise capital for this expansion, the firm became {{a public company}} in 1889, and Horace Brown was created joint managing director alongside William Posnette <b>Manners.</b> By this time the company had an annual output of around 200,000 barrels, and employed 470 people. By 1890, the company's bottling operations equalled those of Bass, Guinness, Allsopp and Whitbread. When William Henry Worthington (1826–1894) died he left no direct heirs and was the fourth and final generation of the family to manage Worthington & Co. Horace Brown left the company in 1894 following a dispute with co-manager William <b>Manners.</b> By 1900, 73 per cent of the company's equity was {{in the hands of}} William Posnette <b>Manners</b> (1846–1915), who had joined the company in 1862 as a junior clerk, and under his astute leadership Worthington acquired a reputation for the quality of its bottled pale ales. The company acquired the Burton Brewery Company in 1915. On Manners' death in 1915, control of the company passed to two of his sons, Arthur (1879–1968) and Ernest. Arthur was the architect of the merger with archrival Bass in 1927, and proved {{to be more than a}} match for John Gretton, 1st Baron Gretton, the chairman of the much larger Bass. Despite Bass's superior capitalization, the terms of the merger were such that <b>Manners</b> became chairman and joint managing director of Worthington, and deputy chairman and joint managing director of Bass. The amalgamation, described as 'the biggest non-merger in the history of the brewing industry', failed to realize its objectives. Apart from greater co-operation in bottled beer production and distribution, there were few economies and the two companies continued to operate as separate entities. Both boards were increasingly dominated by <b>Manners</b> and his family.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} long noted that Spanish does not license {{the use of}} <b>manner</b> verbs when {{describing}} telic motion events, particularly when they involve boundary crossing (Aske, 1989; Slobin & Hoiting, 1994). The only exception to this constraint seems to be punctual acts, especially vertical boundary crossing situations, such as tirarse a la piscina (lit. ‘throw oneself into the pool’) (Naigles et al., 1998). Slobin (2004, 2006) has pointed out the low salience of <b>manner</b> in Spanish; the Spanish <b>manner</b> verb lexicon is not as extensive and frequently used as that of high <b>manner</b> salient languages like English, {{and as a result}} Spanish speakers are thought to attend less to <b>manner</b> than English speakers. In this study, we ask whether Spanish speakers would accept a <b>manner</b> verb in a boundary-crossing event, when <b>manner</b> of motion is made highly salient, either by contextual or by cultural means. Our research, though still preliminary, suggests both contextual <b>manner</b> salience and cultural <b>manner</b> salience increase the acceptability of Spanish <b>manner</b> verbs in boundary-crossing situations...|$|R
