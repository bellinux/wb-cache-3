40|$|<b>Maintenance</b> {{management}} <b>of</b> {{building services}} {{has become one}} of the critical issues among building sector professionals recently. The interruptions or damages to the building services extensively affect the core operation of the business. Therefore, appropriate maintenance management arrangements are required to sustain a proper building services system. Building practitioners tackle various issues and seek a variety of alternative solutions to deliver an effective maintenance strategy for the building services. However, the lack of consideration on the overall effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> services has faced frequent problems such as human errors, health and safety issues, resource scarcities, and time delays. In order to address those problems, this research has been carried to develop a framework that ensures the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities <b>of</b> the building services in Sri Lanka. An extensive literature review was mainly carried to discover the impact <b>of</b> effective <b>maintenance</b> activities towards the building services. Afterwards, a preliminary experts’ survey was conducted to obtain the factors affecting to effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was conducted among maintenance personals to rank identified factors according to their impact. Further, semi-structured interviews have been carried out mainly to identify the limitations <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> work. The framework highlights the factors that affect the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities <b>of</b> building services. Further, the framework facilitates to address the limitations <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities <b>of</b> building services. The framework can be used as clear evidence to convince both top management and owners of organisations to ensure the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities as well.

It remained unchanged until April1, 1997, when ownership and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In the switch, NY333 and nearby NY432, both maintained by the state, were given to Steuben County in exchange for <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> NY415 from Meads Creek Road in Coopers Plains (northwest of Painted Post) to Babcock Hollow Road in Bath as well as for <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton Street (the original routing of NY17) between US15 and Gang Mills.

40|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> often {{appears in}} the AI {{literature}} {{in the context of}} agent behavior and planning. In this paper we argue that earlier characterizations of the notion <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> is not intuitive to characterize the <b>maintenance</b> behavior <b>of</b> certain agents. We propose a different characterization <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> and distinguish it from earlier notions such as stabilizability and the temporal specification 23 f.

The former routing of NY326 on Oakwood Road is now designated as County Route168A (CR168A) in the town of Aurelius and CR168B in the town of Springport. The Genesee Street portion of old NY326 is now part of CR1.

40|$|RESUMÉ The paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> duties both <b>of</b> parents towards their children and of children towards their parents. The core problem <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> determination rests on utilization of relatively vague terms and necessity of consideration for too many factors influencing the result. The author's task lies in clarification of this intricate process and in identification of variables entering into this relation. The text consists of 13 parts, each referring to particular point <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> duties. The opening chapter mentioning the concept <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> itself {{is followed by the}} section treating sources of law within the framework the Czech legal order while taking into account previous legal development in Czechoslovakia. The subsequent part describes historical development <b>of</b> the <b>maintenance</b> duty, which could {{be traced back to the}} ancient Rome empire. The next heading is dedicated to general characteristic <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> duty. The fifth chapter analyses <b>maintenance</b> duty <b>of</b> parents towards their children, where one can identify related important features such as subjects of the relationship, duration, restoring, possibilities to change prescribed alimony, scope of defined alimony etc. Consequently, <b>maintenance</b> duty <b>of</b> children towards their parents is examined reflecting [...] ...|$|R
