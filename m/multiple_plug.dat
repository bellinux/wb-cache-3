5000|$|IEC World Plugs is {{ambiguous}} in some areas: {{it does not}} reference national technical standards that define the dimensions and tolerances of devices. Plugs will usually mate with sockets which are intended to accept plugs classified under the same letter type, {{but there is no}} guarantee of this. There is also an issue relating to Type C, the EN 50075 Europlug, which has no dedicated socket in the standard and is designed to fit sockets accepting [...] "4.0-4.8 mm round contacts on 19 mm centres", implying that there must be usage of such sockets in the territories listed as using Type C plugs. Despite this, World Plugs lists seven territories as using only Type C (i.e., no mention of specific plug types whose mating sockets also accept Type C) and twenty-one territories using Type C with no compatible types. [...] This may be for a number of reasons, for instance the Thai standard TIS 166-2549 includes a socket which will also accept Types A, B and C plugs as well as the Thai plug (which does not have an IEC classification letter). Another possible reason is the use of so-called [...] "universal sockets" [...] in use in some countries; these accept <b>multiple</b> <b>plug</b> types but meet no standards and are not classified by the IEC.|$|E

50|$|One {{explanation}} for the dimorphism observed in the N. pilipes species is sexual size dimorphism may have evolved due to selection favoring female gigantism. Gigantism may have evolved in response to reduce the effectiveness of male mating plugs. With a mating plug, male spiders ensure that only the male who create the plug post coitus would be {{the father of the}} resulting offspring. Although in the species of N. pilipes, plugging {{does not seem to have}} an effect as females are still able to have successful matings even with <b>multiple</b> <b>plugs.</b> The evolution of plugs occurred in earlier ancestral species and still persists along. These traits were then passed down to one of its decedents, the living species N. pilipes. In this ancestral species, female gigantism was selected as a positive adaptation. In female spiders with larger bodies, the “embolic plugs” inserted in the N. pilipes females' genitalia become too thin to effectively seal the genitalia. Additionally, female gigantism would have been important to the ancestral species at the time when mating plugs were still effective, as body size has been shown to increase fecundity. By laying more eggs at a time, the ancestral females could have produced more offspring before they were plugged by a male.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{spark plug}} {{has been used}} as the {{ignition}} source of the spark ignited internal combustion (IC) engine for many decades. It is limited in that once the plug has been built and installed, the ignition location within the cylinder cannot be subsequently changed. Multiple spark ignition of the engine for improved combustion control is possible with a spark plug, but this technology has significant limitations. The large dwell time of the spark <b>plug</b> makes firing <b>multiple</b> ignitions at different but close crank angles during a cycle impractical. Furthermore, to achieve multiple ignition locations with a spark <b>plug</b> requires <b>multiple</b> spark <b>plugs</b> to be installed on each cylinder, which creates severe constraints on the cylinder and valve geometry. The use of a laser as an ignition source however can in principle allow adaptive focusing to allow the on-line change of ignition location {{under the control of the}} Engine Control Unit (ECU) and so effectively remove many of the restrictions of a spark plug based systems. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the potential benefits of changing the ignition position in Single Location Ignition (SLI) and the associated laser pulse energy and investigates the prospects of calibrating these parameters to control an engine for improved performance...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Multiple</b> Use <b>Plug</b> Hybrid for Nanosats (MUPHyN) {{prototype}} thruster incorporates {{solutions to}} several major challenges that have traditionally limited {{the deployment of}} chemical propulsion systems on small spacecraft. The MUPHyN thruster offers several features that are uniquely suited for small satellite applications. These features include 1) a non-explosive ignition system, 2) non-mechanical thrust vectoring using secondary fluid injection on an aerospike nozzle cooled with the oxidizer flow, 3) a non-toxic, chemically-stable combination of liquid and inert solid propellants, 4) a compact form factor enabled by the direct digital manufacture of the inert solid fuel grain. Hybrid rocket motors provide significant safety and reliability advantages over both solid composite and liquid propulsion systems; however, hybrid motors have found only limited use on operational vehicles due to 1) difficulty in modeling the fuel flow rate 2) poor volumetric efficiency and/or form factor 3) significantly lower fuel flow rates than solid rocket motors 4) difficulty in obtaining high combustion efficiencies. The features of the MUPHyN thruster are designed to offset and/or overcome these shortcomings. The MUPHyN motor design represents a convergence of technologies, including hybrid rocket regression rate modeling, aerospike secondary injection thrust vectoring, multiphase injector modeling, non-pyrotechnic ignition, and nitrous oxide regenerative cooling that address the traditional challenges that limit the use of hybrid rocket motors and aerospike nozzles.

40|$|The <b>Multiple</b> Use <b>Plug</b> Hybrid (for) Nanosats is a {{prototype}} thruster {{is being developed}} to fill a niche application for NanoSat-scale spacecraft propulsion. When fully developed, the MUPHyN thruster will provide an effective and low-risk propulsive capability that could enable multiple NanoSats to be independently re-positioned after deployment from a parent launch vehicle. Because the environmentally benign, chemically-stable propellants are mixed only within the combustion chamber after ignition and the flow rate of the fuel is determined by a pyrolysis mechanism that is nearly independent of pressure or fuel grain defects, the system is inherently safe and can be piggy-backed near a secondary payload {{with little or no}} overall mission risk increase to the primary payload. The MUPHyN thruster uses safe-handling and inexpensive nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) as propellants. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a direct digital manufacturing process, is used to fabricate short-form-factor solid fuel grains with multiple helical combustion ports from ABS thermoplastic. This manufacturing process allows for the rapid development and manufacture of complex fuel grain geometries that are not possible to extrude or cast using conventional methods. This technology enables the construction of fuel grains with length-to-diameter ratios appropriate for incorporation into CubeSats while maintaining high surface areas and regression rates that allow the system to maintain a near optimal oxidizer to fuel ratio. The MUPHyN system provides attitude control torques by using secondary-injection thrust vectoring on a truncated aerospike nozzle. This configuration allows large impulse delta V burns and small impulse attitude control firings to be performed with the same system. To ensure survivability during extend duration burns, the MUPHyN incorporates a novel regenerative cooling design where the N 2 O oxidizer flows through a cooling path embedded in the aerospike nozzle before being injected into the combustion chamber near the nozzle base...|$|R

40|$|Background: Quantitative MRI of {{articular}} cartilage has rapidly developed {{in recent years}} and provides the clinician with a noninvasive tool to determine the biological consequence of an intervention. Purpose: To evaluate the quality of intra-{{articular cartilage}}, using the dGEMRIC scanning technique, 1 year after TruFit implantation. The hypothesis was that implantation of a TruFit plug does not lead to damage at the opposing articular cartilage. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 13 patients (age, 32 ± 8 years) were evaluated with dGEMRIC at 12 ± 4 months after treatment of an osteochondral lesion by implantation of 1 or <b>multiple</b> TruFit <b>plugs.</b> The dGEMRIC scanning protocol was applied 90 minutes after intravenous Magnevist (0. 2 mmol/kg body weight) injection. Different regions of interest (ROIs) were defined: the femur cartilage, cartilage directly surrounding the implanted TruFit plug, the TruFit plug, and the articulating and nonarticulating tibia cartilage. The average dGEMRIC index (T 1 gd; magnetic resonance imaging relaxation time per ROI) was calculated by a pixel-by-pixel curve fitting using the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Differences between the mean T 1 gd of the individual ROI for all patients were tested using analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni correction. A P value <. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The average T 1 gd of the TruFit ROI (385 ± 74 ms) was comparable with those in the femur (409 ± 49 ms) and surrounding (392 ± 64 ms) ROIs (P ≥. 339). The average T 1 gds for the articulating (578 ± 133 ms) and nonarticulating (516 ± 118 ms) ROIs were higher compared with the femur (409 ± 49 ms), surrounding (392 ± 64 ms), and TruFit (385 ± 74 ms) ROIs (P <. 002), while no difference was observed between the tibia ROIs (P =. 160). Conclusion: Implantation of the TruFit plug in osteochondral lesions does not damage the opposing or surrounding surface, and newly formed tissue inside the plug has cartilage-like dGEMRIC characteristics 12 months after implantation. The implantation of synthetic TruFit plugs is safe for the opposing cartilage, an item that is frequently discussed when using such materials to treat focal cartilage defects...|$|R

Minimal plastic deformations are experienced for either the MCO with shield plug or the MCO with cover cap. This survivability at 35 g's demonstrates the package's worthiness for 40 years of storage. The force between the two MCOs created by a drop event far exceed that resulting from stacking two loaded MCOs. The stacking load condition is not a structural concern and is, therefore, acceptable for the design duration of 40 years of storage.

30|$|The Venelle- 2 well is a {{directional}} {{exploratory well}} re-drilled {{from one of}} the existing dry wells with a total depth of 2200  m and reaching temperatures of approximately 350  °C, within the Lardarello Geothermal field in southern Tuscany in the close vicinity to the San Pompeo 2 well. The spudding operation began in the late August of 2017. The main aim of the project was to drill into the ‘K-horizon’ (i.e., an important seismic marker discovered from other deep drilling ventures in the area) located at depths of around 3000  m and reach supercritical geothermal resources. No production plans were made. During drilling operations, problems with partial and total circulation losses were experienced. One of the main challenges during drilling of the Venelle- 2 well was unexpectedly high pressures, encountered before reaching the target depths, which caused blow-out and eruption of tourmaline-quartz breccia and vein fragments. During cementing of a 7 ″ casing section, unexpected fire occurred around the well site and cementing was interrupted causing failure of casing equipment and slurry entry to the casing. The logging campaign performed after cementing operations proved large voids in cement sheath. The non-cemented sections at depth of 1205  m were cut off, while partially cemented sections between depths of 1205 and 1409  m were milled. Serious problems occurred during circulation stops with high density drilling fluid (1500  kg/m 3), which increased significantly wellhead pressure and caused problems while implementing standard well control procedures. The first stuck pipe incident occurred at a depth of 2695  m, which was attempted to release using firstly jarring and pulling up the drill string assembly and later by the decrease of drilling fluid density to 1350  kg/m 3. Problems with stuck pipe and circulation losses persisted and the well was eventually displaced with water in order to decrease well pressure and drilling fluid losses. Lower fluid pressures emphasized the need for reassessing well control and methods of circulation loss reduction using various squeezing and clogging techniques, which later proved to be unsuccessful. Challenges also occurred with setting up a swellable packer at greater depths in order to perform leak-off tests. Registering reliable temperature measurement was a serious issue in the Venelle- 2 venture, where multiple temperature logging tools and methods were exercised at various drilling depths. Static formation temperatures of 504  °C at a depth of 2815  m and between 507 and 517  °C at a depth of 2894  m were established from available logging tools. The Venelle- 2 well is currently temporarily abandoned with <b>multiple</b> cement <b>plugs</b> (Bretani et al. 2018).|$|R
30|$|Drilling {{operation}} {{for the second}} IDDP well started {{in the beginning of}} August 2016 with deepening of an existing 2500  m deep production RN- 15 well located in the Reykjanes geothermal field in south–west Iceland. The RN- 15 was a mere vertical production well with a 13 3 / 8 ″ production casing string cemented down to 794  m and an open hole completion. Drilling of the IDDP- 2 well was carried out ‘blind’, i.e., without any drilling fluid returns with an exception of an interval of around 180  m after completed primary cementing operation of an anchor casing at 2941  m depth. Losses of drilling fluid could not be cured with loss circulation material (i.e., polymer pills) nor with <b>multiple</b> cement <b>plugs</b> performed through drill bit as well as through drillable fiber cementing strings. Multiple challenges occurred during drilling operations including weather delays, problems with hole instability that required multiple reaming jobs as well as stuck pipe incidents. The IDDP- 2 well was cemented using reverse circulation method, due to total fluid losses and achieved satisfactory results. As of today, the IDDP- 2 well has the deepest cemented casing in any geothermal well in Iceland. 13 core runs were attempted with rather poor core recovery using an impregnated 8 ½″ diamond core bit and perfect core recovery of nearly 100 % with a 6 ″ PDC core bit beneath the liner pipe. Poor core recovery in the IDDP- 2 well might be explained by fill-in {{at the bottom of the}} well, inclination, heavy dog legs, thermal fracturing of the rock formations as well as the diameter of core barrel being wider than the diameter of heavyweight drill pipe. The IDDP- 2 well was finished at a depth of 4659  m in mid-December 2016 and the perforated liner pipe was lowered to a well depth of 4572  m. At the end of drilling operations, an additional sacrificial 7 ″ casing was set to a depth of 1300  m and cemented. Logging program, including temperature, pressure, and injectivity measurements, was carried out after 6  days of partial heating up. It was confirmed that the IDDP- 2 well successfully penetrated the supercritical conditions of the geothermal brines in the Reykjanes geothermal system with 427  °C and 340 bars of pressure. The main feed zones of the IDDP- 2 well were estimated at depths of 3360  m, 4200  m, 4370  m and 4550  m (Friðleifsson and Elders 2017; Friðleifsson et al. 2017). Right after the drilling operation ceased, an 3 ½″ injection string was lowered close to the well bottom and a 5 -months stimulation operation with cold water pumping started. In May 2017, temperature logs were carried out after few days of heating up and confirmed bottom hole temperature of approximately 535  °C. After well stimulation, an attempt was made to seal off the main feed zone at 3400  m using biodegradable polymers. Unexpectedly, material totally blocked the well from downflowing and cooling was no longer possible. This resulted in week-long heating up of the production casing string and a serious casing damage between 2307 and 2380  m of well depth was discovered using wire-line logs. After retrieving the stimulation string, corrosion of latter assembly sections was observed. Currently, preparation for production tests is ongoing with the first flow tests planned for the first quarter of 2019 (iddp.com).|$|R
