The present investigation was carried out to test the hypothesis that <b>microinjections</b> of UCN 1 into the nucleus ambiguus (nAmb) may elicit cardiac effects. Urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated, adult male Wistar rats, weighing between 300 – 350 g, were used. nAmb was identified by <b>microinjections</b> of l-glutamate (5 mM, 30 nl). <b>Microinjections</b> (30 nl) of different concentrations (0. 062, 0. 125, 0. 25, and 0. 5 mM) of UCN 1 into the nAmb elicited bradycardic responses (26. 5 ± 1, 30. 1 ± 1. 7, 46. 9 ± 1. 7, and 40. 3 ± 2. 6 beats/min, respectively).

In this study we provide electrophysiological evidence that the antinociception, which accompanies the behavioral state resembling general anesthesia following pentobarbital (PB) <b>microinjections</b> into the MPTA of awake rats, could be accompanied by the attenuation of sensory transmission through the spinothalamic tract (STT). Following bilateral <b>microinjections</b> of PB into the MPTA spontaneous firing rate (SFR), antidromic firing index (FI), and sciatic (Sc) as well as sural (Su) nerve-evoked responses (ER) of identified lumbar STT neurons in the isoflurane-anesthetized rat were quantified using extracellular recording techniques. <b>Microinjections</b> of PB into the MPTA significantly suppressed the SFR (47 %), magnitudes of Sc- (26 %) and Su-ER (36 %), and FI (41 %) of STT neurons. <b>Microinjections</b> of PB-free vehicle control did not alter any of the above-cited electrophysiological parameters.

40|$|<b>Microinjections</b> of {{angiotensin}} II (Ang II) {{into the}} rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) induce a sympathetically-mediated increase {{in blood pressure}} (BP), through an interaction with AT 1 -receptors. Under basal conditions in anaesthetised animals, <b>microinjections</b> of AT 1 -receptor antagonists into the RVLM have little, or no effect on BP, suggesting that the angiotensin input to this nucleus is not tonically active. In contrast, <b>microinjections</b> of AT 1 -receptor antagonists into the RVLM of sodium-deplete rats and TGR(mRen 2) 27 rats, induce a depressor response through sympatho-inhibition. This indicates that when the renin-angiotensin system is activated, angiotensin can act in the RVLM to support sympathetic nerve discharge and BP. This study examined whether angiotensin inputs to the RVLM are activated in the spontaneously hypertensive rat — a pathophysiological model which displays increases in both brain angiotensin levels and sympathetic nerve activity.

2500|$|Both the monotelic and the syntelic {{configurations}} fail {{to generate}} centromeric tension and are detected by the spindle checkpoint. In contrast, the merotelic configuration is not detected by this control mechanism. However, {{most of these}} errors are detected and corrected before the cell enters in anaphase. A key factor in the correction of these anchoring errors is the chromosomal passenger complex, which includes the kinase protein Aurora B, its target and activating subunit INCENP and two other subunits, Survivin and [...] Borealin/Dasra B (reviewed by Adams and collaborators in 2001). Cells in which the function of this complex has been abolished by dominant negative mutants, RNAi, antibody <b>microinjection</b> or using selective drugs, accumulate errors in chromosome anchoring. Many {{studies have shown that}} Aurora B is required to destabilize incorrect anchoring kinetochore-MT, favoring the generation of amphitelic connections. Aurora B homolog in yeast (Ipl1p) phosphorilates some kinetochore proteins, such as the constitutive protein Ndc10p and members of the Ndc80 and Dam1-DASH-DDD complexes. Phosphorilation of Ndc80 complex components produces destabilization of kMTs anchoring. It has been proposed that Aurora B localization is important for its function: as it is located in the inner region of the kinetochore (in the centromeric heterochromatin), when the centromeric tension is established sister kinetochores separate, and Aurora B cannot reach its substrates, so that kMTs are stabilized. It {{is interesting to note that}} Aurora B is frequently overexpressed in several cancer types, and it is currently a target for the development of anticancer drugs.|$|E
