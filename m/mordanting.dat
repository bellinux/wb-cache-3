50|$|Virtually all wicks {{are treated}} with various flame-resistant {{solutions}} in {{a process known as}} <b>mordanting.</b> Without <b>mordanting</b> the wick would be destroyed by the flames and the flow of melted wax to the flame would cease. Beyond that, wicks can be treated with substances to improve the color and brightness of the flame, provide better rigidity to keep the wick out of the melted wax, and improve the flow of that wax up the wick. Common treatments are borax and salt which are dissolved in water in which the wicks are soaked.|$|E

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the independent variable}} Exposure, laundering had a different influence than light exposure on color compositions of <b>mordanted</b> and nonmordanted dyed specimens. For black walnut, <b>mordanted</b> and nonmordanted specimens were greener (a*) and bluer (b*) when subjected to laundering (Table  3). <b>Mordanted</b> specimens were yellower (b*) than nonmordanted specimens but only before laundering. After laundering, b* value became similar for both <b>mordanted</b> and nonmordanted. For Osage orange, <b>mordanted</b> specimens were redder (a*) than nonmordanted before laundering, but a* of both became similar after laundering. <b>Mordanted</b> Osage orange was also yellower (b*) and nonmordanted Osage orange was bluer (b*) after laundering. For eastern redcedar, specimens turned lighter, redder, and bluer after laundering both for <b>mordanted</b> and nonmordanted. When visually inspecting the specimens, <b>mordanted</b> and laundered Osage orange was a brighter and clearer yellow when compared to nonmordanted. It is recommended for natural dyers wanting to maintain a bright yellow to use a PAS <b>mordant</b> on wool yarns dyed with Osage orange.|$|R

50|$|Paper or cloth {{is often}} mordanted {{beforehand}} with aluminium sulfate (alum) and gently laid onto the floating colors (although {{methods such as}} Turkish ebru and Japanese suminagashi do not require <b>mordanting).</b> The colors are thereby transferred and adhered {{to the surface of}} the paper or material. The paper or material is then carefully lifted off the size, and hung up to dry. Some marblers gently drag the paper over a rod to draw off the excess size. If necessary, excess bleeding colors and sizing can be rinsed off, and then the paper or fabric is allowed to dry. After the print is made, any color residues remaining on the size are carefully skimmed off of the surface, in order to clear it before starting a new pattern.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 59 - 62) Dandelion roots, dock roots, English walnut hulls, eucalyptus bark, eucalyptus hulls, eucalyptus leaves, juniper berries, mistletoe, kelp {{and onion}} skins were the natural dye materials selected for this study. Five colorfastness tests were performed using these ten natural dyes and four <b>mordants.</b> The {{study was designed}} to obtain qualitative information on the colorfastness properties of the ten natural dyes to light, laundering, crocking, perspiration and drycleaning and to determine the effect of the <b>mordants</b> on these colorfastness properties. Alum, chrome, iron and tin were the <b>mordants</b> used. For the most part, the ten natural dyes rated satisfactory on the crocking, laundering, drycleaning and perspiration tests. A few dye/mordant combinations rated satisfactory to light. These included: juniper berries <b>mordanted</b> with tin, <b>mordanted</b> English walnut hulls, eucalyptus hulls and leaves <b>mordanted</b> with iron, eucalyptus bark <b>mordanted</b> with chrome and iron plus all kelp samples except those <b>mordanted</b> with tin. The lightfastness of dock roots, mistletoe and eucalyptus hulls was poor. Generally, colorfastness was increased by applying <b>mordants.</b> Iron <b>mordanted</b> samples averaged lower ratings than the other <b>mordanted</b> samples on all colorfastness tests except light and averaged lower ratings the the unmordanted samples on the crocking and laundering tests.

30|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} (mean {{and standard}} deviation) for L*a*b* coordinates {{were used to}} examine the directional relationship within the independent variables <b>mordant</b> and exposure. Assessing this information allowed us to compare overall color change due to the use of a PAS <b>mordant.</b> The PAS <b>mordant</b> influenced the color cast of wool yarns dyed with black walnut, Osage orange, and eastern redcedar regardless of light exposure or laundering (Tables  2, 3). For black walnut, <b>mordanted</b> specimens were considerably lighter, redder (a*) and yellower (b*) than nonmordanted. For Osage orange <b>mordanted</b> specimens were yellower (b*) than nonmordanted. For eastern redcedar, <b>mordanted</b> specimens were lighter, greener (a*) and yellower (b*) than nonmordanted.|$|R
30|$|Prior to <b>mordanting,</b> {{the wool}} yarns were {{immersed}} {{in an aqueous}} solution containing non-ionic detergent (5  mL/L) for 30  min for removing unwanted dust {{from the surface of}} the wool. Powdered A. catechu, 5.0 – 0.5  % o.w.f. (on weight of fiber), was added to water in separate baths, and the temperature of the mordant solutions was raised to 30  °C to make biomordant completely soluble.

30|$|In this study, wool fibers are dyed with {{a natural}} {{colorant}} extracted from walnut bark in presence and absence of <b>mordants.</b> The effect of aluminum sulfate, ferrous sulfate, and stannous chloride <b>mordants</b> on colorimetric and fastness properties of wool fibers was investigated. Juglone was identified as the main coloring component in walnut bark extract by UV visible and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. The results showed that pretreatment with metallic <b>mordants</b> substantially improved the colorimetric and fastness properties of wool fibers dyed with walnut bark extract.

30|$|The {{influence}} of PAS on hue and colorfastness had mixed results. The PAS <b>mordant</b> had a warming effect {{on all of}} the dyewoods that was minimized for black walnut after laundering, while eastern redcedar’s cast was reduced after light exposure. Regardless of <b>mordant</b> type, Osage orange darkened from a golden yellow to a tan/brown following exposure to light. Colorfastness to light was enhanced with a PAS <b>mordant</b> for black walnut and eastern redcedar, while Osage orange had a significant difference from laundering but not for light. While any improvement to colorfastness is viewed as positive, the mixed results and subtle overall visual color difference from <b>mordant</b> use {{may not be enough to}} convince dyers to use a metallic <b>mordant</b> with tannin dyestuffs. The use of a <b>mordant</b> does mean another step in the dyeing process that uses water, energy, and may release unbound <b>mordant</b> chemicals into disposal systems, impacting both the environment and health of communities. Further, introduction of metallic <b>mordant</b> use may impact the cultural heritage of traditional dye practices. Conversely, understanding and utilizing a metallic <b>mordant</b> to shift color, improve lightfastness, and understand long term color results may create social value through new knowledge, as well as economic gain by addressing consumer concern over colorfastness of natural dyes.|$|R
