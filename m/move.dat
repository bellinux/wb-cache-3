5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack <b>move,</b> flank <b>move</b> and focus fire. An attack <b>move</b> orders the ships to <b>move</b> and fire simultaneously; a flank <b>move</b> increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E

5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. They can learn up to four <b>moves,</b> including attacking <b>moves,</b> healing <b>moves,</b> and <b>moves</b> that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of <b>moves</b> being considered: generally, <b>moves</b> involving physical exertion are physical, while <b>moves</b> involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. <b>Moves</b> are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's <b>moves</b> correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type <b>moves,</b> while Grass-type <b>moves</b> do little damage to them and Electric-type <b>moves</b> do normal damage.|$|R

Results indicate that participants were not more likely to detect icon position changes (<b>moves),</b> when they were large, 17. 5 mm <b>moves</b> (control <b>moves),</b> opposed to when they were gradual <b>moves</b> (a series of 10 smaller, 1. 75 mm <b>moves).</b> But, when <b>moves</b> were correctly detected, response times were faster for control <b>moves</b> than they were for gradual <b>moves.</b> These findings may help clarify how attributes of a change (here, gradual vs. control <b>moves)</b> influence change blindness in military information displays...|$|R
