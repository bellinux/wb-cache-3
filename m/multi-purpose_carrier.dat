5000|$|From January through July 1973, Kitty Hawk changed home ports from San Diego to San Francisco. Kitty Hawk {{moved into}} dry dock on 14 January 1973, and work began {{to convert the}} ship from an attack (CVA) to a {{multi-mission}} carrier (CV). The [...] "CV" [...] designation indicated that Kitty Hawk was no longer strictly an attack carrier, in that anti-submarine warfare would also become a major role. Kitty Hawk became the first Pacific Fleet carrier to carry the multi-purpose [...] "CV" [...] designation. The conversion consisted of adding 10 new helicopter calibrating stations, installing sonar/sonobuoy readout and analysis center and associated equipment, and changing {{a large portion of}} the ship's operating procedures. One of the major equipment/space changes in the conversion was the addition of the Anti-Submarine Classification and Analysis Center (ASCAC) in the CIC area. ASCAC worked in close conjunction with the anti-submarine warfare aircraft assigned aboard Carrier Air Wing 11. During the yard period, the Engineering Department underwent a major change in its propulsion plant. The Navy Standard Oil (black oil) fuel system was completely converted to Navy Distillate Fuel. The Air Department added several major changes to the flight deck, including enlarging the jet blast deflectors (JBD) and installing more powerful catapults in order to handle the new Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which Kitty Hawk was standing by to receive for its next deployment. Enlarging JBD#1 meant the No. 1 Aircraft Elevator had to be redesigned, making Kitty Hawk the only carrier at the time having an aircraft elevator which tracked from the hangar deck to the flight deck angling out 6°. Kitty Hawk moved out of dry dock on 28 April 1973, and the next day, on her 12th birthday, was named a <b>Multi-Purpose</b> Aircraft <b>Carrier</b> (CV).|$|R

Smart sensory systems are crucial for successful autonomous systems. We will give an explanation for the robot system architecture designed and implemented in this study and a short review of existing techniques, since there exist several recent thorough books and review paper on this paper. Instead we will focus on the main results with relevance to the intelligent service robot project at the Centre of Intelligent Design, Automation & Manufacturing (CIDAM). We will conclude by discussing some possible future extensions of the project.

40|$|The Canadian {{government}} has committed substantial research funds towards improving {{guidelines for the}} structural design of commercial ships operating in northern waterways. Of particular concern is the threat to survivability presented by head-on collision with multi-year ice or fragments of icebergs. The task of developing effective numerical models for studying the collision process has been hampered by {{the complexity of the}} physical interaction mechanisms. The present research considers the nonlinear and dynamic character of this problem. A method for time-domain simulation of hullgirder stresses in icebreaking ships during collisions with multi-year ice is described. The model, ITHACA-SHIP, considers the transient ship-ice interaction and fluid-structure phenomena as strongly coupled through ship dynamics. Emphasis has therefore been placed on the development of hydrodynamic and ice force models. Rigorous kinematic constraints at the interaction interface were identified as a critical factor in replicating the dynamic characteristics of prototype collision response. This {{led to the development of}} techniques for the three-dimensional mapping of this instantaneous ice boundary relative to the moving hull surface. The transient hydrodynamic force is also calculated directly, using boundary integral equation methods and a two-dimensional strip approach. The wave radiation problem for defining the free surface boundary of the fluid is based on a mixed Euler-Lagrange formulation. The prediction of hullgirder stresses is carried out in two steps. Ice and fluid interaction forces are first determined from a rigid body motions simulation, and then subsequently applied as generalized forces in an analysis of flexural response. The hullgirder bending moments and stresses are extracted from the response. The modeling methodology has been verified by predicting simulated stress results for the MV Arctic, a <b>multi-purpose</b> bulk <b>carrier.</b> Good correlation was observed between the numerical predictions and corresponding results from physical model tests and full scale ramming trials. Further discussion is given concerning whipping indicated at higher impact speeds. Nonlinearity of the ship-ice and fluid-structure interaction phenomena has been assessed by introducing progressively more complex representations of the physical mechanisms into the ITHACA-SHIP model. These studies found a high degree of coupling between the two effects. The transient hydrodynamic term was shown to be a significant factor, and the importance of the kinematic criteria confirmed. The indirect representation of collision interaction forces using conventional added mass and damping coefficients in the equations of motion was shown to be conceptually incorrect. The present research has largely been limited to the development of the modeling methodology and examination of a number of suppositions concerning the collision process. But, interactive design software is available in the ITHACA-SHIP model which gives it a capacity for representing realistic ship forms. It may therefore be applied more generally as an engineering tool for conceptual design and parametric analysis; either to investigate collisions with ice, or other types of obstacles, such as mud banks and reefs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the unmanned research aircraft Carolo P 360 "ALADINA" (Application of Light-weight Aircraft for Detecting IN situ Aerosol) for investigating the {{horizontal and vertical}} distribution of ultrafine particles in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). It has a wingspan of 3. 6 m, a maximum take-off weight of 25 kg and is equipped with aerosol instrumentation and meteorological sensors. A first application of the system, together with the unmanned research aircraft MASC (<b>Multi-Purpose</b> Airborne <b>Carrier)</b> of the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen (EKUT), is described. As small payload for ALADINA, two condensation particle counters (CPC) and one optical particle counter (OPC) were miniaturised by re-arranging the vital parts and composing them in a space-saving way in the front compartment of the airframe. The CPCs are improved concerning the lower detection threshold and the response time to less than 1. 3 s. Each system was characterised in the laboratory and calibrated with test aerosols. The CPCs are operated in this study with two different lower detection threshold diameters of 11 and 18 nm. The amount of ultrafine particles, which is an indicator for new particle formation, {{is derived from the}} difference in number concentrations of the two CPCs (Δ N). Turbulence and thermodynamic structure of the boundary layer are described by measurements of fast meteorological sensors that are mounted at the aircraft nose. A first demonstration of ALADINA and a feasibility study were conducted in Melpitz near Leipzig, Germany, at the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station of the Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS) on 2 days in October 2013. There, various ground-based instruments are installed for long-term atmospheric monitoring. The ground-based infrastructure provides valuable additional background information to embed the flights in the continuous atmospheric context and is used for validation of the airborne results. The development of the boundary layer, derived from backscatter signals of a portable Raman lidar POLLY XT, allows a quick overview of the current vertical structure of atmospheric particles. Ground-based aerosol number concentrations are consistent with the results from flights in heights of a few metres. In addition, a direct comparison of ALADINA aerosol data and ground-based aerosol data, sampling the air at the same location for more than 1 h, shows comparable values within the range of ± 20 %. MASC was operated simultaneously with complementary flight patterns. It is equipped with the same meteorological instruments that offer the possibility to determine turbulent fluxes. Therefore, additional information about meteorological conditions was collected in the lowest part of the atmosphere. Vertical profiles up to 1000 m in altitude indicate a high variability with distinct layers of aerosol, especially for the small particles of a few nanometres in diameter on 1 particular day. The stratification was almost neutral and two significant aerosol layers were detected with total aerosol number concentrations up to 17 000 ± 3400 cm − 3 between 180 and 220 m altitude and 14 000 ± 2800 cm − 3 between 550 and 650 m. Apart from those layers, the aerosol distribution was well mixed and reached the total number concentration of less than 8000 ± 1600 cm − 3. During another day, the distribution of the small particles in the lowermost ABL was related to the stratification, with continuously decreasing number concentrations from 16 000 ± 3200 cm − 3 to a minimum of 4000 ± 800 cm − 3 {{at the top of the}} inversion at 320 m. Above this, the total number concentration was rather constant. In the region of 500 to 600 m altitude, a significant difference of both CPCs was observed. This event occurred during the boundary layer development in the morning and represents a particle burst within the ABL...|$|R
