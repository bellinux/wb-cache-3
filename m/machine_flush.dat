The SNRs between the event sound and the voice sound are approximately 0, 3, 6, and 9  dB.

The average accuracy rates of sound event recognition with respect to SNRs are shown in Fig.  14. In the first experiment, clean event sounds in the ASCC SoundLib were used as the training data. The testing results without sound separation are very poor with average accuracy rates below 60  %. In the second experiment, the results are better when the sound separation is applied. These separated event sounds are labelled by the human and then used for training in the third experiment. The results are improved significantly.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{optimization}} of Electrical Discharge <b>Machining</b> (EDM) Injection <b>flushing</b> type control parameters on multi-performance optimization characteristics instead of single performance optimization using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) Method. The experimental control parameters were being optimized {{according to their}} various machining characteristics namely material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR) and surface roughness (SR) using copper as the tool and AISI 304 stainless steel as the workpiece. This parameters optimization was based on Taguchi’s orthogonal array (OA) combined with GRA. A grey relational grade (GRG) calculated based on GRA was used to optimize the EDM process with multiple performance characteristics and Taguchi’s L 18 OA was used to plan the experiments. The machining parameters selected are polarity, pulse on duration, discharge current, discharge voltage, machining depth, machining diameter and dielectric liquid pressure.

30|$|On {{the day of}} surgery, {{we first}} washed out {{volatile}} anesthetics from the anesthesia <b>machine</b> by <b>flushing</b> the system with oxygen (10  L/min for 30  min). We applied defibrillator pads soon after the patient entered the operating room due to his risk of developing a life-threatening arrhythmia. We also administrated atropine 0.01  mg/kg to avoid the occurrence of long QT due to bradycardia. The BIS score was 97 before the induction. Anesthesia was induced with continuous administration of dexmedetomidine 4  μg/kg/h for 15  min followed by midazolam 1 − 2  mg according to the BIS score and his vital signs. Lidocaine was sprayed around his larynx. The BIS score was 69 after when we administered midazolam up to 7  mg. After confirming that mask ventilation is possible, we administrated remifentanil 2  μg/kg/h and then performed laryngoscopy, {{but he had a}} strong gag reflex with 69 of the BIS. We then administered additional remifentanil (2  μg/kg), but the BIS score was still high (64) and he still had a gag reflex. Since we anticipated that administration of a large amount of remifentanil may cause extreme bradycardia, we decided to use a muscle relaxant instead of administering additional remifentanil. We administered an initial dose of rocuronium (5  mg), and an additional dose (5  mg), which helped relieve his gag reflex, and the BIS score decreased to 50. We placed an endotracheal tube (internal diameter 6  mm) using a McGrath® video laryngoscope without difficulty. Throughout the induction, there were no cardiovascular or oxygenation-related complications. For maintenance of anesthesia, the surgeon performed a mandibular nerve block using 1 % lidocaine hydrochloride-epinephrine (9  mL), and we continued to titrate dexmedetomidine 0.7  μg/kg/h and remifentanil 0.15 – 0.25  μg/kg/min according to the invasiveness of the procedure, his BIS score, and his vital signs. Further, in order to avoid bradycardia, we did not administer additional remifentanil; however, this proved difficult because his BIS score remained high (60 – 80) during the surgery. We monitored his rectal temperature throughout the surgery, it was 35 – 36.5  °C throughout the surgery.|$|R

The most important parameters of EDM are the material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra).

40|$|It was {{desired to}} {{assemble}} thick-walled Al alloy 2219 pressure vessels by bobbin-tool friction-stir welding. To develop the welding-process, mechanical-property, and fitness-for-service information {{to support this}} effort, extensive friction-stir welding-parameter studies were conducted on 2. 5 cm. and 3. 8 cm. thick 2219 Al alloy plate. Starting conditions of the plate were the fully-heat-treated (-T 62) and in the annealed (-O) conditions. The former condition was chosen {{with the intent of}} using the welds in either the 'as welded' condition or after a simple low-temperature aging treatment. Since preliminary stress-analyses showed that stresses in and near the welds would probably exceed the yield-strength of both 'as welded' and welded and aged weld-joints, a post-weld solution-treatment, quenching, and aging treatment was also examined. Once a suitable set of welding and post-weld heat-treatment parameters was established, the project divided into two parts. The first part concentrated on developing the necessary process information {{to be able to make}} defect-free friction-stir welds in 3. 8 cm. thick Al alloy 2219 in the form of circumferential welds that would join two hemispherical forgings with a 102 cm. inside diameter. This necessitated going to a bobbin-tool welding-technique to simplify the tooling needed to react the large forces generated in friction-stir welding. The bobbin-tool technique was demonstrated on both flat-plates and plates that were bent to the curvature of the actual vessel. An additional issue was termination of the weld, i. e. closing out the hole left at the end of the weld by withdrawal of the friction-stir welding tool. This was accomplished by friction-plug welding a slightly-oversized Al alloy 2219 plug into the termination-hole, followed by <b>machining</b> the plug <b>flush</b> with both the inside and outside surfaces of the vessel. The second part of the project involved demonstrating that the welds were fit for the intended service. This involved determining the room-temperature tensile and elastic-plastic fracture-toughness properties of the bobbin-tool friction-stir welds after a post-weld solution-treatment, quenching, and aging heat-treatment. These mechanical properties were used to conduct fracture-mechanics analyses to determine critical flaw sizes. Phased-array and conventional ultrasonic non-destructive examination was used to demonstrate that no flaws that match or exceed the calculated critical flaw-sizes exist in or near the friction-stir welds...|$|R
