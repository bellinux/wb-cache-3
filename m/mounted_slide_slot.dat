50|$|Completed <b>slides</b> were <b>mounted</b> into pin-registered <b>slide</b> <b>mounts.</b> Three or more {{pieces of}} film could be <b>mounted</b> into a <b>slide</b> <b>mount</b> which allowed <b>slides</b> {{to contain the}} image film chip and masks to allow for {{inserting}} and over-projecting.

30|$|For staining, {{the slides}} were rinsed in {{distilled}} water and stained in hematoxylin (Merck, Germany). Slides were counterstained in eosin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and dehydrated, cleared, and <b>mounted.</b> <b>Slides</b> were viewed with slide scanner (Zeiss, Germany).|$|R

50|$|In Acanthamoeba infections, the {{diagnosis}} {{can be made}} from microscopic examination of stained smears of biopsy specimens (brain tissue, skin, cornea) or of corneal scrapings, which may detect trophozoites and cysts. Cultivation of the causal organism, and its identification by direct immunofluorescent antibody, may also prove useful. Laboratory workers and physicians often mistake the organisms on wet mount for monocytes and a diagnosis of viral meningitis is mistakenly given if the organisms are not motile. Heating a copper penny with an alcohol lamp and placing it on the wet <b>mount</b> <b>slide</b> will activate sluggish trophozoites and more rapidly make {{the diagnosis}}. If the person performing the spinal tap rapidly looks at the heated wet <b>mount</b> <b>slide</b> the trophozoites can be seen to swarm while monocytes do not.|$|R

The fan-shaped die is welded with steel plate in circle and rib in radial direction by the analysis of structural deformation. The optimal design is provided with ovality of pipe as object variable and <b>sliding</b> <b>slot</b> dimensions as design variables. Compared with experiential shape groove of slot, ovality of optimized slot decreases about 10. 5 % in average.

The first step for staining is deparaffinization then rehydration and staining with Alcian Blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).

Microscopic examination was done by saline wet mount, iodine wet mount and modified acid-fast staining technique. The <b>mounted</b> <b>slides</b> were examined under low power (10 X) followed by high power (40 X) and acid-fast stained smears were examined using oil immersion (100 X).

40|$|A FEM-numerical {{simulation}} {{system is}} developed {{to simulate the}} process of rotary draw bending of tube. The emphasis is to discuss some factors such as tube materials, bending moment of fan-shaped die, pushing force of <b>sliding</b> <b>slot</b> and tube relative bending radius which {{have an effect on}} tube bending quality. The quality parameters of ovality, thinning ratio and thickening ratio are the same as the measurement values in the practical production. Some improved methods are put forward to according to the simulation results. The experiment shows that the simulation system can forecast accurately the deformation in the process of tube bending, so the production manufacturing cost decreases greatly. 5 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Owing to the {{limitation}} of space, the tiltable link is positioned opposite to G 1 but still on the line connecting G 1 and G 2. As the link was only required to be tilted by a small angle for jam-negation, positioning the link in this manner or instead using a <b>sliding</b> <b>slot</b> for G 2, tangent to the G 1 circumference should provide the same result. A DC adapter is used to supply the input voltage to the rotating motor unit. The prototype is made mainly of aluminum and weighs 650  g.

30|$|The {{identification}} of the genera poses problem since the organic extensions usually disappear after frustule cleaning treatment that diatoms are subjected to for microscopic observation. Under such circumstances the genera tends to get misidentified as Thalassiosira sp. (Hasle and Syvertsen 1997). As such observations {{need to be made}} before cleaning the frustules as simple water <b>mounted</b> <b>slides.</b> But though this marine genus has both fultoportulae and rimoportulae, and could have been included in Thalassiosira, it is preferable to maintain the two genera separately, {{on the basis of the}} extended wing since the genus is already large and extremely diverse.|$|R

30|$|Tumours were {{embedded}} in gelatin blocks for MRI acquisition and wooden rods were placed as fiducial markers {{in all four}} corners of the gelatine blocks to aid spatial recognition and co-registration between the following imaging modalities. The samples were transported in dry ice following MRI acquisition. Samples were then re-frozen and cryosectioned to a thickness of 10  µm prior to MALDI-MSI data capture. 10  µm-thick frozen tissue sections were cut, using a Leica CM 3050 cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK). The sections were then freeze–thaw mounted on poly-l-lysine glass <b>slides.</b> <b>Mounted</b> <b>slides</b> were either used immediately or stored in an airtight tube at − 80  °C for subsequent use.|$|R
50|$|Once the wax {{embedded}} {{block is}} finished, sections {{will be cut}} from it and usually placed to float on a waterbath surface which spreads the section out.

A number of slides will usually be prepared from different levels throughout the block. After this the thin section <b>mounted</b> <b>slide</b> is stained and a protective cover slip is mounted on it. For common stains, an automatic process is normally used; but rarely used stains are often done by hand.|$|R

50|$|A digital minilab is a {{computer}} printer that uses traditional chemical photographic processes to make prints from digital images. Photographs are input to the digital minilab using a built-in film scanner that captures images from negative and positive photographic films (including <b>mounted</b> <b>slides),</b> flatbed scanners, a kiosk that accepts CD-ROMs or memory cards from a digital camera, or a website that accepts uploads. The operator can make many corrections such as brightness or color saturation, contrast, scene lighting color correction, sharpness and cropping.
