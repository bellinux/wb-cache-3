5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all <b>my</b> <b>stuff</b> comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
500|$|With the {{assistance}} of the National Guard and Air Force personnel, several hundred patients were evacuated from local hospitals with no injuries or loss of life during the evacuation process. Many residents also evacuated to motels and homes in neighboring communities. Some residents of Grand Forks criticized the National Weather Service for its incorrect prediction of the river level, as it had prevented them from securing their possessions from their homes. One resident said: [...] "If they'd said earlier the river would hit , I would have moved <b>my</b> <b>stuff</b> out of my house. At 49, it was safe." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{of a conversation}} held between Francis and Albini can be heard {{at the end of}} [...] "Oh My Golly!". According to Lupfer, [...] "it was a concept he [...] was going for to get some studio banter." [...] As Deal was leaving the studio to smoke a cigarette, she exclaimed [...] "If anybody touches <b>my</b> <b>stuff,</b> I'll kill ya." [...] Francis replied with [...] "I'll kill you, you fucking die, if anybody touches my stuff". The track begins at this point, with Francis explaining the conversation to Albini, whose voice is not heard on the track. Lupfer later admitted that Albini knew [...] "perfectly well what was going on." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have <b>my</b> <b>stuff</b> to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Elvin Bishop hit, [...] "Fooled Around and Fell in Love," [...] it was Szymczyk who {{suggested}} {{the inclusion of}} the song on Bishop's Struttin' <b>My</b> <b>Stuff</b> album, feeling the blues-oriented album lacked a pop single. The song would go on to become Bishop's biggest hit. [...] Such a pattern was repeated throughout his career. The Eagles brought him in to refine and improve their [...] "rock" [...] sound, and all of their biggest selling albums and songs were Szymcyzk-produced. Martin Turner of Wishbone Ash has called him [...] "my all time favourite producer". While the two did not always get along during recording, usually over Turner's bass-playing style, Turner does credit Szymczyk with giving the band a more commercial sound on one of their most successful albums, 1974's There's the Rub.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. [...] "She {{told me to}} pack up all <b>my</b> <b>stuff,</b> I'm getting kicked out—the video starts off like that", said Roache. It opens with Beyoncé filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the {{audience}} {{to find out that}} she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.|$|E
6000|$|Never before {{did this}} song {{mean so much}} to me as at this moment when the winds were {{actually}} howling outdoors, and Uncle Frank was in very truth piling the logs higher.

500|$|In {{late summer}} {{he was invited}} by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged {{to make it clear}} to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzymała [...] "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and {{responding}} to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was [...] "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed." [...] He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of <b>my</b> <b>stuff</b> in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere", he wrote to Grzymała.|$|E
500|$|Selena Gomez cited Stripped as an {{inspiration}} for her second studio album Revival, saying [...] "That’s {{one of my favorite}} albums and that was kind of what I started off Revival as, some sort of story. I mean, that album for her was incredible — 'Beautiful', 'Can’t Hold Us Down', all of that — that’s the stuff that I love," [...] she said. [...] "That was an album, that was complete on my record. I have 'Rise', 'Survivors', 'Revival', 'Kill Em With Kindness'. <b>My</b> <b>stuff</b> is full on, it's an album, it's a piece, it's something that I'm proud of." [...] In an interview with People, Demi Lovato said that her sixth studio album Tell Me You Love Me was inspired by Stripped. She said, [...] "I grew up listening to Christina Aguilera. She was one of my idols growing up". [...] "I think it was her breakout album that really transformed her into the icon that she is today," [...] explained Lovato. [...] "So that inspired me, she really inspired this album. I was even inspired by the black and white artwork!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of <b>my</b> <b>stuff</b> has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E

5000|$|Heinlein {{found another}} {{publisher}} (Putnam), feeling himself {{released from the}} constraints of writing novels for children. He had once told an interviewer {{that he did not}} want to do stories that merely added to categories defined by other works. He rather wanted to do his own work, stating that: [...] "I want to do <b>my</b> own <b>stuff,</b> <b>my</b> own way". He would go on to write a series of challenging books that redrew the boundaries of science fiction, including Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (1966).|$|R

500|$|Stewart told Vibe {{how he and}} The-Dream came up {{with the}} song's concept. He said [...] "That was Dream and I just getting in the room and clicking,... We were both on two {{different}} keyboards, two different drum machines and once again just got behind the mic and the rest is history." [...] Lyrics include lines like, [...] "But it's the last time, I'm movin' on / I'm throwing on my Louboutins." [...] Lopez described the idea behind the song as [...] "that point in a bad relationship and you're like, 'Damn, I really have to leave. It's just not good for me,' ... It's not the girl who's like, 'I'm gonna take <b>my</b> <b>stuff,</b> and I'm gonna put on my sweatpants, and I'm gonna cry,'... This girl is like putting on her hottest dress and her sexiest Louboutin shoes, and leaving your ass". In the chorus Lopez singles [...] "I'm throwing on my Louboutins" [...] eight times and overall the word [...] "Louboutins" [...] is spoken thirty-two times across the song. Prefix magazine said that [...] "Louboutins" [...] is used as a metaphor for female empowerment.|$|E

2500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} {{that much of the}} public fascination for Fasanella's work had relied on the political and socio-economic messages they contained rather than their artistic appeal. As those messages fell from favor, Fasanella was abandoned by many of his strongest supporters. As he told one reporter: [...] "The other day, I called an old lefty pal at 1199 (the drug and hospital workers' union) and offered them <b>my</b> <b>stuff.</b> 'Forget it Ralph,' he said to me. 'We don't want your stuff.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|James Ray: [...] "I wasn't {{involved}} {{too much}} with the album, as it was taking ages for Eldritch to formulate any concrete ideas, and I wanted to be writing <b>my</b> own <b>stuff.</b> I personally think the album transpired {{to cash in on}} the sales of the single." ...|$|R
2500|$|In addition, {{none of the}} parties, {{save for}} perhaps Gene Clark, seemed willing to {{contribute}} their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. [...] This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told author John Einarson [...] "I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because I {{was getting ready to}} do a solo record, Slipping Away, and I was saving all <b>my</b> good <b>stuff</b> and contributed this throwaway stuff that was awful. Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck." [...] McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added [...] "I don't think I was guilty of that. I gave them <b>my</b> best <b>stuff</b> at the time." ...|$|R

[...] She went on to claim that during the competition she was pushed to play down her marriage, because she was [...] "supposed to be flirting with everyone all the time" [...] and that married models were told to keep quiet about their marriages unless they were married to a celebrity because it drew {{more attention to the}} brand. [...] She later modeled for FHM and Maxim.|$|E
2500|$|Schlessinger {{created the}} Laura Schlessinger Foundation to help abused and {{neglected}} children in 1998. Schlessinger regularly asked her on-air audience to donate items for <b>My</b> <b>Stuff</b> bags, which go {{to children in}} need. All other donations came from other people or groups, usually {{in the form of}} donated items for the bags. Per the foundation's reports, money not used for operations was directed toward pro-life organizations, such as crisis pregnancy centers. In September 2004, Schlessinger announced that she was closing down the foundation because it had become too difficult and costly for her and her husband to underwrite, and they wished to devote their [...] "energies and resources to other pressing needs".|$|E
2500|$|Writer Chris Ware, {{author of}} Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth, has noticed several {{similarities}} between the title character of his work and Stewie Griffin.

[...] He further stated, [...] "I don't want a book of seven years' worth of <b>my</b> <b>stuff</b> to become available and then be {{accused of being a}} rip-off of Family Guy." [...] 20th Century Fox has insisted that Stewie is an entirely original character. In a 2003 interview, Seth MacFarlane said that he had never seen the comic strip before, described the similarities as [...] "pretty shocking" [...] and said that he could see how Ware would reach that conclusion." ...|$|E

I have also always had a love for British culture and spent a semester studying in London and traveling the British Isles. While there, I took numerous pictures of <b>my</b> <b>stuffed</b> animals around the country.

2500|$|The early Game Theory was {{described}} as a [...] "pseudo-psychedelic pop quartet" [...] for which Miller sang and wrote [...] "almost all of the material." [...] On the first three releases, Miller shared co-writing credits on [...] "The Young Drug" [...] with Alternate Learning's Carolyn O'Rourke, and on [...] "Life in July" [...] with Nancy Becker. Miller also included three songs that were written by Fred Juhos, and later defended the decision to record Juhos's songs as a Beatles-like [...] "relief from seriousness," [...] though only one was included in the Distortion of Glory compilation. Juhos's contributions were criticized as failing to mesh with Miller's, and Miller later mused, [...] "It's funny that his stuff wasn't popular.

[...] "Had I not been shooting The Warriors at the time, I don't think my career would have survived. They loved it overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much. It made exactly zero dollars in the United States.

2500|$|On {{the request}} of editor Mark Gruenwald, Byrne wrote and drew a new series in 1989, The Sensational She-Hulk (maintaining the 1985 graphic novel's title). Gruenwald {{directed}} that it be {{significantly different from the}} character's previous series, The Savage She-Hulk. Byrne's take was comedic and the She-Hulk, who was aware she was in a comic book, regularly broke the fourth wall, developing a love-hate relationship with her artist/writer by criticizing his storylines, drawing style, character development, etc. Byrne left the book after writing and drawing the first eight issues. Byrne was asked for input on writer Dwayne McDuffie's She-Hulk: Ceremony limited series, and according to Byrne, most of his objections to the story and notations of errors were ignored, and his editor, Bobbie Chase, [...] "was rewriting <b>my</b> <b>stuff</b> to bring it into line with" [...] the story in Ceremony. Upon complaining to DeFalco, Byrne says he was fired from his series. He later returned to write and draw issues #31–50 under new editor Renée Witterstaetter.|$|E
