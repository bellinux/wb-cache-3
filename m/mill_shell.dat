40|$|Tumbling mills {{describe}} {{a class of}} mechanical systems defined by a cylindrical chamber filled with balls and/or rock that rotates around its own longitudinal axis. This class of mechanical systems is used to grind to a desired quality different material {{in at least three}} industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries (ore, clinker and metal powder). These tumbling mills range in size from small 1 ft diameter lab mills to a 40 ft diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are composed of three main interactive and interdependent elements: the <b>mill</b> <b>shell,</b> liners/lifters and charge. These three elements work together to impact energy to the mill charge through the rotational motion of the <b>mill</b> <b>shell.</b> As with any mechanical system, the natural frequency of that system is essentially dictated by its mass and stiffness. In the case of a tumbling mill, a rotating system, the natural frequency of a given mill, as seen by a stationary observer, is also a function of the rotation speed. The aim of this paper The consequence for a rotating mill, and for that matter any rotating system, is that if the natural frequency of the mill should happen to match the operating rotating speed of the mill, resonance of the mill will occur.

40|$|Abstract Grinding mills are {{generally}} very inefficient, {{difficult to control}} and costly, {{in terms of both}} power and steel consumption. Improved understanding of temperature behaviour in milling circuits can be used in the model-based control of milling circuits. The loss of energy to the environment from the grinding mill is significant hence the need for adequate modeling. The main objectives of this work are to quantify the various rates of energy loss from the grinding mill so that a reliable model for temperature behaviour in a mill could be developed. Firstly models of temperature behaviour in a grinding mill are developed followed by the development of a model for the overall heat transfer coefficient for the grinding mill {{as a function of the}} load volume, mill speed and the design of the liners and <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> using the energy balances in order to model energy loss from the mill. The energy loss via convection through the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> is accounted for by quantifying the overall heat transfer coefficient of the shell. Batch tests with balls only were conducted. The practical aspect of the work involved the measurement of the temperatures of the mill load, air above the load, the liners, <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> and the environmental temperature. Other measurements were: mill power and sound energy from the mill. Energy balances are performed around the entire mill. A model that can predict the overall heat transfer coefficient over a broad range of operating conditions was obtained. It was found that the overall heat transfer coefficient for the grinding mill is a function of the individual heat transfer coefficients inside the mill and outside the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> as well as the design of the liners and shell. It was also found that inside heat transfer coefficients are affected by the load volume and mill speed. The external heat transfer coefficient is affected by the speed of the mill. The values for the overall heat transfer coefficient obtained in this work ranged from 14. 4 – 21 W/m 2 K. iv List of Publications The author has published the following papers based on the contents of this dissertation as follows: Published conference abstract Kapakyulu, E., and Moys, M.

Due to compression loading of rolls, where slabs are reduced to the long stripes, special specimens have been used and tested under compression loading conditions.

A new soft sensor approach based on the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> vibration signal is proposed in this paper. As the frequency domain signal contains more evidently information than time domain, the power spectral density (PSD) of the vibration signal was obtained via fast Fourier transform (FFT). And then the mass and the central frequency of the small peaks of the spectrum are extracted as the spectral features. At last the support vector machines (SVM) is used to build the soft model. The parameters of SVM, the input variables including the mass and the central frequency of the peaks are selected by Genetic algorithm (GA). Experimental results show that proposed soft sensor model has higher accuracy and better predictive performance than the other normal approaches.

40|$|The {{grinding}} {{efficiency of}} semi autogenous milling or ball milling {{depends on the}} tumbling motion of the total charge within the mill. Utilization of this tumbling motion for efficient breakage of particles depends on the conditions inside the mill. However, any kind of monitoring device to measure the conditions inside the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> during operation is virtually impossible due to the severe environment presented by the tumbling charge. An instrumented grinding ball, which {{is capable of surviving}} a few hours and transmitting the impacts it experiences, is proposed here. The spectrum of impacts collected over 100 revolutions of the mills presents the signature of the grinding environment inside mill. This signature could be effectively used to optimize the milling performance by investigating this signature's relation to mill product size, mill throughput, make-up ball size, mill speed, liner profile and ball addition rates. At the same time, it {{can also be used to}} design balls and liner systems that can survive longer in the mill. The technological advances made in electronics and communication makes this leap in instrumentation certainly viable. Hence, the instrumented grinding ball offers the ability to qualitatively observe and optimize the milling environment...|$|E
40|$|Models for {{understanding}} the basic concepts of fine grinding and how they apply {{to the design of}} stirred media mills have not yet matured. While spherical media in tower mills has previously been studied, real grinding media shape in stirred mills can range from spherical (steel/ceramic balls) to highly non-spherical (sand or slag) resulting in very different media and grinding dynamics. Handling the contact mechanics of non-spherical particles is a challenge for numerical models, and very few studies dealing with non-spherical particle shape exist in the literature. Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of dry media flow in a pilot-scale tower mill are performed for four cases with different shaped grinding media, in order to understand how flow and energy utilisation within a stirred mill depend on media shape. Differences in media transport, stress distribution, energy dissipation, and liner wear were observed in the tower mill for the spherical and non-spherical cases. A significant departure from sphericity of the media leads to strong dilation of the bed, reduced bulk density, and a reduction in active volume and collisional power levels leading to a reduction in power draw for the mill. In addition, highly non-spherical media tend to pack tightly near the mill walls forming a near solid layer around the inside of the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> which results in poorer transport and mixing, as well as increased wear rates on the screw impeller. Grinding performance in stirred mills appears to deteriorate strongly when using highly non-spherical media...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to improve how food loss is quantified and characterize the nature of food loss across the value chain for different commodities in {{a wide array of}} countries. For this purpose, we designed a set of surveys to measure the extent of food loss. While the surveys were tailored to specific countries and commodities and commodity varieties (for example, while Maize in Honduras and Guatemala have the same attributes, wheat in China has different attributes than wheat in Mexico), they provide a consistent measurement of food loss across different agents in the value chain (i. e., farmers, middlemen, and processors). The surveys capture detailed information about these agents’ different processes and quantify food loss along each production stage by collecting self-reported measures of the volumes and values of food losses incurred during different processes (harvesting, threshing, <b>milling,</b> <b>shelling,</b> winnowing, drying, packaging, transporting, sorting, picking, transforming, etc.). In addition, we estimate losses based on commodity damage by collecting detailed data from farmers, middlemen, and processors regarding the quality (based on damage coefficients) of agricultural commodities that they use as inputs and outputs. This allows us to quantify food loss in terms of the quality attributable to each agent across the value chain. Finally, we also estimate food loss based on commodity attributes by capturing information about different types of commodity attributes (e. g., size, impurities, broken grain, etc.) and ascertaining the price penalty that each of these types of crop damage entails. In this line, we are able to identify particular factors that diminish commodities’ values and thus are able to quantify food quality loss based on market conditions.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the classification performance of static air classifier in an industrial Vertical Spindle Mill (VSM), sampling ports were drilled on the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> and new on-line sampling methods were designed. Size and density compositions of classifier feed, classifier reject and Pulverized Fuel (PF) were analyzed. Calculation was done about the circulating ratio within the VSM and classification efficiency of the classifier with several surveys. Influences of three operation variables, namely coal type, air rate and roller load pressure on the classifier performance were investigated. Result shows that circulating ratio is around 7 and 10. Yield of particles with - 90 μm decreases from 32 % in classifier feed to 24 % in classifier reject after classification, which indicates the poor classification of classifier. Density composition of samples in classifier feed, classifier reject and pulverized fuel are quite different. Dominant density levels are - 1. 4 g/cm and + 1. 8 g/cm in pulverized fuel due to size reduction and liberation. Results of classification efficiency show that the variation of the air rate in a range between 62. 8 t/h and 53. 2 t/h has limited influence on the efficiency, however, classification efficiency decreases significantly when air rate is smaller than 44 t/h.

Charge descriptors such as the Centre of Circulation (CoC), shoulder angle, toe angle, the free surface and also kinematic information such as the velocity profile along a carefully chosen radial line from the centre of the mill that passes through the CoC were obtained. The time averaged velocity data was used when assessing the influence of the lifter face angle on the velocity profile.

40|$|Ball mills, i. e. {{rotating}} cylindrical drums {{filled with}} a feed material and metal balls, {{also known as the}} charge, are a major category of grinding devices in mineral processing and cement production. Since the grinding process is excessively energy-intensive and aggressive in terms of wear, a profiled and wear-resistant liner is installed in the mill to transfer energy to the grinding charge more efficiently and to protect the <b>mill</b> <b>shell.</b> Because of the harsh environment inside of the mill and the relatively long lifespan of its liner, the optimization of the liner by the classical way, i. e. experimental testing, is a difficult and slow process. In this thesis, a procedure for predicting the charge motion and the power draw of a ball mill based on the discrete element method (DEM) is calibrated and validated by means of photographs of the charge, and power draw measurements of a 1 : 5 -scale laboratory mill, which were kindly provided by the company Magotteaux International S. A.. This computational method essentially renders future experimental testing unnecessary with respect to these characteristics. Based on this first method, a generic process for predicting the wear distribution and the progressive shape evolution of liner surfaces is developed and validated by the wear profiles of the shell liner in the first chamber of a 5. 8 m diameter cement mill monitored during a decade by Magotteaux International S. A.. The energy dissipated by tangential damping defined by the linear spring-slider-damper DEM contact law was found to be the best fitting wear model with respect to the real wear data. The progressive update of the liner geometry by a multi-step procedure delivers relatively accurate results for liners without axial height variation while further investigations are still required for almost fully variable geometries.

40|$|Grinding {{slurries}} {{are known}} to be non-Newtonian. For such suspensions, slurry viscosity is not a constant, but is a function of shear rate. This study was aimed at the derivation of an estimate of a typical shear rate range inside a ball mill, in order to determine appropriate values of apparent viscosity for studies of the effects of rheology on grinding. Shear rates were estimated by considering the ball charge motion inside the mill. Two types of ball motion, cascading and cataracting, were taken into account. For the first type of motion, Morrell 2 ̆ 7 s power model approach [Morrell, S., 1996. Power draw of wet tumbling mills and its relationship to charge dynamics: Part 1. A continuum approach to mathematical modelling of mill power draw. Trans. I. M. M. 105, C 43 -C 53] was employed. This approach considers the mill charge to be comprised of layers or 2 ̆ 7 shells 2 ̆ 7 which slide against one another. The relative velocity between layers of the charge was calculated. Distance over which this change in velocity occurs was determined from the slurry volume filling the interstices of the charge and from the contact area between the slurry and ball surfaces. Shear rate defined as the velocity gradient between layers of the charge in the cascading motion was hence estimated to be 13 s as a lower limit of the shear rate range for a ball mill of 4. 57 m in diameter. For the second type of motion, the velocity of a free-flight ball striking the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> was resolved into two components, and a typical shear rate of 730 s was estimated from the tangential velocity of the ball for the same ball mill. It is therefore recommended that a shear rate in the range of 13 - 730 s be used to characterise the apparent viscosities of slurry in grinding applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} behaviour of malleable metals in tumbling mills. Much of the work focused on lead: shots, flattened shots and fragments were ground in three different laboratory mills. Testwork with fragments was repeated {{in the presence of a}} brittle and harder mineral phase (95 % silica, 5 % lead) and for copper (100 % copper). The transfer of particles across size classes and the loss of weight because of smearing on the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> and grinding media were measured. Microhardness tests confirmed that lead did not work-harden during grinding. The transfer across size classes was modelled with various first order differential equations describing flattening, folding, cold-welding and actual breakage. Model parameters were estimated using a least-square minimization criterion. When more than one model was fitted to a given data set, the one whose phenomenological basis was closest to the dominant transfer mechanisms observed almost always yielded the best data fit. The dominant mechanism was very dependent on the type of metal ground, its particle size and shape, the grinding intensity generated by the tumbling mill and the presence of a hard, brittle phase. Flattening, responsible for the transfer to coarser size classes, generally dominated over folding, the mechanism accountable for the transfer to finer size classes (other than breakage). Breakage was favoured over flattening and folding when grinding finer and softer particles,in a high impact environment, or in the presence of a hard, brittle mineral phase. Loss of weight due to smearing significantly increased when grinding a softer mineral in a mill with a rough inner shell, or when particle breakage took place. A methodology based on the Laboratory Knelson Concentrator was developed and tested to estimate the breakage function and gravity recoverability of gold flakes. Progeny from the breakage of gold particles was shown to be highly gravity recoverable, more than 90 % above 0. 025 mm.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{research}} {{focus of}} this thesis is lifter height effect on different charge characteristics. Thecharge characteristics identified were shoulder and toe angle, charge size and toe height. Anattempt was made to develop {{a model for the}} velocity profile incorporating lifter height. Therefore the objectives of the study are to: •Determine the effect of lifter height on the velocity profile using the particle tracking data. •Determine the effect the lifter height on the charge shoulder and toe. •Develop a velocity profile model including lifter height using granular flow theory and to compare the model to experimental data. The motivation for the study is that lifters {{are one of the most}} important design variables in a mill. Without lifters the mill’s energy efficiency would decrease. In Meaders & MacPherson, (1964) the effect of lifters on energy was quantified to be between 20 % and 30 %. The lifters control the height and angle of departure from the charge at the <b>mill</b> <b>shell</b> and therefore control the impact area and magnitude. The area and magnitude of the charge impact will affect the grind of the mill and energy utilization in the mill. The thesis was also aimed at generating data that can be used to model the velocity profile that can be incorporated in power models. Most of the power models do not account for the effect of lifters. The experiments involved collecting data from three dimensional particle tracking of selected particles in the charge. using the PEPT system. The PEPT experiments were conducted at IThemba Labs in Cape Town South Africa using a 300 mm x 285 mm experimental mill.

50|$|The ballmill allows {{grinding}} of {{the harder}} limestones {{that are more}} common than chalk. A ballmill consists of a horizontal cylinder that rotates on its axis. It holds spherical, cylindrical or rod-like grinding media of size 15-100 mm that may be steel or a variety of ceramic materials, and occupy 20-30% of the <b>mill</b> volume. The <b>shell</b> of the <b>mill</b> is lined with steel or rubber plates. Grinding is effected by impact and attrition between the grinding media. The various mineral components of the rawmix are fed to the mill at a constant rate along with water, and the slurry runs from the outlet end. The washdrum has a similar concept, but contains little or no grinding media, grinding being autogenous, by the cascading action of the larger raw material pieces. It is suitable for soft materials, and particularly for flinty chalk, where the unground flint acts as grinding media.|$|R
5000|$|Whelan {{was one of}} the 14 Volunteers of Unit “D” Company, who {{occupied}} Boland's Mill {{at around}} noon on Easter Monday. “Tuesday evening at around 6 o’c we first received attention from the enemy. Two 18-pounder 3 inch shells ripped through the wall of the top loft where the most of my men were stationed, scattering lumps of metal and jagged stones around .... The shells had burst several sacks of flour and bran and the loft was smothered in a fog of flour for quite ten minutes”. Lieutenant Joseph O'Byrne, Acting Captain of the Unit In the first artillery fire of the week, Boland's <b>Mill</b> had been <b>shelled</b> by the gunboat “Helga” (now known as the Irish patrol vessel Muirchú) from the river Liffey. The [...] "Helga", which had sailed from Dún Laoghaire earlier, would go on to bombard Liberty Hall the following day. As only the top loft of the mill {{happened to be in the}} gunboat’s field of fire, Capt. O’Byrne moved his men down to the third floor for safety and because the vantage was just as good from there.|$|R
