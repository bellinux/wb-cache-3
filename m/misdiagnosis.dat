5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. <b>Misdiagnosis</b> has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with <b>misdiagnosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, ingestion of ferric chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity and mortality. Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or <b>misdiagnosis.</b> Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common <b>misdiagnosis.</b> Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Misdiagnosis</b> is {{frequent}} (occurring {{in about}} 5 to 30% of cases). Different {{studies showed that}} in many cases seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause. Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and of those who have PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} first 50 {{games of the}} 2009–10 OHL season, Hodgson {{returned}} to the Battalion line-up on February 4, 2010, recording two assists in a 4–2 win against the Erie Otters. Following his return, he declared {{he would no longer}} be training in the off-season with Canucks Director of Player Development Dave Gagner, under whose supervision he suffered his back injury. Combined with the Canucks doctors' initial <b>misdiagnosis</b> and Vigneault's disparaging comments regarding Hodgson following the NHL pre-season, there was speculation in the media of a possible conflict between Hodgson and the Canucks organization. General Manager Mike Gillis, however, dismissed such speculation.|$|E
5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a <b>misdiagnosis</b> is less dangerous than not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of narcosis {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems causing disorientation or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances; or hypothermia causing rapid breathing and shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis. Alleviation of the effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects. In the rare event of <b>misdiagnosis</b> when another condition is causing the symptoms, the initial management– ascending closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} is diagnosed {{based on a}} complete history of the individual. Costly and invasive studies such as gastroduodenal manometry and esophageal Ph testing are unnecessary and will often aid in <b>misdiagnosis.</b> Based on typical observed features, several criteria have been suggested for diagnosing rumination syndrome. The primary symptom, the regurgitation of recently ingested food, must be consistent, occurring for at least sixweeks of the past twelve months. The regurgitation must begin within 30minutes of {{the completion of a}} meal. Patients may either chew the regurgitated matter or expel it. The symptoms must stop within 90minutes, or when the regurgitated matter becomes acidic. The symptoms must not be the result of a mechanical obstruction, and should not respond to the standard treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a <b>misdiagnosis</b> such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misdiagnosis</b> is {{the leading}} cause of medical error in {{outpatient}} facilities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Misdiagnosis</b> does {{sometimes}} occur. In {{a highly}} influential {{study from the}} 1960s, Eliot Slater demonstrated that misdiagnoses had occurred in one third of his 112 patients with conversion disorder. Later authors {{have argued that the}} paper was flawed, however, and a meta-analysis has shown that <b>misdiagnosis</b> rates since that paper was published are around 4%, the same as for other neurological diseases.|$|E
25|$|The <b>misdiagnosis</b> of {{schizophrenia}} {{is also a}} common problem. There may be long delays of patients getting a correct diagnosis of this disorder.|$|E
25|$|SPS is {{diagnosed}} by evaluating clinical findings and excluding other conditions. There is no specific laboratory test that confirms its presence. Underdiagnosis and <b>misdiagnosis</b> are common.|$|E
25|$|A common <b>misdiagnosis</b> is of {{a normal}} intrauterine {{pregnancy}} is where the pregnancy is implanted laterally in an arcuate uterus, potentially being misdiagnosed as an interstitial pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note, however, that while SMA syndrome can mimic an eating disorder, distinguishing the two conditions is extremely important, as <b>misdiagnosis</b> in this situation can be dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of ADHD {{by way of}} {{methylphenidate}} has led {{to legal}} actions, including malpractice suits regarding informed consent, inadequate information on side effects, <b>misdiagnosis,</b> and coercive use of medications by school systems.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of eczema {{is based}} {{mostly on the}} history and {{physical}} examination. In uncertain cases, skin biopsy may be useful. Those with eczema may be especially prone to <b>misdiagnosis</b> of food allergies.|$|E
25|$|Skin prick {{tests and}} blood tests are equally cost-effective, and health {{economic}} {{evidence shows that}} both tests were cost-effective compared with no test. Also, early and more accurate diagnoses save cost due to reduced consultations, referrals to secondary care, <b>misdiagnosis,</b> and emergency admissions.|$|E
25|$|Since Usher {{syndrome}} is incurable at present, {{it is helpful}} to diagnose children well before they develop the characteristic night blindness. Some preliminary studies have suggested as many as 10% of congenitally deaf children may have Usher syndrome. However, a <b>misdiagnosis</b> can have bad consequences.|$|E
25|$|Psychosis {{is first}} and {{foremost}} a diagnosis of exclusion. So a new-onset episode of psychosis cannot be considered a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded, or ruled out. Many clinicians improperly perform, or entirely miss this step, introducing avoidable diagnostic error and <b>misdiagnosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{three months}} and almost desperate, Gilman decided to {{contravene}} her diagnosis and started to work again. After realizing how close {{she had come to}} complete mental breakdown, she wrote The Yellow Wallpaper with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her own <b>misdiagnosis</b> complaint. She sent a copy to Mitchell but never received a response.|$|E
25|$|Assumption that a {{reported}} injury {{was caused by}} a spider is the most common source of false reports, which in some cases have led to <b>misdiagnosis</b> and mistreatment, with potentially life-threatening consequences. Many spider bites are relatively painless but the spider is often trapped and easily found. With neurotoxic envenomation, serious symptoms arise within a few hours.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of ectopic pregnancy include increased hCG, vaginal bleeding (in varying amounts), sudden lower abdominal pain, pelvic pain, a tender cervix, an adnexal mass, or adnexal tenderness. In the absence of ultrasound or hCG assessment, heavy vaginal bleeding {{may lead to a}} <b>misdiagnosis</b> of miscarriage. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are more rare symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Forbes was {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis in 1975, while working on The Slipper and the Rose; he remained in remission which he attributed to cutting out gluten and taking vitamins and oil of primrose, together with Newman's care. However, he revealed in a 2012 interview {{that it had been}} a <b>misdiagnosis.</b> He continued his acting, directing and screenwriting career into the early 1990s, and was still publishing novels in the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|Correct {{diagnosis}} {{is important for}} mental health disorders, otherwise the condition could worsen, resulting in {{a negative impact on}} both the patient and the healthcare system. Another problem with <b>misdiagnosis</b> is that a treatment for one condition might exacerbate other conditions. In other cases apparent mental health disorders could be a side effect of a serious biological problem such as concussion, brain tumor, or hormonal abnormality, which could require medical or surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} in Europe of the single-embryo transfer policy, which aims at {{the reduction of}} the incidence of multiple pregnancies after ART, usually one embryo or early blastocyst is replaced in the uterus. Serum hCG is determined at day 12. If a pregnancy is established, an ultrasound examination at 7 weeks is performed to confirm the presence of a fetal heartbeat. Couples are generally advised to undergo PND because of the, albeit low, risk of <b>misdiagnosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The United States Preventive Services Task Force {{does not}} {{recommend}} electrocardiography for routine screening procedure in patients without symptoms and those at low risk for coronary heart disease. This is because an ECG may falsely indicate {{the existence of}} a problem, leading to <b>misdiagnosis,</b> the recommendation of invasive procedures, or overtreatment. However, persons employed in certain critical occupations, such as aircraft pilots, may be required to have an ECG as part of their routine health evaluations.|$|E
25|$|The {{discharge}} coats {{the walls}} of the vagina, and is usually without significant irritation, pain, or erythema (redness), although mild itching can sometimes occur. By contrast, the normal vaginal discharge will vary in consistency and amount throughout the menstrual cycle and is at its clearest at ovulation—about two weeks before the period starts. Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women, though others argue that this is often a <b>misdiagnosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis and <b>misdiagnosis</b> in PGD using PCR {{have been}} mathematically {{modelled}} {{in the work}} of Navidi and Arnheim and of Lewis and collaborators. The most important conclusion of these publications is that for the efficient and accurate diagnosis of an embryo, two genotypes are required. This can be based on a linked marker and disease genotypes from a single cell or on marker/disease genotypes of two cells. An interesting aspect explored in these papers is the detailed study of all possible combinations of alleles that may appear in the PCR results for a particular embryo. The authors indicate that some of the genotypes that can be obtained during diagnosis may not be concordant with the expected pattern of linked marker genotypes, but are still providing sufficient confidence about the unaffected genotype of the embryo. Although these models are reassuring, they are based on a theoretical model, and generally the diagnosis is established on a more conservative basis, aiming to avoid the possibility of <b>misdiagnosis.</b> When unexpected alleles appear during the analysis of a cell, depending on the genotype observed, it is considered that either an abnormal cell has been analysed or that contamination has occurred, and that no diagnosis can be established. A case in which the abnormality of the analysed cell can be clearly identified is when, using a multiplex PCR for linked markers, only the alleles of one of the parents are found in the sample. In this case, the cell can be considered as carrying a monosomy for the chromosome on which the markers are located, or, possibly, as haploid. The appearance of a single allele that indicates an affected genotype is considered sufficient to diagnose the embryo as affected, and embryos that have been diagnosed with a complete unaffected genotype are preferred for replacement. Although this policy may lead to a lower number of unaffected embryos suitable for transfer, it is considered preferable to the possibility of a <b>misdiagnosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ritter {{rules are}} a {{compilation}} of reminders, symptoms, and risk factors designed to prevent the <b>misdiagnosis</b> of thoracic aortic dissection. The rules were named for actor John Ritter, who died from a thoracic aortic dissection on September 11, 2003. Ritter was initially misdiagnosed and subsequently treated for a heart attack. The Ritter rules were developed by Dianna Milewicz, of the University of Texas Medical School, Houston, and were jointly published in March 2010 by John Ritter Foundation and the Thoracic Aortic Disease Coalition.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{conditions}} are far more common {{and more likely to}} be the source of necrotic wounds, even in areas where brown recluse spiders actually occur. The most important of these is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacterium whose necrotic lesions are very similar to those induced by recluse bites, and which can be lethal if left untreated. <b>Misdiagnosis</b> of MRSA as spider bites is extremely common (nearly 30% of patients with MRSA reported that they initially suspected a spider bite), and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
25|$|Errors {{can include}} <b>misdiagnosis</b> or delayed diagnosis, {{administration}} of the wrong drug to the wrong patient or in the wrong way, giving multiple drugs that interact negatively, surgery on an incorrect site, failure to remove all surgical instruments, failure to take the correct blood type into account, or incorrect record-keeping. A 10th type of error is ones which are not watched for by researchers, such as RNs failing to program an IV pump to give a full dose of IV antibiotics or other medication.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{typically}} suspected {{based on a}} women's symptoms. Diagnosis is made with microscopy (mostly by vaginal wet mount) {{and culture of the}} discharge after a careful history and physical examination have been completed. The color, consistency, acidity, and other characteristics of the discharge may be predictive of the causative agent. Determining the agent is especially important because women may have more than one infection, or have symptoms that overlap those of another infection, which dictates different treatment processes to cure the infection. For example, women often self-diagnose for yeast infections but due to the 89% <b>misdiagnosis</b> rate, self-diagnoses of vaginal infections are highly discouraged.|$|E
25|$|SPS is {{estimated}} to have a prevalence of about one per million. Underdiagnosis and <b>misdiagnosis</b> hinder epidemiological information about the condition and {{may have led to}} its prevalence being underestimated. In the United Kingdom, 119 cases were identified between 2000 and 2005. It does not predominantly occur in any racial or ethnic group. The age of onset varies from about 30 to 60, and it most frequently occurs in people in their 40s. Five to ten percent of patients with SPS have the paraneoplastic variant of the condition. In one group of 127 patients, only 11 of them had paraneoplatic symptoms. About 35 percent of SPS patients have type I diabetes.|$|E
25|$|In Trauma and Recovery, Herman {{expresses the}} {{additional}} concern that patients {{who suffer from}} C-PTSD frequently risk being misunderstood as inherently 'dependent', 'masochistic', or 'self-defeating', comparing this attitude to the historical <b>misdiagnosis</b> of female hysteria. However, those who develop C-PTSD do so {{as a result of the}} intensity of the trauma bond – in which someone becomes tightly biolo-chemically bound to someone who abuses them (also known as Stockholm Syndrome – seen in cases of kidnapping in which a person falls in love with their captors) and the responses they learned to survive, navigate and deal with the abuse they suffered then become automatic responses, imbedded in their personality over the years of trauma – a normal reaction to an abnormal situation.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination {{is more likely to}} result in problems like <b>misdiagnosis,</b> overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in a benefit to the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.|$|E
