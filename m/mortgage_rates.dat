40|$|This paper gives {{a general}} {{mortgage}} model subject to sub-optimal prepayment behavior of borrowers. The proposed classification of {{approaches to the}} option-based and mortgage-rate-based (MRB) specification is validated {{by the fact that}} these two approaches require different analytical and numerical tools. With the option-based specification of the prepayment intensity, our model is the first continuous-time model; this gives advantage in the numerical treatment of the model. We propose a new approach based on the MRB idea with the endogenous <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> process. The <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> process is defined and the existence of a solution is proven for the option-based specification of the prepayment process. A numerical procedure for finding the endogenous <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> is proposed. <b>Mortgage,</b> option-based approach, prepayment, intensity, <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} effect of the Swedish repo <b>rate</b> on the <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> has changed during the period between the years of 2005 - 2017. The relation between the repo <b>rate</b> and <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> is examined during three time intervals using regressions and correlation analysis. Furthermore, {{the effect of}} the repo rate is investigated in times of negative and positive interest rate levels. The results show that {{the effect of the}} repo <b>rate</b> on the <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> has decreased significantly with time. It is also shown that the repo rate tends to affect the <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> less in times of negative interest rates. The reduced effect of the repo rate has then been analysed using the Transmission Mechanism of Monetary Policy to deduct probable factors causing the change. The factors mentioned consist of changes in risk behaviour and mortgage financing...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{mortgage}} prepayment models require a specification of the <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> process. Usually some ad-hoc models are used (e. g., a Treasury yield plus some constant). Recently, {{a number of}} papers appeared where authors utilized a <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> implied by the cur-rent yield curve (so called endogenous <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate).</b> However, the existing computational algorithms suffer from the curse of dimension-ality and, consequently, are problematic to use for full scale problems. A computational algorithm, proposed in this paper, does not require iterations. Moreover, the algorithm is tractable in the sense that its complexity is equivalent to the problem of mortgage valuation. The numerical example is based on a PDE computation. An implementa-tion of a Monte Carlo method is also discussed. ...|$|R

2500|$|Instead of {{deploying}} their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, around 1980 building societies began setting <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> {{with reference}} to market clearing levels. In sum they began behaving more like banks, seeking to maximise profit instead {{of the advantages of}} a mutual organisation. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), [...] "... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance mortgage lending between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a return on assets for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves". As Boxall and Gallagher (1997) also observe; [...] "... accumulation of reserves in the early-1990s, beyond regulatory and future growth requirements, is difficult to reconcile with conventional theories of mutual behaviour".|$|E
30|$|In {{light of}} the strong {{increase}} of house prices in Switzerland in the 2000 s and early 2010 s, we analyze the effects of <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> shocks, changes in housing demand & supply and business cycle conditions on house prices for the time period 1982 – 2013. We study intertemporal effects by employing Bayesian timevarying coefficients vector autoregressions (TVC-BVAR), regional effects by using regional BVARs and heterogeneity in housing markets by looking at housing segments. 50 % of house price variations {{can be explained by}} housing demand & supply. The response of house prices to <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> shocks weakened after the 1990 s real estate crisis and remained constant thereafter. However, owneroccupied apartment prices became again more sensitive to <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> shocks during the recent house price boom.

2500|$|In January 2011, JPMorgan Chase {{admitted}} that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for their mortgages, including active duty personnel in Afghanistan. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed {{on more than}} a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act which automatically lowers <b>mortgage</b> <b>rates</b> to 6 percent, and bars foreclosure proceedings of active duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Captain Jonathan Rowles. Both Captain Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was [...] "grim", and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back. Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27million in compensation to settle the class-action suit. At the company's 2011 shareholders' meeting, Dimon apologized for the error and said the bank would forgive the loans of any active-duty personnel whose property had been foreclosed.

Next, we show a number of techniques to significantly reduce the high computational price of MOATS (which is very high even for one stochastic factor).

40|$|Following the {{implications}} of term structure theory in an efficient bond market, this study formulates a random walk model that produces unbiased and efficient forecasts of the 30 -year <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> for 1987 - 2006.

In exploring the view that the 30 -year <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> often moves in tandem with the 10 -year Treasury rate, we further find that these rates are cointegrated and thus converge to an equilibrium relation in the long-run.

Further analysis using asymmetric error correction models shows (i) the Federal Funds rate to be weakly exogenous with respect to the <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate,</b> (ii) short-run mutual dependence to exist between the series in the form of bidirectional Granger causality, and (iii) the <b>mortgage</b> <b>rate</b> to exhibit asymmetrical behaviour with differing speeds of adjustment detected in response to changes in the interest rate differential.
