40|$|Purpose: Genes of the HoxD cluster play a {{major role}} in {{vertebrate}} limb development, and changes that modify the Hoxd 12 locus affect other genes also, suggesting that HoxD function is coordinated by a control mechanism involving multiple genes during limb morphogenesis. In this study, mutant phenotypes were produced by treatment of mice with a chemical mutagen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). We analyzed mutant mice exhibiting the specific <b>microdactyly</b> phenotype and examined the genes affected. Materials and Methods: We focused on phenotype characteristics including size, bone formation, and digit morphology of ENU-induced <b>microdactyly</b> mice. The expressions of several molecules were analyzed by genome-wide screening and quantitative real-time PCR to define the affected genes. Results: We report on limb phenotypes of an ENU-induced A-to-C mutation in the Hoxd 12 gene, resulting in alanine-to-serine conversion. <b>Microdactyly</b> mice exhibited growth defects in the zeugopod and autopod, shortening of digits, a missing tip of digit I, limb growth affected, and dramatic increases in the expressions of Fgf 4 and Lmx 1 b. However, the expression level of Shh was not changed in Hoxd 12 point mutated mice. Conclusion: These results suggest that point mutation rather than the entire deletion of Hoxd 12, such as in knockout and transgenic mice, causes the abnormal limb phenotype in <b>microdactyly</b> mice. The precise nature of the spectrum of differences requires further investigation...|$|E
