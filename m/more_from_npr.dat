50|$|Bob Edwards, {{previously}} a {{co-host of}} All Things Considered, hosted Morning Edition beginning with its first episode, {{a job he}} initially took on a temporary basis when a shake-up in production and on-air staff occurred ten days before the show's premiere.

His last day as host was April 30, 2004; this was not due to Edwards retiring, but rather a highly controversial decision <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> to reassign him as senior correspondent, which resulted in anger and harsh criticism from many listeners. From May 3, 2004 through November 11, 2016 the show was co-hosted by Steve Inskeep and Renée Montagne, with David Greene joining as co-host in 2012.
