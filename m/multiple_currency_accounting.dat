40|$|For this century, {{financial}} accounting "technology" has meant double-entry accounting. Computers, once {{assumed to be}} infallible, insufficiently automated double-entry with only single-entry records. Transaction logs, audit trails, and other features since have augmented these bookkeeping verification gaps by enabling error discovery and recovery. VisiCalc, later Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 and Excel, brought dynamic spreadsheets into widespread use for modeling "what if" thereby bridging the gap between time-fixed ledgers with new flexibility for handling the imaginable. However, even as multinational finance systems, enterprise resource planning, and accounting processes infiltrated every organization, {{financial accounting}} technology has not advanced in tandem with business complexities. Consider whether {{you are able to}} bridge the gap for <b>multiple</b> <b>currency</b> <b>accounting.</b> converge the accounting of interest bearing assets, or integration from start to finish initial strategic business planning to forensic analysis. If you are, the process is likely to be complex and cumbersome, while disconnected as supplemental steps to core financial operations...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to review the {{corporate}} financing strategies employed by Zimbabwean listed firms since the adoption of the <b>multiple</b> <b>currency</b> system which set the country on a recovery path after the decade-long political, social and economic crises. The adoption of the <b>multiple</b> <b>currency</b> system necessitated recapitalization and retooling because most firms’ balance sheets were wiped away during the hyperinflation era. The study is based on secondary data of 80 firms listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. The study found that rights issues and high retention ratios were the main strategies used by firms to recapitalize their operations. The recapitalization efforts have been by liquidity challenges that have characterised the <b>multiple</b> <b>currency</b> era...|$|R

40|$|Evolutionary studies often {{assume that}} energy {{is the primary}} {{resource}} (i. e.

The evolutionary consequences of having a single trade-off <b>currency</b> versus <b>multiple</b> competing <b>currencies</b> are unknown. Using simulations, we modeled the evolution of either a single physiological currency between reproduction and survival, or of <b>multiple</b> such <b>currencies.</b> For a wide array of model specifications varying functional forms and strengths of the trade-offs, we show that the presence of <b>multiple</b> <b>currencies</b> (e. g. nutrients, time) generally results in the evolution of higher lifetime reproductive success through partial circumvention of such trade-offs. Evolution of the underlying physiology is also more highly contingent with <b>multiple</b> <b>currencies.</b> These results challenge the paradigm of a single survival-reproduction trade-off as central to life history evolution, suggesting greater roles for physiological constraints and contingency, and implying potential selection for evolution of <b>multiple</b> trade-off <b>currencies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Publisher's version {{available}} from [URL] paper attempts {{to determine the}} impact of dividend policy on stock price risk in Zimbabwe. A sample of 60 listed companies in Zimbabwe Stock Exchange is examined for a period from 2001 to 2011. The empirical estimation {{is based on a}} crosssectional regression analysis of the relationship between stock price volatility and dividend policy after controlling for firm size, earning volatility, leverage and asset growth. Both dividend policy measures (dividend yield and payout ratio) have significant impact on the share price volatility. The relationship is not reduced much even after controlling for the above mentioned factors. This suggests that dividend policy affects stock price volatility and it provides evidence supporting the arbitrage realization effect, duration effect and information effect in Zimbabwe. The responsiveness of the dividend yield to stock price volatility increased during <b>Multiple</b> <b>Currency</b> Regime (2009 - 2011). In overall period the size and leverage have positive and significant impact on stock price volatility. The size effect is negative during pre <b>Multiple</b> <b>Currency</b> period (2001 - 2008) but positive during <b>Multiple</b> <b>Currency</b> period. The earning volatility impact is negative and significant only during the <b>Multiple</b> <b>Currency</b> period.
