The tools used for the design and simulation of multi-antenna structures involving these artificial materials will be commented. A multi-antenna system design based onm etamaterial separators will be designed {{in order to reduce the}} size of the multi-antenna structure keeping the isolation level between antenna elements. Firstly, a unit cell to be used in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen</b> will be analysed and designed. Next, a monopole will be tuned at an operating frequency of 2. 45 GHz. Secondly, two multi-antenna systems will be designed, a first having two monopoles and another one with four monopoles.

40|$|The Superconducting Fault Current Limiter is {{a device}} placed in {{electric}} network {{to limit the}} peak current {{in the event of}} fault. In inductive SFCL the high temperature superconducting tubes are used as secondary winding. Primary winding is conventionally made of copper wire. The magnetic field distribution analysis is significant to elaborate proper operation of the limiter. The FEM is irrevocable at designing stage to calculate the electrical parameters of the SFCL in resistive and superconducting state. During the normal operation the resistance of superconducting winding is equal zero, and the magnetic flux does not penetrate the iron core because the superconducting tube acts as <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen.</b> The impedance of SFCL is nearly zero. When the fault occurs the increasing current exceed the critical value of the HTS element then resistance of secondary winding is reflected into the circuit, and the magnetic flux penetrates the iron core increasing the impedance of limiter. The voltage on the limiter depends mainly on the structure of the limiter, its geometrical dimensions, number of primary winding turns, distance between the windings and size of the core. The influence of many different parameters on the SFCL operation makes the analytical calculation very complicated and inaccurate.

An uninterrupted superconducting path {{is achieved by}} splitting two sections of a slit 2 G tape {{in order to obtain}} a loop without joint. Several loops are stacked together to obtain a coil acting as a <b>magnetic</b> <b>screen.</b> Persistent currents in this coil are shown to shield efficiently magnetic fields that are applied at very low sweep rates (500 @T/s). The shielding properties are characterized by measuring the shielding factor of the screen, i. e. the ratio between the magnetic field with and without screen. In a coil made of a single layer of coated conductors, the shielding factor {{at the center of the}} coil is shown to exceed 10 for an applied DC magnetic flux density of 5 mT. The uniformity of the shielding factor along the axis of the screen is also investigated; results show the magnetic field is attenuated by a factor larger than 3 near the open ends. Both the maximum field amplitude that can be shielded and the shielding factor of the coil can be enhanced by increasing the number of concentric coils.

In the kaon condensed phase there is an electrically charged fermion which becomes gapless near μ_s^(1) ≃ 1. 35 Δ and a neutral fermion which becomes gapless near μ_s^(2) ≃ 1. 61 Δ. Here, μ_s=m_s^ 2 /(2 p_F) is the shift in the Fermi energy due to the strange quark mass m_s and Δ is the gap in the chiral limit. The transition to the gapless phase is continuous at μ_s^(1) and first order at μ_s^(2). We find that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>screening</b> masses are real in the regime μ_s μ_s^(2).
