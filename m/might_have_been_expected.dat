5|$|God by {{a sudden}} {{conversion}} subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> from one at my early period of life. Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness, I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make progress therein, that although I did not altogether leave off other studies, yet I pursued them with less ardour.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{maintained}} that the evidence against Desha was largely circumstantial. They said that Desha's personal items {{could easily have been}} planted where they were found. They pointed out that, despite the stab wounds on Baker's body, no blood was found on the ground near the road or on the path along which the murderer had dragged the body to conceal it. Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
60|$|Almost any {{one would}} be alarmed at such a visitor, even though he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expecting</b> this attention, and Ralph came very near {{trembling}} with fear as he realized how narrow <b>had</b> <b>been</b> his escape from death.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Kiest remarked, [...] "A {{perfectly}} credible, fairly forgettable, country debut about chasing dreams...Fans of {{her show}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expecting</b> McCurdy to <b>be</b> a mean-girl counterpart to Taylor Swift; keep hoping, kids, but it hasn't happened yet." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "'It's Working' was {{the first}} track demoed for the album and it {{immediately}} marks its patch a bold distance from Oracular Spectacular. In place of the grumbling synthesizers and neon electronica you <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expecting,</b> the track builds its house on harpsichords, flutes and Zombies-esque guitars. What's more, the hook—and there most definitely is one—takes a good 12 bars to reveal itself.|$|R
25|$|Addyman {{considers}} that road vehicle toll income {{was less than}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> (£2,000 in 1853), and attributes this {{to the success of}} suburban passenger railway business.|$|E
25|$|Haultain <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to be {{appointed}} as the first Premier of Alberta. However, Haultain was Conservative while Laurier was Liberal. Laurier opted to have Lieutenant Governor George H. V. Bulyea appoint the Liberal Alexander Rutherford, whose government would later fall in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, {{production}} {{ended in}} France after 40 years but continued at the Mangualde plant in Portugal. This lasted until 1990, when {{production of the}} 2CV ended. The 2CV outlasted the Visa, another of the cars which <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to replace it, and was produced for {{four years after the}} start of Citroën AX production.|$|E
5000|$|Kristen Elizabeth of TV Equals {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "I just didn’t feel the spark in this episode. It {{felt more like}} the writers were dialing it in. Even Donna felt a little off, and she’s usually my favorite character. I think I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expecting</b> too much, but {{considering the fact that}} The Cleveland Show took a few weeks off, there was ample time to turn in a better polished episode than this".|$|R
6000|$|... “From {{the moment}} the Spanish vessel {{exhausted}} her first burst of speed, the result was never in doubt. She fell, in fact, far below what <b>might</b> reasonably <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> of her.|$|R
60|$|Amy Willoughby married Walter Larramie. That was a {{thing which}} <b>might</b> well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> I <b>was</b> very glad to hear it, for I shall never fail to be {{interested}} in the Larramies.|$|R
25|$|The type {{is poorly}} {{documented}} - in particular no reliable details {{are available for}} its performance: the published figures are essentially those of the Nieuport 11, whereas such a close copy of the 17, with a powerplant of similar output, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to have a performance roughly equivalent {{to that of the}} original from which it was derived.|$|E
25|$|For his {{achievements}} in Hispania, the senate decreed a thanksgiving ceremony of three days. In {{the course of}} the year 194 BC, he returned to Rome and was rewarded with the honor of a Roman triumph, at which he exhibited an extraordinary quantity of captured brass, silver, and gold, both coin and ingots. Cato distributed the monetary prize to his soldiery, and was more liberal than <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> from his vigorous parsimony.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately {{the removal}} of the child suited the plans of the comte de Provence, now Louis XVIII, along with those of the revolutionary government. The royal family made no serious attempt to {{ascertain}} the truth, though they paid no tributes to the memory of the deceased king as <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected,</b> had they been convinced of his death. Even his sister wore no mourning for him until she arrived at Vienna and saw that this was expected of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't {{this rather}} sudden?" [...] asked the minister, with less {{excitement}} {{than the fact}} <b>might</b> perhaps <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to create in a friend. [...] "I thought you intended to pass the winter in Florence." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{opening it}} to let Little Dorrit out, she found Mr Pancks, {{instead of having}} gone his way, as in any less {{wonderful}} place and among less wonderful phenomena he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reasonably <b>expected</b> to do, fluttering {{up and down the}} court outside the house.|$|R
50|$|The French began {{negotiations}} in Paris in late 1762. Because {{of a change}} in the British government, they were offered more lenient terms than <b>might</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> While they lost Canada to the British, Martinique and Guadeloupe were returned to them in exchange for Minorca.|$|R
25|$|This {{addition}} to the company's facilities <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to substantially increase profits. Unfortunately, in the same year, many of New York's shipbuilding and repair yards were hit {{by a series of}} labor strikes led by the International Association of Machinists, and the Morse Works {{was one of the worst}} affected. In early October 1903, the Morse Iron Works and Dry Dock Company announced that it was filing for bankruptcy, and the company's activities temporarily came to a halt.|$|E
25|$|Team Rosberg {{promptly}} {{took the}} opportunity to participate in the DTM again when it was recreated {{at the turn of the}} millennium. While it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to renew its association with Opel, it instead partnered with Mercedes-AMG. It was one of four teams running CLK coupes, with Darren Turner and Pedro Lamy on driving duty. It was a respectable season, in which Rosberg was classified 7th in the teams' standings, while Lamy and Turner were classified 13th and 14th overall.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} series, a mystery man arrives asking for Janey – Susan finally discovers the {{identity}} of Kenzo's father. Roger and Abi's marriage announcement gives Susan the idea to renew her marriage vows despite protests from Ben. A death in the dentist's chair is not very good for business, but Ben discovers it's not good for his private life either. Michael succeeds in placing the whole family on The Weakest Link, but Anne Robinson raises more difficult questions than <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{enquiries}} {{were confused}} by inadequate or conflicting testimony. Although the clerk at Wellow, Arthur Hillard, <b>might</b> normally <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to <b>be</b> blamed, {{it was obviously}} unjust to place the entire responsibility on a fifteen-year-old youth who was doing the job of several senior staff, {{in an environment of}} such corporate misconduct.|$|R
60|$|In the {{following}} rude strains, our forefathers commemorated {{one of the}} last, and most gallant atchievements, performed upon the border. The reader will find, in the subjoined extract from Spottiswoode, a minute historical account of the exploit; which is less different from that contained in the ballad than <b>might</b> perhaps <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coach Kline {{finished}} the abbreviated season 2-3-1 (.417), {{but under the}} difficult circumstances of the time this was as good an outcome as <b>might</b> <b>have</b> otherwise <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> With {{the end of the}} war, a return to normalcy for 1919 was anticipated. The program's overall record slipped with the losses to 166-54-12 (.741).|$|R
25|$|However, from 1907 onwards Mead, at {{this stage}} an opening batsman, {{advanced}} very rapidly, with his average reaching 39 in the very wet summer of 1909. In 1911, he moved down the order to his familiar position of number four, and so successful was this move {{that he was the}} leading run-scorer in 1911 and 1913, and toured Australia in 1911/1912 and South Africa in 1913/1914. He was not nearly so successful as <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> in Australia, but in South Africa he hit a Test century and played particularly well throughout. In 1912 he had been unbeaten (160* and 33*) in Hampshire's historic win over the Australians at Southampton.|$|E
25|$|The final {{study of}} Parade, {{executed}} {{prior to the}} oil on canvas, is divided horizontally into fourths and vertically into sixths. The 4 : 6 ratio corresponds to {{the dimensions of the}} canvas, which is one and one-half times wider than its vertical dimension. An additional vertical axes was drawn by Seurat, which neither corresponds to the location of the figures, nor to the architectural construction of the work; neither do these axes correspond precisely to the golden section, 1 : 1.6, as <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected.</b> Rather, they correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section), as noted by Seurat with citations from Charles Henry.|$|E
25|$|The {{south and}} westwards range {{expansion}} of black sparrowhawks in South Africa has {{led them to}} colonise the urban and suburban areas of Cape Town where they have thrived in the past 15 years, {{with none of the}} expected negative impacts on their health that <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> from the disturbances associated with a novel climate (from a subtropical, summer rainfall regimen to a Mediterranean, winter rainfall region), or other possible sources of stress in their newly urbanised environments. This is probably due to the abundance of prey, mainly various species of Columbidae (the wide variety of pigeons and doves) in these urban areas, and, therefore, their lack of nutritional stress.|$|E
50|$|Any {{person whose}} rights <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{materially}} and {{adversely affected by}} administrative action and who <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> given reasons for the action may, within 90 days after the date on which that person {{became aware of the}} action or <b>might</b> reasonably <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to <b>have</b> become aware of the action, request that the administrator concerned furnish written reasons for the action.|$|R
6000|$|It {{appears that}} cold-blooded animals <b>are,</b> as <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> [...] <b>expected,</b> far more {{sensitive}} to an increase of temperature than is Drosera. Thus, as I hear from Dr. Burdon Sanderson, a frog begins to be distressed in water at a temperature of only 85o Fahr. At 95o the muscles become rigid, and the animal dies in a stiffened condition.

50|$|During {{the later}} 1980s the East German {{political}} establishment suffered {{a crisis of}} confidence as the winds of Glasnost blowing across from Moscow left old certainties looking less than certain, while intensifying industrial and commercial rivalry between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic made the future look less secure, highlighting the dire fiscal position of the savagely indebted East German economy. In university sociology departments there was little appetite for undermining the state {{by focusing on the}} increasingly stark dysfunctionalities of the socialist state, but nor was it possible to overlook objective facts. Someone in Bluhm's position <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expecting</b> to work towards a doctorate and pursue a university career as a sociology professor, but as academic career opportunities faded away Carola Bluhm switched to politics not necessarily by design, but in response both to her personal situation, as the mother of two very young children, and to national events.|$|R
25|$|After this {{promising}} start, Coen <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> to have {{a substantial}} Test career. Instead, in 1928–29 he lost form and made only 64 runs in six innings, which meant he was not picked for the 1929 South African tour to England. He did not play at all in 1929–30 and then in 1930–31 he started playing for Western Province; initially, he had little success, {{and he was not}} picked for the next South African Test tour, the 1931–32 tour to Australia and New Zealand. Ironically, while the tour was taking place, Coen had a second season in which he excelled with the bat, making 630 runs at an average of 63. Among his innings in this season was one of 173, his highest, against Transvaal.|$|E
25|$|Monash {{was born}} in Dudley Street, West Melbourne, Victoria, on 27 June 1865, the son of Louis Monash and his wife Bertha, née Manasse. He was born to Jewish parents, both from Krotoschin, in the Posen province, Kingdom of Prussia (now Krotoszyn in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland); the family name was {{originally}} spelt Monasch (pronounced {{with the emphasis on}} the second syllable). The family spoke German as their native language. As <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> from a man brought up by cultivated German parents who had arrived in Australia barely two years before John's birth, Monash spoke, read, and wrote German fluently. However, from 1914 until his death, Sir John Monash had no good reason to attract attention to his German background.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, Epirus {{was settled}} {{by the same}} nomadic Hellenic tribes that went on to settle the rest of Greece. Unlike most other Greeks of the time, who lived in or around city-states such as Athens or Sparta, the Epirotes lived in small villages and {{their way of life}} was foreign to that of polis of {{southern}} Greeks. Their region lay {{on the edge of the}} Greek world and was far from peaceful; for many centuries, it remained a frontier area contested with the Illyrian peoples of the Adriatic coast and interior. However, Epirus had a far greater religious significance than <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> given its geographical remoteness, due to the presence of the shrine and oracle at Dodona – regarded as second only to the more famous oracle at Delphi.|$|E
50|$|The stadium {{was filled}} with 28,000 Newcastle fans, while no more than a dozen Londoners had made the trip, with Palace {{themselves}} believing only two or three of their own supporters were in the crowd. It was a cold and wet January day, with a light breeze, and the Newcastle fans gave the Palace team a good reception, rather than the hostile one they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expecting.</b> When the game got under way Newcastle started off somewhat complacently. Their passes were going astray and they allowed Palace to impose themselves. Before long the Southern league side were in control. Dickie Roberts, playing on the wing for Palace, was too much for Newcastle's Scottish international defender Andy McCombie, and whilst his crosses were mostly coming to nothing, they were starting to unsettle the crowd. The opening twenty minutes were largely chance free, but then Roberts turned McCombie once again and had the ball in the net, only for the goal to be disallowed controversially as off-side.|$|R
40|$|Australia has {{experienced}} a economic growth since the 1991 recession and convergence in labour market outcomes across space <b>might</b> reasonably <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> given this 17 year span. The orthodox view of regional development suggests that “provided there are no major barriers to the operation of market forces, in an integrated national space economy there are strong pressures leading to the general convergence of regional incomes over time” (Martin and Sunley 1998 : 201) ...|$|R
5|$|This is a concise work, {{in terms}} of its duration, the economy of {{thematic}} material presented, and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate. The first movement is in 6/8 time and a monothematic sonata form. The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn's musical jokes. In this case he tinkers with the movement's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it. The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement's theme, which is in the dominant. This would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that, in this instance, is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the tonic. It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise, which is actually a coda. The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the listener <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expecting,</b> and it does so after two measures of pointed silence.|$|R
