40|$|International audienceABSTRACT Among the {{promising}} bulk chemicals, 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD) and 2, 3 -butanediol (2, 3 -BD) are two bio-based diols, {{which have a}} wide range of applications in cosmetic and food industry, as antifreezes, lubricants, fuel additives, {{as well as in the}} production of polymers. The possibility to obtain diols from the waste glycerol is topical by two reasons. First, the waste glycerol is received in large amounts during the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> from plant oils and is inexpensive and renewable source. On the other hand, the glycerol's liberation in the environment is connected with serious ecological problems. In this study is reported the isolation of three novel strains G 9, G 31 and G 46, capable to convert glycerol into high amounts of 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD) and 2, 3 -butanediol (2, 3 -BD). They were examined by classical microbial tests and by the genetical approach of 16 S rDNA sequencing. The strains' physiological and biochemical features indicated their most possible affiliation to the species Klebsiella pneumoniae: they were facultative anaerobes, oxydase-negative and catalase-positive, did not grow at 10 ºC, didn't generate H 2 S and were able to ferment the all typical for the species carbohydrates. The sequencing of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene confirmed the affiliation of G 9, G 31 and G 46 to Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. The sequence comparison with the GenBank data (NCBI) showed 99 % sequence identity of G 31 with the type strain K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 T. G 9 and G 46 were closely related (99 % 16 S rDNA identical nucleotides) to another ATCC species: MGH 78578 and to the known as excellent glycerol fermenting strain K. pneumoniae TUAC 01. The other Klebsiella strains, known as glycerol consuming - K. oxytoca strain 17 and K. planticola strain DR 3 were quite phylogenetically distant from ours and formed a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree...|$|E

It is believed by most of the people to be more environmentally friendly than the widely used fossil fuels. Green fuel has evolved as a possible fuelling option as the world drains out its possible energy resources. It has a big role to play in the future as far as the replacements to the already existing fossil fuels are concerned. We, as a group, aim at evaluating the performance and combustion characteristics of one of the biofuels, bio diesel. The performance <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> can be evaluated by an index called as cetane number. Cetane number is a measurement of combustion quality of diesel fuel during compression ignition.

Accordingly, many researches have been done to find alternative fuels that are clean and efficient.

Therefore, using waste cooking oil (WCO) for biodiesel would be more economical and sustainable solution.

PM emission of WCO B 100 and diesel fuel was compared and the effect of PM components such as soluble organic fraction (SOF) and soot were studied.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of heavy-duty haulage trucks to {{the concentrations of}} aerosols and criteria gases in underground mine air and the physical properties of those aerosols were assessed for three fuel blends made with fatty acid methyl esters biodiesel and petroleum-based ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD). The contributions of blends with 20, 50, and 57 % <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> as well as neat ULSD were assessed using a 30 -ton truck operated over a simulated production cycle in an isolated zone of an operating underground metal mine. When fueled with the B 20 (blend <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> with ULSD with 20 % <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> content), B 50 (blend <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> with ULSD with 50 % <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> content), and B 57 (blend <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> with ULSD with 57 % <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> content) blends in place of ULSD, the truck's contribution to mass concentrations of elemental and total carbon was reduced by 20, 50, and 61 %, respectively. Size distribution measurements showed that the aerosols produced by the engine fueled with these blends were characterized by smaller median electrical mobility diameter and lower peak concentrations than the aerosols produced by the same engine fueled with ULSD. The use of the blends resulted in number concentrations of aerosols that were 13 - 29 % lower than those when ULSD was used. Depending on the content <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> in the blends, the average reductions in the surface area concentrations of aerosol which could be deposited in the alveolar region of the lung (as measured by a nanoparticle surface area monitor) ranged between 6 and 37 %. The use of blends also resulted in slight but measurable reductions in CO emissions, {{as well as an}} increase in NOX emissions. All of the above changes in concentrations and physical properties were found to be correlated with the proportion <b>of</b> <b>biodiesel</b> in the blends.
