No Canadian radio broadcaster currently offers an exclusively DAB signal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014, a {{corporate}} relocation to Switzerland was considered {{as part of a}} merger with Alliance Boots, a European drugstore chain. This drew controversy as <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> felt that it was an attempt at tax inversion. On August 5, 2014, Walgreens announced {{that they would not be}} relocating their headquarters.|$|E
25|$|The Salon {{continued}} {{to be the key}} annual marketing event for consumer appliance manufacturers, dictating the rhythm of new product introduction and advertising. The Prefect of the Saine noted in 1958 that the SAM generated far more business than was transacted at the event. <b>Many</b> <b>consumers</b> bought products from retailers that they had selected at the Salon.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the law {{remains in}} the balance, <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> have made claims against their credit card {{providers}} for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest {{that they would have}} earned had the money not been deducted from their account. It is likely that claims for amounts charged in excess of £12 will succeed, but claims for charges at the OFT's £12 threshold level are more contentious.|$|E
25|$|Canada is home {{to dozens}} of {{licensed}} Internet pharmacies, many of which sell their lower-cost prescription drugs to U.S. consumers, who pay one of the world's highest drug prices. In recent years, <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> in the US and in other countries with high drug costs, have turned to licensed Internet pharmacies in India, Israel and the UK, which often have even lower prices than in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply is}} not uniformly {{continuous}} and often fails to meet basic drinking water quality standards. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> {{are forced to}} use alternative and more expensive water sources. For example, it is common in the urban ‘barrios’ in central Venezuela for poor consumers to pay the equivalent of approximately US$1.90m³ – {{much more than the}} tariff for water from the network – for water purchased from a tanker.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, when major {{portions}} of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are implemented in the United States, high deductible plans {{and the concept of}} consumer-driven healthcare may become more popular. Although new federal tax subsidies will help reduce health insurance rates for <b>many</b> <b>consumers,</b> individuals and families that do not qualify, are expected to consider Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) if they do not have employer-sponsored coverage.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{exports to}} the U.S. {{plummeted}} 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports more wine from Australia than from France. Amongst the possible causes for this economic crisis are that <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> tend to prefer wine labels that state the variety of grape from which the wine is made, and often find the required French AOC labels difficult to understand.|$|E
25|$|Many {{credit card}} {{companies}} will also, when applying payments to a card, do so, for the matter at hand, {{at the end of}} a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.|$|E

25|$|Few private {{houses in}} Brazil have an earthed supply, {{so even if}} a three-pin socket is present it is not {{safe to assume that}} all three {{terminals}} are actually connected. Most large domestic appliances were sold with the option to fit a flying earth tail to be locally earthed, but <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> were unsure how to use this and so didn't connect it. The new standard has an earth pin, which in theory eliminates the need for the flying earth tail.|$|E
25|$|The {{cassette}} {{quickly found}} {{use in the}} commercial music industry. One artifact found on some commercially produced music cassettes was a sequence of test tones, called SDR (Super Dynamic Range, also called XDR, or eXtended Dynamic Range) soundburst tones, {{at the beginning and}} end of the tape, heard in order of low frequency to high. These were used during SDR/XDR's duplication process to gauge the quality of the tape medium. <b>Many</b> <b>consumers</b> objected to these tones since they were not part of the recorded music.|$|E
25|$|However, {{about fifty}} percent of all Otomi paper {{production}} is still done in standard 40cm by 60cm size and sold to Nahua painters from Guerrero, the market segment which made the mass commercialization of the product possible. Seventy {{percent of all the}} craft production of these Otomi and Nahuas is sold on the national market with about thirty percent reaching the international market. As most amate paper is sold as the backing for these paintings, so <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> assume the Nahua produce the paper as well.|$|E

50|$|While many {{environmentalists and}} {{conservation}} advocates support decoupling, <b>many</b> <b>consumer</b> advocates representing utility ratepayers have opposed decoupling as {{it attempts to}} guarantee revenue levels to utility companies. Decoupling mechanisms reduce a utility company's financial risk from reducing sales, due to conservation, weather and economic conditions. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>consumer</b> advocates have requested and state and federal regulators have required that utility companies profit levels (measured through a return on equity allowance) be reduced to reflect lower risk.|$|R

25|$|While {{financial}} institutions {{took steps to}} implement e-banking services in the mid-1990s, <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> were hesitant to conduct monetary transactions over the internet. It took widespread adoption of electronic commerce, based on trailblazing companies such as America Online, Amazon.com and eBay, to make the idea of paying for items online widespread. By 2000, 80% of U.S. banks offered e-banking. Customer use grew slowly. At Bank of America, for example, it took 10 years to acquire 2 million e-banking customers. However, a significant cultural change took place after the Y2K scare ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{advertisement}} {{fell into}} disuse in 2001, as the Coca-Cola company restructured its advertising campaigns so that advertising {{around the world}} was produced locally in each country, rather than centrally in the company's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2007, the company brought back the campaign after, according to the company, <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> telephoned its information center saying that they considered it to {{mark the beginning of}} Christmas. The advertisement was created by U.S. advertising agency Doner, and {{has been part of the}} company's global advertising campaign for many years.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile {{mainstream}} theorizing {{has taken}} different directions. Interest {{has shifted from}} general equilibrium style (high-dimension) models to simple, mainly one-good models. Ramsey-style dynamic-optimization models have largely displaced the fixed-saving coefficient approach. The <b>many</b> <b>consumers</b> that Stiglitz implanted into neoclassical growth modelling did not flourish there. Instead the representative agent is usually now the model's driver. Finally, the exogenous technical progress of Harrod, and most writers on growth from whatever school in the 1960s and later, has been joined by numerous models which make technical progress endogenous {{in one of the}} several possible ways...|$|E
