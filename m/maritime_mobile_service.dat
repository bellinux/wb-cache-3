Implementation of such protocols will allow multiple shipboard equipment to communicate via a shipborne network and then transmit the data to a shore-based network in an effective and efficient manner. Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) techniques are often used by packet-switching networks to provide error-free communication links between network nodes. Information throughput is highly link dependent; as the noise or interference on the link increases, throughput decreases. T...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{design of a}} microstrip patch antenna with compact nature {{and the study of}} various antenna parameters to suit the applications such as WiMax operating in the frequency range of 3. 3 – 3. 5 GHz and in other applications like fixed satellite <b>services,</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> etc. covering 2 - 4 GHz of S-band frequency spectra. It is experimental observed that by placing stubs on the patch with air filled dielectric medium, the resonant frequency of the antenna can be lowered by a considerable amount resulting in compactness. Proposed antenna {{can be used as a}} compact antenna system where limited size is a requirement. Measurement results showed the satisfactory performance over S-band frequency spectra with the improved antenna parameters.

40|$|A novel design {{technique}} of patch antenna is proposed and experimentally studied. By etching unequal shaped slot structure on conducting patch element, the resonant {{frequency of the}} proposed antenna is significantly lowered compared to designed frequency, leads to size reduction of patch antenna (25 % size reduction) atresonant frequency. Proposed antenna is designed and fabricated on a FR 4 superstrate with a thickness of 1. 66 mm. Experimental results show that an acceptable impedance bandwidth of 200 MHz ((5. 99 %) at 3. 34 GHz) and 290 MHz ((6. 20 %) at 4. 70 GHz) are obtained. The maximum peak gain of 4. 85 dB and 5. 94 dB at two resonant frequencies with 3 -dB half power beamwidth (HPBW) of 34 o, 43 o are also obtained. Measured results also show that proposed antenna achieved broadsided radiation pattern with linear polarization characteristics. The {{results show that the}} resonant frequencies are used in wireless communication applications namely, WiMax, <b>maritime</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> RADAR communication, fixed satellite services...|$|R

Information throughput is highly link dependent; as the noise or interference on the link increases, throughput decreases. To improve the throughput on a packet switching communications network, an adaptive ARQ strategy is developed and applied to the Stop-and-Wait protocol. A comparison of the throughput efficiencies of the simulated adaptive SW protocol with the non-adaptive SW protocol showed a marked improvement in throughput when the communication links are subjected to high channel bit error rates.

Although numerous studies have investigated this issue, {{there is still a}} lack of studies about the factors related to the dissatisfaction of the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> fee.

The empirical result shows that usage time of mobile device, the priority of handset subsidy when choosing <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> plan, and the awareness of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> payment system are related to dissatisfaction of <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> fee. Moreover, the result implies that the <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> subscribers might be satisfied to their <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> fee in average.

A second objective is to investigate the reasons for using/not using <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> In-depth focus group interviews and secondary empirical data provide the main data. Concerning the youth’s general knowledge of and interest in <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> the results point to six things: young people show a low demand for many <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> there is a demand for extended, established <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> like SMS, the interest in the new services vary, there is low interest in active information search, there is little knowledge of the enabling technology, and the understanding of the pricing is generally low. As concerns reasons for and against usage of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> results point to four central aspects: many individuals could present clearly defined needs for certain services, many indicated an interest in "community usage" of <b>mobile</b> <b>services,</b> they experienced the prices of <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> to be a hinder for usage, and technology placed limitations on the usage.
