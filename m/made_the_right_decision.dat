5|$|Barrichello placed blame upon Frentzen for {{starting}} the lap one accident at the Variante della Roggia corner. He demanded that Frentzen be banned for ten races. Barrichello also added that his helmet was damaged from his collision with de la Rosa. Frentzen reacted {{by suggesting that}} Barrichello braked earlier which forced him {{to make contact with}} teammate Trulli. FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting defended his decision not to stop the race saying that the safety car was deployed as all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that he believed stopping the race would be dangerous. However, he admitted that he was not aware about Gislimberti's condition when making the decision. Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed that Whiting had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> and praised the safety of the modern Formula One car for protecting drivers.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{eventually}} {{chose to}} follow the footsteps of his cousin and aunt and attended Georgia Tech to study graphic design and computer imaging, and subsequently, management. There, he led the Yellow Jackets in averaging 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in 31 games, and led the Atlantic Coast Conference in field goal percentage (.560), joining Antawn Jamison as the only freshmen ever to do so. Bosh originally intended to complete his degree, {{but by the end}} of the 2002–03 season, his strong performances convinced him that he was ready for the NBA. He left Georgia Tech after his freshman season and entered the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh said in future interviews that although he misses his college days, he believes he <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> to pursue a professional career.

While fans at the Rose Garden harbored thoughts of an upset against the Los Angeles Lakers {{in the first}} round of the playoffs, the Trail Blazers succumbed in four games. In O'Neal's first season, he appeared in a total of 45 games in the regular season, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds per game. For the most part, however, he came off the bench and only averaged 10.2 minutes a game. O'Neal doubted for a while if he had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> to skip college—he watched with envy as good friend and fellow prep-to-pro draftee Kobe Bryant was enjoying a good rookie season—but he remained confident that the best had yet to come.|$|E

25|$|With great difficulty, Lafaille {{managed to}} climb down the 75 degree {{face to the}} pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, {{allowing}} him to make short abseils {{down some of the}} hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on {{a different part of the}} South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> in not trying to save him.|$|E

[...] The Scientologist was arrested by Clearwater police and charged with battery, but the State Attorney's Office of Florida decided not to pursue charges. After the incident the Clearwater police Deputy Chief viewed a videotape of the altercation, and concluded that Lonsdale was the victim and that his police officers <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> in arresting the Scientologist. After viewing the videotape, the Assistant State Attorney stated [...] "it is just {{not going to be a}} prosecutable case," [...] and said that the video shows [...] "pretty much mutual aggression" [...] between Lonsdale and the Scientologist.

Lonsdale's attorney Luke Lirot stated [...] "It is another example of the State Attorney's Office's historical reluctance to tangle with Scientology." [...] Scientology spokeswoman Pat Harney said that church members had been told to avoid Lonsdale, and told the St. Petersburg Times that Scientologists had complained to police that they felt Lonsdale was stalking them. The police did not charge Lonsdale, stating that he had the right to take photos and video in public places.|$|E

40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) is {{a significantly}} impairing anxiety disorder {{for which the}} most successful treatment, cognitive behaviour therapy, has 50 - 60 % success rates, taking into account treatment refusals and dropout rates (Fisher & Wells, 2005). Thus, {{factors that contribute to}} the persistence of OCD and interfere with treatment are likely being overlooked. Indeed, Mancini and Gangemi (2004) have proposed that individuals with OCD have greater fear of guilt than others; that is, they dread being judged as guilty for not having done everything in their power to prevent some negative outcome. This fear of guilt fuels obsessions and compulsions as individuals attempt to prevent, avoid, or neutralise the feared guilt. However, few studies have explored fear of guilt in OCD, and no scales exist to measure this construct. The role of fear of guilt in OCD was therefore examined across two studies. Study 1 explored the core features of fear of guilt in OCD, as well as the validity and reliability of the Fear of Guilt Scale (FOGS), a measure developed specifically to assess levels of trait fear of guilt in OCD. Results indicate that the FOGS is a valid and reliable, two-factor measure, and greater FOGS scores significantly predict more severe OCD symptoms among nonclinical participants. Study 2 aimed to determine whether fear of guilt evokes caution and feelings of doubt during the decision-making process, thereby making it more difficult to know when to stop and explaining perseveratory behaviour, such as compulsions in OCD. Findings suggest that greater fear of guilt does not predict more time taken or information needed to make decisions, but higher fear of guilt predicts feelings of uncertainty when deliberating, as indicated by ratings of greater difficulty making decisions, lower confidence in having <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions,</b> and less satisfaction with decisions made. Implications of these findings and the role that fear of guilt may play in the development and persistence of OCD are discussed...|$|R

Have we <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>decisions?</b> Will it address all our needs? Is there anything I forgot to consider? What if our users don’t like it? What if it is a complete failure?!Theoretically, it should be ok. I’ve followed <b>the</b> <b>right</b> steps and worked with a creative, talented and dedicated team. This is different from trying out a new instructional technique or reorganizing the information desk. This is big. I talk the evidence based talk regularly, but now I am walking the walk in a bigger way than I had ever imagined. Change can be frightening. Moving out of comfort zones is not easy. Having said that, the challenge can be invigorating and the change, refreshing. I find myself welcoming the change as much as I dread it. I’ll face my fears and see it through to the implementation and evaluations and beyond. And hey, no matter what the outcome, it should make for a good paper. If anyone else out there is going through a similar process, I’d be interested in comparing notes. I invite you to try something new this year in your work environment or in your professional activities. Implement a new service; change a process; publish a paper; present at a conference; teach a new workshop. Find out what should work through research and investigation, and go for it. Yes, it may cause anxiety and you may have to spend time convincing others to accept change, but it beats just thinking about it. Now, if I could just crawl under a reference book until the lab is built I’ll be all set. Call me when it’s done...|$|R
