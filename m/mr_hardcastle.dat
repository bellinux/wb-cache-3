500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} in trade publications. The Moving Picture World remarked that the play itself was not well-known, {{but that the}} plot was depicted adequately enough that it may encourage a re-perusal of the play. There was no fault found by the reviewer who stated, [...] "The characters of Hardcastle, Kate and Marlow are admirably done and seem to correctly interpret the original. The staging and costuming are {{in harmony with the}} play and reproduce the scenery of the time depicted with accuracy. The usefulness of a work of this sort does not end with the presentation of the play itself. There is an educational value which includes the costuming and reproduction of the surroundings of the time. These are so unfamiliar now that they afford not a little addition to the interest and pleasure of such a film. The work has been done so well that the company deserves commendation for undertaking the task. It is not an easy manner to reproduce a play of this character, and when it is well done the company performing it deserves praise." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed on almost all points, [...] "In numerous details the illusion is dispelled, for the scenery is manifestly not of the eighteenth century. No contemporary of Goldsmith ever rode in such a barouche as appears in this film, nor lived in such a house as <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b> The final tableau is as artificial as set pieces which have gone out of style at funerals. With all of its imperfections there is considerable of virile comedy in the film." [...] Though the Mirror reviewer stated that despite the elimination of the Hastings and Constance Neville subplot, the acting is clear enough that audiences do not need prior knowledge of the play to appreciate the film.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 20, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with the love affair of two young people, both of whose parents are anxious that they should wed. Young Marlow sent by his father to court {{the daughter of an}} old friend, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastle.</b> Marlow has spent very little time in the company of the fairer sex, and as a consequence thereof is always shy and nervous in their presence. He, therefore, accepts his father's orders unwillingly and, accompanied by his friend, young Hastings, rides out to meet his future bride. On the road the travelers encounter Hardcastle's stepson, Tony Lumpkin, who in revenge for punishment his stepfather has inflicted, directs Marlow and his friend to the Hardcastle mansion, claiming that it is an inn where they will be well treated. In the meantime, great preparations are being made at the Hardcastle home for the reception of Hardcastle's old friend, and when Tony ushers in young Marlow, thinking Hardcastle merely the proprietor of an inn, he treats him with scant courtesy and orders him about, much to the older man's chagrin. Hardcastle is subjected to his daughter's extravagant costumes, and she appears on this memorable evening dressed in a simple dress and wearing the cap and apron that housewives in the neighborhood assume. This costume greatly pleases her father, but leads young Marlow further astray. He immediately jumps to the conclusion that she is a most attractive barmaid and loses his heart to her in short order. Upon the arrival of his father, Marlow learns his mistake as regards the inn question, but flatly refuses to marry Hardcastle's daughter, claiming that she is too grand for him, and citing his preference for the maid servant. While in the act of making love to the supposed barmaid he is discovered by his father, and, when told that this is the young lady his father had intended him to marry, he is overjoyed, as he feels sure that his bashful disposition would never have allowed him to woo and win her had he known her to be a lady of fashion." ...|$|E

6000|$|Most of us tell {{old stories}} in our families. The wife and {{children}} laugh for the hundredth time at the joke. The old servants (though old servants are fewer every day) nod and smile a recognition at the well-known anecdote. [...] "Don't tell that story of Grouse in the gun-room," [...] says Diggory to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Hardcastle</b> in the play, [...] "or I must laugh." [...] As we twaddle, and grow old and forgetful, we may tell an old story; or, out of mere benevolence, and a wish to amuse a friend when conversation is flagging, disinter a Joe Miller now and then; but the practice is not quite honest, and entails a certain necessity of hypocrisy on story hearers and tellers. It is a sad thing, {{to think that a}} man with what you call a fund of anecdote is a humbug, more or less amiable and pleasant. What right have I to tell my [...] "Grouse in the gun-room" [...] over and over in the presence of my wife, mother, mother-in-law, sons, daughters, old footman or parlor-maid, confidential clerk, curate, or what not? I smirk and go through the history, giving my admirable imitations of the characters introduced: I mimic Jones's grin, Hobbs's squint, Brown's stammer, Grady's brogue, Sandy's Scotch accent, {{to the best of my}} power: and, the family part of my audience laughs good-humoredly. Perhaps the stranger, for whose amusement the performance is given, is amused by it and laughs too. But this practice continued is not moral. This self-indulgence on your part, my dear Paterfamilias, is weak, vain--not to say culpable. I can imagine many a worthy man, who begins unguardedly to read this page, and comes to the present sentence, lying back in his chair, thinking of that story which he has told innocently for fifty years, and rather piteously owning to himself, [...] "Well, well, it IS wrong; I have no right to call on my poor wife to laugh, my daughters to affect to be amused, by that old, old jest of mine. And they would have gone on laughing, and they would have pretended to be amused, to their dying day, if this man had not flung his damper over our hilarity." [...] . I lay down the pen, and think, [...] "Are there any old stories which I still tell myself in the bosom of my family? Have I any 'Grouse in my gun-room?'" [...] If there are such, it is because my memory fails; not because I want applause, and wantonly repeat myself. You see, men with the so-called fund of anecdote will not repeat the same story to the same individual; but they do think that, on a new party, the repetition of a joke ever so old may be honorably tried. I meet men walking the London street, bearing the best reputation, men of anecdotal powers:--I know such, who very likely will read this, and say, [...] "Hang the fellow, he means ME!" [...] And so I do. No--no man ought to tell an anecdote more than thrice, let us say, unless he is sure he is speaking only to give pleasure to his hearers--unless he feels that it is not a mere desire for praise which makes him open his jaws.|$|E
