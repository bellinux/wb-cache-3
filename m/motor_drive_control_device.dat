40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{development}} and implementation of new technologies in the fields of electronics, electro motion and control systems engineering, had a great impact on all kinds of industries. Industrial electronics completely changed its face and modem systems for motion control were introduced. Sophisticated microprocessors for servo control combined with faster power electronic devices, allowed a new generation of electrical motors with permanent rare earth magnets to become the "heart" of contemporary industrial and automotive applications. Most of those motors fall in the category of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM) or Brushless DC Motors (BDCM) because of their distinctive type of control - sinusoidal or trapezoidal. Despite their numerous advantages over other AC and DC motors, they have a relatively high price. Thus diagnostics and service, especially of PMSM motors and their feedback <b>control</b> <b>devices,</b> play an important role for keeping machines in industrial plants in a good healthy condition. This paper proposes a platform for comprehensive diagnostics of servo <b>motors</b> and <b>drives,</b> feedback <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) power modules with a potential to benefit graduate students, industrial service technicians and engineers. ...|$|R

As compared to segregated standby redundancy and whole system standby redundancy, such method provides preservation of all unit functions {{in case of}} redundancy and gives the possibility for continuous monitoring of major and redundant elements. Example of that unit is given. Electric <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> channel block diagram contains two control units – the major and redundant; it also contains four power supply units. Control units programming was carried out using automata-based approach. Electric <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> channel model was developed; it provides complex simulation of control state-machine and power converter. Through visibility and hierarchy of finite state machines debug time was shortened as compared to traditional programming.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a hybrid cascaded H-bridge multilevel <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> scheme for electric/hybrid electric vehicles where each {{phase of a}} three-phase cascaded multilevel converter can be implemented using only a single DC source and capacitors for the other DC sources. Traditionally, each phase of a three-phase cascaded multilevel converter requires n DC sources for 2 n + 1 output voltage levels. In this paper, a scheme is proposed that allows {{the use of a}} single DC source as the first DC source with the remaining n- 1 DC sources being capacitors. It is shown that a simple 7 -level equal step output voltage switching control can simultaneously maintain the balance of DC voltage levels of the capacitors, eliminate specified low order non-triplen harmonics, and produce a nearly sinusoidal three-phase output voltage. This scheme therefore provides the capability to produce higher voltages at higher speeds (where they are needed) with a low switching frequency method for <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> application, which has inherent low switching losses and high conversion efficiency. This control scheme especially fits fuel cell electric vehicle <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> applications and hybrid electric vehicle <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{induction}} <b>motor</b> <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> method {{which uses}} minimal number of sensors, providing only DC-link current as a feedback signal. Improved DC-link current sampling scheme and modified asymmetrical switching pattern cancels characteristic waveform errors which exist {{in all three}} reconstructed motor line-currents. Motor linecurrent harmonic content is reduced to an acceptable level, eliminating torque and speed oscillations which were inherent for conventional single sensor drives. Consequently, use of single current sensor and line-current reconstruction technique is no longer acceptable only for low and medium performance drives, but also for drives where priority is obtaining a highly accurate, stable and fast response.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design of an {{electrical}} drive system for the purpose of high precision motion control. A modern electrical drive is usually equipped with acurrent regulated voltage source along with powerful motion controller systemutilizing one or more micro-controllers and/or digital signal processors (DSPs).
