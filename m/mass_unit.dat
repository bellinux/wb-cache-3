5|$|Like other elements, {{a variety}} of {{processes}} alter the relative abundance of calcium isotopes. The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as calcite, aragonite and apatite from solution. Lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals, leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025% per atomic <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> (amu) at room temperature. Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes (usually 44Ca/40Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. 44Ca/40Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.|$|E

25|$|Accuracy {{can always}} be {{improved}} with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in ab initio models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with sufficient accuracy. Errors for energies can be less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen electrons is computationally tractable by approximate methods such as density functional theory (DFT).|$|E
25|$|Methane is {{important}} for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator. Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but {{the ratio of the}} heat of combustion (891 kJ/mol) to the molecular mass (16.0 g/mol, of which 12.0 g/mol is carbon) shows that methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon, produces more heat per <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> (55.7 kJ/g) than other complex hydrocarbons. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking. In this context it is usually known as natural gas, which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter, or 1,000 BTU per standard cubic foot.|$|E
25|$|Building {{from work}} by J. J. Thomson on the {{deflection}} of positively charged atoms by electric and magnetic fields, Francis Aston {{built the first}} mass spectrograph at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919. His aim {{was to try to}} separate the two isotopes of neon, which he was able to easily do. Aston discovered that the masses of all the particles are whole numbers, called the whole number rule, that is, the masses of all the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom. Aston arbitrarily computed his masses relative to oxygen-16, which he took to have a mass of exactly 16. (Today the atomic <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> (amu) is relative to carbon-12.) Ironically, the one exception to this rule was hydrogen itself, which had a mass value 1.008. The excess mass was small, but well outside experimental uncertainty. Aston and others quickly realized that the discrepancy was on account of the binding energy of atoms, that is, the mass of a number of hydrogen atoms bound into a single atom must be less than the sum of the masses of the separate hydrogen atoms. Additional work determined the nuclide binding energies. Aston's work on isotopes garnered him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole-number rule. Noting Aston's recent discovery of nuclear binding energy, in 1920 Arthur Eddington suggested that stars may obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen (protons) into helium and that the heavier elements may form in stars.|$|E

This approval has since been given. Following the proposal to redefine the mole by fixing the value of Avogadro's number, Brian Leonard of the University of Akron, writing in Metrologia proposed that the dalton (Da) be redefined as such that NA = (g/Da)mol, but that the unified atomic <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> (mu) retain its current definition based on the mass of 12C, ceasing to exactly equal to the dalton.

500|$|As {{even the}} most massive atoms are far too light to work with directly, chemists instead use the unit of moles.

Also, the microscopic properties of helium-3 cause it to have a higher zero-point energy than helium-4.

40|$|Antioxidant {{measurement}} assays {{are widely}} used and should be chosen based on their being fit for purpose. Likewise, the mode of reporting antioxidant measurements should also be fit for purpose. The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay is widely used internationally for measuring the antioxidant capacity of commodities using the peroxyl radical. However, the current mode of reporting of the ORAC values is not obvious, especially for the consumer groups.
