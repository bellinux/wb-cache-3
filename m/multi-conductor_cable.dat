50|$|Rather than {{produce a}} {{transmitter}} {{to match the}} 2B, Drake designed {{a new line of}} equipment beginning with an SSB transceiver, the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a <b>multi-conductor</b> <b>cable.</b> The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency). The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker.|$|E

5000|$|IMTS systems {{typically}} had 25 {{watts of}} transmitter {{power at the}} mobile station and 100-250 Watts at the terminal — unlike the older cellular car telephones that had maximum power output of 3 watts and modern cellular handsets with power outputs of 0.6 watts. Mobile installations normally consisted of a [...] "head unit" [...] or the telephone handset which sat in a cradle with a direct dialing keyboard. These looked and functioned much like a landline, or hardwired, telephone. Unlike cellular handsets, these units passed through a dial tone when the receiver was lifted from the cradle {{and in this way}} seemed more like a landline telephone than a cellular handset. There was a separate large radio transceiver chassis, typically measuring at least a foot square and 6 inches high, that was mounted either in the trunk or under the seats of an automobile. These transceivers were connected to the handset cradle with a <b>multi-conductor</b> <b>cable</b> usually around [...]5 inch thick. The mobile antennas almost always required a hole to be drilled {{in the body of the}} car to mount the antenna in; until the 1970s there were no [...] "on-glass" [...] antennas - these were developed later for the cellular car-mounted telephones. The antennas looked much like those used for CB radios and were about 19 in. long (1/4 wavelength at 155 MHz). These mobile telephone systems required a large amount of power (10 to 15 amperes at 12 volts) and this was supplied by thick power cabling connected directly to the automobile's battery. It therefore was quite possible and not uncommon for an IMTS telephone to drain an automobile's battery if used for moderate periods of time without the automobile engine running or if left on overnight. Optionally these units were also connected to the car's horn and were switched to honk the horn as a ringer when receiving an incoming call if the user was away from the car at the time of the call.|$|E

40|$|Measuring induced {{polarization}} {{in the time}} domain with relatively compact multi-channel multi-electrode systems is attractive because of {{the simplicity of the}} procedure and thus its efficiency in the field. However the use of this technique is sometimes discouraged by the bad quality of the measurements in cases of high electrode contact resistances that can render data interpretation infeasible or at least unreliable. It is proposed that capacitive coupling in the multi-core electrode cables has a significant role in creating this problem. In such cases separation of current and potential circuits by using separate <b>multi-conductor</b> <b>cable</b> spreads can yield significant improvement in data quality. The procedure is relatively simple and can be implemented with common resistivity and time-domain IP equipment. We show here three field examples from Southern Sweden, all measured as 2 D electrical imaging sections. The first one is an example where the use of a single cable spread is sufficient thanks to moderate electrode contact resistance and high signal levels. The following two examples are from sites where {{induced polarization}} measurements could not yield consistent results using only a single <b>multi-conductor</b> <b>cable</b> spread. Useful results were subsequently obtained by using separate cable spreads. The first example is a 280 m long line measured over an old covered municipal waste deposit where the waste body stands out as a zone of high chargeability. The second example is a 120 m line measured on a sandy glaciofluvial structure that is host to an aquifer of regional importance. The improvement led to discrimination between materials of different grain sizes, with potential bearing for understanding the aquifer. The third example is a 300 - 400 m line measured across an esker lying on clay till. The improvement led to a clear visualization of the esker and to the identification of a possible fault in the underlying gneissic bedrock. In all cases pseudosections and examples of chargeability decay curves are shown and discussed as tools for assessing data quality. Inversion results are shown together with background geological information and it is concluded that they are in good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) magnitudes from classical detection {{techniques are}} {{expressed in terms of}} apparent charges. Signals from HF/VHF/UHF techniques on substation components are often hard to express in this quantity because of complex signal excitation and propagation channels. A method to calibrate PD signals obtained during online inductive detection in medium voltage belted cables is described. online inductive detection implies that the impedances of components present in substations essentially determine the detected PD signal magnitude. The use of belted cables means, that the coupling of a PD event to the conductors not only depends on the PD site within the cross-section of the cable or cable accessory, but also becomes dependent on the momentary phase angle. In addition, during signal propagation the signal magnitude may alter according to the propagation modes of a <b>multi-conductor</b> <b>cable.</b> These aspects are studied quantitatively by the use of theoretical modelling in addition to offline and online experiments.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of transfer characteristics of low voltage power distribution networks for PLC requires {{the knowledge of}} the electrical parameters of the cables comprising these networks. In this paper, a method has been developed for characterizing the power line cable parameters. As a complement to many existing approaches, we estimate the cable parameters from a set of easy measurements. A <b>multi-conductor</b> powerline <b>cable</b> has multiple, coupled propagation modes with corresponding primary parameters, even if the propagation speed of those modes is nearly the same. Based on multi-conductor transmission line theory, we propose a practical measurement approach to derive the important parameters separately.

The approach is validated by comparing the computed transfer function of a power line cable with the directly measured one. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|An {{insulation}} resistance diagnostic system was recently developed and exercised during {{a series of}} cable fire tests, sponsored by the commercial U. S. nuclear industry. This {{insulation resistance}} measurement system was able to identify and quantify the changes in insulation resistance occurring between the separate conductors and the conductors to ground in cable bundles as they were being exposed to fires. Eighteen separate fire tests were conducted during the period January through May 2001 and included a variety of cable and fire exposure conditions. The insulation resistance measurement system was operated at a 120 VAC input to the conductors for fourteen of those test runs and at 100 VDC input for three of the runs. One test was run with the insulation resistance measurement system providing 24 VDC to two separate instrument cables being exposed to the fire. The results obtained by the insulation resistance measurement system during these tests showed that cables will fail during a fire {{in one of three}} ways: by internal shorting of the conductors in a <b>multi-conductor</b> <b>cable,</b> by shorting of the conductors in different cables bundled together, and by individual conductors shorting to ground.

40|$|During the {{evaluation}} of a proposed site for an underground nuclear test at the Department of Energy`s Nevada Test Site (NTS) {{it was important to}} measure the bulk density of the geological formation in which the test was to be executed. The most satisfactory method for this measurement is the density log. This is a measurement system in which a gamma-ray source and detector are mounted in an instrument (a sonde) which is lowered into a borehole by a <b>multi-conductor</b> <b>cable,</b> and the number of gamma rays detected is used to infer the bulk density. At NTS many of the boreholes of interest are air-filled, with diameters as large as 3. 65 m, drilled in partially-saturated media. Consequently the commercial equipment and calibration procedures are not suitable for NTS conditions. The count rate from a density sonde is strongly affected by any gap between the sonde and the borehole wall, especially if the gap is filled with air rather than water. Modern commercial density logs employ two detectors, and use one of the detectors to compensate for borehole conditions such as mudcake and gap. The commercial compensation algorithms assume that the sonde is parallel to the borehole wall; a reasonable assumption for oilfield conditions but not for NTS conditions. Moreover, in an air-filled borehole, borehole diameter affects both the calibration and the compensation. Therefore we could not use commercial algorithms to deal with NTS conditions. For many years, no appropriate two-detector algorithm was available for the NTS situation. Consequently we developed special algorithms for a single-detector sonde, which was equipped to measure the gap directly. Recently a two-detector algorithm was developed, which appears to be satisfactory if the sonde is calibrated in the appropriate-diameter borehole. In this report we describe the calibration procedures and the algorithms for both methods...|$|E
50|$|Since {{stripping}} the insulation from wires is time-consuming, many connectors intended for rapid assembly use insulation-displacement connectors so that insulation {{need not be}} removed from the wire. These generally {{take the form of a}} fork-shaped opening in the terminal, into which the insulated wire is pressed and which cut through the insulation to contact the conductor within. To make these connections reliably on a production line, special tools are used which accurately control the forces applied during assembly. If properly assembled, the resulting terminations are gas-tight and will last the life of the product. A common example is the <b>multi-conductor</b> flat ribbon <b>cable</b> used in computer disk drives; to terminate each of the many (approximately 40) wires individually would be slow and error-prone, but an insulation displacement connector can terminate all the wires in (literally) one stroke. Another very common use is so-called punch-down blocks used for terminating telephone wiring.|$|R
