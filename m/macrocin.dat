5000|$|In enzymology, a <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase (...) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{chemical}} reaction ...|$|E

5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:macrocin 3"'-O-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include <b>macrocin</b> methyltransferase, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine-macrocin O-methyltransferase.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} assay for S-adenosyl-L-methionine:macrocin O-methyltransferase, {{the enzyme}} which carries out the terminal step in tylosin biosynthesis, is described. <b>Macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase requires Mg 2 + and S-adenosyl-L-methionine for activity, has a temperature optimum of about 31 degrees C, {{and has a}} pH optimum of 7. 5 to 8. 2. <b>Macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase specifically converts <b>macrocin</b> to tylosin by O-methylation of the 3 " ' position of <b>macrocin.</b> In vitro methylation studies with extracts from a tylosin-producing Streptomyces fradiae strain and from mutant strains blocked in 2 " '- or 3 " '-O-methylations indicated that: (i) the 2 " '- and 3 " '-O-methylations occur after 6 -deoxy-D-allose {{is attached to the}} macrolide ring; (ii) the 2 " '- and 3 " '-O-methylations are carried out by separate enzymes; and (iii) the 2 " '-O-methylation precedes the 3 " '-O-methylation. <b>Macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase was inhibited by high levels of its substrate, <b>macrocin,</b> by its product, tylosin, and by other tylosin analogs which contained mycinose or demethyl analogs of mycinose. <b>Macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase was produced early in the tylosin fermentation cycle by S. fradiae and preceded the onset of rapid tylosin biosynthesis by about 24 h. The enzyme specific activity reached maximum at about 72 h and then slowly declined. A mutant strain of S. fradiae selected for increased tylosin production synthesized <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase more rapidly and accumulated a higher enzyme specific activity than a wild-type strain...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} mutants of Streptomyces fradiae {{selected}} for increased {{production of the}} macrolide antibiotic tylosin was analyzed for levels of expression of <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase, the enzyme which catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of tylosin. Increased tylosin production was accompanied by increased <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase {{in some of the}} mutants. Increased expression of <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase was due to more rapid early biosynthesis of the enzyme, to reduced decay of enzyme specific activity late in the fermentation, or to combinations of both. Mutant strains which showed rapid loss of enzyme specific activity late in the fermentation converted large amounts of tylosin to relomycin. The most productive mutants, which synthesized elevated levels of <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase, also produced large amounts of <b>macrocin,</b> the substrate for the enzyme. Incomplete conversion of <b>macrocin</b> to tylosin by these mutants may be due to substrate and product inhibition (E. T. Seno and R. H. Baltz, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 20 : 370 - 377, 1981). The results suggest that both the levels of precursors and the levels of expression of tylosin biosynthetic enzymes are important for efficient production of tylosin...|$|E
40|$|Tylosin, a {{macrolide}} antibiotic, was co-produced {{with four}} structurally similar antibiotics in fermentation cultures of Streptomyces fradiae. <b>Macrocin,</b> desmycosin, lactenocin, and relomycin {{were found to}} be components of a common pathway that functions in tylosin biosynthesis. Data obtained by the addition of the purified 14 C-labeled antibiotics to cultures of S. fradiae revealed that <b>macrocin</b> and desmycosin were direct precursors of tylosin, whereas lactenocin was an immediate precursor of both <b>macrocin</b> and desmycosin. Incubation of these cultures with [14 C]tylosin resulted in an equivalent distribution of radioactive label between relomycin and an unidentified component. The kinetics of incorporation of label into the two species were similar, suggesting that both were derived directly from tylosin. A system that supported that methylation of <b>macrocin</b> to tylosin by cell-free extracts of S. fradiae was developed. A proposed scheme defining the terminal stages of tylosin biosynthesis is presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{large group}} of ester {{derivatives}} of tylosin-related macrolides was prepared in which the hydroxyl groups at C- 3 and C- 4 '' were acylated by either chemical or biochemical methods. Most of the derivatives exhibited excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity. However, only the 3, 4 ''-diacyl derivatives of tylosin and <b>macrocin</b> showed any significant improvements of in vivo efficacy against experimental infections in rodents. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{isolated}} numerous mutants of Streptomyces fradiae blocked in tylosin biosynthesis after N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. These mutants {{were classified}} into nine groups, {{based upon the}} tylosin-like compounds produced and upon cofermentation analyses. More than 80 % of the mutants isolated produced no tylosin-like compounds, {{and the majority of}} these were blocked only in the formation of tylactone. Four classes of mutants blocked in the biosynthesis or addition of tylosin sugars were isolated; tylA mutants were blocked in the formation of all three tylosin sugars, whereas tylB, tylC, and tylD mutants were blocked specifically in the biosynthesis or the addition of mycaminose, mycarose, and 6 -deoxy-d-allose, respectively. Two classes of mutants (tylH and tylI) blocked in specific oxidations of tylactone and two classes (tylE and tylF) blocked in specific O-methylations of demethylmacrocin and <b>macrocin</b> were also characterized. Cofermentation and bioconversion studies with these mutants suggested the following relationships: (i) the tylosin sugars are derived from a common intermediate; (ii) tylactone is the first intermediate which can be excreted in appreciable quantities; (iii) the addition of mycaminose to the C- 5 hydroxyl group of tylactone must precede oxidations at C- 20 and C- 23; (iv) oxidation at C- 20 normally precedes the attachment of mycarose to the 4 ′ hydroxyl position of mycaminose; and (v) 6 -deoxy-d-allose is added to the C- 23 hydroxyl position of the lactone and subsequently O-methylated at 2 ‴ and 3 ‴ positions. The O-methylations appear to be the final two steps in tylosin biosynthesis, and the 2 ‴ O-methylation must occur before the 3 ‴ O-methylation can take place. All of the tyl mutants except the tylG mutants produced relatively high levels of tylosin-like intermediates or shunt products. Mutants blocked in specific steps other than 3 ‴ O-methylation, including a mutant blocked in 2 ‴ O-methylation of demethylmacrocin, produced normal levels of <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase. Mutants apparently containing specific tylosin structural gene mutations produced normal levels of aerial mycelia and spores, produced low levels of tylosin aldehyde reductase, and were resistant to high levels of tylosin. However, three atypical tylG mutants produced no tylosin-like compounds, could not cosynthesize tylosin with any other tyl mutant, could not bioconvert tylactone or <b>macrocin</b> to tylosin, and produced no <b>macrocin</b> O-methyltransferase. These three mutants produced elevated levels of tylosin aldehyde reductase. In addition, one was very succeptible to tylosin and did not produce aerial mycelia or spores...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 20 -deoxo- 20 -cyclic (alkylamino) {{derivatives}} of tylosin, desmycosin, <b>macrocin</b> and lactenocin was prepared by reductive amination of the C- 20 aldehyde group. The {{majority of the}} compounds were prepared using metal hydrides (sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride) as the reducing agents and a suitable cyclic alkylamine. Subsequently, a more convenient procedure was developed using formic acid as a reducing agent. The C- 20 amino derivatives prepared from desmycosin exhibited good in vitro antimicrobial activity against Pasteurella haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida (MIC range of 0. 78 approximately 6. 25 micrograms/ml) as well as Mycoplasma species (MIC range of 0. 39 approximately 6. 25 micrograms/ml). Several derivatives showed excellent oral efficacy against infections caused by P. multocida in chicks. One of these derivatives, 20 -deoxo- 20 -(3, 5 -dimethylpiperidin- 1 -yl) desmycosin (tilmicosin or EL- 870) was selected for development as a therapeutic agent for pasteurellosis in calves and pigs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
