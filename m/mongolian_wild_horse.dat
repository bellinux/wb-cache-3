5|$|The Manipuri pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{developed}} in India. Experts disagree on its exact origin, {{although they do}} {{agree that it is}} an ancient breed, possibly developed from either the Tibetan pony or a cross between the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Horse</b> and the Arabian. First mentioned in written chronicles in 1584, Manipuri ponies were used as cavalry horses throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were in demand by the British for use as polo ponies. Breed numbers have dwindled, however, mainly due to exports, and today the population is very low. In 2007, a genetic study was conducted on the Manipuri and four other Indian equine breeds. The Manipuri was shown to be genetically close to three other Indian pony breeds, but genetically more distant from the Marwari, the sole Indian horse breed in the study. The Manipuri pony was originally bred for polo and military usage, and today is bred mainly for playing polo and racing, although it is also in demand for military transport use.|$|E

500|$|Sources {{disagree}} as to {{the exact}} origins of the Manipuri pony, although all agree that it was derived from ancient stock. One source gives the ancestors of the pony as Tibetan ponies brought into India over a thousand years ago, while another states their origins to be a cross between the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Horse</b> and the Arabian, brought to India by invading Tartar tribes, who also brought the equestrian game of polo. Manipuri ponies have been bred for centuries in the Manipur area of northeast India. The first written mention of the breed dates to a brief statement in the 1584 Manipur Royal Chronicle. By the early 1600s, the breed was mentioned frequently in Manipur literature. They were often used as cavalry horses, and were ridden by Meitei warriors. Manipuri ponies played a major part in the cavalry commanded by Garib Newaz, whose horsemen terrorized upper Burma throughout the early 1700s and in 1738 were used during his Sack of Sagaing. Between 1859 and 1916, Manipuri ponies were extremely desired by the British for playing polo, and there were further infusions of Arabian blood in the 19th century, as British administrators and military officers sought to upgrade their polo ponies. The height of polo horses was initially restricted to , based on the average height of the Manipuri, and although this restriction was later relaxed to [...] and then removed altogether, demand for Manipuris was so high that the area was drained of them. At one point during this period, the export of ponies from Manipur was banned to allow the breed time to increase in number to a viable level. Manipuris were also used to transport British troops into Burma throughout World War II.|$|E

2500|$|Most [...] "wild" [...] horses today, {{such as the}} American mustang or the Australian brumby, are {{actually}} feral horses descended from domesticated animals that escaped and adapted {{to life in the}} wild. In contrast, the Przewalski's horse has never been domesticated and remains the only true <b>wild</b> <b>horse</b> in the world today. Przewalski's horse is one of three known subspecies of Equus ferus, the others being the domesticated horse Equus ferus caballus, and the extinct tarpan Equus ferus ferus. There are still a number of other wild equines, including three species of zebra and various subspecies of the African wild ass, onager (including the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> ass), and kiang.|$|R
