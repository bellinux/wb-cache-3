40|$|Abstract. Canine extraskeletal osteosarcomas are {{extremely}} rare tumors. Over {{a period of}} 25 years at the Animal Medical Center, approximately 1, 000 cases of skeletal osteosarcomas have been diagnosed. During the same period 1 1 cases of extraskeletal osteosarcomas and three extraskeletal chondrosarcomas were diagnosed. Tumors of the mammary gland were excluded. Extraskeletal osteosarcomas {{were found in the}} adrenal gland, eye, gastric ligament, ileum, kidney, liver, spleen, testicle, and vagina. The chondrosarcomas were found in the mitral valves, lungs, and omentum. The mean age of the dogs with extraskeletal osteosarcoma was 11 years, and {{the mean age of the}} dogs with extraskeletal chondrosarcoma was 14 years. The sizes of the tumors ranged from 3 cubic centimeters to 8, 3 15 cubic centimeters. Osteoblastic osteosarcomas were the most common histologic type (7 / 11, 63. 6 %); there was a single case of each of the following: fibroblastic, fibrous histiocytic, chondroblastic, and mixed osteo-chondroblastic osteosarcoma. Two of the dogs with <b>chondrosarcomas</b> had <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcomas</b> involving the lungs and omentum. The remaining dog had a regular chondro-sarcoma involving the mitral valve. Distant metastases were present in seven of 11 dogs with extraskeletal osteosarcoma and in none of the dogs with chondrosarcoma.

40|$|The tumor {{designated}} by Stout and Murray as "hemangiopericytoma" (HPC) more than 50 years ago continues {{to represent a}} source of uncertainty and disagreement among pathologists. In particular, questions exist regarding the synonymity of a hemangiopericytomatous growth pattern [...] defined by a monomorphic population of compact polygonal or bluntly fusiform cells and a branching stromal vascular pattern with a "staghorn" configuration [...] {{and the presence of}} a reproducible biological entity. It has been shown repeatedly that these same histologic features may be observed at least focally in a diversity of neoplasms, including "true" hemangiopericytomas, synovial sarcomas, <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcomas,</b> infantile fibrosarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, leiomyosarcomas, endometrial stromal sarcomas, solitary fibrous tumors, myofibromas, malignant mesotheliomas, thymomas, sarcomatoid carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and "phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors. " Despite their potential sharing of the microscopic attributes in question, such neoplasms have individualistic clinical features and can also be distinguished from one another by specialized pathologic analyses. HPC is "defined" in that context by reactivity for vimentin, with or without CD 34 and CD 57, but it lacks other immunodeterminants of epithelial, neural, and myogenous differentiation. Paradoxically, this phenotype is indeed associated with the presence of myogenous-type cytoplasmic filaments in ultrastructural evaluations of HPC. Other lesions that may resemble "true" HPC [...] but which possess dissimilar subcellular and clinical characteristics [...] include solitary fibrous tumors, hemangiopericytomalike tumors of the sinonasal tract, and "infantile (congenital) hemangiopericytomas.

40|$|The neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule (NCAM) was discovered {{in a search for}} cell surface antigens of chicken neurons that contribute to {{cell adhesion}} and pattern formation during development. Homologous adhesion molecules have been identified in several species, including humans. In this immunohistochemical study, the authors examine the role of human NCAM in tumor diagnosis. The authors used a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5. 1 H 11, to examine NCAM immunoreactivity in frozen sections of more than 450 tumors, including more than 80 small round cell tumors (SRCT) of childhood and adolescence (neuroblastomas, Ewing's sarcomas [ES], peripheral neuroepitheliomas [PN], primitive neuroectodermal tumors [PNET], esthesioneuroblastomas, malignant ectomesenchymoma, medulloblastomas, small cell osteosarcomas, <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcomas,</b> embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and lymphomas). The authors show that 1) neuroblastomas and primary brain tumors are NCAM+; 2) ES, most PN/PNETs, and melanomas are NCAM-; 3) embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and various other sarcomas are NCAM+; 4) neuroendocrine tumors are NCAM+; 5) subsets of carcinomas of kidney, ovary, lung and other organs are NCAM+; and 6) lymphoid tumors are NCAM-. Tests with normal fetal and adult tissues indicate that these findings reflect only in part the NCAM phenotypes of corresponding normal tissues. Notably the NCAM- phenotype of ES and PN/PNET is not explained by current histogenetic models for these tumors, which suggest a primitive neuroectodermal origin. Finally the authors show that NCAM expression among SRCT has an inverse relationship with the expression of p 30 / 32 MIC 2, a cell surface antigen of ES and PN/PNET detected with MAb HBA 71. These results suggest that immunohistochemical assays for NCAM and p 30 / 32 MIC 2 expression may aid in the further characterization of SRCT of childhood and adolescence...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the cases that were amputated in our clinic due to primary {{malignant}} and metastatic bone and soft tissue tumor. Material and Method: 24 cases that were amputated due to primary malignant and metastatic bone and soft tissue tumor between January 1987 and January 2012 were examined retrospectively. The cases were assessed in terms of age, gender, pathological diagnosis, localization, type of amputation, survival and characteristics. The data obtained were transferred to SPSS 15. 0 program and analyzed. Normality distributions of the data were analyzed with Shapiro-Wilk test. Results: Of the 24 cases, 17 (70 %) were men, while 7 (30 %) were women and the average age was 42 (between 12 and 68). The most common reasons for amputation were skin cancer (25 %), Ewing sarcoma (20. 8 %), Osteosarcoma (16. 6 %) and others (Malignant <b>mesenchymal</b> tumor, <b>chondrosarcoma,</b> synovial sarcoma, metastatic tumor). 16 of these patients had previously received an intervention in a different centre at least once.

40|$|Chondrosarcomas are {{malignant}} bone tumors {{with pure}} hyaline cartilage differentiation; myxoid changes, calcification, or ossification may be present. Several subtypes of chondrosarcomas exist. Behavior patterns vary, ranging from slow-growing nonmetastasizing lesions to aggressive metastasizing sarcomas. Symptoms are usually mild, with duration ranging from {{several months to}} years, and usually consist of persistent, dull, aching pain or palpable masses. Radiographic findings include bone expansion with cortical thickening, radiolucent areas with variably distributed punctate or ring-like matrix calcifications, cortical erosion or destruction, endosteal scalloping, and scant or absent periosteal reaction; extension into the soft tissue may be present. Histological differential diagnosis from benign cartilaginous lesions {{can be achieved by}} increased cellularity, enlarged plump nuclei, binucleated cells, hyperchromatic nuclear pleomorphism, and permeation of cortical or medullary bone. Atypia is usually mild to moderate; necrosis and mitoses can be seen, particularly in high-grade lesions. Adequate surgery is the mainstay of treatment. High-grade and pelvic chondrosarcomas are best managed with wide resection. Because of the low metastatic potential and low local recurrence rate noted with intralesional surgery, low-grade chondrosarcomas can be treated with curettage (with or without treatment of the defect cavity) with a local adjuvant, such as phenol or cryotherapy.

They are unique {{in their ability}} to frequently arise in the soft tissues in addition to the common skeletal sites of other bone tumors. Histologically, mesenchymal chondrosarcomas are characterized by a mix of cartilage and undifferentiated stromal tissue. Radiographically, they demonstrate features similar to the more commonly encountered conventional chondrosarcoma, with the tumor location and patient age helping to suggest the correct diagnosis. We present a case of <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> presenting as chronic sinusitis, arising in the sinonasal cavity. Additionally, a discussion of the imaging features and a brief review of the literature surrounding this uncommon neoplasm are included...|$|E

Extraskeletal <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> is rare and metastasis to the pancreas is extremely rare, with only four cases reported in the literature. The therapeutic effectiveness of chemotherapy remains uncertain. We report a 39 -year-old man with extraskeletal <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> of the buttock, who had metastases to the pancreas, bones, and lung. He underwent distal pancreatectomy, resection of the buttock tumor, and chemotherapy. He had a good response to chemotherapy and survived for about 3 years after surgery. 1...|$|E
40|$|Extraskeletal <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> (EMC) is a {{rare and}} a {{malignant}} chondrogenic neoplasm. As a particularity of this neoplasm, {{about one-third of the}} cases develop outside the bone, with intramuscular site being a very rare location for development of EMC. The diagnosis of <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> can be very challenging, especially in cases without conspicuous cartilaginous differentiation. In such cases its distinction from other small cell mesenchymal neoplasms cannot be safely established. This, however, is of major clinical interest as it implicates different treatment protocols as well as a different prognosis. We hereby present a case of EMC at a unusual location in a 23 -year-old female with the purpose to highlight its morphologic features and to discuss its differential diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> of {{the head}} and neck is unusual, ranging from 5 to 12 % of all cases. In the jaws, it has a predilection for {{anterior}} portion of the maxilla and sinonasal structures. 1, 2 Mandibular lesions occur predomi-nantly in the symphysis, coronoid, and condylar processes due to endochondral ossification of these regions. 3, 4 Wide surgical excision is the preferred treatment. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy generally have no advantage during the course of treatment. 2, 5 Various imaging modalities such as plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone scan are useful for the diagnosis of this disease. 6 An online literature review of MEDLINE from (1970 - 2011) revealed that ultrasonographic findings of mandibu-lar <b>mesenchymal</b> <b>chondrosarcoma</b> have not previously been reported. Therefore, we report this case, with emphasis on the significant ultrasound features associated with the tumor. Case Report A 24 -year-old man in a poor socio-economic condition was referred to the Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Depar-tment at Shiraz Dental School for further evaluation. He complained of a huge painless swelling in the left lower third of his face that had been present for 3 months. Clin-ical examination showed severe limitation of mouth open-ing less than 1 cm (Fig. 1).
