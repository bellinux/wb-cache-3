It studies the trends, patterns and locational determinants of Indian overseas acquisitions. Hitherto largely preoccupied with greenfield OFDI since the early 1960 s, this study shows that Indian multinationals have increasingly started adopting acquisition as a global growth strategy to serve a variety of their firm‐specific objectives like accessing new markets, foreign strategic assets, and trade‐supporting infrastructure. As part of the locational analysis, a set of factors such as host country <b>market,</b> <b>skill</b> endowment and import intensity from India, came out to be important cross‐country pull factors for Indian overseas acquisitions. ...|$|E

Specifically, we account for the pattern of changes in wage inequality, for the increased relative wage and employment of women, for the emergence of the college wage premium and for the shift in employment from the goods to the service-producing sector. The underlying theory we adopt is neoclassical, a two-sector competitive labor market economy in which the supply of and demand for labor of heterogeneous skill determines spot <b>market</b> <b>skill</b> rental prices. The empirical approach is structural. The model embeds many of the features that have been posited in the literature to have contributed to the changing US wage and employment structure including skill-biased technical change, capital-skill complementarity, changes in relative product-market prices, changes in the productivity of labor in home production and demographics such as changing cohort size and fertility.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with how MNCs (multinational corporations) differ from indigenous organisations {{in relation to their}} human resource development (HRD) practices, and whether this relationship changes across countries. We question whether local isomorphism is apparent in the HRD practices of MNCs, or whether MNCs share more in common with their counterparts in other countries. A series of hypotheses are put forward and tested, using survey data from 424 multinational and 259 indigenous organisations based in the UK and Ireland. The results suggest a hybrid form of localisation, where MNCs adapt their practices to accommodate national differences, but that these adaptations do not reflect convergence to domestic practice. The results also indicate that MNCs are selective in the HRD practices that are adapted. Evidence from this study indicates that country differences in career traditions and labour <b>market</b> <b>skill</b> needs are key drivers in the localisation of associated HRD practice. In contrast, MNCs, irrespective of national context, adopt comparable systematic training frameworks, ie training-need identification, evaluation and delivery...|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} on labour <b>market</b> <b>skill</b> shortages indicates that whether respondents report skill shortages or hard-to-fill vacancies {{do so for}} widely different reasons. Nevertheless, there is some consensus that skill shortages analysis needs to examine such shortages {{within the context of}} the local labour market in order to understand the labour market dynamics and structural factors that affect the propensity for unemployed people to fill ‘skill shortage’ vacancies. The traditional approach has been to utilise qualitative analysis and case studies. This paper undertakes a multivariate logit analysis of employer perceptions of skill shortages utilising a sub-regional data set from a survey of Dorset employers undertaken in 1998. On a general level, the paper demonstrates the complexity involved in attempting to measure skill problems using the responses of employers to standard surveys. More specifically the results of the logit analysis find, amongst other findings, that: firm size is a significant determinant in skill deficiency perception, that growing firms have a higher skill shortage perception and that it is important to include respondent characteristics when analysing employer perceptions of skill deficiencies...|$|E

Emerging technologies and emerging markets present both unique challenges and tremendous opportunities for those firms and individuals who focus their search for competitive advantage on them. Here, we provide examples of effective commercial pathways for both intra- and entrepreneurial ventures embracing these phenomena. First, we describe how one intrapreneurial large firm is investigating emerging markets such as India and China (emerging economies) with emerging technologies to create a worldwide business solution power. Then the investigation of an emerging technology is provided, that of nanotechnology, by a small entrepreneurial firm utilizing emerging <b>market</b> <b>skill</b> sets to define and enable worldwide business solutions. Interestingly, both of the respective commercialization strategies are based on competency theory albeit, used differently.

Furthermore, voluntary turnover incurs considerable expense {{as it is a}} labour intense service industry. This paper presents findings from data analysis of formal exit interviews conducted in two hotel chains. The first sample covers a large New Zealand hotel chain with 15 sites, with interviews conducted in 2004 and 2005. The quantitative data for this brand was collected nationally at multiple sites and is further illuminated by qualitative data focusing on a single site case study. The second set of interviews represents a single site, with data gathered from 2001 to 2005. The literature review discusses the theoretical foundations of employee turnover and exit interview efficacy. Particular focus is placed on the antecedents of turnover in the organisational entry phase of the employment relationship, with questions being raised around the importance of socialisation. In an industry that has traditionally high employee turnover, the efficacy of exit interviews in providing feedback on organisational entry is of crucial importance. Our findings raise questions regarding the effectiveness of information provided by the exit interview processe...|$|E
40|$|In Germany, {{the skill}} {{structure}} of wages remained stable {{in the last}} two decades while employment of the low skilled deteriorated considerably relative to employment of the high skilled. This paper analyses the impact of technical progress on the skill structure of employment and wages by means of an insider-outsider-variant of a right-to-manage model. While wages of high skilled employees is determined on a competitive labor market, wages for all other skill groups are subject to a Nash bargaining between unions and the firms. The econometric evidence presented is based on West German manufacturing data at the one-digit level. A semi-structural model is estimated which is sufficiently flexible to be regarded as a second order approximation of a general union preference function. The approach enables us to identify the indirect effects of technical progress on employment resulting from the bargaining process. These indirect effects prove to be quantitatively important. In some industries job losses due to technical progress for the low skilled relative to the high skilled are generated through counter acting wage policies. The findings support the view that insider-outsider mechanisms are operating on the German labor <b>market.</b> <b>Skill</b> structure, technological progress, flexible functional form...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} by welfare researchers that the welfare caseload is quite diverse. Many studies of the now-defunct Aid to Families with Depen-dent Children (AFDC) program demonstrated that some women on the welfare rolls were much worse off than women not on the rolls in terms of family back-ground, educational attainment, labor market experience and skill, health prob-lems, and many other indicators, and that different women might need different types of special assistance. This heterogeneity has assumed even greater impor-tance in the welfare reform environment of the 1990 s. The new reforms are, generally speaking, aimed at raising employment levels and promoting work, particularly off the welfare rolls. It is naturally to be expected that women with greater capabilities to respond to these policies will fare better than women with lesser capabilities. 1 In addition, from the program operator’s viewpoint, hetero-geneity {{is important because it}} implies that policies might be differentially tar-geted, or tailored, to different types of welfare recipients who have different needs and capabilities.

40|$|Racial {{inequality}} {{remains a}} substantial problem in American society. Competing explanations of African American - white inequality often overlap {{but they are}} often also quite contentious. Recent empirical studies {{on the role of}} race and labor have tended to absolve the market process of contributing to persistent racial discrimination. The most sophisticated studies that claim to show no discrimination within the labor market rely on a single test score variable (the AFQT) within one dataset. However, the AFQT over-estimates African American - white pre-labor <b>market</b> <b>skill</b> differences, its predictions have not been replicated by studies that employ different measures of cognitive skills, and it yields inconsistent and counter-intuitive results when decomposed into its component parts. After reviewing some of the most recent literature, this study concludes that the notion that competition will eliminate discrimination within the labor market is little more than conservative political ideology masquerading as science. So-called pre-labor market inequality, which may also be summarized as the class and cultural background of individuals, does have an impact on individual well-being and intergenerational mobility. However, we are unable to distinguish the manner in which class background matters. Is it because superior class position creates an advantage in skill acquisition or because is it because superior social status increases access to persons embedded into positions of power and authority? In addition, several studies present strong empirical evidence of discrimination within the labor market. Race, Discrimination, Wage, Inequality, Labor Market,...|$|E
40|$|Skills are {{regarded}} an important growth driver in knowledge based globalised economy. In {{most of the}} developed nations and fast growing economies have very high proportion of skilled work force, while the skill levels among the Indian work force is abysmally low and probably among {{the lowest in the}} world. One {{of the reasons for the}} low skill trained manpower is terribly low institutional training capacity and the vocational education and training systems as being too supply driven and far-removed from market demand. India has distinct advantage of young age-population with declining dependency ratio which is termed as ‘population dividend ’ while the industrialized nations have ageing population with rising dependency ratio. This precisely gives India an advantage with huge competitive edge internationally. While industrialized nations will be facing acute shortage of skills with increasing dependency ratio, India can harness this huge potential if skill development initiatives fructifies in right direction which will then be in real sense a ‘population dividend’. If this opportunity is missed then it may well turn in to ‘demographic nightmare’ The paper aims at examining the skill issues in the context of globalization and seeks to scrutinize how the skilling efforts have moved on to central stage in order to reap the benefits.

Studies on {{transition}} {{from school to}} work, have highlight the importance of two categories of factors {{at the level of}} the individual formal proceedings which may affect how easy it is to graduate to integrate into the labor market: 1) so far as the educational systems are transmitting specific competences as compared with those general and 2) so far as there are direct links between employers and the education system. In this way, are reduced the costs of selection and allocation for employers. A poor articulation between educational institutions and the labor market produce a high level of unmatched competences of assimilated by formal education and competencies required of the labor <b>market</b> (<b>skill</b> mismatch) (Parodi et al., 2012). The surveys with European employers reflect particular difficulties that they are experiencing in employment vacancies. Investigation on the European companies in the spring of 2013 found that 40 % of the firms in the EU have difficulty in finding employees with suitable qualification (CEDEFOP-European Center for the Development of the Vocational Training, 2014). Skills mismatch is a generic term that refers to various types of imbalances between skills and competences offered and those required in the labor market. Concept has become one intensely discussed and submitted to measurement in international research on the background concerns the under-utilization human resource. Numerous opinion polls with employers come to the same unexpected conclusion - that despite high unemployment many posts can't find occupants satisfactorily prepared and identify the causes: most of them criticized the lack of skills of the candidates or the absence of skills specific to the workplace. Based on the latest studies on international databases have built a set of questions that, through secondary analysis, we tried to find answers. Questions that we try to give answer are: What are the main types of skills mismatch? What are the main ways to measure skills mismatch? What are the indicators of skills mismatch?

40|$|The Council of the European Union (CEU) is {{interested}} in enhancing cohesion among all member states {{through the development of}} inter-state, inter-group and inter-individual relationships. Through a series of specific initiatives, the goal is to contribute to the successful implementation of inclusive strategies and underline the importance of achieving sustainable and inclusive growth (Watkins, 2007). This originates from the CEU’s belief that education and training play a fundamental role in achieving cooperative objectives as it equips citizens with the skills and competencies needed by society to promote social and trans-national cohesion. In order to improve social and individual competencies for the 21 st Century and considering the formative process as a complex reality influenced by cultural, individual and socio-economic factors, the European policy is involved in three different types of intervention (EComm, 2008; ECoun, 2006). The first type of intervention is aimed at scholastic drop out and the necessity of improving access to higher education. Essentially the goal is to create pro-active and compensatory measures to prevent discrimination and inequality (Collins, Kenway, McLeod, 2000; Duru-Bellat, 2004; Ellenbogen, Chamberland, 1997; Ross, 2007). Related to this goal, the second objective involves promoting the mobility of young people in order to give them the possibility of constructing their own life project. In this sense, the Youth on the Move initiative is directed towards helping young people achieve their full education and training potential, thereby improving their employment prospects (EComm, 2004 a, 2004 b; ECou, 2005). Educational Institutions need to improve the quality and relevance of the courses they offer and to encourage citizens {{from all walks of life}} to enroll in formal and non-formal higher education courses(Scheerens, 2007). Given the relationship between education and economic growth (De la Fuente, 2006), the latter objective concerns the recognition that the training available must be relevant to the needs of the workforce and must also facilitate the individuals’ access to lifelong learning opportunities and guidance (EComm, 2003, 2006 b; Brunello, Checchi, 2007; Hanushek, Kimko, 2000; Kleiner et al. 2005). This means that education and training programs must respond quickly to new trends in order to better meet the skill needs of the labor market and the social and cultural challenges of a globalized world. In order to strengthen the ability to anticipate and match labor <b>market</b> <b>skill</b> needs, the CEU is geared towards improving access to lifelong learning, in particular for disadvantaged groups. The strategies adopted in pursuit of these three objectives means that Member States of the EU must engage in horizontal cooperation and share experience and best practices...|$|E
40|$|This {{series of}} essays studies the {{observed}} {{fluctuations in the}} aggregate economy and the factors behind. I first examine the cyclical behaviors of the aggregate productivity shocks, {{as measured by the}} aggregate Solow residual and how it relates to the technology adoption decision done by individual firms. Then I divert my attention to the labor market, and enquire into (i) why workers with different skills show such significant differences as observed in the U. S. in terms of their unemployment rates and wages; and (ii) what the so-called labor wedge might reflect. The first chapter of my dissertation formalizes Schumpeter's idea that the firm level technological changes are what cause changes in the aggregate Solow residual. The analysis starts with a characterization about how new firms make their technology adoption decision, taking into account both the average productivity of the candidate technology and the risk associated with its adoption. Then through the creative destruction process, these newly adopted technologies gradually prevail in the market, and eventually manifest themselves in the aggregate Solow residual. The quantitative experiments confirm that the Schumpeterian story told in this chapter is able to amplify the traditional aggregate productivity shock, as well as to transform other shocks to the economy into variations in the Solow residual, and thus generating significant business cycle fluctuations. The model also has a few reasonable firm-level implications. The second chapter develops a framework {{for the study of the}} labor market dynamics when workers differ in their production efficiency, which I call skills in the chapter, and when there are search frictions. Compared to the standard business cycle model with frictional labor <b>market,</b> <b>skill</b> heterogeneity in my model creates dispersion in the match surpluses between the workers and the firms, and thus necessitates a screening process that results in the termination of the unprofitable matches in equilibrium. This endogenous separation mechanism disproportionately influences the employment status of the less-skilled workers and not only exposes them to larger layoff risks, but also inflicts on them greater difficulties in terms of reestablishing their employment relationship with the firms. Quantitatively, the model has cross-sectional implications for the unemployment rates and the wages that are consistent with the observed differences across skill groups in the U. S. labor market. The last chapter carefully studies the hypothesis that the empirical labor wedge as defined by Robert Shimer may reflect the existence of a household production sector that is largely uncounted by the standard macroeconomic framework. By enriching an otherwise standard real business cycle model with a household production sector, I find that if the hours worked at home and the utility obtained from the home-produced goods are not included in the calculation, the model generates a wedge between the marginal product of labor (MPL) and the household's marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure (MRS) that assembles the empirical labor wedge. With reasonable parameter values, the quantitative properties of the model-predicted labor wedge also match those of their empirical counterpart...|$|E
