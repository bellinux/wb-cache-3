5|$|Coolsma {{returned}} to the Netherlands {{with his wife in}} 1876 and became the leader of the NZV, holding the office until 1908. He disputed the idea that <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> should be focused on the non-Islamicised eastern portion of the colony. He believed instead that <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> should be prioritsed in the western portion, where Islam had already become entrenched.|$|E

5|$|A {{primary reason}} the General Council {{was formed in}} 1914 was to create {{cooperation}} in Pentecostal <b>missionary</b> <b>work.</b> Missions have remained a central focus of the denomination since that time. In 2009, there were Assemblies of God churches in 213 countries and territories around the world. <b>Missionary</b> <b>work</b> outside of the United States is overseen by Assemblies of God World Missions. As of December 2009, AG World Missions was reporting 2,719 personnel worldwide. The agency also provides medical evangelism through HealthCare Ministries, founded in 1983 as the Medical Missions Program. This ministry provides free optical, dental, and medical care as well as evangelism. It has operated in 86 countries since its founding.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Cleveland's father {{moved to}} Clinton, Oneida County, New York, {{to work as}} {{district}} secretary for the American Home Missionary Society. Despite his father's dedication to his <b>missionary</b> <b>work,</b> the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling {{at the completion of}} the apprentice contract. In 1853, when <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again. Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.|$|E

5|$|The Jarls Eirik and Svein proved strong, {{competent}} rulers, {{and their}} reign was prosperous. Most {{sources say that}} they adopted Christianity but allowed the people religious freedom, leading to a backlash against Christianity which undid much of Olaf Tryggvason's <b>missionary</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|As well as visiting Kilimanjaro, Rebmann and Krapf visited {{other areas}} of Africa, {{including}} the African Great Lakes and Mount Meru. He even became married to a fellow missionary, Anna Maria, née Maisch, with whom he spent fifteen years doing <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> in Africa before her death in 1866, and {{with whom he had}} a child (who died only days after his birth).|$|E

5|$|The priests {{began their}} <b>missionary</b> <b>work,</b> but {{encountered}} suspicion from most chiefs. The {{members of the}} party had great difficulty defending themselves, as {{none of them was}} fluent in English or Hawaiian. But, the group were favorably received by the high chief Boki, the royal governor of Oahu, and his wife Kuini Liliha. (The couple were Catholic converts and rivals of Queen Kaʻahumanu.) Boki welcomed the party and gave its members permission to stay.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Hawaii, Bush {{settled on the}} island of Kauai. In 1880, he was listed as the tax collector of Kawaihau, Kauai. In 1882, his older brother in his capacity as Minister of Interior appointed him Road Supervisor for the District of Hanalei to replace Christian Bertlemann, who had resigned. In 1887, Bush converted to Mormonism and was ordained an elder after two years; he took an active part in <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> in the islands. He became the bishop of the Latter-day Saints ward in Kealia and hosted LDS historian Andrew Jenson during his 1895 visit to Kauai. In around 1894, Bush married a young girl at Lahaina, traveling to Kona after their marriage.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the narrator}} {{explains}} the effect of the <b>missionaries</b> <b>work,</b> saying, [...] "the strongest message received may be the technology itself. An emblem of wealthy machine culture and its power. To convert is to be joined to this power." ...|$|R
5|$|Coolsma {{continued}} {{to write about}} both <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> and the Sundanese language. In 1881, he wrote a series of condemnatory reviews of Sundanese-language schoolbooks offered by the colonial government, arguing that the content had little value and the language was mostly artificial. He published a Sundanese-Dutch dictionary in 1884, consulting various works of Sundanese literature for his lexemes. In 1901, he published {{a history of the}} mission in the East Indies, titled De zendingseeuw voor Nederlandsche Oost-Indiës (The Century of the Mission in the Dutch East Indies). It described the 19th century as time of extensive growth.|$|E
5|$|Due to Calvin's <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> in France, his {{programme}} {{of reform}} eventually reached the French-speaking provinces of the Netherlands. Calvinism was {{adopted in the}} Electorate of the Palatinate under Frederick III, {{which led to the}} formulation of the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563. This and the Belgic Confession were adopted as confessional standards in the first synod of the Dutch Reformed Church in 1571. Several leading divines, either Calvinist or those sympathetic to Calvinism, settled in England (Martin Bucer, Peter Martyr, and Jan Laski) and Scotland (John Knox). During the English Civil War, the Calvinistic Puritans produced the Westminster Confession, which became the confessional standard for Presbyterians in the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|Monson {{initiated}} French-speaking proselytizing {{efforts in}} Quebec. He directed increased <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> to {{immigrants from the}} Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS general authority, was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of migrating to Utah or Alberta as many members had done before, to help build the church's presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of permanence, and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} Catholic <b>missionaries</b> <b>worked</b> in Almaliq in the 14th century as well, {{including}} Giovanni de' Marignolli. Like him, many European travellers in medieval China stopped there {{on their way}} coming or going. The city was typically known as [...] "Armalec" [...] in their accounts.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1820s {{large numbers}} of <b>missionaries</b> <b>worked</b> in the islands, {{converting}} many groups to Christianity.

War and slavery disappeared." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carlo Braga (23 May 1889 - 3 January 1971) was a professed {{priest of}} the Salesians of Don Bosco and known as [...] "the Little Don Bosco of China" [...] for his <b>missionary</b> <b>works</b> towards the {{children}} in China. He died in the Makati, Philippines in 1971.|$|R
5|$|The arts of {{manuscript}} illumination, metalworking {{and sculpture}} flourished and produced treasures {{such as the}} Book of Kells, ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> that spread Celtic Christianity and learning to Scotland, England and the Frankish Empire on Continental Europe {{after the fall of}} Rome. These missions continued until the late Middle Ages, establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting much influence in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The present {{town was}} {{established}} in 1764 by the General Trade Company as the trading post of Holsteinsborg ("Fort Holstein"), named for the first chairman of the Danish College of Missions in Copenhagen which underwrote and directed the <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> in the colony. At {{the time of its}} founding, the Kalaallisut name of the place was Amerlok, after its fjord. The colonists formally established several villages in the region, of which only two remain to this day: Itilleq and Sarfannguit. Under the Royal Greenland Trading Department, Holsteinsborg was a center of the trade in reindeer skins.|$|E
5|$|The {{support of}} <b>missionary</b> <b>work</b> {{was also a}} {{priority}} in the 19th century. The first General Assembly requested {{that each of the}} four synods appoint and support two missionaries. Presbyterians took leading roles in creating early local and independent mission societies, including the New York Missionary Society (1796), the Northern Berkshire and Columbia Missionary Societies (1797), the Missionary Society of Connecticut (1798), the Massachusetts Missionary Society (1799), and the Boston Female Society for Missionary Purposes (1800). The first denominational missions agency was the Standing Committee on Mission, which was created in 1802 to coordinate efforts with individual presbyteries and the European missionary societies. The work of the committee was expanded in 1816, becoming the Board of Missions.|$|E
