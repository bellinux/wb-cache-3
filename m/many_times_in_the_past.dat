5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{continuing}} the Amiens battle {{past the point}} of initial success, as had been done so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.|$|E
500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E

500|$|In the quarter-finals Lee {{defeated}} O'Sullivan 5–4 in a {{match that}} lasted 3 hours and 32 minutes. O'Sullivan came from 2–3 down to lead 4–3 before Lee leveled the match. In the final frame O'Sullivan led 36–0, before Lee made a 46 break and fluked a snooker that {{enabled him to}} claim victory. O'Sullivan said his performance was very poor, while Lee said he was quietly confident. White defeated Robertson 5–3 to reach his third semi-final of the season. White led 4–1 and was 56 points ahead in the sixth but missed a straightforward green, allowing Robertson to win on the black with a 67 break. Robertson took the next frame before a risky long pot in the eighth allowed White to win the match. White—who last won a ranking title 12 years ago prior at this event—said, [...] "Everyone knows I've been in front so <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and tossed it away so I was having nightmares out there". Drago quickly won the first four frames of his match against Hann, conceding the fifth, before completing a 5–1 victory, after which he said the crowd support helped him. Maguire caused an upset when he beat Higgins 5–3, a match that saw Maguire lose the first two frames before winning the next four. After the match Maguire {{he said he had}} [...] "starting to think about winning it now".|$|E
500|$|Jordan meets Heer's younger sister, Mandy (Sanjana Sanghi), {{during one}} of his performances, and she asks him to help Heer - who has been {{diagnosed}} with Aplastic Anemia. Although he is initially asked to leave by Heer's mother Neena (Shernaz Patel), Jordan's presence causes Heer to recover somewhat. He starts disregarding his musical obligations as he spends more time with Heer, and soon Khatana asks Heer to persuade Jordan to attend his concerts. Heer accompanies him to a show, and the media links them as a couple, portraying her as having an affair despite being married. Heer asks Jordan to complete his tour and reunite with her once again. After JJ finishes his performances, both will have some intimate time. During this time, her condition worsens. She slowly slips into a coma and is discovered by their doctor to be pregnant; Neena and Mandy guess it is because of Jordan. Mandy calls him and tells that Heer is pregnant but has gone into a coma. Jordon leaves another show right in the middle as he has done <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and reaches ICU. He tries to wake her up by saying his usual funny dialogues when they meet; however, Jordan realizes that she will not survive, because she does not respond to any of his words nor emotional touches and kisses. Heer died or not it was not confirmed ...|$|E
