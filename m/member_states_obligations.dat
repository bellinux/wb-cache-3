To review tobacco challenges, regulations and policies in the EAEU and it's Member States {{in the light of}} <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>obligations</b> on WHO FCTC. Material and Methods Scoping review based on search and analysis of available official publications of the EAEU and it's Member States, WHO sources, research papers, media and industry sources. Results The EAEU development and functioning which started in 2015, includes technical regulations on Tobacco Products and tax policy principles. The EAEU is not a party to the WHO FCTC. In the EAEU there is no parliament and public health is not included in the areas of activities of Eurasian Economic Commission. Regulatory impact assessment is concerned mostly with business interests. There are numerous examples of tobacco industry interference, especially in relation to taxation of tobacco products, so that WHO FCTC compliance by the EAEU Member States might be compromised, with subregional, regional and global repercussions. Conclusions Differences between tobacco regulations and policies in the EAEU, EU and other supranational organizations should be further researched in order to promote exchange of best practices in WHO FCTC comprehensive compliance. Implementation of WHO FCTC Article 5. 3. and involvement of civil society are among priorities. The practical prospects for the supranational EAEU to become a party to the WHO FCTC should be considered in detail...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>obligations</b> to facilitate a stable internal electricity market investment climate {{on the one hand}} and rights to intervene in investment decisions by launching a tender procedure on the other hand. The author argues that, although responsibility for investments in new electricity generation capacity is at the outset left to market participants based on electricity market price signals, public intervention mechanisms still have a part to play in promoting desired investments. <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>obligations</b> to facilitate a stable investment climate are not necessarily sufficient to ensure security of supply. Given the complexity of the market evaluations to be made and the fundamental interests involved in securing <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> electricity supplies, it is argued that Community institutions should practice some degree of self-restraint in their review of whether a tendering procedure is necessary in the security of supply interest. Furthermore, it is submitted that <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> rights to rely on demand-side tenders and tenders in the environmental interest may contribute to realize the overall EU energy policy priorities of environmental protection and security of supply...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the system of enforcement of <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>obligations</b> in the European Union (EU). It will focus upon the final limb of the enforcement system, the financial sanctions, and will evaluate its evolution since the initial judgment against Greece in 2000. The discussion will centre upon the behaviour of the two key institutions in the enforcement process, the Commission and the Court of Justice, by analysing the practice and policy of these institutions. It will argue that the Commission and Court have had to devise an enforcement policy in a unique regulatory system, which is a regulatory system where the legislator has provided no guidance to the institutions responsible for the execution of enforcement policy as to its objectives or methodology. This regulatory gap has produced some interesting inter-institutional dialogue between the Court and Commission that has not occurred in the earlier phase of the enforcement process, despite a similar lack of legislative guidance. The inter-institutional dialogue has increased the transparency and efficiency of imposing financial sanctions, which has moulded it into a potentially significant deterrent to non-compliance. Deploying this approach in the earlier phase of the enforcement process could significantly increase the transparency and efficiency of the macro system of enforcement...|$|R

The thesis consists of two major parts. Part One describes the European law system {{from the point of view}} of its effects on a national law; the direct effect as well as the obligation to implement the EU law into national legal acts are considered. Part Two is divided into six chapters; each chapter deals with a different aspect of Czech obligation to implement and apply the EU law. Czech government is the main legislative initiator and has developed detailed rules for preparing government bills. However, the praxis is far from ideal. Both chambers of Czech Parliament are affected by serious lack of interest in the process of implementation. The Constitutional court provides a constantly growing judicature of open-minded interpretation of the national law with respect to the EU law. On the other hand, it shows a surprising reluctance to refer for a preliminary ruling at the Court of Justice of the European Union.

The <b>Member</b> <b>State’s</b> European viability can be considered in terms of four complementary to each other spheres which can be referred to as relational areas: (a) domestic EU law and policies implementation area, in which the adequate recognition of acquis by relevant national authorities and bodies as well as its complete and effective implementation on the national ground is at stake, (b) cooperation-negotiation area, where the identification of national interests in the EU decision-making process, their substantiation and ultimate recasting into balanced mandates and persuasive negotiation argumentation later presented at the EU level should occur, (c) legitimization area, where positions presented by national administration in various EU decision-making gremia are given necessary political support by adequately identified domestic groups of significant interests and/or key national authorities elected by a broad suffrage (i. e. the parliament and, usually, regional and local self-governmental bodies), (d) litigation area, in which proper protection of national interests within the EU judicial system (i. e. through the Court of Justice or the Court of First Instance) is at stake, irrespective of whether the state appears as a plaintiff or a defendant, or an intervenient, in a given case under these European courts’ scrutiny...|$|R

A sustainability framework is outlined that aims at (1) facilitating the development of SRC production systems that are attractive from the perspectives of all stakeholders, and (2) ensuring that the SRC production is RED eligible. Producer manuals, EIAs, and voluntary certification schemes can all be useful for ensuring RED eligibility. However, they are currently not sufficiently comprehensive, neither individually nor combined, and suggestions for how they can be more complementary are given. Geographical information systems offer opportunities for administrative authorities to provide stakeholders with maps or databases over areas/fields suitable for RED-eligible SRC cultivation. However, proper consideration of all relevant aspects requires that all stakeholders in the SRC supply chain become engaged in the development of SRC production systems and that a landscape perspective is used...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the legal {{effects of a}} seemingly paradoxical situation: an international agreement falls within the exclusive competence of the European Union, and yet the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are {{parties to the agreement}} and the Union is not. This situation emphasises the importance of the role the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> continue to play within the framework of EU foreign policy, even in fields where the EU has apparently displaced the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> completely. It serves as a reminder that the EU, as an international actor, operates as a complex organization – a constitutional order – which continues to include the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The <b>members</b> of this constitutional order of states operate both in their own right as international actors, and as EU <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> with the <b>obligations</b> which flow from that status. While not common, the participation of the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in international agreements falling within exclusive Union competence is not as unusual as we might imagine and it gives rise to a number of interesting legal questions as to the status of the agreement, if any, in Union law and the Member States’ obligations under Union law arising as a consequence. The legal questions explored in the chapter arise out {{of the fact that the}} international agreements in the above examples are not formally a ‘Union agreement’ within the scope of Articles 216 and 218 TFEU and thus the matters regulated by those provisions, including the binding nature of the agreement as far as the Union is concerned, and its place in the Union legal order, are not expressly resolved. To what extent can the provisions of Articles 216 and 218 TFEU apply by analogy?

This obligation arises from customary principles that govern States’ international responsibilities and set out the consequences, for third States, of serious breaches of peremptory norms of international law. We will first describe how the Israeli government’s settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territory implies serious and systematic breaches of obligations that stem from fundamental norms of international law (I). Breaches of international law by Israel imply legal consequences for third <b>States,</b> namely the <b>obligations</b> to “ensure respect” for international law, “to not recognise” an illegal situation arising from such breaches, and to not render “aid or assistance” to maintaining the situation (II). The EU and its <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are, therefore, under the obligation to cease all economic relations with Israeli entities which could contribute to maintaining the illegal situation arising from settlements, including the importation of goods. (III). The modalities {{for the application of}} the obligation to prohibit, in the EU, the trade of goods from Israeli settlements will be analysed, and in particular, with respect to EU and WTO law (IV).
