Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>exceeded,</b> while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded. In Trondheim in Norway, the Trampe bicycle lift has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many cities have bicycle carriers mounted on the front.|$|E

The Occupational Safety Act (1973) required employers to provide company doctors and safety experts. A directive on protection against noise at the place of work was adopted in November 1970. If measurements showed or there was reason to assume that a noise level guide value of 90dB( [...] A) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>exceeded</b> at the place of work, then the authority had to instruct the employer to arrange check-ups of the employees concerned and these employees had to use personal noise protection devices.

50|$|The {{air quality}} {{readings}} published for particulate matter (PM10) are 24-hour averages, {{as required by}} the Planning Minister's Conditions of Approval for the tunnel.

50|$|Some devices, {{including}} uninterruptible {{power supplies}} (UPSs), have ratings both for maximum volt-amperes and maximum watts.
