Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their <b>members,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
