40|$|Cold CO 2 gas {{emission}} sites in rainwater-filled pools, so called <b>mofettes,</b> are widely distributed all over Italy. Their gas reservoirs, mostly having a high CO 2 content, have a magmatic and/or metamorphic origin. Temporal variations in fluid expulsions were observed at the <b>mofettes</b> of Caprese Michelangelo {{during the period}} from 2002 to 2005. These observations were made possible by using a new approach: photographic time-series. A first interpretation of these fluid expulsionswas based on meteorological/hydrogeological explanations. However, our long-term observations show that these processes may merely be a side effect. The probable main reason for the anomalous emissions is the long-term variation in the long-distance fluid transport process from the reservoir induced by the local tectonic settings. In {{the northern part of the}} Alto Tiberina Fault, a fault intersection was reactivated by a seismic sequence which started on 2001 November 26, and continued for approximately four months. The magnitude of the main shock was MW = 4. 6. As revealed by the drilling of a deep borehole, dug in the direct vicinity, overpressurized fluids trapped at a depth of 3700 m could be activated as a consequence of the improved transport conditions, that is, the fracture apertures that materialized as a result of the rupture process. A migration of the hypocentres towards the surface provides hints of a possible pore pressure diffusion process. The consequence is an increased fluid transport to the <b>mofettes.</b> The first indications of anomalous fluid expulsions at the <b>mofettes</b> of Caprese Michelangelo were detected 18 months after the seismic events...|$|R

40|$|The Cheb Basin (NW Bohemia, Czech Republic) is a shallow, neogene intracontinental basin. It is a non-volcanic region which {{features}} frequent earthquake swarms and large-scale diffuse degassing of mantle-derived CO 2 {{at the surface}} that occurs {{in the form of}} CO 2 -rich mineral springs and wet and dry <b>mofettes.</b> So far, the influence of CO 2 degassing onto the microbial communities has been studied for soil environments, but not for aquatic systems. We hypothesized, that deep-trenching CO 2 conduits interconnect the subsurface with the surface. This admixture of deep thermal fluids should be reflected in geochemical parameters and in the microbial community compositions. In the present study four mineral water springs and two wet <b>mofettes</b> were investigated through an interdisciplinary survey. The waters were acidic and differed in terms of organic carbon and anion/cation concentrations. Element geochemical and isotope analyses of fluid components were used to verify the origin of the fluids. Prokaryotic communities were characterized through quantitative PCR and Illumina 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Putative chemolithotrophic, anaerobic and microaerophilic organisms connected to sulfur (e. g., Sulfuricurvum, Sulfurimonas) and iron (e. g., Gallionella, Sideroxydans) cycling shaped the core community. Additionally, CO 2 -influenced waters form an ecosystem containing many taxa that are usually found in marine or terrestrial subsurface ecosystems. Multivariate statistics highlighted the influence of environmental parameters such as pH, Fe 2 + concentration and conductivity on species distribution.

At the surface, the <b>mofettes</b> changed their morphological features macroscopically due to this enhanced gas dynamic. The phenomenological observation of post-seismic fluid expulsion 18 months after the seismic crisis suggests the interpretation of a long-term fluid transport process forced by pressure pulse propagation.

40|$|In {{the region}} of Scuol-Tarasp in the Lower Engadine Valley in the Eastern Swiss Alps, {{there are a variety}} of {{phenomena}} related to a geogenetic CO 2 production, including carbogaseous mineral springs, previously active coldwater geysers and dry gas exhalations from the ground via <b>mofettes.</b> Previous isotopic studies revealed that the CO 2 originates from the metamorphic decomposition of carbonate rocks in the crust. This paper presents an inventory of the springs, geysers and <b>mofettes,</b> and proposes a conceptual model on the regional gas and water circulation. Based on hydrochemical criteria, it was possible to identify six main groups of spring waters, three of which are carbogaseous mineral springs. Most of the carbogaseous springs and gas exhalations are bound to the Bündnerschiefer fractured aquifer. The different water types originate from mixing of groundwater and highly mineralised carbogaseous fluids from depth. Near-surface degassing of CO 2 from the fluid phase creates the dry gas exhalations. CO 2 and radon measurements in 178 soil boreholes suggest that the gas exhalations occur at a limited number of point-like anomalies, and there is no evidence for regionally important diffuse CO 2 discharges from the ground...|$|R
40|$|There is {{only limited}} {{understanding}} {{of the impact of}} high p(CO 2) on soil biomes. We have studied a floodplain wetland where long-term emanations of temperate volcanic CO 2 (mofettes) are associated with accumulation of carbon from the Earth’s mantle. With an integrated approach using isotope geochemistry, soil activity measurements and multi-omics analyses, we demonstrate that high (nearly pure) CO 2 concentrations have strongly affected pathways of carbon production and decomposition and therefore carbon turnover. In particular, a promotion of dark CO 2 fixation significantly increased the input of geogenic carbon in the <b>mofette</b> when compared to a reference wetland soil exposed to normal levels of CO 2. Radiocarbon analysis revealed that high quantities of <b>mofette</b> soil carbon originated from the assimilation of geogenic CO 2 (up to 67 %) via plant primary production and subsurface CO 2 fixation. However, the preservation and accumulation of almost undegraded organic material appeared to be facilitated by the permanent exclusion of meso- to macroscopic eukaryotes and associated physical and/or ecological traits rather than an impaired biochemical potential for soil organic matter decomposition.

We elaborated bathymetric 3 D models of these spring areas, marked degassing locations in a plan view, and evaluated the gas flx according to a subjective, visual fie-level scale. We also measured physicochemical parameters of the water. The observed phenomena were classifid among mofettes and mineral waters.

40|$|Microbial {{life in the}} {{continental}} deep biosphere is closely linked to geodynamic processes, yet this interaction is poorly studied. The Cheb Basin in the western Eger Rift (Czech Republic) is an ideal place for such a study because it displays almost permanent seismic activity along active faults with earthquake swarms up to M L   4. 5 and intense degassing of mantle-derived CO 2 in conduits that {{show up at the}} surface in form of mofettes. We hypothesize that microbial life is significantly accelerated in active fault zones and in CO 2 conduits, due to increased fluid and substrate flow. To test this hypothesis, pilot hole HJB- 1 was drilled in spring 2016 at the major <b>mofette</b> of the Hartoušov <b>mofette</b> field, after extensive pre-drill surveys to optimize the well location.

40|$|If geogenous CO 2 {{escaping}} from dry mofettes influences the temperature regime within {{and in the}} close vicinity of the vents, plants growing around the vents should be influenced. A probable temperature effect could result in (1) different stomatal behaviour which could affect transpiration, in (2) different photosynthetic efficieny and growth or (3) in pigment content and composition. Yet, plants growing in <b>mofette</b> fields are additionally affected by the direct effect of the elevated CO 2 on above- and below-ground plant parts. Acidification of organelles as well as probable hypoxia will be deleterious for a normal functioning of the plant`s metabolism. Three different grass species (Phleum pratense, Juncus effusus, and Echinochloa crus-galli) grown under a naturally elevated CO 2 regime in a <b>mofette</b> area in N-Slovenia were examined and the physiological behaviour studied. In all cases the grasses showed a clear correlation between the prevailing CO 2 regime and total plant height. Net photosynthesis measured at 2000 ppm (A 2000) and even more net photosynthesis measured at 350 ppm and 700 ppm CO 2 (A 350 and A 700) were higher in low-CO 2 -grown plants (0. 4 % CO 2 in the soil) than in plants that exhibited medium (3. 3 %) or high (26 %) soil CO 2 during germination and growth.

40|$|The {{region of}} West Bohemia/Vogtland in the Czech–German border area {{is well known}} for the {{repeated}} occurrence of earthquake swarms, CO 2 emanations and <b>mofette</b> fields. To deepen the understanding of these phenomena local earthquake tomography of the Vp and Vp/Vs structure and attenuation tomography are carried out in this study. In comparison with previous investigations the travel time tomography revealed more details of the near-surface geology, potential fluid pathways and features around and below the swarm focal zone. In the uppermost crust, {{for the first time the}} Cheb basin and the Bublák/Hartoušov <b>mofette</b> fields were imaged as distinct anomalies of Vp and Vp/Vs. The well-pronounced low-Vp anomaly of the Cheb basin is not continuing into the Eger rift indicating a particular role of the basin within the rift system. A steep channel of increased Vp/Vs is interpreted as the pathway for fluids ascending from the earthquake swarm focal zone up to the Bublák/Hartoušov <b>mofette</b> fields. As a new feature, a mid-crustal body of high Vp and increased Vp/Vs is revealed just below and north of the earthquake swarm focal zone. It may represent a solidified intrusive body which emplaced prior or during the formation of the rift system. The enhanced fluid flow into the focal zone and triggering of earthquakes could be driven by the presence of the intrusive body if cooling is not fully completed. The assumed intrusive structure is considered as a heterogeneity leading to higher stress particularly at the junction of the rift system with the basin and prominent fault structures. This may additionally contribute to the triggering of earthquakes. The three-dimensional (3 -D) P-wave attenuation (Qp) model for West Bohemia is the first of its kind. Path-averaged attenuation t * is calculated from amplitude spectra of time windows around the P-wave arrivals of local earthquakes. Average value or Qp for stations close to Nový Kostel are very low (< 150) compared to that of stations located further away from the focal zone (increases up to 500 within 80 km distance). The SIMUL 2000 tomography scheme is used to invert the t * for P-wave attenuation perturbation. Analysis of resolution shows that the model is wellresolved in the vicinity of earthquake swarm hypocenters. The prominent features of the model are located around Nový Kostel focal zone and its northern vicinity. Beneath Nový Kostel a vertically stretched (down to depth of 11 km) and a highly attenuating body is observed. This might be due to fracturing and high density of cracks inside the weak earthquake swarm zone in conjunction with presence of free gas/fluid. Further north of Nový Kostel two high attenuating body are located at depths between 2 to 8 km which can represents trapped laterally distributed fluids. The eastern anomaly shows a good correlation with the fluid accumulation area which was suggested in 9 HR seismic profile...|$|E

The relatively high abundance of arbuscules in root cortex indicated existence of functional symbiosis at much higher CO 2 concentrations than normally found in soils. In addition, concentration of two different glomalin-related soil protein fractions – EE-GRSP and TG-GRSP – was measured.

For several years, the gas flow regime of mineral springs at Bad Brambach (Germany) and mofettes in the Nature Park Soos (Czech Republic) and its dependence on hydro-/meteorological parameters have been studied. The mineral spring ‘Wettinquelle’, Bad Brambach, is a well-known seismo- hydrologically sensitive location for swarmquakes at a special epicentral area of NW Bohemia. Since 2000, a slight upward trend in the gas flow of three Bad Brambach mineral springs has been observed, which became stronger after the ‘Eisenquelle’ spring capture reconstruction (winter 2003 / 2004). Similar behaviour could be detected at a <b>mofette</b> in Soos. The results correspond to a 3 He/ 4 He mantle ratio increase in gases at mofettes in the Cheb Basin (CZ) traced by other authors for more than 12 years, and could give hints for a higher degassing activity of the magma body below that area. Common and special properties in the degassing regimes of the Bad Brambach and Soos locations are discussed.

Our results show major shifts in archaeal and bacterial communities towards anaerobic and methanogenic taxa dominating in CO 2 rich hypoxic soils with a significant increase in abundance of Methanomicrobia and predominantly anaerobic Chloroflexi and Firmicutes. O 2 concentration in soil was consistently shown to be the strongest predictor of the compositional changes across both the archaeal and bacterial communities. However, soil pH and total N, were most important in separating the archaeal communities in transition and control zones, but not the bacterial communities.

We explored whether those phylotypes that appear exclusively in hypoxic soils are local specialists or widespread generalists able to tolerate a range of soil conditions. AM fungal community composition was characterized by cloning, restriction fragment length polymorphism typing, and the sequencing of small subunit rRNA genes from roots of four plant species growing at high (hypoxic) and low (control) geological CO 2 exposure. We found significant levels of AM fungal community turnover (β diversity) between soil types and the numerical dominance of two AM fungal phylotypes in hypoxic soils. Our results strongly suggest that direct environmental selection acting on AM fungi is a major factor regulating AM fungal communities and their phylogeographic patterns.

Additionally, photosynthesis as measured using CO 2 gas-exchange and fluorescence clearly followed the same rule, being higher {{at the margins of}} the area and lower close to the vents. As fluorescence can be detected via remote sensors, chlorophyll fluorescence may be used to detect physiological changes from remote. In addition an abiotic thermal parameter may help in recognising mofettes in the field. As the flux of escaping CO 2 gas from the soil may influence the soil temperature at and around the vent openings the application of infrared thermovision systems may be used additionally help to confirm their existence or detect unknown ones. The emerging gas dampens the temperature fluctuations of the soil imposed by the weather: it will cool the soil, when the gas is cooler than the undisturbed surface and it will warm the soil when the gas is warmer. Subtraction of multi-temporal IR images and setting temperature difference thresholds in difference images allows to disclose this effect and thus to detect the vents as well as their spatial extension. ...|$|E
40|$|Earth {{degassing}} specifically {{of carbon}} dioxide CO 2 is of increasing interest {{with respect to the}} global carbon budget, related climate effects, earth quake and volcano eruption mechanisms, as well as plant physiological reactions in gas-rich environments. Investigations in all of these disciplines require the detection of surface CO 2 degassing structures and quantification of their emissions. We introduce minimal thermal change detection based on infrared imaging as a new remote sensing tool for the detection of earth surface thermal anomalies suiting among others to discover Earth degassing locations of any origin. The method allows for seamless areal search and monitoring of degassing structures in any terrain. As proof of concept infrared imaging measurements were performed at the Bossoleto vent on the eastern master fault of the Siena Graben (Tuskany, Italy). It is known for the migration of a large amount of CO 2 -rich gas from deep geothermal reservoirs. Field data acquired confirmed the qualification of the method. Detection of CO 2 degassing locations from infrared image time series worked reliably and optimal detection conditions were identified (dry, calm, cloudless weather between dusk and dawn). A simple model of heat exchange processes involved and observed was developed. In a first attempt this model was applied to determine the gas exit temperature, the area of gas thermal reach and the gas flux from recorded image series. It is the first method that allows remote areal survey of <b>mofette</b> fields and the associated CO 2 flux quantification sole from infrared image time series...|$|E
40|$|We present new isotope (C, He, Ne, Ar, partly N) and {{compositional}} {{data from the}} free gas phase of fourteen degassing sites in the westernmost part of the Pannonian Basin near the Austria/Slovenia borderline. Based on these data, {{the origin of the}} gases and the degree of modification of the gas signatures due to interaction processes during migration are evaluated. The isotope signatures indicate an origin of helium and CO 2 predominantly in the subcontinental mantle. Measured 3 He/ 4 He ratios from 4. 95 to 6. 32 Ra include the highest ones recorded in the whole Pannonian Basin system. Only at three locations in the periphery of the degassing center, a substantial admixture of crustal helium was found. The CO 2 in the <b>mofette</b> gases and at the sites with the highest 3 He/ 4 He ratios (6. 3 Ra) is characterized by δ 13 C values of − 3. 5 ‰. In comparison with MORB (Mid-ocean Ridge Basalt), it is thus slightly enriched in 13 C. The 3 He/ 4 He isotope ratios within the range typical for the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) point to a fast, localized fluid transport from the magmatic reservoir to the surface. There are only few sites in European non-active volcanic regions where free gases with unmodified SCLM helium isotope signature escape at the surface. A comparison of the elemental and isotopic geochemical characteristics of gases with SCLM-helium signature from four different regions (Massif Central/France, Eifel/Germany, Eger Rift/Czech Republic and the westernmost part of the Pannonian Basin system) indicates that the European SCLM in general is characterized by a reservoir more enriched in 13 C compared to MORB...|$|E
40|$|In a 1. 140 km² {{study area}} of the {{volcanic}} West Eifel, a comprehensive investigation established the correlation between red wood ant mound (RWA; Formica rufa-group) sites and active tectonic faults. The current stress field with a NW-SE-trending main stress direction opens pathways for geogenic gases and potential magmas following the same orientation. At the same time, Variscan and Mesozoic fault zones are reactivated. The results showed linear alignments and clusters of approx. 3, 000 RWA mounds. While linear mound distribution correlate with strike-slip fault systems documented by quartz and ore veins and fault planes with slickensides, the clusters represent crosscut zones of dominant fault systems. Latter can be correlated with voids caused by crustal block rotation. Gas analyses from soil air, mineral springs and <b>mofettes</b> (CO 2, Helium, Radon and H 2 S) reveal limiting concentrations for the spatial distribution of mounds and colonization. Striking is further the almost complete absence of RWA mounds in the core {{area of the}} Quaternary volcanic field. A possible cause {{can be found in}} occasionally occurring H 2 S in the fault systems, which is toxic at miniscule concentrations to the ants. Viewed overall, there is a strong relationship between RWA mounds and active tectonics in the West Eifel...|$|R
40|$|Romania is {{a member}} state of the European Union. Among the {{resources}} of the Romanian tourist patrimony, mineral and thermal waters, <b>mofettes,</b> salt mines, muds and the climate build up a valuable portfolio of the wellness tourism offer. These resources are used to recover and reacquire the strength to work, but also for minimizing the effects of degenerative diseases commonly affecting senior citizens. The aging {{of the population of the}} European Union is one of the challenges affecting this block on a macroeconomic level increasingly more visibly. A solution for minimizing the effects of the rising number of senior citizens might be the integration of the Romanian wellness offer in the European tourist offer. Our country is also affected by this phenomenon and the existing wellness resources are useful in diminishing the negative effects of the aging process. The research began by analyzing the specialized literature, which confirmed the phenomenon of aging among the Europe's population. This was followed by a pilot study (287 respondents) which was undertaken from June to December 2015 on representatives of the Romanian population. Romania's tourist heritage, represented by its wellness tourism resources, may represent an important tourist product on the European market which can help senior citizens benefit from treatments of degenerative illnesses...|$|R
40|$|Greece {{is located}} on a {{convergent}} plate boundary comprising the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Eurasian, while the Arabian plate approaches the Eurasian in a northwestward motion. It {{is considered to be}} one of the most tectonically active regions of Earth with a complex geodynamic setting, deriving from a long and complicated geological history. Due to this specific geological background, conditions for the formation of many thermal springs are favoured. In the past years, almost all the already known sites of degassing (fumaroles, soil gases, <b>mofettes,</b> gas bubbling in cold and thermal waters) located in the Hellenic area were sampled at least one time. Collected samples were analysed for their chemical (He, Ne, Ar, O 2, N 2, H 2, H 2 S, CO, CH 4 and CO 2) and isotopic composition (He, C and N). Some of these sites have been selected for systematic sampling. Four of them have records longer than 10 years with tens of samplings also considering some literature data. Two of the sites are located in active volcanic areas (Santorini and Nisyros) while the other two are close to actively spreading graben structures with intense seismic activity (Gulf of Korinth and Sperchios basin). Results allowed to define long term background values and also some interesting variation related to seismic or volcanic activity...|$|R
