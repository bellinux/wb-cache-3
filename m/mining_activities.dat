Prior to that, both species had been listed as vulnerable. Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction, primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. Also, they are both hunted for bushmeat. The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF.

The tin mining area refers to unconventional mining, {{which is a}} tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> using simple mechanical instrument. Tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> has been long existed in Bangka Belitung, conducted legally and illegally. Tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> makes coastal supporting ecosystems such as mangrove cannot play their role normally. One of the regency in Bangka Belitung, which its coastal area is affected by un-conventional mining, is South Bangka. The {{aim of this study}} is to monitor and measure the mangrove density changes. This research use Landsat data acquisition from year 1997, 2009 and 2014 through NDVI analysis. The result shows that tin <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> in South Bangka coastal area causes reduction in mangrove density. The field studies indicated that 4 types of mangrove was found. The types of mangrove are Avicennia marina, Sonneratia caseolaris, Rhizopora mucronata, and Xylocarpus granatum. Mangrove management is needed in order to maintain the quality of coastal ecosystem. Moreover, the regulation and monitoring of the <b>mining</b> <b>activity</b> should be issued by the government to support environmental sustainability...|$|R
5|$|In June 1916, the Russian {{geologist}} Nikolay Pogrebov oversaw mining of {{the first}} tonnes of oil shale at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg (then Petrograd) Polytechnic Institute for large-scale experiments. These events marking {{the beginning of the}} Estonian oil shale industry took place {{more than half a century}} after an oil shale industry had emerged in Scotland, the leading oil shale industry in 1916, and a decade before the industry emerged in China, which, besides Estonia, is today the other leading oil shale-exploiting country. In 1916 a total of 640–690tonnes of oil shale were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing. The tests proved that the oil shale was suitable for combustion as a solid fuel and for extraction of oil shale gas and shale oil. Based on these promising results, a plan for oil shale mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917. On 13 February 1917, the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1.2million rubles to purchase land and start <b>mining</b> <b>activities.</b> After the February Revolution, the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner for oil shale purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an oil shale mine at Pavandu, with full-scale construction carried out by about 500workers, including war prisoners, in the summer of 1917. After the October Revolution, financing ceased and construction stopped. Two private Saint Petersburg firms, established specially for oil shale mining, Böckel& Co. and Mutschnik& Co., which in the fall of 1916 had begun surface mining at Kukruse and Järve, respectively, also terminated their <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> in 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{last great}} {{ruler of the}} Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Semitic-speaking Canaanite {{settlers}} from the Near East into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and <b>mining</b> <b>activities,</b> however, combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the Canaanite settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.|$|E

5|$|In some areas, {{systematic}} {{attacks against}} tribespeople {{in or near}} mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers.Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their <b>mining</b> <b>activities.</b> Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that {{there were times when}} miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages not involved in the original act. During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Java is a {{relatively}} small island compared to Sumatra, {{but it has a}} higher concentration of active volcanoes. There are 45 active volcanoes on the island excluding 20 small craters and cones in the Dieng volcanic complex and the young cones in the Tengger caldera complex. Some volcanoes are grouped together in the list below because of their close location. Mount Merapi, Semeru and Kelud are the most active volcanoes in Java. Mount Semeru has been continuously erupting since 1967. Mount Merapi has been named as one of the Decade Volcanoes since 1995. Ijen has a unique colourful caldera lake which is an extremely acidic natural reservoir (pH<0.3). There are sulphur <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> at Ijen, where miners collect highly concentrated sulphur rocks by hand.|$|E

The opencast <b>mining</b> <b>activities</b> in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, {{so that by the}} end of the nineteenth century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E

5|$|The minting {{of silver}} coinage began {{during the reign}} of AlexanderI as a means to pay for royal expenditures.

5|$|Honduras was a {{relatively}} poor province and did not attract the most distinguished conquistadors. Most conquistadors and colonists who ventured to Honduras desired to return quickly to Spain with newly acquired wealth and improved social status, and were therefore looking for immediate enrichment. The progress of conquest {{was based on the}} distribution of encomienda rights and land concessions. Encomienda gave the encomendero (holder of the encomienda) the right to receive tribute and labour from the indigenous inhabitants of a defined area. Up until the middle of the 16th century, the encomendero could assign his own level of tribute and labour to be provided by the natives within his encomienda, which gave rise to much abuse. The encomiendas established in Honduras were small, and did not generate rapid income. Social advancement was gained by overlordship of natives within the encomienda system. In Honduras, the conquistadors gained immediate income by selling natives into slavery on the Caribbean islands and in Panama, and by <b>mining</b> <b>activities.</b> This in turn resulted in a reduction of indigenous population levels in Honduras, with a rapid drop in economic production {{during the first half of}} the 16th century. On the whole, the Spanish colonists were unwilling to invest time and resources into the long-term development of the agricultural production of their encomiendas in Honduras.|$|E

In order to properly pay the soldiers of the Macedonian army with something other than general spoils of war, the minting of coinage significantly increased during the reigns of Philip II and Alexander the Great, especially after the increase in state revenues following the seizure of the Pangaion Hills.
