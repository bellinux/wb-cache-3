40|$|The {{environmental}} geochemistry of molybdenum and tungsten {{is not well}} known. To enable predictions of Mo and W concentrations {{in the presence of}} ferrihydrite (hydrous ferric oxide), batch equilibrations were made with MoO 42 -, WO 42 -, o-phosphate (PO 43 -) and freshly prepared ferrihydrite suspensions in 0. 01 M NaNO 3 in the pH range from 3 to 10 at 25 °C. The results showed that WO 42 - is adsorbed more strongly than MoO 42 -, and that both ions are able to displace PO 43 - from adsorption sites at low pH. Two models, the Diffuse Layer Model (DLM) and the CD-MUSIC Model (CDM), were tested in an effort to describe the data. In both models, the adsorption of MoO 42 - and WO 42 - could be described with the use of two monodentate complexes. One of these was a fully protonated complex, equivalent to adsorbed <b>molybdic</b> or tungstic <b>acid,</b> which was required to fit the data at low pH. This was found to be the case also for a data set with goethite. In competitive systems with PO 43 -, the models did not always provide satisfactory predictions.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} and the kinetics of {{the reaction}} of Mo (VI) with 8 -hydroxyquinoline; 8 -hydroxyquinaldine; KELEX 100; LIX 63; and LIX 65 N were studied by solvent extraction. From the equilibrium studies {{it was concluded that}} in weakly acidic solution (pH 5 to 6) the overall extraction reaction is (UNFORMATTED TABLE FOLLOWS) MoO₄²⁻ + 2 H⁺ + 2 HL(o) ↔ (K(ex)) MoO₂L ₂(o) + 2 H₂O (TABLE ENDS) where HL is the monoprotic bidentate ligand, "(o) " refers to the organic phase, and K(,ex) is the extraction constant. It was concluded that the complexation reaction requires four protons to convert molybdate into molybdenyl. The extractions constants for LIX 63 and 8 -hydroxyquinaldine, corrected for the side reaction of the ligand and metal, are 10 ¹⁶·⁴³ and 10 ¹⁴·⁴⁰, respectively. In the case of LIX 65 N, the plot of log(D) vs pH has a maximum at pH 1. 0, which was explained qualitatively in terms of protonation of the ligand and <b>molybdic</b> <b>acid</b> at low pH. The extraction constant for the reaction of <b>molybdic</b> <b>acid</b> and the neutral ligand was estimated to be 100, 000. The kinetics of extraction Mo (VI) with LIX 63, 8 -hydroxyquinoline, 8 -hydroxyquinaldine, and Kelex 100 were studied in this work. In all cases, except 8 -hydroxyquinoline, the rate-determining step {{of the reaction}} involves the formation of a 1 : 1 complex between the neutral ligand and several Mo(VI) species differing in the degree of protonation. The rate-determining step for the reaction of Mo(VI) with 8 -hydroxyquinoline involves the formation of a 1 : 2 complex. The rate constant for the reaction of HMoO₄ with 8 -hydroxyquinaldine is four orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding value reported in the literature for 8 -hydroxyquinoline. The slower reaction with 8 -hydroxyquinaldine was attributed to the presence of the methyl group next to the nitrogen atom of the ligand which hinders its binding with molybdenum in the rate determining step of the reaction...|$|E

The use of activated carbon as support afforded an X-ray amorphous Mo phase, whereas crystalline molybdenum carbide phases were obtained on carbon nanofibers and, in some cases, on carbon nanotubes. When the resulting catalysts were tested in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of guaiacol in dodecane, catechol and phenol were obtained as the main products, although in some instances significant amounts of cyclohexane were produced. The observation of catechol in all reaction mixtures suggests that guaiacol was converted into phenol via sequential demethylation and HDO, although the simultaneous occurrence of a direct demethoxylation pathway cannot be discounted. Catalysts based on carbon nanofibers generally afforded the highest yields of phenol; notably, the only crystalline phase detected in these samples was Mo 2 C or Mo 2 C-ζ, suggesting that crystalline Mo 2 C is particularly selective to phenol. At 350  °C, carbon nanofiber supported Mo 2 C afforded near quantitative guaiacol conversion, the selectivity to phenol approaching 50 %.

XPS analysis indicates that the best results in solar cell performance are in hand with a heterogeneous composition of the molybdenum oxide film presenting MoV and MoVI as predominant species. The MoO 3 films deposited by cyclic voltammetry are not as homogeneous as those deposited by potentiostatic technique and only MoVI species are present. These differences may justify the different behaviour of the solar cells using these different buffer layers. Only buffer layers deposited by potentiostatic technique allow improving the cells performances in the same way than those achieved by evaporation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nitrides {{remain a}} {{relatively}} unexplored class of materials {{primarily due to}} the difficulties associated with their synthesis and characterization. Several synthetic routes, including high temperature reactions, microwave assisted synthesis, {{and the use of}} plasmas, to prepare binary and ternary nitrides have been explored. Transition metal nitrides form a class of materials with unique physical properties, which give them varied applications, as high temperature ceramics, magnetic materials, superconductors or catalysts. They are commonly prepared by high temperature conventional processes, but alternative synthetic approaches have also been explored, more recently, which utilize moderate temperature condition. Transition metal nitrides particularly, molybdenum nitride, niobium nitride, and tungsten nitride have important applications as catalyst in hydrodenitridation reactions. These nitrides have been traditionally synthesized using high temperature nitridation treatments of the oxides. The nitridation temperatures are very high (> 800 - 1000 o C).

Single layers of the transition metal dichalcogenides WS 2, MoS 2, and MoSe 2 were formed in aqueous suspensions by lithium intercalation and exfoliation of the crystalline powders [13]. Rao and Nag [14] described the preparation of WS 2 and MoS 2 sheets by lithium intercalation followed by exfoliation of the layers by ultrasonication and chemical synthesis, where <b>molybdic</b> <b>acid</b> and tungstic acid, respectively, were treated with an excess of thiourea. Another approach, a mixed-solvent strategy, exploited a low-intensity ultrasonic treatment (ultrasonic bath) for the exfoliation of MoS 2, WS 2, and BN in ethanol/water mixtures [15]. This method is suitable for the preparation of approximately 1 % dispersion of exfoliated particles. Direct exfoliation of the bulk powder materials using supercritical CO 2 assisted with ultrasound also led to the single and few layers of BN, MoS 2, and WS 2. The effects of supercritical CO 2 coupled with ultrasound {{played a key role in}} the exfoliation process [16]. Warner et al. [17] presented a relatively simple method to prepare thin few-layer sheets of h-BN with micrometer-sized dimensions using chemical exfoliation in the solvent 1, 2 -dichloroethane. Lin et al.

40|$|Amorphous Molybdenum Sulfide (MoSx) {{has been}} {{identified}} as an excellent catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is still a challenge to prepare amorphous MoSx as a more active and stable catalyst for the HER Here the amorphous MoSx catalysts are prepared on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrates at 200 degrees C by a simple hydrothermal method using <b>molybdic</b> <b>acid</b> and thioacetamide. Because the CFP is intrinsically hydrophobic due to its graphene-like carbon structure, two kinds of hydrophilic pretreatment methods, [plasma pretreatment (PP) and electrochemical pretreatment (EP) ] are investigated to convert the hydrophobic surface of the CFP to be hydrophilic prior to the hydrothermal growth of MoSx. In the HER catalysis, the MoSx, catalysts grown on the pretreated CFPs reach a cathodic current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a much lower overpotential of 231 mV on the MoSx/EP-CFP and 205 mV on the MoSx/PP-CFP, compared to a high overpotential of 290 mV on the MoSx of the nonpretreated CFP. Turnover frequency per site is also significantly improved when the MoSx are grown on the pretreated CFPs. However, the Tafel slopes of all amorphous MoSx catalysts are in the range of 46 - 50 mV/dec., suggesting the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism as a major pathway for the HER. In addition, regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} the pretreatment, the hydrothermally grown MoSx catalyst on CFP exhibits such excellent stability that the degradation of the cathodic current density is negligible after 1000 cycles in a stability test, possibly due to the relatively high growth temperatureclose...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{that does not}} employ chemical precipitation for the quanti-tative separation of serum inorganic phosphate from the proteins present. The separation is accomplished by heat coagulation of serum and subsequent extraction of phosphate from the intact clot with dilute sulfuric acid. Serum (0. 25 ml.) is placed {{at the bottom of}} a 25 X 95 -mm. shell vial and coagulated in a boiling-water bath for 2 mm. The resultant coagulum is firm, adherent to the container, and not easily disrupted; 6. 0 ml. of O. 3 N H 2 S 04 is then added to cover the coagulum, and the phosphate extracted. The phosphate in the extract is determined by a phospho-molybdate reduction procedure. N/Il OST PROCEDURES for the determination of serum inorganic phos-phate are based on the reduction of phosphomolybdate (1 - 6), and have three distinct steps. The first is the preparation of a protein-free fil-trate with trichloroacetic acid (TCA). An acid molybdate reagent is then added to an aliquot of filtrate, with the formation of phosphomo-lybdic acid. Finally the phosphomolybdic acid is reduced to a blue complex (molybdenum blue). TCA has several disadvantages as a protein precipitant. It must be used in fairly high concentrations to be effective, and requires refrigeration. On occasion the protein-free filtrate formed is not clear, and elimination of the cloudiness requires addition of chloroform or carbon tetrachloride (7). The presence of TCA is known to inhibit the formation of molybdenum blue (1). The selection of a reducing agent is important.

The functions of virtually all these proteins are unknown. CML 24, also known as TCH 2, shares over 40 % amino acid sequence identity with calmodulin, has four EF hands, and undergoes Ca 2 +-dependent changes in hydrophobic interaction chromatography and migration rate through denaturing gel electrophoresis, indicating that CML 24 binds Ca 2 + and, as a consequence, undergoes conformational changes. CML 24 expression occurs in all major organs, and transcript levels are increased from 2 - to 15 -fold in plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat, cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid (ABA), and indole- 3 -acetic acid. However, CML 24 protein accumulation changes were not detectable.

MgCl 2 tolerance is not due to reduced uptake or to elevated Ca 2 + accumulation.

Two reduced-tillage systems, no tillage (NT) and minimum tillage (MT), and four different fertilizer treatments were assessed. The amounts of P extracted by anion-exchange resin (AER) and by Mehlich 3 (M 3) were compared; in addition, differences between two determination methods of P contents extracted by Mehlich 3, namely <b>molybdic</b> <b>acid</b> colorimetric standard procedure (M 3 -COL) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (M 3 -ICP), were evaluated.

The linear correlation coefficient between M 3 -COL and M 3 -ICP was highly significant (R 2 = 0. 89; P & 0. 01), but a two-straight-lines model or a quadratic relationship were more adequate for describing the dependence between the two determination procedures after M 3 extraction. Relative and absolute differences between M 3 -COL and M 3 -ICP showed a tendency to increase as organic carbon content increased. Phosphorus content extracted by AER and M 3 -COL or M 3 -ICP reported a significant but much less predictable relationship with R 2 values of 0. 27 and 0. 21 (n = 96), respectively.

40|$|Vitellogenin (VTG) is a {{well known}} protein {{biomarker}} for exposure to environmental estrogens and possible endocrine disruption in fish. VTG is very dominant in plasma after the onset of vitellogenesis and the protein is heavily phosphorylated. This enables indirect quantification through measurement of alkali-labile protein bound phosphate (ALP) {{as an alternative to}} the more expensive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Good correlation has previously been shown between ALP and actual VTG levels but little effort has been made to investigate the method in an analytical way e. g., to assure the origin of the measured phosphate. During this method development care has been taken to rule out non-VTG sources of phosphate such as phospholipids and free phosphate in the blood plasma. Sample preparation has been simplified and unnecessary steps have been omitted. The common spectrophotometric measurement for ALP involves measurement at two wavelengths and calculation of corrected absorbance values. With a quick phase separation step the spectrophotometric phosphate determination using <b>molybdic</b> <b>acid</b> and ascorbic acid has been improved and all matrix interference has been eliminated. The final ALP method presented here has a detection limit of 3. 2 mu g PO 43 -/ml plasma which is six times lower than similar methods and it also has less variability. A high sample throughput in comparison to previous ALP methods is possible after scaling down sample and reagent volumes to fit in a 96 well microtiter plate. The cost for buying all chemicals and plastic consumer goods for setting up the indirect protocol for the analysis of 1000 samples is only circa 350 euro. This is only 1 % of the material cost for buying commercially available test kit for direct quantification of VTG in the same number of samples.

40|$|The Arabidopsis TCH genes, {{originally}} isolated as {{a consequence}} of their upregulation in response to the mechanical stimulus of touch, are also upregulated by a variety of seemingly disparate environmental and hormonal stimuli. To gain insight into the complexities of TCH gene regulation, a number of approaches were taken. Regulatory elements responsible for regulation were identified and characteristics of the regulation were evaluated. Reporter genes were used to monitor expression localization and dynamics. Microarray analyses of genome-wide expression behavior indicated that touch-inducible gene expression is more widespread than generally appreciated. Identification of all touch-regulated genes shed light on the types of cellular processes that may be altered in response to mechanical stress perturbations. Expression of the TCH 2 gene, also called CML 24, encoding a calmodulin (CaM) -like (CML) protein, was evaluated. CML 24 shares over 40 % amino acid sequence identity with CaM, has 4 EF hands and undergoes a Ca 2 +-dependent change in migration rate through denaturing gel electrophoresis, indicating that CML 24 binds Ca 2 + and, {{as a consequence}}, undergoes conformational changes. CML 24 expression occurs in all major organs and is induced from 2 - to 15 -fold in plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat, cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid (ABA) and indole- 3 -acetic acid.

These data present evidence that CML 24 encodes a potential Ca 2 + sensor that may function to enable responses to ABA, day length and presence of various salts. Further investigation of CML 24 function and regulation led to the finding that CML 24 has a critical role in nitric oxide regulation. Distinct tilling mutant alleles demonstrated that CML 24 can act as a switch in the response to day length perception. Because of potential redundancy with the related CML 23 gene, CML 23 T-DNA insertion mutants were identified and characterized. Together, CML 23 and CML 24 impact the autonomous regulatory pathway of the transition to flowering. Nitric oxide levels are elevated in cml 23 /cml 24 double mutants. Therefore, CML 23 and CML 24 are potential calcium sensors regulate nitric oxide accumulation. In collaboration with Drs. McCann and Carpita, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to assess, verify and classify wall architectural changes that occur as a result of single XTH insertion mutations. Thirty-four homozygous mutant lines of Arabidopsis representing 21 members of the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase gene family provided a set of mutants to characterize. Kohonen networks classified cell wall architectures of xth mutant lines and previously characterized cell wall mutants. The xth mutants were found to have chemical changes in their cell walls not detectable as phenotypic growth and development changes, consistent with the existence of feed-back loops that modify wall composition in response to a life-long deficiency of a cell wall enzyme. To gain insight into the potential physiological relevance of the distinct members of the XTH family, GUS reporter fusion genes were constructed, and plants expressing these transgenes were characterized to reveal spatial and temporal patterns of expression. In addition, Genevestigator sources were mined for comprehensive and comparative XTH expression regulation analysis. These data revealed that the Arabidopsis XTHs are likely expressed in every developmental stage from seed germination through flowering. All organs showed XTH::GUS expression and most, if not all, are found to express multiple XTH::GUS genes suggesting that XTHs may contribute to morphogenesis at every developmental stage and in every plant organ. Different XTHs have remarkably diverse and distinct expression patterns indicating that paralogous genes have evolved differential expression regulation perhaps contributing to the maintenance of the large gene family. Extensive overlap in XTH expression patterns is evident; thus, XTHs may act combinatorially in determining wall properties of specific tissues or organs. Knowledge of gene-specific expression among family members yields evidence of where and when gene products may function and provides insights to guide rational approaches to investigate function through reverse genetics...|$|E
