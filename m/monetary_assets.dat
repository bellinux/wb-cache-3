In a {{world of}} perfect certainty, the user costs can be computed directly from assetreturn data, and so, the index is model-free. In the presence ofuncertainty, however, the true user cost of a <b>monetary</b> <b>asset</b> dependson the covariance of the asset s return with the marginal utility ofwealth. Intuitively, an asset s value depends both on its expectedpayoff and on the asset s ability to hedge wealth fluctuations. As aresult, the true user cost cannot be computed without an explicitmodel of preferences. It follows that the exact Divisia monetaryindex in a stochastic economy is not model-free, but depends on theunderlying preference assumptions. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the choice of a money stock measure on the inference about monetary shocks. To this end, it adopts order-invariant forecast error variance decompositions (FEVD) for an unrestricted vector autoregressive (UVAR) model. This approach does not require orthogonalization of shocks and is invariant to the ordering of the variables in the UVAR. The empirical work is based on estimating UVAR model using different methods of measurement of <b>monetary</b> <b>asset.</b> The results suggest that empirical conclusions from the FEVD analyses differ when money is measured by the flow of monetary services rather than by summation of the dollar amount of <b>monetary</b> <b>asset.</b> Further, the results show that qualitative inference about the money’s effects on the economic activity can depend crucially on the definition of money chosen.

500|$|Jim Rickards, in his 2011 book [...] {{argues that}} the {{consequences}} of the Fed's attempts to prop up economic growth could be devastating for American national security. Though Rickard's book is largely concerned with currency war as competitive devaluation, it uses a broader definition of the term, classing policies that cause inflation as currency war. Such policies can be seen as metaphorical warfare against those who have <b>monetary</b> <b>assets</b> in favor of those who do not, but unless the effects of rising inflation on international trade are offset by a devaluation, inflationary policies tend to make a country's exports less competitive against foreign countries. In their review of the book, Publishers Weekly said: [...] "Rickards's first book is an outgrowth of his contributions and a later two-day war game simulation held at the Applied Physics Laboratory's Warfare Analysis Laboratory. He argues that a financial attack against the U.S. could destroy confidence in the dollar. In Rickards's view, the Fed's policy of quantitative easing by lessening confidence in the dollar, may lead to chaos in global financial markets." [...] Kirkus Reviews said: [...] "In Rickards' view, the world is currently going through a third currency war ("CWIII") based on competitive devaluations. CWII occurred in the 1960s and '70s and culminated in Nixon's decision to take the dollar off the gold standard. CWI followed World War I and included the 1923 German hyperinflation and Roosevelt's devaluation of the dollar against gold in 1933. Rickards demonstrates that competitive devaluations are a race to the bottom, and thus instruments of a sort of warfare. CWIII, he writes, is characterized by the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing, which he ascribes to what he calls [...] "extensive theoretical work" [...] on depreciation, negative interest rates and stimulation achieved {{at the expense of other}} countries. He offers a view of how the continued depreciation and devaluation of the dollar will ultimately lead to a collapse, which he asserts will come about through a widespread abandonment of a worthless inflated instrument. Rickards also provides possible scenarios for the future, including collaboration among a variety of currencies, emergence of a world central bank and a forceful U.S. return to a gold standard through an emergency powers–based legal regime. The author emphasizes that these questions are matters of policy and choice, which can be different." ...|$|E

This is done for Danish data within the natural framework of a multivariate econometric model. The purpose of the study is to investigate issues in relation to the level and weighting of a monetary aggregate. We show that within this model it is possible to identify monetary aggregates at different levels of aggregation and that for the narrow aggregate (M 1) equal weighting of the components are permitted. For the broader aggregates, (M 2) or (M 2 -M 1), equal weighting is no longer appropriate. These findings are not contradictory to what we would expect from aggregation and index number theory. Finally, the overall identifica-tion of the stationary (or long-run) structure points towards a co-existence of a liquid and a less liquid money demand relation which is interpreted as an indication of the possibility of splitting the total money demand relation with respect to different motives for holding money. <b>Monetary</b> <b>asset</b> components; Aggregate money demand; Denmark; Demand relation...|$|R
