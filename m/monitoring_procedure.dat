40|$|Contemporary {{tests for}} {{structural}} change {{are designed to}} detect a structural break within a given historical data set of fixed size. Due {{to the law of}} the iterated logarithm, these one-shot tests cannot be applied to monitor out-of-sample stability each time new data arrive. The authors propose and analyze two real-time <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedures</b> with controlled size asymptotically: the fluctuation and CUSUM <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedures.</b> Simulation results show that the proposed <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedures</b> indeed have controlled asymptotic size and that detection timing depends on the magnitude of parameter change, the signal to noise ratio, and the location of the out-of-sample break point.

50|$|Due to the {{extensive}} amount of assistance {{the federal government}} provides, federal agencies rely on numerous monitoring activities performed by themselves, pass-through entities, and external sources. The most common <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedure</b> is the Single Audit. This is an annual examination of a recipient’s operations and records that determines {{whether or not the}} recipient complied with laws and regulations applicable to the assistance they received. Additionally, Federal agencies routinely visit recipients and inspect their records and statements to check for situations of noncompliance with laws and regulations, and require periodic financial and performance reports that detail recipient operations. Federal agencies also require pass-through entities to perform similar procedures to their sub-recipients, since they are responsible for the assistance they pass on.|$|E

The principal findings of the report were that the TVI operation created some jobs in an impoverished area and generated revenues for the indebted national government. However, that it also displaced many families; divided the local indigenous people; deprived thousands of small-scale miners of their livelihood; negatively affected rice farmers and fishers living downstream; and that it is located on the peak of Mount Canatuan, which the Subanon living in the area consider to be sacred. The report made recommendations for action both by the Philippine Government and TVI - including that the mining operation be halted until an independent <b>monitoring</b> <b>procedure</b> is in place.|$|E
