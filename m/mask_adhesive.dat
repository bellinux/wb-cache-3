50|$|Glochidia may be {{difficult}} to remove. Yanking out the bristles may result in leaving one or more 20-30 micrometre sized barbs in the skin, later to be manifest by granuloma formation. Attempts to suck out the glochidia are likely to result in their attachment to the tongue. Popular methods of removing glochidia have included spreading adhesive plaster over the area and ripping it off quickly or using melted wax (hot wax sometimes employed for removing hair). Martinez et al. studied various methods of removing glochidia from rabbit skin. They evaluated tweezers, glue, facial <b>mask,</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape, package-sealing tape, and tweezing followed by glue. The most effective single method was tweezing, which removed 76% of the spines. The method using a thin layer of household glue (Elmer's Glue-All, Borden Inc) covered with gauze, allowed to dry (about 30 minutes) and then peeled off resulted in removal of 63% of the spines. Facial mask and adhesive tapes removed about 40% and 30% of the spines, respectively, and produced more retention and inflammation three days after removal than no treatment. Repeated applications of adhesive tape did not improve the results. According to Martinez, the most effective method is to first use tweezers to remove clumps of spines followed by the application and removal of household glue, resulting in removal of 95% of the spines.|$|E
50|$|Most solid <b>masks</b> {{require an}} <b>adhesive</b> {{to hold the}} mask in place while work is performed. Some, such as masking tape and frisket, come with <b>adhesive</b> pre-applied. Solid <b>masks</b> are readily {{available}} in bulk, and are used in large painting jobs.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{technique}} {{to switch off}} the tack adhesion in selected areas of a colloidal nanocomposite adhesive. It is made from a blend of soft colloidal polymer particles and hard copolymer nanoparticles. In regions that are exposed to IR radiation, the nanoparticles sinter {{together to form a}} percolating skeleton, which hardens and stiffens the adhesive. The tack adhesion is lost locally. Masks can be made from silicone-coated disks, such as coins. Under the <b>masks,</b> <b>adhesive</b> island regions are defined with the surrounding regions being a nontacky coating. When optimizing the nanocomposite's adhesive properties, the addition of the hard nanoparticles raises the elastic modulus of the adhesive significantly, but adhesion is not lost because the yield point remains relatively low. During probe-tack testing, the soft polymer phases yield and enable fibrillation. After heating under IR radiation, the storage modulus increases by a factor of 5, and the yield point increases nearly by a factor of 6, such that yielding and fibrillation do not occur in the probe-tack testing. Hence, the adhesion is lost. Loading and unloading experiments indicate that a rigid skeleton is created when the nanoparticles sinter together, and it fractures under moderate strains. This patterning method is relatively simple and fast to execute. It is widely applicable to other blends of thermoplastic hard nanoparticles and larger soft particles...|$|R
40|$|A {{replacement}} {{alkaline cleaning}} chemistry was {{qualified for the}} copper cleaning process used to support printed wiring board fabrication. The copper cleaning process was used to prepare copper surfaces for enhancing the adhesion of dry film photopolymers (photoresists and solder <b>masks)</b> and acrylic <b>adhesives.</b> The alkaline chemistry {{was used to remove}} organic contaminates such as fingerprints...|$|R
30|$|Scattering {{of tension}} values can be {{explained}} by scattering in the failure mode, while no adhesive failure of the solder mask/epoxy adhesive interface occurred in the SM-BM or in the SM-Cu configuration. The statistical variance in the solder mask type B configuration SM-BM was related to the particular cohesive failure of the solder <b>mask</b> itself. No <b>adhesive</b> failure to the epoxy adhesive was observed, but there was residue of solder mask on the interface base material/solder mask.|$|R
50|$|Considering that Dscam and Dscaml1 have {{non-overlapping}} expression {{patterns in}} the mouse retina, with Dscam being expressed in a subset of amacrine cells and most retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and Dscaml1 expressed in the rod circuit, Fuerst et al. (2009) examined retinal ganglion cell populations in Dscam−/− mice and, in addition, assessed retinal anatomy in the rod circuit using a gene-trap-knockout allele of Dscaml1. In the absence of either gene, the cells that would normally express it showed excessive fasciculation of their dendrites and clumping of their cell bodies. These findings led {{to the conclusion that}} Dscam and Dscaml1 prevent excessive adhesion, primarily by <b>masking</b> cell-type-specific <b>adhesive</b> interactions between dendrites of the same cell class, rather than actively promoting repulsion between them.Thus, in the absence of diversity, mammalian DSCAMs do not provide cells with the ability to distinguish between their own processes and the processes of all other cells, including processes from cells of the same type. Instead, DSCAM acts to negate cell-type-specific interactions that are promoted by other recognition molecules.|$|R
40|$|Summary Growth in biofilms {{provides}} bacterial {{species with}} many advantages over growth in suspension, e. g. colonization of nutrient-rich areas. In the alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus biofilm formation is facilitated through its asymmetric cell division, where one daughter cell becomes a motile flagellated swarmer cell able to colonize new surfaces {{while the other}} remains as a stalked cell attached to the substrate through the adhesive holdfast. The Caulobacter biofilm consists of stalked cells arranged either in a monolayer or in a multicellular 'mushroom' structure. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Berne et al. demonstrate that extracellular DNA (eDNA) from lysed cells prevents biofilm maturation. eDNA <b>masks</b> the <b>adhesive</b> properties of newly synthesized holdfast to enable the escape of swarmer cells from the biofilm. By contrast, holdfasts on previously attached stalked cells remain unaffected by eDNA. Surprisingly, the inhibitory effect was genus-specific, as only DNA from Caulobacter, but not from other genera, could interfere with biofilm maturation. This study reveals a new role for DNA in biofilms, as a regulatory rather than a structural component, and a novel mechanism to facilitate the escape of cells from biofilms. A compelling case is made {{for the existence of}} a new type of genus-specific 'macromolecular language'...|$|R
40|$|Stretchable {{electronics}} offers unsurpassed mechanical compliance on complex or soft surfaces {{like the}} human skin and organs. To fully exploit this great advantage, an autonomous {{system with a}} self-powered energy source has been sought for. Here, we present a new technology to pattern liquid alloys on soft substrates, targeting at fabrication of a hybrid-integrated power source in microfluidic stretchable electronics. By atomized spraying of a liquid alloy onto a soft surface with a tape transferred <b>adhesive</b> <b>mask,</b> a universal fabrication process is provided for high quality patterns of liquid conductors in a meter scale. With the developed multilayer fabrication technique, a microfluidic stretchable wireless power transfer device with an integrated LED was demonstrated, which could survive cycling between 0 % and 25 % strain over 1, 000 times...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{dendritic}} cell-specific ICAM- 3 -grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) in DC-T {{cell communication}} {{was assessed by}} analyzing the effect of DC-SIGN-blocking mAb in MLR. The {{results show that the}} degree of inhibition by DC-SIGN and LFA- 1 mAb depends on the magnitude of the MLR and the maturation status of the DC. Addition of DC-SIGN mAb at several time-points during MLR showed that DC-SIGN is involved early on in DC-T cell contacts. This initial role is <b>masked</b> by strong <b>adhesive</b> and costimulatory mechanisms, indicating a short-lived effect of DC-SIGN in DC-T cell interactions. To examine this concept in more detail, the percentage of PBL capable of binding DC-SIGN was determined. Analysis of several donors revealed that 1 - 20 % PBL bind to beads coated with recombinant DC-SIGN, and the DC-SIGN-binding cells comprised all major cell subsets found in blood. PBL isolated from a donor with high DC-SIGN-binding capacity were more prone to blocking by DC-SIGN mAb in MLR than PBL from a donor with low DC-SIGN-binding capacity. This study indicates an initial and transient role for DC-SIGN in T cell proliferation, which becomes apparent when T cell proliferation is low and when the percentage of DC-SIGN binding PBL is high...|$|R
40|$|Besides an atraumatic procedure, aseptic {{techniques}} {{during surgery}} {{have been suggested}} {{to have a positive}} impact on the predictability of osseointegration. To avoid an infection of the surgical field, coverage of the face of the patient (drapes) and nose (surgical mask, drape and plastic film) were advocated in order to reduce airborne infections and to prevent a contact contamination of instruments and gloves. Such a coverage, however, increases the feeling of claustrophobia when local anaesthesia is used and can lead to hypoxemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the expired air via the nostrils could contribute to the contamination of the oral surgical field. Test blood agar plates were installed for 30 min under the nose of volunteers lying on a surgical table; once with full coverage of their nostrils, as indicated above, and once without. Simultaneously, control plates were installed on a table besides the patient to measure the basic contamination from the environment. All plates were incubated both aerobically and anaerobically. The number of colony forming units (c. f. u.) recorded on test plates after aerobic and anaerobic incubation were surprisingly low, with a mean score of 2. 7 and 5. 0 c. f. u. for the uncovered situation, and 2. 5 and 3. 3 c. f. u. for the covered situation, respectively. The control plates were infected by a nearly comparable number of bacteria (means ranging from 2. 2 to 3. 2). These findings indicate that covering nostrils by a <b>mask</b> and sterile <b>adhesive</b> plastic film is not essential in avoiding airborne microbial contamination. However, the use of a meshed nose guard to prevent contact with the highly contaminated nasal skin is highly recommended. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{adherence}} of Plasmodium falciparum-infected {{red blood}} cells (IRBCs) in the human placenta is mediated by chondroitin- 4 -sulfate (C 4 S). Although IRBC binding to C 4 S has been unequivocally established, the adherence characteristics of IRBCs {{at different stages of}} parasite development and through successive parasite generations after selection for C 4 S adherence are not known. Here we show that IRBCs acquire a significant capacity to bind to C 4 S at as early as 14 h and exhibit maximum binding at 22 to 26 h postinvasion. Surprisingly, the IRBC binding ability decreases by ∼ 50 % at the late trophozoite and schizont stages. The binding strength of the IRBCs also gradually decreases during successive generations after selection for C 4 S binding, and at the 32 nd generation, the binding capacity was only ∼ 31 % of that of IRBCs at the 2 nd generation, suggesting that IRBCs eventually lose their C 4 S-adherent capacity. We also tested the susceptibility of the adhesive protein(s) on the IRBC surface to trypsin treatment at different stages of parasite development. The data show that IRBCs with late trophozoites are more resistant to trypsin treatment than those containing early trophozoites, indicating that parasite proteins expressed on the IRBC surface during trophozoite maturation partially <b>mask</b> accessibility of <b>adhesive</b> protein for binding to C 4 S. These data provide important insights into the expression pattern of the C 4 S-adhesive protein(s) on the IRBC surface, emphasizing the need for understanding the regulation of genes involved in IRBC binding to C 4 S. Our data also define the parasite stage at which IRBCs are suitable for studying structural interactions with C 4 S...|$|R
