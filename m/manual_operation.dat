5|$|Since June 2009, {{when two}} Red Line trains {{collided}} and killed nine people {{due in part}} to malfunctions in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been manually operated. The current state of <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> has led to heavily degraded service, with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks, speed restrictions, and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains, increased dwell time, and worse on-time performance. Metro originally planned to have all trains be automated again by 2017, but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues.|$|E
5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires <b>manual</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractManual tasks play an {{important}} role in social sustainable manufacturing enterprises. Commonly, <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> are used for low volume productions, but are not limited to. Operational models in manufacturing systems based on “x-to-order” paradigms (e. g. assembly-to-order) may require <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> to speed-up the ramp-up time of new product configuration assemblies. The implications of <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> in any production line may imply that any manufacturing or assembly process become more susceptible to human errors and therefore translate into delays, defects and/or poor product quality. In this scenario, virtual and augmented realities can offer significant advantages to support the human operator in <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> This research work presents the development of a mixed (virtual and augmented) reality assistance system that permits real-time support in <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> A review of mixed reality techniques and technologies was conducted, where it was determined to use a projection mapping solution for the proposed assistance system. According to the specific requirements of the demonstration environment, hardware and software components were chosen. The developed mixed reality assistance system was able to guide any user without any prior knowledge through the successful completion of the specific assembly task...|$|R

5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and where used, the water supply.|$|E
5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to <b>manual</b> <b>operation.</b> The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E

However, technical mishaps including the test train rolling away by itself delayed the start of automatic train operation. The project caused numerous service disruptions on the L at night and on weekends. Frequently, service was shut down in separate sections of the line, usually from Eighth Avenue to Lorimer Street, Lorimer to Broadway Junction, or Broadway Junction to Rockaway Parkway. During this time, shuttle buses served suspended areas. This project also required the temporary closing of some stations, either in one direction or both directions, and for the line to be operated in two sections.|$|E

2500|$|Under [...] "normal", {{progressive}} and linear acceleration and deceleration, the DSG shifts in a sequential manner; i.e., under acceleration: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th, {{and the same}} sequence reversed for deceleration. However, the DSG can also skip the normal sequential method, by missing gears, and shift two or more gears. This is most apparent if the car is being driven at sedate speeds {{in one of the}} higher gears with a light throttle opening, and the accelerator pedal is then pressed down, engaging the kick-down function. During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening. This kick-down may be engaged by any increased accelerator pedal opening, and is completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the pedal is pressed fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in <b>Manual</b> <b>operation</b> mode. The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.|$|E
