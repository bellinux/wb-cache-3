5|$|Several {{commercial}} <b>mushroom</b> ketchups {{were produced}} in the United Kingdom; some of the brands included Crosse and Blackswell's <b>Mushroom</b> Catsup, Morton's <b>Mushroom</b> Ketchup and Geo Watkins <b>Mushroom</b> Ketchup. Some of these companies exported their product to the United States, which created competition with ketchup products manufactured in the U.S. by the H. J. Heinz Company.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{difficult}} to accurately identify a safe <b>mushroom</b> without proper training and knowledge, it is often advised to assume that a wild <b>mushroom</b> is poisonous and not to consume it.|$|E
5|$|Collection of the <b>mushroom</b> for culinary use {{has also}} been {{documented}} in Nepal. However, the Nepalese do not consider it a choice <b>mushroom</b> for eating; of the three grades given to edible mushrooms, it was given the worst. Again, unlike other mushrooms, no medicinal use was reported. The <b>mushroom</b> {{has also been}} the only non-morel species exported from Nepal for culinary use.|$|E

5|$|Common names include Jersey cow <b>mushroom,</b> bovine bolete, and euro cow bolete. One {{proposed}} origin for {{the scientific}} name is that medieval knights—who revered Tricholoma equestre—considered this <b>mushroom</b> fit only for cattle-drovers as it was not highly valued.|$|E
5|$|Geo Watkins <b>Mushroom</b> Ketchup {{continues}} to be produced today. It is a commercial, mass-produced product that is marketed and purveyed to consumers, and remains available in the United Kingdom. The company was founded in 1830. It is prepared in a liquid form and has a dark brown coloration. Contemporary preparation of Geo Watkins <b>Mushroom</b> Ketchup consists mostly of water, salt, vinegar, and hydrolised vegetable protein, containing just 3% <b>mushroom</b> powder.|$|E
5|$|Use of this <b>mushroom</b> as a {{food source}} also seems to have existed in North America. A classic {{description}} of this use of A.muscaria by an African-American <b>mushroom</b> seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the <b>mushroom,</b> after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a <b>mushroom</b> sauce for steak. It is also consumed {{as a food}} in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible <b>mushroom</b> is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.|$|E
50|$|Psychedelic <b>mushrooms</b> (psilocybin <b>mushrooms),</b> {{commonly}} called magic <b>mushrooms</b> or shrooms have also long {{been used as}} entheogens.|$|R
5000|$|Many folk traditions {{concern the}} {{defining}} features of poisonous <b>mushrooms.</b> [...] However, {{there are no}} general identifiers for poisonous <b>mushrooms,</b> so such traditions are unreliable.

5|$|Various {{parts of}} the <b>mushroom</b> display {{characteristic}} color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in <b>mushroom</b> identification. The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with {{the application of a}} drop of potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. The <b>mushroom</b> flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with a drop of FeSO4, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella bombycina, {{commonly}} known as the silky sheath, silky rosegill, silver-silk straw <b>mushroom,</b> or tree <b>mushroom,</b> is a species of edible <b>mushroom</b> in the family Pluteaceae. It is an uncommon but widespread species, having been reported from Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Europe, and North America. The fruit body (<b>mushroom)</b> begins developing in a thin, egg-like sac. This ruptures and the stem expands quickly, leaving the sac {{at the base of the}} stem as a volva. The cap, which can attain a diameter of up to , is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced gills, free from attachment to the stem, and initially white before turning pink as the spores mature. The <b>mushroom</b> grows singly or in clusters, often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in elms and maples. V.bombycina contains compounds with antibacterial properties.|$|E
5|$|When young, it may {{be mistaken}} for the edible St George's <b>mushroom</b> (Calocybe gambosa) or the miller (Clitopilus prunulus). It has been {{responsible}} for many cases of <b>mushroom</b> poisoning in Europe. E.sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this <b>mushroom.</b>|$|E
50|$|Medicinal <b>mushrooms</b> are <b>mushrooms</b> or {{extracts}} from <b>mushrooms</b> that {{are thought to}} be treatments for diseases, yet remain unconfirmed in mainstream science and medicine, and so are not approved as drugs or medical treatments. Such use of <b>mushrooms</b> therefore falls into the domain of traditional medicine.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mushrooms</b> {{have been}} used for food and {{medicinal}} purposes since ancient times. The ? glucans found in <b>mushrooms</b> are currently considered to be responsible for some of the medicinal properties of <b>mushrooms,</b> thereby motivating studies to improve the content of these compounds in fungi and to understand their mechanisms of action. In this study, we tested the effect of nitrogen supplementation on the productivity and nutritional composition of Pleurotus ostreatus <b>mushrooms.</b> P. ostreatus <b>mushrooms</b> were grown in various substrates supplemented with urea or rice bran, and the biological efficiency, mineral composition, protein content and ?-glucan content of the <b>mushrooms</b> were evaluated. The growth of P. ostreatus in substrates with nitrogen supplementation increased the productivity and quality of the <b>mushrooms.</b> However, supplementing <b>mushrooms</b> with rice bran increased the mushrooms’ productivity more than supplementation with urea did. Therefore, the selection of substrates {{is an important factor in}} the composition of <b>mushrooms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Winter (strains {{white and}} yellow), shiitake (strains 271 and Taichung 1) and oyster <b>mushrooms</b> (abalone and tree oyster <b>mushrooms)</b> were {{collected}} from commercial sources. Strain yellow contained 26. 7 % of proteins (higher than other <b>mushrooms).</b> Shiitake and the two oyster <b>mushrooms</b> contained more than 60 % of carbohydrates. Arabitol {{was found in the}} highest amounts only in winter <b>mushrooms.</b> Glucose, mannitol and trehalose were found in varied amounts. Total soluble sugar contents were in the order: winter <b>mushrooms</b> > shiitake > abalone and tree oyster <b>mushrooms.</b> Total contents of free amino acids also varied and ranged from 4. 08 to 31. 5 mg g(- 1) dry weight. Contents of total 5 '-nucleotides were similar in the two winter <b>mushrooms,</b> whereas the content of flavour 5 '-nucleotides was higher in strain white. Contents of total and flavour 5 '-nucleotides were higher in strain 271 than in strain Tainung 1. The two oyster <b>mushrooms</b> were comparable in contents of flavour 5 '-nucleotides. The umami taste was in the order: strain 271 > winter <b>mushrooms</b> > two oyster <b>mushrooms</b> and strain Tainung 1. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible <b>mushroom,</b> but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly bitter and is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in butter or oil; if it is cooked in water, the flesh becomes very soft. Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for later use. As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled <b>mushroom</b> pickers prefer young fruit bodies. The urine discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health. The red-coloured azulene compounds, ingested with the <b>mushroom</b> food, are more or less excreted with the urine.|$|E
