40|$|A static {{enclosure}} {{method was}} applied to determine the exchange of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and carbonyl sulfide (OCS) between the surface of Sphagnum peatlands and the atmosphere. Measurements were performed concurrently with dynamic (flow through) <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements</b> with sulfur-free air used as sweep gas. This latter technique {{has been used to}} acquire the majority of available data on the exchange of S gases between the atmosphere and the continental surfaces and has been criticized because it is thought to overestimate the true flux of gases by disrupting natural S gas gradients. DMS emission rates determined by both methods were not statistically different between 4 and > 400 nmol m− 2 h− 1, indicating that previous data on emissions of at least DMS are probably valid. However, the increase in DMS in static enclosures was not linear, indicating the potential for a negative feedback of enclosure DMS concentrations on efflux. The dynamic enclosure method measured positive OCS flux rates (emission) at all sites, while data using static enclosures indicated that OCS was consumed from the atmosphere at these same sites at rates of 3. 7 to 55 nmol m− 2 h− 1. <b>Measurements</b> using both <b>enclosure</b> techniques at a site devoid of vegetation showed that peat was a source of both DMS and OCS. However, the rate of OCS efflux from decomposing peat was more than counterbalanced by OCS consumption by vegetation, including Sphagnum mosses, and net OCS uptake occurred at all sites.

40|$|Abstract—The {{shielding}} effectiveness (SE) <b>measurements</b> on <b>enclosures</b> with various apertures by both reverberation chamber (RC) and GTEM cell (GC) methodologies are presented. Furthermore, computer simulation through commercial software (CST) {{is used to}} compare with the experimental data. Our {{results show that the}} SE of the rectangular enclosure with five different apertures from RC is usually larger than those from GC. The reason for this is related to the random polarization and various angles of incidence within the RC, where various polarization and incident angles are averagely and randomly coupled into the EUT. However, as for the GC, the normal incidence with vertical polarization usually corresponds to the worse case, which leads to the worse SE of the enclosure. Surprisingly, an abnormal phenomenon is found from the enclosure with nine periodic rectangles. According to Charles F Bunting’s work, moreover, it is still reasonable because many rectangular apertures on the enclosure may lead to a fact that the coupled energy of oblique incidence may be larger than that of normal incidence. Finally, we obtain conclusions about the use of two experimental methodologies in SE measurement. 1...|$|R

Despite warm and sunny conditions, midday isoprene concentrations were low, averaging 0. 39 nL/L. Fluxes of isoprene increased through the morning hours, with midday fluxes averaging 0. 34 mg m- 2 h- 1 and a maximum measured flux of approximately 1. 0 mg m- 2 h- 1. Consistent with these low fluxes, leaf <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements</b> of woody species within the tower footprint determined that only one isoprene-emitting species, Acacia nigrescens, was present in significant numbers, comprising less than 10 % of the woody biomass. Combining enclosure data with species composition and leaf area index data from the site, we estimated that the isoprene emission capacity of the vegetation within the vicinity of the tower was very low, approximately 0. 47 mg m- 2 h- 1, and patchy. Under these circumstances, low and variable fluxes are expected. Additional leaf <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements,</b> for a total of 121 species, were made at other locations, and approximately 35 % of the species was found to emit significant amounts of isoprene. Important isoprene emitting plant families included Caesalpinaceae, Mimosaceae, Papilionaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, and Myrtaceae. Twelve members of the important savanna genus Acacia were measured, of which five species, all belonging in Subgenus Aculeiferum, Section Aculeiferum, were found to emit significant amounts of isoprene.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compound}} (VOC) emission fluxes from Gorse (Ulex europaeus) were measured during May 30 – 31, 1995 at Kelling Heath in eastern England by using bag enclosure and gradient methods simultaneously. The <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements</b> {{were made from}} branches {{at different stages of}} physiological development (flowering, after flowering, and mixed). Isoprene was found to represent 90 % of the total VOC emissions, and its emission rates fluctuated from 6 ng (g dwt) − 1 h− 1 in the early morning to about 9700 ng(g dwt) − 1 h− 1 at midday. Averaged emission rates standardized to 20 °C were 1625, 2120, and 3700 ng (g dwt) − 1 h− 1 for the new grown, “mixed,” and flowering branch, respectively. Trans-ocimene and α-pinene were the main monoterpenes emitted and represented, on average, 47. 6 % and 36. 9 % of the total monoterpenes. Other monoterpenes, camphene, sabinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene and γ-terpinene, were positively identified but together represented less than 1. 5 % of the total VOC emissions from gorse. Maximum isoprene concentrations in air at the site were measured around midday at 2 m (174 parts per trillion by volume, or pptv) and 6 m (149 pptv), and minimum concentrations were measured during the night (8 pptv at both heights). Mean daytime α-pinene air concentrations of 141 and 60 pptv at 2 and 6 m height were determined, but trans-ocimene concentrations were less than the analytical detection limit (4 pptv), suggesting rapid chemical removal of this compound from air. The isoprene fluxes calculated by the micrometeorological gradient method showed a pattern similar to that of those calculated by the enclosure method, with isoprene emission rates maximum at midday (100 μg m− 2 h− 1) and not detectable during the nighttime. Assessment of the fraction of the site covered by gorse plants enabled an extrapolation of emission fluxes from the <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements.</b> When averaged over the 2 day experiment, isoprene fluxes of 29. 8 and 27. 8 μg m− 2 h− 1 were obtained from the gradient and the enclosure extrapolation respectively.

The comparison of these 'leaf temperature-dependent enzyme capacities' and the measured emission rates revealed that the enzyme activity of isoprene synthase is comparable to the observed isoprene emission rates. In addition, variation in the isoprene synthase activity of the leaves due to changes in light intensity during leaf development was investigated. A 50 % reduction of light intensity by shading of single branches reduced isoprene synthase activity by = 60 % compared with full sunlight.

40|$|Isoprene fluxes were {{estimated}} using eight different measurement techniques at a forested site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during July and August 1992. Fluxes from individual leaves and entire branches {{were estimated}} with four enclosure systems, including one system that controls leaf temperature and light. Variations in isoprene emission {{with changes in}} light, temperature, and canopy depth were investigated with leaf <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements.</b> Representative emission rates for the dominant vegetation in the region were determined with branch <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements.</b> Species from six tree genera had negligible isoprene emissions, while significant emissions were observed for Quercus, Liquidambar, and Nyssa species. Abovecanopy isoprene fluxes were estimated with surface layer gradients and relaxed eddy accumulation measurements from a 44 -m tower. Midday net emission fluxes from the canopy were typically 3 to 5 mg C m- 2 h- 1, although net isoprene deposition fluxes of- 0. 2 to - 2 mg C m- 2 h- 1 were occasionally observed in early morning and late afternoon. Above-canopy CO 2 fluxes estimated by eddy correlation using either an open path sensor or a closed path sensor agreed within ± 5 %. Relaxed eddy accumulation estimates of CO 2 fluxes were within 15 % of the eddy correlation estimates. Daytime isoprene mixing ratios in the mixed layer were investigated with a tethered balloon sampling system and ranged from 0. 2 to 5 ppbv, averaging 0. 8 ppbv. The isoprene mixing ratios in the mixed layer above the forested landscape were used to estimate isoprene fluxes of 2 to 8 mg C m- 2 h- 1 with mixed layer gradient and mixed layer mass balance techniques. Total foliar density and dominant tree species composition for an approximately 8100 km 2 region were estimated using high-resolution (30 m) satellite data with classifications supervised by ground measurements. A biogenic isoprene emission model used to compare flux measurements, ranging from leaf scale (10 cm 2) to landscape scale (102 km 2), indicated agreement to within ± 25 %, the uncertainty associated with these measurement techniques. Existing biogenic emission models use isoprene emission rate capacities that range from 14. 7 to 70 μg C g- 1 h- 1 (leaf temperature of 30 °C and photosynthetically active radiation of 1000 μmol m- 2 s- 1) for oak foliage.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{inventory of}} nitrate (NO 3) in San Francisco Bay (SFB) is unavailable to the resident phytoplankton {{most of the}} year due to the presence of ammonium (NH 4) at inhibitory concentrations that prevents NO 3 uptake. Low annual primary productivity in this turbid estuary is generally attributed to the poor irradiance conditions. However, {{this may not be the}} only cause; spring phytoplankton blooms occur irregularly in north SFB only when NH 4 concentrations are low, < 4 mmol L 1 and NO 3 uptake by phytoplankton occurs. Field <b>measurements</b> and <b>enclosure</b> experiments confirm the NH 4 inhibition process to be the cause of low NO 3 utilization {{most of the year}}. Detailed analysis of spring blooms in three embayments of SFB over 3 years shows a consistent sequence of events that result in bursts of chlorophyll. The first requirement is im-proved irradiance conditions through stabilization of the water column by stratification or reduced tidal activity. Second, NH 4 concentrations must be reduced to a critical range, 1 to 4 mmol L 1 through dilution by precipitation and by phytoplankton uptake. This enables rapid uptake of NO 3 and subsequent increase in chlorophyll. The resulting bloom is due to both the initial uptake of NH 4 and the subsequent uptake of NO 3. The NO 3 uptake step is crucial since it is the larger nitrogen source and uptake occurs at higher rates than that for NH 4 at the concentrations that occur in SFB. Existing models of light-limited, non-nutrient limited productivity in SFB require modification to include the NH 4 inhibition ef-fect. From measured NH 4 uptake rates and initial concentrations, calculations can be made to predict the length of time that favorable irradiance conditions are required for the phytoplankton population to reduce ambient NH 4 concentrations to non-inhibiting concentrations and allo...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} carbon and nutrient cycling and the role of root dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems such as large abandoned pastures and natural grasslands present in the Prealps, for which below-ground processes are currently enigmatic. In particular, we quantified root/leaf biomass and C:N ratio throughout two growing seasons. Additionally, root traits such as root length density (RLD), root mass density (RMD), and root diameter classes (RDC) were also investigated with the aim of understanding the spatial distribution of roots in the soil. In our samples, we found that the roots could be divided into three main diameter classes and hence quantified the presence of each class along the soil profile. With regard to total root biomass, we found the occurrence of two peaks of biomass accumulation during the growth season, and when biomass accumulation was compared with climatic data, it was impossible to obtain a clear indication of the root turnover rate. In fact, the strong influence of grazing on the above-ground biomass could have affected, in turn, root biomass. In future, this possible complication will be avoided by repeating the <b>measurements</b> within <b>enclosures</b> to avoid grazing interference. We found that C:N ratio remained constant, with a single peak, suggesting a lower root decomposition during the warmest period (August 2006). The concentration of nitrogen in roots decreased with depth as a result of a decrease in roots with smaller diameters. The reverse was found for carbon content, which increased with depth, probably due to an increase in roots with larger diameters.

Within the present study, a modified CANVEG scheme is described. A generic parameterization and characterization of biophysical properties of Amazon rain forest canopies is inferred using available field measurements of canopy structure, in-canopy profiles of horizontal wind speed and radiation, canopy albedo, soil heat flux and soil respiration, photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen as well as leaf level <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements</b> made on sunlit and shaded branches of several Amazonian tree species during the wet and dry season. The sensitivity of calculated canopy energy and CO 2 fluxes to the uncertainty of individual parameter values is assessed. In the companion paper, the predicted seasonal exchange of energy, CO 2, ozone and isoprene is compared to observations. A bi-modal distribution of leaf area density with a total leaf area index of 6 is inferred from several observations in Amazonia. Predicted light attenuation within the canopy agrees reasonably well with observations made at different field sites. A comparison of predicted and observed canopy albedo shows a high model sensitivity to the leaf optical parameters for near-infrared short-wave radiation (NIR). The predictions agree much better with observations when the leaf reflectance and transmission coefficients for NIR are reduced by 25 ? 40 %. Available vertical distributions of photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen concentration suggest a low but significant light acclimation of the rain forest canopy that scales nearly linearly with accumulated leaf area. Evaluation of the biochemical leaf model, using the <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements,</b> showed that recommended parameter values describing the photosynthetic light response, have to be optimized. Otherwise, predicted net assimilation is overestimated by 30 ? 50 %. Two stomatal models have been tested, which apply a well established semi-empirical relationship between stomatal conductance and net assimilation. Both models differ in the way they describe the influence of humidity on stomatal response. However, they show a very similar performance within the range of observed environmental conditions. The agreement between predicted and observed stomatal conductance rates is reasonable. In general, the leaf level data suggests seasonal physiological changes, which can be reproduced reasonably well by assuming increased stomatal conductance rates during the wet season, and decreased assimilation rates during the dry season. The sensitivity of the predicted canopy fluxes of energy and CO 2 to the parameterization of canopy structure, the leaf optical parameters, and the scaling of photosynthetic parameters is relatively low (1 ? 12 %), with respect to parameter uncertainty. In contrast, modifying leaf model parameters within their uncertainty range results in much larger changes of the predicted canopy net fluxes (5 ? 35 %) ...|$|R

Branch <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements</b> on senescent, young, and mature leaves showed that leaf development had a pronounced impact on the aldehyde exchange behavior with respect to both the direction and {{the magnitude of the}} exchange. The emission activity of senescent leaves was associated with a negative CO 2 balance, even during daytime, indicative of a catabolic metabolism and decomposition processes leading to an increased aldehyde production within the leaf. The low exchange rates observed in young leaves were attributed to low stomatal conductance, while in mature leaves stomatal conductance and metabolic activities allowed efficient uptake. Within each leaf class the diurnal variations in the exchange of both aldehyde compounds were found to be mainly dependent on the respective ambient air concentrations. High ambient air concentrations resulted in decreased emission rates of senescent leaves and in enhanced uptake in young and mature leaves. CH 3 CHO compensation points decreased from 1. 8 to 1. 1 ppb with leaf maturation. We provide evidence that leaf-age-dependent variations in the stomatal conductance can account for the major share of differences in the CH 3 CHO deposition velocity.

In literature many works {{can be found on}} this topic, but until now no attention has been focused on the analytical form of the cross-power spectra (CPs) between the system outputs when a fluid-structure coupling is present. In this work it is shown that the CPs modal decomposition depends on the choice of the references, i. e. acoustical or structural. At first it is theoretically pointed out that the CP formulation for the acoustical and structural case is formally identical if appropriately pre-processed. Then, this theoretical result is verified through the results of an extensive experimental testing on the helicopter EUROCOPTER EC- 135. The CPs between the structural output velocities and the acoustical response of the microphone inside the helicopter cabin are considered as inputs of an OMA. In order to verify the effectiveness of the modal model so obtained a classical modal analysis is also performed. The acoustical reference choice reveals to be suitable for a vibro-acoustical OMA.

Fluxes of NO averaged 8. 9 (+ 1. 5) x 109 molecules crn- 2 s- 1 from the dominant (yellow clay) soils of the region, with larger fluxes (33. 7 (_+ 6. 5) x 109 molecules cm- 2 s- 1) observed from adjacent white sand softs. Fluxes from clay softs were lower {{by more than a}} factor of 5 than fluxes observed during the dry season at a nearby site. Low soil emission rates were reflected in lower concentrations of NO {{at the top of the}} forest canopy in the wet season, only 30 - 50 pptv (parts per trillion by volme) during the daytime. The meas-ured fluxes are consistent with chemical mass balances for NO within the forest canopy, calculated from the NO and 03 profiles taken at night, and with observations of NO between 150 and 5000 m altitude (A. L. Torres and K. R. Hooks, unpublished manuscript, 1989). Measurements of NO emission rates from soil plots fertilized using NaNO 3, NH 4 C 1 or sucrose indicated that a reducfive pathway (alenitrification) may have been primarily responsible for production of the NO released by both clay and sand softs. 1.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of air flow patterns and related passive scalar transport inside an open-fronted containment facility, {{with emphasis on}} the interaction with the laboratory environment. Time-averaged and instantaneous structures of the turbulent jlow were examined by visualization and local <b>measurements</b> inside the <b>enclosure</b> and at the front aperture of 1200 mm x 500 mm cross-section. The cabinet was scavenged at an extractflowrate of 0. 310 m 3 /s with 95 per cent of the air passing through the front aperture at a spatially averaged air velocity of 0. 5 m/s and 5 per cent supplied through an auxiliary aperture of 1200 mm x 15 mm cross-section located at {{the front edge of}} the ceiling of the enclosure. Sulphur hexajluoride was used to mark the jlow and the distributions of its time-averaged concentration over the front aperture and inside the cabinet were used to deduce the degree of mixing and passive scalar transport. The geometrical features of the cabinet provided a $ow $eld with a spanwise vortex at the upper frontal part of the enclosure, whose cross-sectional dimension was larger close to the side walls where the velocity of the injlowing air was lower than in the central region. The spanwise vortex implemented to improve capture efficiency at low inflowing air velocities can be detrimental to the stability of the injlowing air stream along the sash handle, leading e of the passive scalar encapsulated within the vortex itself. Without external disturbances, the leakage from the vortex periodic bursts generated by the oscillations at the periphery of the spanwise vortex, but these oscillations become mo the cross-draught. The structure and the orientation of the vortex were vulnerable to external disturbances in that the vortex was tilted and pushed below the sash level on one side, resulting in asymmetrical leakage...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) fluxes were measured in three U. S. woodlands in summer 1993. Fluxes from individual leaves and branches were estimated with enclosure techniques and used to initialize and evaluate VOC emission model estimates. Ambient measurements were used to estimate above canopy fluxes for entire stands and landscapes. The branch enclosure experiments revealed 78 VOCs. Hexenol derivatives were the most commonly observed oxygenated compounds. The branch measurements also revealed high rates of isoprene emission from three genera of plants (Albizia, Chusqua and Mahonia) and high rates of monoterpene emission from three genera (Atriplex, Chrysthamnus and Sorbus) for which VOC emission rates have not been reported. Measurements on an additional 34 species confirmed previous results. Leaf <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements</b> of isoprene emission rates from Quercus were substantially higher than the rates used in existing emission models. Model predictions of diurnal variations in isoprene fluxes were generally within ± 35 % of observed flux variations. Measurements with a fast response analyzer demonstrated that 60 min is a reasonable time resolution for biogenic emission models. Average daytime stand scale (hundreds of m) flux measurements ranged from about 1. 3 mg C m- 2 h- 1 for a shrub oak stand to 1. 5 - 2. 5 mg C m- 2 h- 1 for a mixed forest stand. Morning, evening and nighttime fluxes were less than 0. 1 mg C m- 2 h- 1. Average daytime landscape scale (tens of km) flux measurements ranged from about 3 mg C m- 2 h- 1 for a shrub oak-aspen and rangeland landscape to about 7 mg C m- 2 h- 1 for a deciduous forest landscape. Fluxes predicted by recent versions (BEIS 2, BEIS 2. 1) of a biogenic emission model were within 10 to 50 % of observed fluxes and about 300 % higher than those predicted by a previous version of the model (BEIS) ...|$|R
40|$|This work is an {{experimental}} and theoretical analysis of factors and conditions affecting smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) production in corridor-like enclosure fires. Thirty eight experiments were {{performed in a}} three metre long corridor-like enclosure having a cross section 0. 5 m x 0. 5 m, door-like openings in the front panel and a propane gas burner located near the closed end. Measurements of smoke and carbon monoxide concentrations were performed at locations inside the enclosure {{and also in the}} exhaust duct of a hood collecting the combustion products. The main conclusion of this work is that smoke production depends not only on the fuel and Global Equivalence Ratio (GER) - as is reported in the literature - but also on the temperatures and residence time inside the enclosure, at least for the experimental conditions examined in this study. Additionaly, it was found that smoke concentration inside the enclosure was increasing during the ventilation controlled regime even after external burning started. Such increase was verified by temperature, smoke and velocity <b>measurements</b> inside the <b>enclosure.</b> The increase was due to reverse flow behind the flames travelling along the corridor. Namely, the gases reversed direction behind the flames with hot gases travelling in the upper layer backwards towards the closed end of the corridor in contrast to hot gas movements towards the opening in front of the flames. This recirculation was confirmed by velocity and oxygen concentration measurements in the upper and lower layers inside the enclosure. In addition, the present results show that the relationship reported in the literature between smoke and carbon monoxide production during overventilated conditions Yco/Ys = constant, is no longer valid during an underventilated enclosure fire. The ratio Yco/Ys increases for the Global Equivalence Ratios of the enclosure greater than one. The obtained results are useful for CFD validation and specifically applicable for assessing smoke hazards in corridor fires in buildings where smoke concentrations can be much larger than anticipated owing to leakage to adjacent rooms behind travelling flames.

40|$|The {{development}} and use of a'n experimental test rig is reported which is capable of modelling two- and three-dimensional wall-bounded air jets. This test rig was primarily produced in order to facilitate the experimental verification of computer codes for calculating convective heat transfer within mechanically- ventilated enclosures. Special attention was therefore given {{in the design of the}} rig to heat transfer <b>measurements</b> within such <b>enclosures.</b> The analogy between heat and mass transfer and the application of the naphthalene sublimation technique are explained. Also use of phase change paints in heat transfer measurements in general, and wall-jets in particular, is discussed and experimentally demonstrated. The boundary conditions for the application of each of the above two methods are then specified. The mass transfer method may be used for the case of a heated plate and a jet at ambient temperature while the phase change paint method is applicable to a heated jet. Heat/mass transfer studies are carried out for two different geometries. First beneath a plane wall-jet- obstructed by a normal flat-plate (Alamdari, Hammond and Montazerin (1986 bound paper)), where the data are compared with the computations of the 'intermediate-level' convection model of Alamdari and Hammond (1982) and the high-level 'elliptic' finite domain flow model of Pun and Spalding (1977). The comparison has been a clear demonstration of the capabilities of the computer codes and has shown that although their results over flat surfaces are in good agreement with the test data, their predictions for jets flowing round corners need further research. Secondly the flow and heat transfer characteristics of a three-dimensional jet parallel to a flat plate has been studied. In this case the flow field and mass transfer are modelled and an equation is finally derived which estimates the average heat transfer over a plate parallel to a bluff-jet for a variety of off-set heights, Reynolds numbers and nozzle aspect ratios and can readily be used by design engineers handling such flows...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between the atmosphere and the biosphere have been studied {{to a great extent}} in the last decades; it cannot be denied that these systems are altering each other’s processes. The production of terpenoid compounds by vegetation is an example of such interactions. Ecological and atmospheric scientists are interested in the production and emission of terpenoid compounds. However, they are studying them from substantially different points of view, driven largely by the scales at which they approach the process. The aim of my dissertation was to study biogenic emissions and their effect on atmospheric chemistry using variables such as landscape structure, landscape configuration, and developmental stage; factors that have not been considered before from an atmospheric point of view. The main questions of my study were: (1) Does understory vegetation have an impact on regional emissions? (2) Does developmental stage affect terpenoid emissions? (3) Does the light environment in the forest affect the rate at which terpenoid compounds are emitted? To answer these questions, field studies were performed and terpenoid emissions were measured using branch <b>enclosure</b> <b>measurements</b> and GC-MS techniques. The first question was assessed by using Pteridium aquilinum, one of the most abundant understory species. We determined that Pteridium was a terpenoid emitter, but its emissions did not influence the regional atmospheric chemistry. Nevertheless, this study is a first step to consider the herbaceous layer when studying monoterpene emissions. The second question studied the difference in emissions of Pinus ponderosa seedlings and mature trees, finding {{a significant difference in the}} magnitude of the emissions but not in their chemical composition; emissions of seedlings were greater. In this case, this study is one of the first on the developmental stage and monoterpene emissions in a woody species. The third question, addressing the differences of emissions of sun and shaded branches of Pinus ponderosa, found a significant difference between the branches’ emissions. The results of the different questions addressed in this work show that it is necessary to incorporate landscape component to have a better understanding of the production and effects of BVOC’s compounds in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{study of the}} ozone effects on agricultural and forest vegetation requires {{the knowledge of the}} pollutant dose absorbed by plants via leaf stomata, i. e. the stomatal flux. Nevertheless, the toxicologically effective dose can differ from the stomatal flux because a pool of scavenging and detoxification processes reduce the amount of pollutant responsible of the expression of the harmful effects. The measurement of the stomatal flux is not immediate and the quantification of the effective dose is still troublesome. The paper examines the conceptual aspects of ozone flux measurement and modelling in agricultural and ecological research. The ozone flux paradigm is conceptualized into a toxicological frame and faced at two different scales: leaf/shoot and canopy scales. Leaf and shoot scale flux <b>measurements</b> require gas-exchange <b>enclosure</b> techniques, while canopy scale flux measurements need a micrometeorological approach including techniques such as eddy covariance and the aerodynamical gradient. At both scales, not all the measured ozone flux is stomatal flux. In fact, a not negligible amount of ozone is destroyed on external plant surfaces, like leaf cuticles, or by gas phase reaction with biogenic volatile compounds. The stomatal portion of flux can be calculated from concurrent measurements of water vapour fluxes at both scales. Canopy level flux measurements require very fast sensors and the fulfilment of many conditions to ensure that the measurements made above the canopy really reflect the canopy fluxes (constant flux hypothesis). Again, adjustments are necessary in order to correct for air density fluctuations and sensor-surface alignment break. As far as regards flux modelling, at leaf level the stomatal flux is simply obtained by multiplying the ozone concentration on the leaf with the stomatal conductance predicted by means of physiological models fed by meteorological parameter. At canopy level the stomatal flux is calculated by SVAT models often based on the energy balance of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system and on the big-leaf concept. This latter assumes the canopy as equivalent to a single leaf having a leaf area equal to the total area of all the plant&rsquo;s leaves and lying at a certain height above the ground. The complexity of SVAT models ranges from one-dimensional to three-dimensional models. The most used are one-dimensional models in single-layer, dual-source or multi-layer version. The main uncertainties in flux modelling are currently associated to the estimation of the non-stomatal flux component and to the up-scaling process from leaf to canopy and stand level. For the latter a separate representation of sunlit and shaded leaves is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Sensor and {{instrumentation}} networks operating inside aircraft wings, unmanned air vehicle (UAV) fuselage, small submarine craft and/or automobile engine compartments {{could be}} significantly enhanced or enabled by implementing radio communications within these spaces. A wired infrastructure can be cumbersome and expensive {{to install and}} maintain inside challenging environments such as aircraft and submarines. Furthermore, wire bundles and assemblies can be heavy, and flight vehicle environments are particularly sensitive to mass distribution. Wireless sensor and instrumentation networks would offer an alternative to their wired counterparts, and could alleviate many of the aforementioned concerns associated with wired assemblies. Furthermore, wireless sensor networks could be quickly deployed in these environments, enabling rapidprototype instrumentation and sensor systems. The nodes of this network are envisioned to be quite small such that the environments they are measuring are not appreciably affected {{by the presence of}} the nodes themselves. Perhaps the size of a dime, these sensor nodes would nominally contain all of the sensors, processors, antennas, communications subsystems and energy storage elements necessary to perform the required instrumentation operations in these proposed environments. However, the interior enclosures of aircraft wings, UAV fuselage and small submarines are highly reverberant to propagating electromagnetic waves due to the metallic walls surrounding the space, and energy that is transmitted within the enclosure by a radio device can be expected to remain in the space for long durations in time. This lingering of energy can cause the communications channel dispersion in the enclosure to be considerable, potentially limiting and/or degrading communications. The work described in this dissertation studies the wireless RF communications channel native to these enclosures to better understand the unique characteristics of this channel, referred to as the enclosed space radio channel. For the purposes of this research, the enclosures considered are generally described as being 1) several meters or less per dimension, 2) enclosed by metallic boundaries on many or all sides, and 3) filled with non-uniform objects and/or obstructions. Measurements of the channel dispersion in two representative enclosures are made between 200 MHz and 20. 0 GHz, utilizing the metrics of RMS delay spread, mean excess delay, and the 50 % and 90 % coherence bandwidth. A model for the channel dispersion is formed based on simple descriptions of the enclosure, and it is shown that this model matches the measured data well. A model for the gain of the enclosed space channel is developed and presented, and this model also demonstrates a good match to the gain measured in the channel. The dynamic range of the enclosed space channel gain is measured and modeled, and both theory and the measurements show that the dynamic range is bounded in a high-frequency limit. Both the dispersion model and gain model utilize the enclosure quality factor as a critical parameter, and through the quality factor an important tradeoff between gain and dispersion is seen. <b>Measurements</b> of the <b>enclosures</b> used in this work show average RMS delay spreads of 100 - 300 ns and 50 % coherence bandwidths of 1 - 5 MHz, indicating that the dispersion in these enclosures is less than the dispersion seen in the outdoor mobile communications channel, but greater than the dispersion seen in the indoor wireless communications channel. Measurements of the gain in these enclosures show average values between - 10 and - 30 dB—considerably larger than the gain typically seen in the indoor or outdoor channels. Single-carrier communications experiments using real signals of several different modulation formats are made between 3. 0 and 18. 0 GHz, and the results show that data rates up to 5 Mbps are readily obtainable. The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multicarrier modulation scheme is evaluated in the enclosed space channel, and results suggest that data rates up to 54 Mbps are possible using the IEEE 802. 11 a communications standard...|$|R
