5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of <b>megalomania</b> and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition, an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into an historical cliché.|$|E
5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted {{to him that he}} was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen. However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than <b>megalomania,</b> his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E
5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his <b>megalomania</b> had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, {{delusions}} of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was quite ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E
25|$|Edmund Bergler also {{considered}} <b>megalomania</b> {{to be normal}} in the child, and {{for it to be}} reactivated in later life in gambling. Otto Fenichel states that, for those who react in later life to narcissistic hurt with denial, a similar regression to the <b>megalomania</b> of childhood is taking place.|$|E

25|$|Chevy's second {{marriage}} to Jacqueline Carlin was formalized on December 4, 1976. After {{one year and}} five months, they divorced. During this period, Chase's daily cocaine consumption was reportedly more than two grams (0.07oz), and {{the side effects of}} such drug use were <b>megalomania,</b> paranoia, and incoherence.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, Featherston is {{a victim}} of his own <b>megalomania,</b> as he forces himself to attempt to {{accomplish}} increasingly dangerous goals in order to maintain his own belief in his greatness. He expresses several times his opinion that, without him, the Confederate States of America would amount to nothing, and that race relations would rot the core of the Confederate nation.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Beatty {{wrote to}} his wife that Churchill should either give the Admiralty his full {{attention}} or leave it alone, but his “flying about and putting his finger to pies which do not concern him is bound to lead to disaster”. Churchill believed that he had “special knowledge” {{and an ability to}} improvise solutions, but others saw it as <b>megalomania.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} who {{credited}} Hitler with the classic symptoms of schizophrenia was the Canadian psychiatrist W.H.D.Vernon; in 1942, he argued in an essay that Hitler was suffering from hallucinations, hearing voices, paranoia and <b>megalomania.</b> Vernon wrote that Hitler’s personality structure – although overall {{within the range of}} normal – should be described as leaning towards the paranoid type.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{members are}} vocalists Lene Nystrøm and René Dif, keyboardist Søren Rasted, and guitarist Claus Norreen. During their split, Nystrøm, Dif and Rasted all {{achieved}} solo chart success, and Norreen {{continued in the}} music industry remixing other artists' material. At a press event on 26 October 2007, the group announced a reunion tour, as well as the release of a compilation album featuring new material. Their third album, <b>Megalomania,</b> was released on 3 October 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Psychopathography of Adolf Hitler is an {{umbrella}} term for psychiatric (pathographic, psychobiographic) literature {{that deals with}} {{the hypothesis that the}} German Führer and Reichskanzler Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) suffered from mental illness. Both during his lifetime and after his death, Hitler has often been associated with mental disorders such as hysteria, <b>megalomania</b> or paranoid schizophrenia. Psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who have diagnosed Hitler as having mental disturbance include well-known figures such as Walter C. Langer and Erich Fromm. Other researchers, such as Fritz Redlich, have concluded that Hitler probably did not have these disorders.|$|E
25|$|Khánh {{drafted a}} new constitution, {{known as the}} Vũng Tàu Charter, which would have {{augmented}} his personal power and hamstrung Minh of what authority he had left. However, this only served to weaken Khánh as large demonstrations and riots {{broke out in the}} cities, with the Buddhists prominent, calling {{for an end to the}} state of emergency and the new constitution. Thích Trí Quang thought that, as Khánh would not use his power to remove Diệmists, it was merely an expression of <b>megalomania.</b> Some of the riots were sectarian, resulting in several deaths. Information Ministry buildings and radio stations were set on fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} prove that Hitler had a fully {{developed}} psychosis in a clinical sense has only occasionally been made. An example is the book Hitler, Steiner, Schreber (1966) by the Freiburg psychiatrist Wolfgang Treher. Treher explains that both Rudolf Steiner (whose anthroposophy he attributes to mental illness) and Hitler suffered from schizophrenia. He writes that both managed {{to stay in touch}} with reality because they had the opportunity to create their own organizations (Steiner: the Anthroposophical Society; Hitler: the NSDAP and its many subdivisions) that they could influence according to their delusions – and therefore avoid the, normally expected, “schizophrenic withdrawal”. Treher finds that Hitler’s <b>megalomania</b> and paranoia are quite striking.|$|E
25|$|Like most archetypical villains, Voldemort's arrogance {{leads to}} his downfall. He also {{suffers from a}} {{pathological}} fear of death, which he regards as a shameful and ignominious human weakness. However, while he had many traits of a megalomaniac, {{he did not have}} all, as one common trait associated with <b>megalomania</b> and narcissists was shifting blame. Voldemort admitted he paid an expensive price in attacking the parents of Harry Potter, and carefully studied what went wrong when reorganizing his Death Eaters, ultimately placing the blame upon himself. According to Rowling, his Boggart would be his own corpse. Rowling also said that the difference between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry accepts mortality, and thus Harry is in the end stronger than his nemesis.|$|E
500|$|... {{gave rise}} to a bitter and {{prolonged}} reaction which convulsed the course of national politics for the next decade. In Ontario it had been demanded and applauded by the Orange element as the punishment of treason and a vindication of loyalty. In Quebec Riel was defended, despite his apostasy and <b>megalomania,</b> as the symbol, indeed as a hero of his race.|$|E
500|$|Lalich {{states that}} Applewhite fit [...] "the {{traditional}} {{view of a}} charismatic leader", and Evan Thomas deems him a [...] "master manipulator". Lifton compares Applewhite to Shoko Asahara, the founder of Aum Shinrikyo, describing him as [...] "equally controlling, his paranoia and <b>megalomania</b> gentler yet ever present". Christopher Partridge of Lancaster University states that Applewhite and Nettles were similar to John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton, who founded Muggletonianism, a millennialist movement in 17th century England.|$|E
500|$|... "Playmate to Jesus" [...] {{is a song}} by Danish-Norwegian pop band Aqua {{from their}} third studio album, <b>Megalomania.</b> The song, which was {{released}} in 2011, is about universal love and [...] "what goes around comes around". The song was published {{the same day as}} their other single, [...] "Like a Robot", which was originally planned to be released in July 2011. Despite the song's positive critical reaction, it only charted in Denmark, becoming the group's second lowest-charting single. The music video, directed by Michael Sauer Christensen and filmed in Lyngby, Denmark, premiered on 22 September 2011.|$|E
500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} performance, critical {{reactions to}} the song were mixed to positive. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic, {{in a review of}} <b>Megalomania,</b> viewed [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] as one of the highlight songs of the album saying, [...] "The sweeping strings, inspired sound effects, and driving country-pop melodies of the lushly produced opener 'Playmate to Jesus', [...] shows the reunion hasn't been completely without merit." [...] Time said the song [...] "has the dubious distinction of sounding vaguely like a Lady Gaga track that didn’t pass quality control," [...] but was [...] "relatively catchy, boasting the kind of musical infectiousness that causes you to hum it under your breath on the subway." ...|$|E
500|$|Referencing Zahn's {{annotations}} in the 20th Anniversary Edition of Heir to the Empire, John Booth {{wrote in}} Wired that Zahn [...] "created and developed Thrawn {{as a character}} [...] deliberately establishing the Grand Admiral as a villain who leads not by coercion and fear but through valuing strategy and loyalty". Zahn explained in 2008 that Thrawn's version of the Empire is different than that of Palpatine because Thrawn does not have Palpatine's <b>megalomania</b> and xenophobia. Calling Thrawn and Mara Jade his favorite of the characters he created, Zahn noted in 2006 that writing the Grand Admiral [...] "provides the intellectual challenge of {{trying to come up}} with new, clever, and (hopefully) workable tactics and strategies".|$|E
500|$|Gooch {{believes}} there is a contradiction between Sadler's advocacy of science and reason and his support of the avant-garde theological, [...] "inter-planetary" [...] contents of The Urantia Book. Gardner describes Sadler's life story as [...] "riveting" [...] and summarizes him as an [...] "intelligent, gifted" [...] person who proved to be [...] "gullible" [...] about alleged supernatural revelations. He contends that Sadler eventually developed <b>megalomania</b> that was unrecognized by those around him and argues that Sadler succumbed to hubris and began {{to believe that he}} was a prophet, divinely chosen as the founder and leader of a new religion. Lewis disputes this characterization, maintaining that Sadler and those around him sought only to clarify and explain the teachings of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} by DVD Verdict, Mike Pinsky stated that [...] "Turning the third episode over {{to such a}} character, when Michael passes off {{responsibility}} for picking a corporate health care plan to Dwight, is meant to draw laughs out of his <b>megalomania.</b> But it just is not that funny." [...] Travis Fickett from IGN wrote positively of the episode, giving it a 7.9/10 [...] "good" [...] rating. He noted that [...] "there's something Stephen King about Dwight that creates an underlying layer of menace" [...] and that the episode is [...] "an early incarnation of [...] early days, its original [...] "paradigm" [...] – and arguably its strongest." [...] IGN later placed Jim and Pam's prank of creating fake diseases as ninth in its [...] "Top Ten Moments from The Office". Television Without Pity awarded the episode an A rating.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{undertook}} {{a significant amount}} of background research in preparation for writing Moonraker; he asked his fellow correspondent on The Sunday Times, Anthony Terry, for information on the Second World War German resistance force—the Werewolves—and German V-2 rockets. The latter was a subject on which he wrote to the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and the British Interplanetary Society. Fleming also visited the Wimpole Street psychiatrist Eric Strauss to discuss the traits of megalomaniacs; Strauss lent him the book Men of Genius, which provided the link between <b>megalomania</b> and childhood thumb-sucking. Fleming used this information to give Drax diastema, a common result of thumb-sucking. According to his biographer Andrew Lycett, Fleming [...] "wanted to make Moonraker his most ambitious and personal novel yet." [...] Fleming, a keen card player, was fascinated by the background to the 1890 royal baccarat scandal, and when in 1953 he met a woman who had been present at the game, he questioned her so intently that she burst into tears.|$|E
500|$|Superhuman {{psychologist}} Leonard Samson says of Osborn: [...] "In clinical terms, {{the words}} psychotic and psychopathic {{are far from}} synonymous... but in Norman Osborn's case, both apply. I'd characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic <b>megalomania</b> and malignant narcissism. In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes {{him one of the}} most dangerous human beings on the planet." [...] There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit that he has made mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father.|$|E
500|$|A {{preview of}} [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] was {{uploaded}} to Universal Music's Danish YouTube account on 6 September 2011. It was released as the album's second single {{and as a}} radio single on 12 September, {{the same day as}} their club single [...] "Like a Robot", which was originally planned to be released in July. [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] is the first track of their third album <b>Megalomania.</b> The track was Aqua's second-lowest charting single. It debuted at number twenty-six on the Danish Singles Chart, issue dated 7 October 2011. The following week the song peaked at number thirteen. In its third and final week on the chart it fell to number thirty-three. It is the group's third single not to chart within the top 10 in Denmark, the others being [...] "We Belong to the Sea" [...] and [...] "Spin Me a Christmas". The song has been certified gold in Denmark by the IFPI for sales of 300,000 units.|$|E
500|$|A {{central part}} of Fall Out Boy's sound {{is rooted in the}} band's lyrics, mainly penned by bassist Pete Wentz, who {{commonly}} uses irony and other literary devices to narrate personal experience and stories. Wentz stated, [...] "I write about what I’m going through most of the time, or what I imagine people are going through most of the time." [...] He draws inspiration from authors such as Charles Bukowski, Ernest Hemingway, and JT LeRoy, as well as rappers such as Lil Wayne, who he described as his primary influence while writing Infinity on High. On Fall Out Boy's earlier works, Wentz wrote primarily about love and heartbreak. Themes addressed on From Under the Cork Tree include narcissism and <b>megalomania,</b> while many tracks on Infinity on High discuss {{the ups and downs of}} fame. While writing Folie à Deux, he explored moral dilemmas and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E
500|$|After {{the series}} finale, the Los Angeles Times {{characterized}} the series as [...] "an epic poem, with Jack Bauer {{in the role}} of Odysseus or Beowulf. Which means he needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision." [...] The critic {{went on to say that}} villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that [...] "Jack and 24 fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and <b>megalomania,</b> ruthlessness and stupidity." [...] One reviewer for BuddyTV said that [...] "I'll remember the legacy of 24 as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy." [...] The New York Times said [...] "24 will live on, possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life the ticking time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11." [...] The show was declared the sixth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).|$|E
500|$|Alexander perhaps {{undercut}} his own rule {{by demonstrating}} signs of <b>megalomania.</b> While utilizing effective propaganda {{such as the}} cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following {{his visit to the}} oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331BC. His attempt in 327BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330BC, this was [...] "symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328BC is described as [...] "vengeful and reckless" [...] by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of DariusIII, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324BC.|$|E
500|$|The {{hearing before}} {{a panel of}} six judges on 16 April 1860 was {{attended}} by neither the Mortara family nor Feletti—the former {{because they were in}} Turin and learned of the trial date only two days beforehand, and the latter because he refused to recognise the new authorities' right to put him on trial. With the evidence gathered by Curletti and Carboni already in hand, the prosecution had no witnesses to call. The prosecutor Radamisto Valentini, a lawyer fighting his first major case, declared that Feletti had ordered the seizure alone and on his own initiative, and then turned his focus to Carboni's second point of how the authorities in Rome could have possibly concluded that Morisi's story was genuine. Valentini went over Morisi's account in detail, arguing that even if things had happened as she said, the baptism had not been administered properly and was therefore invalid. He then highlighted the inconsistencies between her testimony and the other accounts, condemned Morisi as a silly girl [...] "corrupted by the foul breath and touch of foreign soldiers... rolled over without shame with them", and finally charged that Feletti had ordered the seizure himself out of <b>megalomania</b> and [...] "an inquisitor's hatred of Judaism".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his skills}} as a commander, Alexander perhaps {{undercut}} his own rule by demonstrating signs of <b>megalomania.</b> While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following {{his visit to the}} oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. When he attempted to have his men prostrate before him at Bactra in 327 BC in an act of proskynesis (borrowed from the Persian kings), the Macedonians and Greeks considered this blasphemy and usurpation of the authority of the gods. Alexander's court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual there and the others took his example, an act of protest that led Alexander to abandon the practice. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana in 330 BC, this was [...] "symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people," [...] according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as [...] "vengeful and reckless" [...] by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington.

500|$|During {{his time}} of exile, he was {{primarily}} concerned with religious rather than political matters. Spurred on by a sympathetic Roman Catholic priest in Quebec, he was increasingly influenced by his belief {{that he was a}} divinely chosen leader of the Métis. Modern biographers have speculated that he may have suffered from the psychological condition <b>megalomania.</b> His mental state deteriorated, and following a violent outburst he was taken to Montreal, where he was under the care of his uncle, John Lee, for a few months. But after Riel disrupted a religious service, Lee arranged to have him committed in an asylum in Longue Pointe on 6 March 1876 under the assumed name [...] "Louis R. David". Fearing discovery, his doctors soon transferred him to the Beauport Asylum near Quebec City under the name [...] "Louis Larochelle". While he suffered from sporadic irrational outbursts, he continued his religious writing, composing theological tracts with an admixture of Christian and Judaic ideas. He consequently began calling himself Louis [...] "David" [...] Riel, prophet of the new world, and he would pray (standing) for hours, having servants help him to hold his arms {{in the shape of a}} cross. Nevertheless, he slowly recovered, and was released from the asylum on 23 January 1878 with an admonition to lead a quiet life. He returned for a time to Keeseville, where he became involved in a passionate romance with Evelina Martin dit Barnabé, sister of his friend, the oblate father Fabien Barnabé. But with insufficient means to propose marriage, Riel returned to the west, hoping that she might follow. However, she decided that she would be unsuited to prairie life, and their correspondence soon ended.|$|E
2500|$|Sigmund Freud commented, {{regarding}} the adult neurotic's sense of omnipotence, that [...] "this belief is a frank acknowledgement of {{a relic of}} the old <b>megalomania</b> of infancy". He similarly concluded that [...] "we can detect an element of <b>megalomania</b> in most other forms of paranoic disorder. We are justified in assuming that this <b>megalomania</b> is essentially of an infantile nature and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations".|$|E
2500|$|Whereas Freud saw <b>megalomania</b> as an {{obstacle}} to psychoanalysis, {{in the second half of}} the 20th century object relations theory, both in the United States and among British Kleinians, set about revaluing <b>megalomania</b> as a defence mechanism that offered potential access for therapy. [...] Such an approach built on Heinz Kohut's view of narcissistic <b>megalomania</b> as an aspect of normal development, by contrast with Kernberg's consideration of such grandiosity as a pathological development distortion.|$|E

2500|$|Aqua {{commenced}} {{the recording}} of <b>Megalomania</b> {{at the beginning of}} 2010, scheduled for a release in the spring of 2011. Aqua released the album's lead single, [...] "How R U Doin?" [...] on 14 March 2011, after a preview of the song was posted onto the band's official Facebook page on 10 March 2011. Co-written by Thomas Troelsen, the song peaked at number four in Denmark, becoming the band's tenth top-ten single. It has since been certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for sales of 15,000 copies in Denmark. Aqua were originally set to release their third studio album on 14 July 2011, however the release was pushed back to 5 September 2011 with the record label citing bad timing. The album, titled <b>Megalomania,</b> was then further rescheduled to be released on 3 October 2011. On 7 September 2011 Aqua released a preview of their new single, [...] "Playmate to Jesus", on their official Facebook page, which was released on 12 September 2011. On 8 September 2011 it was announced that [...] "Like a Robot" [...] would also be released as a single on 12 September, and would battle against [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] in the charts.

They initially announced six concerts but quickly added three additional shows to Melbourne, Sydney and Perth (Fremantle) due to popular demand. Aqua appeared on Sunrise, an Australian morning TV show on the Seven Network. They performed a slower tempo acoustic version of [...] "Barbie Girl" [...] and it was revealed that Lene had pneumonia, but the concerts would proceed as the group pride themselves on never having cancelled a show. They then appeared on the Seven Network's The Morning Show, performing [...] "Doctor Jones". After the tour, the band split again.|$|E
