The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and {{includes}} interviews with rabbis and psychotherapists about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality. During the film's six-year production, DuBowski met hundreds of homosexual Jews, but only a handful agreed to be filmed due to fear of being ostracized from their communities. Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only in silhouette or with their faces pixelized. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> are American Jews, with one British and one Israeli Jew also featured. The film was successful at the box office, grossing over $788,896 on eight screens by its close date.|$|E

Also, <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female <b>participants</b> (33.3 %) had males as their household heads while a small proportion (3.3 %) of female participants were heads of their households. Considering the trends, it is evident that <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> households <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> were headed by males hence had males as the main decision makers. These include decisions made by female micro-entrepreneurs about their businesses. This finding is consistent with observations by Akpalu et al.

A seemingly <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> participants (44 %) had dependants. Our findings revealed that participants both women and men engage in different businesses. Poor sales were currently the main problem faced by women micro- entrepreneurs in the district. This is because income level in the municipality is generally low. This situation is similar to a finding by Okraku and Croffie (1997) in which <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> micro-entrepreneurs indicated poor sales as a result <b>of</b> low incomes. <b>The</b> study again revealed that small businesses in the LMKD are faced with several constraints including poor market demand, access to capital or credit and government regulation.|$|R
