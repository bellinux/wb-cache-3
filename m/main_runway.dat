5|$|Many flights, {{including}} all OceanAir and BRA Transportes Aéreos, {{were transferred to}} Guarulhos International Airport, the major airport in São Paulo, due to {{the closure of the}} <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> at Congonhas and the ongoing investigation of the accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Finnair started {{flying to}} Helsinki, {{although}} direct flights were not introduced until 1971. After 1962, the east–west runway became the <b>main</b> <b>runway.</b> Along with the runway expansion, a new service building, with {{a capacity for}} 2million passengers, was opened in 1964. It was located about half a kilometer (quarter of a mile) south of the former terminal. Designed by Odd Nansens Arkitektkontor, it had two stories, one for arrivals and one for departures, and two wings, one for domestic and one for international flights. It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft. The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes, although they were also occasionally used to Bodø.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew along the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, {{during which the}} starboard wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E

5|$|Værnes Air Station {{is one of}} two air {{stations}} in Central Norway, the other being Ørland Main Air Station. There are no aircraft permanently stationed at Værnes, but the station serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Trøndelag District (HV-12). Most of the military installations are located {{on the north side of}} the runway, although some are also located on the south side, to the east of the civilian terminal. Værnes also serves as a storage base for the United States Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway. The military owns the runways and taxiways, but these are operated by Avinor. Three to four hundred military aircraft are handled at the air station each year. The military installations contain places for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. The Ring Road connects the northern to the southern installations and passes the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> on the east side.|$|E
25|$|The plane made {{radio contact}} with {{approach}} control at Prestwick shortly before 11:00p.m. At {{this point the}} cross-wind over the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> had, unknown to Parmentier, dropped to 14knots which made it within limits to attempt a landing on the <b>main</b> <b>runway.</b> Instead, he decided to attempt an overshoot of the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> guided by the ground radar controller, followed by a left-hand turn that would bring the plane downwind of the alternate runway. He would then overfly the runway before looping round for his final approach. While it might sound complicated, Parmentier {{expected to be in}} visual contact with the ground which would make such an attempt relatively easy.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> uses a Category III Instrument Landing System (ILS). The {{northern}} runway {{does not}} have an ILS; when it is in use, arriving aircraft use a combination of distance measuring equipment and assistance from the approach controller (using surveillance radar) or (where equipped, and subject to operator approval) an RNAV (GNSS) approach (also available for the <b>main</b> <b>runway).</b> On both runways, a continuous descent approach is used to minimise the environmental effects of incoming aircraft, particularly at night.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the <b>main</b> <b>runways,</b> taxiways and parking aprons were mostly torn up or turned into single lane {{agricultural}} roads.|$|R
50|$|The lake is in {{a direct}} line {{with two of the}} <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, and {{airplanes}} frequently fly over the area.|$|R
50|$|Most of the hardstands have gone. The <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> (with the {{exception}} of one which remains almost complete) and taxiways were broken up for aggregate and used for various construction projects.|$|R
25|$|On March 31, 2003, a Blue Panorama Airlines Boeing 767 (EI-CXO) skidded off the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> 06 in poor {{weather and}} gusting winds. No {{injuries}} occurred.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> was re-designated from 13/31 to 12/30 {{due to the}} {{magnetic}} north pole having drifted {{so much that the}} airport's runway needed to be re-numbered.|$|E
25|$|On 6 September 2012 {{construction}} machinery {{moved in and}} began building a new road on {{the line of the}} <b>main</b> <b>runway,</b> with a roundabout to give access from Banwell Road.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport is}} the second largest in Canada, with over 19 million {{passengers}} passing through each year. It has grown to three passenger terminals and three <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> servicing over fifty airlines.|$|R

50|$|Kibrit {{is being}} used by the Egyptian Air Force. Currently, the {{airfield}} is housing an SA-342 Gazelle unit. Its <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> are having their asphalt removed, but the hangars are still being used for housing the helicopters.|$|R
25|$|The airport {{purchased}} {{land from}} the Tasmanian Government {{in the southern part}} of the airport for future development of operational facilities. This additional area would allow for a short runway for general aviation aircraft, either parallel to the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> along the southern end of the eastern boundary of the airport, or a cross runway towards the southern end of the <b>main</b> <b>runway.</b> The alternative second runway would provide an opportunity to improve the operational management of the lighter categories of aircraft. However, the second runway is not likely to be developed any time soon, because the existing runway is under-utilised.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 2011, a 124-metre {{extension}} to the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> {{at the airport}} was opened, almost eight months ahead of schedule. On 8 January 2013, the airport was renamed Aberdeen International.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 {{an airport}} traffic control tower was built and the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> was {{extended}} from 3,900 feet to 5,300. In 1963 an instrument landing system was installed to help during poor weather. In 1977 the runway was further lengthened to 6,500 feet.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} September 1943, the C-47 {{groups had}} moved to Sicily and Kairouan was {{dismantled}} and abandoned. Today, one (possibly two) <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> {{can be seen in}} aerial photography, along with traces of taxiways and dispersal pads.|$|R
50|$|The airport, having {{recently}} completed major terminal renovations, has three operational runways. The two parallel <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> run north/south {{and allow for}} simultaneous takeoffs and landings. The east/west runway is shorter and generally only used in adverse weather conditions.|$|R
25|$|In 1973 {{the airport}} was {{expanded}} again to handle bigger aircraft. The <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> was lengthened to 2500m, taxiways were widened and aprons enlarged. This mostly offset {{the negative effects}} of the 1973 oil crisis, passenger volume remained the same and cargo operations expanded.|$|E
25|$|The February 1953 C diagram shows runway 7 (4301ft), runway 13 (6201ft) and runway 18 (5202ft). On June 1, 1954 Runway 7/25 was closed; it {{was later}} removed to allow {{terminal}} expansion. Love Field then had two runways: Runway 13/31, the <b>main</b> <b>runway,</b> and the shorter 18/36.|$|E
25|$|Fairbairn, {{a former}} RAAF base {{is on the}} eastern side of the <b>main</b> <b>runway.</b> In {{addition}} to military and VIP aircraft operations, this area contains the Air Traffic Control tower, aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) facilities and remote parking for visiting heavy aircraft and diverted passenger flights.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} track {{layout of}} Davidstow circuit {{was used in}} 1952 and contained three corners; most drivers thought that this layout was not very challenging. The track was 4.2 km long and used the <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> of RAF Davidstow Moor.|$|R
50|$|PMD has two <b>main</b> <b>runways,</b> runways: 4/22, and 7/25, {{and both}} are over 2 mi long. 7/25 was built to {{withstand}} an 8.3 Richter Scale earthquake, {{making it one of}} the world's strongest runways. Another smaller runway, 72/252, is used as an assault strip.|$|R
50|$|Davidstow Circuit was {{established}} in 1952 on the former military airfield and later modified. The track was 4.2 km long and used the <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> of RAF Davidstow Moor. Three Formula 1 races were held here between 1954-1955. The circuit hosted its last race in 1955.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s The <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> of Filton Aerodrome was greatly {{extended}} for the Bristol Brabazon project. Charlton village was demolished and the pre-war Filton bypass was severed. In the early 1960s, a new bypass was constructed, roughly {{parallel to the}} old one, and this later {{became part of the}} M5 motorway.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{the company}} has {{invested}} heavily in extending aprons and creating rapid exit taxiways to derive maximum efficiency from the existing <b>main</b> <b>runway.</b> Runway 11/29, the shortest {{and one of the}} oldest runways, is closed to allow overspill aircraft parking. This runway will disappear under the new parallel runway in due course.|$|E
25|$|A9 Falkirk to Scrabster (Originally Edinburgh to Inverness, it was {{extended}} to John o' Groats via Wick on 16 May 1935, and later cut back {{at the southern end}} because of the construction of the <b>main</b> <b>runway</b> at Edinburgh Airport on top of it. On 1 April 1997, it was diverted to Thurso and Scrabster at the northern end).|$|E
50|$|In 2009 new {{ownership}} began re-invigorating {{the airport}} and in 2011 was reopened as Vulcan/Kirkcaldy Aerodrome and is being operated by Wheatland Industries. The aerodrome is currently being used by private aircraft and one commercial operator, Vertical Extreme Skydiving. One of the <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> is being resurfaced.|$|R
5000|$|On August 5, 2014, little-used runway 04-22 was {{permanently}} closed. [...] It {{was only}} 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) long and used primarily when the <b>main</b> <b>runways</b> {{needed to be}} closed for repairs. The last operation on the runway was a Southwest Airlines flight from Chicago Midway that arrived at 4:18 AM.|$|R
