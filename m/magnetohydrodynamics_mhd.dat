50|$|A quantum vacuum {{thruster}} (QVT or Q-thruster) is {{a theoretical}} system {{that uses the}} same principles and equations of motion that a conventional plasma thruster would use, namely <b>magnetohydrodynamics</b> (<b>MHD),</b> to make predictions about {{the behavior of the}} propellant. However, rather than using a conventional plasma as a propellant, a QVT uses the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the zero-point field. If QVT systems were to truly work they would eliminate the need to carry any propellant, as the system uses the quantum vacuum to assist with thrust. It would also allow for much higher specific impulses for QVT systems compared to other spacecraft as they would be limited only by their power supply’s energy storage densities. Harold White's Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory (NASA Eagleworks) suggests that their RF cavity may be an example of a quantum vacuum thruster (QVT or Q-thruster).|$|E
50|$|In 1966 {{he became}} a full member of the German Academy of Sciences and was Director of the Berlin-Babelsberg Observatory of the Academy of Sciences. Following {{reorganization}} in 1969, he headed the newly established Central Institute for Astrophysics (ZIAP), in which the previously independent observatories in Potsdam, the Babelsberg Observatory, the Sonneberg Observatory and the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory, Tautenburg were summarized. Until 1973, he also led the research field of cosmic physics at the Academy of Sciences, in astrophysics and geophysics. Then he gave to health reasons {{and focused on the}} management of the ZIAP. He not only made it a center of theoretical gravitational physics, but also included <b>magnetohydrodynamics</b> (<b>MHD,</b> in collaboration with Max Steenbeck) - which {{played an important role in}} astrophysics on a par with the gravitational theory in the model training - and geophysics (in collaboration with Hans Ertel), which was formative in Potsdam later.|$|E
50|$|Numerical {{resistivity}} is {{a problem}} in computer simulations of ideal <b>magnetohydrodynamics</b> (<b>MHD).</b> It is a form of numerical diffusion. In near-ideal MHD systems, the magnetic field can diffuse only very slowly through the plasma or fluid of the system; it is rate-limited by the inverse of the resistivity of the fluid. In Eulerian simulations where the field is arbitrarily aligned compared to the simulation grid, the numerical diffusion rate takes the form similar to an additional resistivity, causing non-physical and sometimes bursty magnetic reconnection in the simulation. Numerical resistivity is a function of resolution, alignment of the magnetic field with the grid, and numerical method. In general, numerical resistivity will not behave isotropically, and there can be different effective numerical resistivities {{in different parts of the}} computational domain. For current (2005) simulations of the solar corona and inner heliosphere, this numerical effect can be several orders of magnitude larger than the physical resistivity of the plasma.|$|E
5000|$|A QVT system {{seeks to}} make use of this predicited Casimir-like {{momentum}} transfer. It is argued that when the vacuum is exposed to crossed electric and magnetic fields (i.e. E and B-fields) it will induce a drift of the entire vacuum plasma which is orthogonal to that of the applied E x B fields. In a 2015 paper White highlighted that the presence of ordinary matter is predicted to cause an energy perturbation in the surrounding quantum vacuum such that the local vacuum state has a different energy density when compared with the [...] "empty" [...] cosmological vacuum energy state. This suggests the possibility of modelling the vacuum as a dynamic entity as opposed to it being an immutable and non-degradable state. White models the perturbed quantum vacuum around a hydrogen atom as a Dirac vacuum consisting of virtual electron-positron pairs. Given the nontrivial variability in local energy densities resulting from virtual pair production he suggests the tools of <b>magnetohydrodynamics</b> (<b>MHD)</b> can be used to model the quasiclassical behavior of the quantum vacuum as a plasma.|$|E

Because he feels uncomfortable within the military R&D, he prefers to integrate civilian research. In 1965 he is hired by the Marseille Institute of Fluid Mechanics (IMFM), a French laboratory affiliated with CNRS and the French atomic agency CEA, as a research engineer where he makes his first studies in <b>magnetohydrodynamics</b> (<b>MHD).</b> In 1972 he fully incorporates the CNRS after his EngD thesis defense. In 1974 he officially stops experimental research in MHD and starts working at the Marseille Observatory where he reconverts himself in fundamental research as an astrophysicist.

Convalescent after many months of hospitalization following an industrial injury, he becomes between 1977 and 1983 codirector of the Calculation Center at the French University of Provence where he develops with students some CAD software marketed in 1978. He retires from CNRS in April 2003 but keeps working. In 2007, he founds a non-profit organization called UFO-Science to concretize some research ideas he could not experiment on while working due to lack of allocated funds at the time.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, {{the theory}} behind plasma {{cosmology}} was introduced by Alfvén, a plasma expert who won the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics {{for his work on}} <b>magnetohydrodynamics</b> (<b>MHD).</b> In 1971, Oskar Klein, a Swedish theoretical physicist, extended the earlier proposals and developed the Alfvén-Klein model of the universe, or [...] "metagalaxy", an earlier term used to refer to the empirically accessible part of the universe, rather than the entire universe including parts beyond our particle horizon. In this Alfvén-Klein cosmology, sometimes called Klein-Alfvén cosmology, the universe is made up of equal amounts of matter and antimatter with the boundaries between the regions of matter and antimatter being delineated by cosmic electromagnetic fields formed by double layers, thin regions comprising two parallel layers with opposite electrical charge. Interaction between these boundary regions would generate radiation, and this would form the plasma. Alfvén introduced the term ambiplasma for a plasma made up of matter and antimatter and the double layers are thus formed of ambiplasma. According to Alfvén, such an ambiplasma would be relatively long-lived as the component particles and antiparticles would be too hot and too low-density to annihilate each other rapidly. The double layers will act to repel clouds of opposite type, but combine clouds of the same type, creating ever-larger regions of matter and antimatter. The idea of ambiplasma was developed further into the forms of heavy ambiplasma (protons-antiprotons) and light ambiplasma (electrons-positrons).|$|E
