These weak waves can combine in supersonic flow to become a shock wave if sufficient Mach waves are present at any location. Such a shock wave is called a Mach stem or <b>Mach</b> <b>front.</b> Thus it is possible to have shockless compression or expansion in a supersonic flow by having the production of Mach waves sufficiently spaced (cf. isentropic compression in supersonic flows). A Mach wave is the weak limit of an oblique shock wave (a normal shock is the other limit).|$|E
40|$|Fundamental spatiotemporal field {{properties}} and particle velocity waveform signatures of sub-Rayleigh and supershear ruptures were experimentally investigated {{through a series}} of laboratory earthquake experiments. We appeal to dynamic rupture theory to extract and highlight previously unnoticed aspects and results, which are of direct relevance to our new experiments. Kinematic relationships derived from both singular and non-singular solutions are applied to analyze and interpret various features observed in these experiments. A strong correspondence is demonstrated between particle velocity records obtained in lab experiments and synthetic particle velocity waveform profiles derived from theory. Predicted temporal profiles, sense of particle motion, and amplitude decay properties of sub-Rayleigh and supershear particle velocity waveforms are experimentally verified. In a particular set of supershear rupture experiments, the fault-normal (FN) and fault-parallel (FP) velocity waveforms were simultaneously recorded at fixed, off-fault field points as a shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front</b> swept these locations. Particle velocity records collected over a broad range of stable supershear rupture speeds validate the predicted scaling relationship δu_ 1 s/δu_ 2 s = √V_r^ 2 /C_s^ 2 − 1 =β_s, between the FP (δu_ 1 ^ṡ) and the FN (δu_ 2 ^ṡ) velocity jumps propagated by a shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front.</b> Additional experimental findings include detailed rupture speed measurements of sub-Rayleigh and supershear ruptures and the observation of a supershear daughter crack with vanishing shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front.</b> Previously unappreciated scaling relations between particle velocity field components, attributed to dilatational and shear waves, are also developed and experimentally verified. In particular, the FP velocity jump δu_ 1 ^ṡ(x_ 1,x_ 2) propagated by the shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front,</b> and the sliding speed δu_ 1 (x_ 1, 0 ^+), measured at a field point positioned extremely close to the frictional fault plane, are shown to obey a speed-dependent scaling relationship given by δu_ 1 ^s/δu_ 1 ^+ = 1 − 2 ^(Cs 2) /_(Vr 2), which was gleaned from a non-singular, steady state velocity field solution...|$|E

40|$|Thrust fault {{earthquakes}} are {{studied in}} a laboratory earthquake setup previously used to investigate analog strike-slip seismic events. Dynamic mode II ruptures are generated along preexisting faults in an analog material, Homalite H- 100, and their interaction with the free surface is studied for both sub-Rayleigh and supershear rupture speeds. High-speed digital photography and laser velocimeter diagnostics are used synergistically to identify and study the ground velocity signatures caused by the various features of the generated ruptures. The obtained surface-normal motions of both sub-Rayleigh and supershear ruptures show substantial asymmetry between the hanging and footwall, with the hanging wall experiencing much larger velocity amplitudes. The main features of the surface velocity traces at various stations {{can be explained by}} the calculated arrivals of various waves and fronts—Mach cones, Pand S waves, and sub-Rayleigh features. In both the sub-Rayleigh and supershear cases, the arrival of the rupture tip generates a prominent Rayleigh wave traveling along the simulated Earth's surface. Supershear events feature larger amplitudes of ground shaking profiles. All signatures in the surface motion records attenuate and broaden with increasing distance from the fault trace. The signatures corresponding to the arrival of the <b>Mach</b> <b>fronts</b> attenuate with distance at a slower rate than those from sub-Rayleigh ruptures.

40|$|The {{near field}} ground motion {{signatures}} associated with sub-Rayleigh and supershear ruptures are investigated using the laboratory earthquake experiment originally developed by Rosakis and coworkers (Xia et al., 2004, 2005 a; Lu et al., 2007; Rosakis et al., 2007). Heterodyne laser interferometers enable continuous, high bandwidth measurements of fault-normal (FN) and fault-parallel (FP) particle velocity “ground motion” records at discrete locations {{on the surface}} of a Homalite test specimen as a sub-Rayleigh or a supershear rupture sweeps along the frictional fault. Photoelastic interference fringes, acquired using high-speed digital photography, provide a synchronized, spatially resolved, whole field view of the advancing rupture tip and surrounding maximum shear stress field. Experimental results confirm that near field ground motion records associated with the passage of a sub-Rayleigh rupture are characterized by a FN velocity swing which dominates over the FP velocity swing. The situation is shown to reverse in the supershear rupture speed regime whereby the motion along the shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front</b> is characterized by a FP particle velocity swing which dominates over the FN velocity swing. Additional distinguishing particle velocity signatures, consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions, and repeatedly observed in experimental records are (1) a pronounced peak in the FP velocity record, induced by the leading dilatational field, which sweeps the measurement station just prior to the arrival of the shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front,</b> and (2) a pronounced velocity swing in the FN record associated with the arrival of a “trailing Rayleigh disturbance”, which sweeps the measurement station following passage of the shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front.</b> Each of these features are addressed in detail. We conclude by reexamining the 2002, M_w 7. 9 Denali fault earthquake and the remarkable set of ground motion records obtained at Pump Station 10 (PS 10), located approximately 85 km east of the epicenter and 3 km north of the fault along the Alaska Pipeline. Motivated by the analysis and thorough interpretation of these records by Dunham and Archuleta (2004, 2005), we attempt to replicate the Denali ground motion signatures using a laboratory earthquake experiment. The experiments feature a left (west) to right (east) propagating right lateral rupture within the Homalite test specimen with particle velocity data collected at a near-field station situated just above (north of) the fault, (on the compressional quadrant) in order to simulate the PS 10 scenario. Both sub-Rayleigh and supershear laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted using the “Denali PS 10 ” configuration in order to compare and contrast the resulting particle velocity signatures. Results from the supershear experiment capture the prominent FN and FP ground motion signatures and corresponding sense of particle motion revealed in the PS 10 ground motion records. Most notably, the particle velocity records feature a dominant FP component coinciding {{with the arrival of the}} shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front,</b> followed by a pronounced velocity swing in the FN component coinciding with the passage of a trailing Rayleigh disturbance, as independently confirmed by the presence of these features and their noted arrival times in the synchronized photoelastic image sequence. ...|$|E

Heterodyne laser interferometers enable continuous, high-bandwidth measurements of fault-normal (FN), fault-parallel (FP), and vertical (V) particle velocity "ground motion" records at discrete locations {{on the surface}} of a Homalite- 100 test specimen as a sub-Rayleigh or a supershear rupture sweeps along the frictional fault. Photoelastic interference fringes, acquired using high-speed digital photography, provide a synchronized, spatially resolved, whole field view of the advancing rupture tip and surrounding maximum shear stress field. The first phase of experimental investigations examine and verify the ground motion signatures of supershear ruptures. Experimental results demonstrate that a shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front</b> produced by a stable supershear rupture is characterized by a dominant FP velocity component. The situation is shown to reverse in the sub-Rayleigh rupture speed regime whereby the FN particle velocity component dominates the ground motion record. Additional distinguishing particle velocity signatures, consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions, and repeatedly observed in experimental records are, (1) a pronounced peak in the FP velocity record induced by the leading dilatational field, which sweeps the measurement station in advance of the shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front,</b> and (2) a pronounced velocity swing in the FN record associated with the arrival of a trailing Rayleigh sub-Rayleigh (secondary) rupture, which follows the arrival of the shear <b>Mach</b> <b>front.</b> Analysis of the particle velocity records also confirms 2 D steady-state theoretical predictions pertaining to the separation, attenuation, and radiation partitioning of the shear and dilatational portions of the rupture velocity field components. The second phase of our experimental investigations re-examine the 2002, Mw 7. 9, Denali fault earthquake and the remarkable set of near-source ground motion records obtained at (PS 10), located approximately 85 km east of the epicenter and just 3 km north of the fault along the Alaska pipeline. Motivated by the analysis and interpretation of these records by (Ellsworth et al., 2004; Dunham and Archuleta, 2004, 2005), we attempt to mimic the Denali strike-slip rupture scenario and replicate the PS 10 ground motion signatures using a laboratory earthquake experiment. The experiments feature a left-to-right (west-to-east) propagating right lateral rupture within a Homalite- 100 test specimen with particle velocity data collected at a near-field station situated just above (north of) the fault. Both sub-Rayleigh and supershear laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted using the Denali PS 10 configuration in order to compare and contrast the resulting particle velocity signatures. Supershear laboratory records capture all of the prominent features displayed within the PS 10 ground motion records. Noted velocity signatures are correlated to the location of the rupture fronts and their noted arrival times in the synchronized photoelastic image sequence. Scaling relationships are also presented which transform the laboratory records through six orders of magnitude in time, to match the scale of the PS 10 ground motion records. The strong correlation between the scaled experimental records and the actual PS 10 ground motion records support the hypothesis that the Denali strike-slip fault exhibited a supershear burst. Finally, we present a 2 D steady state, stress-velocity formulation that relates the FP and FN particle velocity records measured close to the fault, to the evolution of the stress tensor at the same location. A locally steady-state condition is assumed within a restricted time interval in order to invoke these relationships and estimate the dynamic stresses, σxx(t) and τ(t), at the near-fault station. Dynamic stress measurements enable a new class of friction investigations using the laboratory earthquake configuration. Experimental findings are presented, which capture the temporal and spatial distributions of σxx and τ, evolution of the dynamic friction coefficient, and velocity weakening behavior of a supershear slip-pulse. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{extend a}} model of a {{two-dimensional}} self-healing slip pulse, propagating dynamically in steady state with slip-weakening failure criterion, to the supershear regime in order to study the off-fault stressing induced by such a slip pulse and investigate features unique to the supershear range. Specifically, we show that there exists a nonattenuating stress field behind the <b>Mach</b> <b>front</b> that radiates high stresses arbitrarily far from the fault (practically this would be limited to distances comparable to the depth of the seismogenic zone), thus being capable of creating fresh damage or inducing Coulomb failure in known structures at large distances away from the main fault. We allow for both strike-slip and dip-slip failure induced by such a slip pulse. We show that off-fault damage is controlled by the speed of the slip-pulse, scaled stress drop, and principal stress orientation of the prestress field. We apply this model to study damage features induced during the 2001 Kokoxili (Kunlun) event in Tibet, for which {{it has been suggested that}} much of the rupture was supershear. We argue that an interval of simultaneous induced normal faulting is more likely due to a slip partitioning mechanism suggested previously than to the special features of supershear rupture. However, those features do provide an explanation for otherwise anomalous ground cracking at several kilometers from the main fault. We also make some estimates of fracture energy which, for a given net slip and dynamic stress drop, is lower than for a sub-Rayleigh slip pulse because part of the energy fed by the far-field stress is radiated back along the Mach fronts...|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} {{heterogeneous}} rupture propagation affects the coherence of shear– and Rayleigh–Mach wave fronts radiated by supershear earthquakes. We address this question using numerical simulations of ruptures on a planar, vertical strike–slip fault {{embedded in a}} three–dimensional, homogeneous, linear elastic half–space. Ruptures propagate spontaneously in accordance with a linear slip–weakening friction law through both homogeneous and heterogeneous initial shear stress fields. In the 3 –D homogeneous case, rupture fronts are curved due to interactions with the free surface and the finite fault width; however, this curvature does not greatly diminish the coherence of <b>Mach</b> <b>fronts</b> relative to {{cases in which the}} rupture front is constrained to be straight, as studied by Dunham and Bhat (2008). Introducing heterogeneity in the initial shear stress distribution causes ruptures to propagate at speeds that locally fluctuate above and below the shear–wave speed. Calculations of the Fourier amplitude spectra (FAS) of ground velocity time histories corroborate the kinematic results of Bizzarri and Spudich (2008) : 1) The ground motion of a supershear rupture is richer in high frequency with respect to a subshear one. 2) When a Mach pulse is present, its high frequency content overwhelms that arising from stress heterogeneity. Present numerical experiments indicate that a Mach pulse causes approximately an – 1. 7 high frequency falloff in the FAS of ground displacement. Moreover, {{within the context of the}} employed representation of heterogeneities and over the range of parameter space that is accessible with current computational resources, our simulations suggest that while heterogeneities reduce peak ground velocity and diminish the coherence of the <b>Mach</b> <b>fronts,</b> ground motion at stations experiencing Mach pulses should be richer in high frequencies compared to stations without Mach pulses. In contrast to the foregoing theoretical results, we find no average elevation of 5 %–damped absolute response spectral accelerations (SA) in the period band 0. 05 – 0. 4 s observed at stations that presumably experienced Mach pulses during the 1979 Imperial Valley, 1999 Kocaeli, and 2002 Denali Fault earthquakes compared to SA observed at non–Mach pulse stations in the same earthquakes. A 20 % amplification of short period SA is seen only at a few of the Imperial Valley stations closest to the fault. This lack of elevated SA suggests that either Mach pulses in real earthquakes are even more incoherent that in our simulations, or that Mach pulses are vulnerable to attenuation through nonlinear soil response. In any case, this result might imply that current engineering models of high frequency earthquake ground motions do not need to be modified by more than 20 % close to the fault to account for Mach pulses, provided that the existing data are adequately representative of ground motions from supershear earthquakes...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus on}} {{the present study is}} on the point-source {{approximation}} of a seismic source. First, we compare the synthetic motions on the free surface resulting from different analytical evolutions of the seismic source (the Gabor signal (G), the Bouchon ramp (B), the Cotton and Campillo ramp (CC), the Yoffe function (Y) and the Liu and Archuleta function (LA)). Our numerical experiments indicate that the CC and the Y functions pro-duce synthetics with larger oscillations and correspondingly they have a higher frequency content. Moreover, the CC and the Y functions tend to produce higher peaks in the ground velocity (roughly of a factor of two). We have also found that the falloff at high frequencies is quite different: it roughly follows ~− 2 in the case of G and LA functions, it decays more faster than ~− 2 for the B function, while it is slow than ~− 1 for both the CC and the Y solutions. Then we perform a comparison of seismic waves resulting from 3 -D extended ruptures (both supershear and subshear) obeying to different governing laws against those from a single point-source having the same features. It is shown that the point-source models tend to overestimate the ground motions and that they completely miss the <b>Mach</b> <b>fronts</b> emerging from the supershear transition process. When we compare the extended fault solutions against a multiple point-sources model the agreement becomes more significant, although relevant dis-crepancies still persist. Our results confirm that, and more importantly quantify how, the point-source approximation is unable to adequately de-scribe the radiation emitted during a real world earthquake, even in the most idealized case of planar fault with homogeneous properties and em-bedded in a homogeneous, perfectly elastic medium. 1...|$|R

However, the physics of particle acceleration in the ICM is still not fully understood.

In our new VLA images, we detect the previously known ∼ 2. 1 Mpc radio halo and ∼ 1. 5 Mpc radio relic. We carry out a radio spectral analysis from which we determine the relic's injection spectral index to be α_inj = - 1. 12 ± 0. 19.

During the laser assisted nanostructuring process, intensive heating will cause the material to experience fast phase change that the non-equilibrium state will lead to shock wave near the heating spot. In nanostructures, thermal movements of molecules/atoms show strong statistical variations in space since the equilibrium state cannot be established. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which directly tracks the movements of molecules/atoms, is capable of exploring physical phenomena down to molecular/atomic levels and predicting processes under different conditions. The previous work done in our group have investigated the evolution of density, temperature, pressure, and shock wave <b>front</b> <b>Mach</b> number. Chapter 2 is an introduction to the basics of MD simulation. In chapter 3, the evolution of the interaction zone and energy exchange between the plume and the ambient gas are studied with respect to different gas/solid molecular mass ratios and different ambient gas densities. The evolutions of shock wave front position as well as velocity and Mach number in different ambient gases are also studied. Lasers also have wide spread popularity in characterization physical properties of materials. When illuminating the surface of materials, the laser light can be absorbed by the material and cause the temperature and thermal radiation variation at the surface. These phenomena have been intensively studied in the past. A photothermal (PT) technique has been developed in our group for characterizing thermal physical properties of different materials.
