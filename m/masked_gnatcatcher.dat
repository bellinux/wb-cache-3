50|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>gnatcatcher</b> (Polioptila dumicola) {{is a small}} active insectivorous songbird, {{found in}} {{northern}} Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and southern and central Brazil. It is found {{in a wide range}} of semi-open habitats, including dry forest and Cerrado. It is generally fairly common, and consequently considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and IUCN.|$|E
50|$|A species new to science, the {{critically}} endangered Iquitos gnatcatcher Polioptila clementsi, was first described in 2005. This species {{is a member}} of the Guianan gnatcatcher Polioptila guianensis complex, which recently has been proposed split into three species (four with the Iquitos gnatcatcher), but not all authorities have accepted this (e.g. SACC). Furthermore, other groups should possibly be split, notably the tropical gnatcatcher Polioptila plumbea and <b>masked</b> <b>gnatcatcher</b> Polioptila dumicola complexes, but at present scientific papers on these matters are lacking.|$|E
40|$|A male-female pair of <b>Masked</b> <b>Gnatcatcher,</b> Polioptila dumicola (Aves: Muscicapidae, Sylviinae) were {{observed}} {{for the first}} time in Santa Catarina state (Brazil) on 11 / 06 / 200, near the banks of the Chapecó River, between the municipalities of Ipuaçu and São Domingos in the west of Santa Catarina state (26 º 37 ’ 38 ”S and 52 º 31 ’ 52 ”W). Although it had been quoted in the literature of Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina and Uruguay, and also in literature of the Brazilian states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, this was the first record of the species in the state of Santa Catarina...|$|E
50|$|Its jizz {{is similar}} to that of other gnatcatchers; a small bird with a {{relatively}} long thin bill, a long frequently cocked tail, and grey upperparts. The central rectrices are black, while the outer are white (consequently, the tail appears primarily black from above, white from below), and there is a white patch in the wing (caused by broad white edging to the tertials). Males of the southern and western group (including subspecies saturata), the <b>masked</b> <b>gnatcatchers</b> in the strict sense, have grey underparts and a broad black mask. Females lack the mask, but instead have a black patch behind the eyes on the auriculars. The northern nominate subspecies dumicola is distinctive, with white underparts in both sexes, and a narrow black mask in the male. It may be a separate species, Berlepsch's gnatcatcher.|$|R
