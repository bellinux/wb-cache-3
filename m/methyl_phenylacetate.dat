The {{reaction of}} silylketene acetals derived from <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetates</b> with [N-(2 -nitrophenylsulfonyl) imino] phenyliodinane (NsN = IPh) under the catalysis of dirhodium(II) tetrakis[N-tetrachlorophthaloyl-(S) -tert-leucinate], Rh_{ 2 }(S-TCPTTL) _{ 4 }, proceeds in benzene {{at room temperature}} to give N-(2 -nitrophenylsulfonyl) phenylglycine derivatives in high yields and with enantioselectivities of up to 99 % ee...|$|R
40|$|A {{substrate}} structure rule {{to predict}} the enantioselectivity of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) towards $ alpha$-substituted carboxylic acids is proposed. Lipase from Candida rugosa resolved <b>methyl</b> $ alpha$-substituted <b>phenylacetates</b> - 5. These substrates were examined to understand the influence of steric and the electronic nature of the substituents at the chiral center on the enantioselectivity. Crude CRL was partially enantioselective towards substrates - 3, and highly selective towards and, E $>$ 100. Partial purification of crude CRL by 2 -propanol extraction and separation by an ion exchange chromatography, dramatically improved the enantioselectivity towards - 3, E $>$ 100. One main lipase fraction, F$ sb{ rm C}$ was obtained with 58 fold purification and 62 % yield. This improvement in enantioselectivity was achieved with a simple dialysis against deionized water or 50 % 2 -propanol extraction. Lauric acid (10 mM), partially reversed {{the increase in the}} enantioselectivity. The absolute configuration of the favored enantiomer for crude and partially purified lipase preparations, was S. Other lipases with opposite stereoselectivities were not identified. Based on literature and our results, it is believed that the size of the substituents at the stereogenic carbon center can account for the enantioselectivity of CRL catalyzed hydrolysis. The opposite configuration is not preferred when the electronic nature of the medium size substituent is varied. The rule can predict the selectivity data for partially purified CRL preparations. We believe that the accuracy of the rule can be improved if more examples of partially purified CRL reactions are examined...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{interest}} in ionic liquids as novel solvents for biocatalysis, {{there is still no}} clear idea of their influence on the stability and the activity of enzymes. Here we analysed the activity and stability of PGA in six different ionic liquids, having different cations ([bmim] and [omim]) and anions (CH 3 OSO 3 2, PF 6 2 and BF 4 2). To be active in ionic liquids, PGA- 450 requires an acceptable hydration (aw. 0. 60), as in organic solvents. PGA is highly stable in [bmim][PF 6] and [bmim][BF 4], and catalytic activity, assayed by studying the synthesis of the amide of L-phenylglycine methyl ester with <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> in these ILS is comparable to that obtained in toluene...|$|E
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that {{chemical}} markers in exhaled air/breath can provide a methodology for the detection of tuberculosis infection. These markers consist of <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> methyl p-anisate, methyl nicotinate and o-phenylanisole (2 -methoxybiphenyl). Current approaches utilise gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) which are useful for centralised testing of breath samples. The World Health Organization (WHO) require a portable, non-invasive diagnostic tool for the screening of tuberculosis infection. In order to meet this, we demonstrate proof-of-concept for the analytical sensing of the identified chemical markers in aqueous solutions using electrochemical based technology. We demonstrate that screen-printed electrochemical sensors can be used as the basis of a diagnostic tool for the electrochemical breathprinting of chemical markers (methyl nicotinate and 2 -methoxybiphenyl) useful for the screening of tuberculosis infection. It is hoped that further development will facilitate the potential for a portable, hand-held, non-invasive breath diagnostic tool to be realised...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{detection}} method for nicotinic acid, a specific metabolite marker of Mycobacterium tuberculosis present in cultures and patients' breath, is studied in complex solutions containing other metabolites and in biological media such as urine, saliva and breath condensate. The method {{is based on}} the analysis of the luminescence increase of Tb 3 þ complexes in the presence of nicotinic acid due to the energy transfer from the excited ligand to the lanthanide ion. It is shown that other potential markers found in M. tuberculosis culture supernatant, such as <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate,</b> p-methyl anisate, methyl nicotinate and 2 -methoxy biphenyl, can interfere with nicotinic acid via a competitive absorption of the excitation photons. A new strategy to circumvent these interferences is proposed with an upstream trapping of volatile markers preceding the detection of nicotinic acid in the liquid phase via the luminescence of Tb 3 þ complexes. The cost of the method is evaluated and compared with the Xpert MTB/RIF test endorsed by the World Health Organization...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{modelling}} {{was used}} to investigate the catalytic site of penicillin G acylase (PGA) by building up a simple enzyme–ligand model able to describe and predict the enzyme selectivity. The investigation {{was based on a}} double computational approach: first, the GRID computational procedure was applied to gain a qualitative description of the chemical features of the PGA active site; second, a classical “transition state approach” {{was used to}} simulate the tetrahedral intermediates and to evaluate their energies. GRID calculations employed different probes which gave a complete description of the chemical interactions occurring upon binding of different ligands, thus indicating those structures having good affinity with the active site of the enzyme. Tetrahedral intermediates were constructed on the basis of GRID results and provided both geometrical features and energies of enzyme–substrate interaction. Such energies were compared to experimental kinetic data obtained in the enzymatic acylation of l-phenylglycine methyl ester using various <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> derivatives. The good agreement of computational results with experimental evidence demonstrates the validity of the model as a rapid and flexible tool to describe and predict the enzyme selectivity...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic kinetic {{resolution}} of secondary alcohols using a lipase and a ruthenium catalyst required some improvements {{to make it}} suitable for its use in an industrial process. The use of p-chlorophenyl acetate as acyl donor is not desirable {{in view of the}} toxicity of the side product. We herein report that simple alkyl esters can be used as acyl donors if the alcohol or ketone residue formed during the enzymatic acylation is continuously removed during the reaction. The addition of a ketone speeds up the racemisation process and allowed us to reduce the amounts of enzyme and ruthenium catalyst. The scope of this method was explored and a suitable range of acyl donors found. Various benzylic and aliphatic alcohols were reacted using isopropyl butyrate or <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> as acyl donor and in most cases the ester was isolated in > 95 % yield and 99 % ee. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the alcohol by-products of the enzymatic resolution could be used as the hydrogen source in the asymmetric reductive transesterification of ketones. ...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{affordable}} {{diagnostic test}} for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is urgently {{needed to improve}} detection of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that animal behavior can be used as a biosensor to signal the presence of human disease. For example, the giant African pouched rats can detect tuberculosis by sniffing sputum specimens while trained honeybees respond to three of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the breath of TB positive patients by proboscis extension. However, both rats and honeybees require animal housing facilities and professional trainers, which are outside the scope of most disease testing facilities. Here, we report that the innate olfactory behavioral response of the roundworm nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can be used to detect the TB-specific VOCs methyl p-anisate, methyl nicotinate, <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> and o-phenylanisole, in chemotaxis assays. Dauer larvae, a long-lived stress resistant alternative development state of C. elegans in which the animals can survive for extended periods of time in dry conditions with no food, were also demonstrated to detect the VOCs. We propose that exposing naive dauer larvae to TB-related VOCs and recording their response in this behavioral assay could lead to the development of a new method for TB diagnostics using breath as the sample type.

40|$|A metagenomic fosmid library from bovine rumen {{was used}} to {{identify}} clones with lipolytic activity. One positive clone was isolated. The gene responsible for the observed phenotype was identified by in vitro transposon mutagenesis and sequencing and was named est 10. The 367 amino acids sequence harbors a signal peptide, the conserved secondary structure arrangement of alpha/beta hydrolases, and a GHSQG pentapeptide which is characteristic of esterases and lipases. Homology based 3 D-modelling confirmed the conserved spatial orientation of the serine in a nucleophilic elbow. By sequence comparison, Est 10 is related to hydrolases that are grouped into the non-specific Pfam family DUF 3089 and to other characterized esterases that were recently classified into the new family XV of lipolytic enzymes. Est 10 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged fusion protein, purified and biochemically characterized. Est 10 showed maximum activity towards C 4 aliphatic chains and undetectable activity towards C 10 and longer chains which prompted its classification as an esterase. However, {{it was able to}} efficiently catalyze the hydrolysis of aryl esters such as <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> and phenyl acetate. The optimum pH of this enzyme is 9. 0, which is uncommon for esterases, and it exhibits an optimal temperature at 40 °C. The activity of Est 10 was inhibited by metal ions, detergents, chelating agents and additives.

40|$|A {{commercial}} and very hydrophobic styrene-divinylbenzene matrix, MCI GEL® CHP 20 P, {{has been compared}} to octyl-Sepharose® beads as support to immobilize three different enzymes: lipases from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) and from Rhizomucor miehie (RML) and Lecitase ® Ultra, a commercial artificial phospholipase. The immobilization mechanism on both supports was similar: interfacial activation of the enzymes versus the hydrophobic surface of the supports. Immobilization rate and loading capacity is much higher using MCI GEL® CHP 20 P compared to octyl-Sepharose® (87. 2 mg protein/g of support using TLL, 310 mg/g using RML and 180 mg/g using Lecitase® Ultra). The thermal stability of all new preparations is much lower than that of the standard octyl-Sepharose® immobilized preparations, while the opposite occurs when the inactivations were performed in the presence of organic co-solvents. Regarding the hydrolytic activities, the results were strongly dependent on the substrate and pH of measurement. Octyl-Sepharose ® immobilized enzymes were more active versus p-NPB than the enzymes immobilized on MCI GEL® CHP 20 P, while RML became 700 -fold less active versus <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate.</b> Thus, the immobilization of a lipase on this matrix needs to be empirically evaluated, since it may present very positive effects in some cases while in other cases it may have very negative ones. © 2014 by the authors.

40|$|In {{investigating}} {{and seeking}} {{to mimic the}} reactivity of trimethylaluminium (TMA) with synthetic, ester-based lubricating oils, the reaction of methyl propionate 1 was explored with 1, 2 and 3  equivalents of the organoaluminium reagent. Spectroscopic analysis points {{to the formation of}} the adduct 1 (TMA) accompanied only by the low level 1 : 1 production of Me_ 2 AlOCEtMe_ 2 2 and Me_ 2 AlOMe 3 when an equimolar amount of TMA is applied. The deployment of excess TMA favours reaction to give 2 and 3 over 1 (TMA) adduct formation and spectroscopy reveals that in hydrocarbon solution substitution product 2 traps unreacted TMA to yield 2 (TMA). The ^ 1 H NMR spectroscopic observation of two Al-Me signals not attributable to free TMA and in the ratio 1 : 4 suggests the formation of a previously only postulated, symmetrical metallacycle in Me_ 4 Al_ 2 (μ^ 2 -Me) (μ^ 2 -OCEtMe_ 2). In the presence of 3, 2 (TMA) undergoes thermally induced exchange to yield Me_ 4 Al_ 2 (μ^ 2 -OMe) (μ^ 2 -OCEtMe_ 2) 4 and TMA. The reaction of <b>methyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> 5 with TMA allows isolation of the crystalline product Me_ 2 AlOCBnMe_ 2 (TMA) 6 (TMA), which allows the first observation of the Me_ Al_ 2 (μ^ 2 -Me) (μ^ 2 -OR) motif in the solid state. Distances of 2. 133 (3) Å (Al-Me_bridging) and 1. 951 Å (mean Al-Me_terminal) are recorded. The abstraction of TMA from 6 (TMA) by the introduction of Et_ 2 O has yielded 6, which exists as a dimer.
