40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been new odour {{assessment}} tools available to help municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) understand their off-site odour impact, such as dispersion modelling, portable odour measurement panel equipment, electronic noses, air tracer compounds, and odour sensors {{that can be used}} to measure ambient odours at the plant fenceline. However, perception of odours is highly subjective, individuals might have different responses to an odour at various concentration and duration. Many WWTPs have serious concerns about off-site odour impacts that are causing them to look for viable odour controls to meet community needs for an odour-free environment. This paper presents ways to demonstrate compliance with community odour standards using dispersion modelling, direct fenceline ambient sampling, <b>and</b> portable odour <b>measurement</b> equipment. Hand-held ambient odour and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) measurement devices were evaluated, and they compared favorably to odour dispersion modelling results for a mid-sized WWTP in the United States. Other methods, such as the electronic nose, were reviewed but not included in this paper because they are better suited for sampling at the odour emission source than for ambient sampling. Electronic noses also tend to have high detection limits for known odourous compounds emitted at a WWTP, which means that the typical WWTP odourous emission concentrations emitted may not be detected by the device. This paper provides insight into ambient sampling approaches using hand-held devices instead of other methods or approaches, including dispersion modelling and/or direct emissions source testing, to determine a WWTP’s off-site odour impacts. Results from this innovative approach, which relies on recent innovations in portable, odour measurement panel equipment, show that a simple strategy exists to prioritize odour sources for controls. The dispersion model results in the case study, using source-measured inputs, were verified at the fenceline using data gathered with hand-held ambient odour <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>metering</b> devices. 1...|$|R

The installation procedure is identical anywhere within the satellite service area {{and the use of}} circular polarization further simplifies the setup which permits to reduce the time and cost of the home installation. Although the installation could be done by some advanced users, it is recommended to contact a certified Tooway installer.Poor alignment of the dish system results in higher error rates and a lower broadband speed.

Prior to mapping, the pressure records were leveled (referenced to the same absolute geopotential) using the current measurements {{under the assumption that}} their mean fields are geostrophic. The leveled pressures were subsequently used together with the current measurements in a multivariate, nondivergent OI mapping procedure. This procedure significantly reduced the mapping errors, because both pressure and its (geostrophic) gradient are specified as inputs. The mapped bottom pressure and current fields have typical mean-square errors of only 0. 0005 db 2 and 4 cm 2 s 22, compared to typical signal variances of 0. 0035 db 2 and 80 cm 2 s 22. The daily maps of abyssal pressure are used to identify the characteristic space–time structures of dynamical processes. Examples are shown in which deep-level cyclones spin up jointly with steep stationary troughs in the Gulf Stream and deep anticyclones with steep propagating crests.

40|$|Electric power {{distribution}} systems are gradually adopting new advancements in communication, control, <b>measurement,</b> <b>and</b> <b>metering</b> technologies to help realize the evolving concept of Smart Grids. Future distribution systems will facilitate increased and active participation of customers in Demand Side Management activities, with customer load profiles being primarily governed by real-time {{information such as}} energy price, emission, and incentive signals from utilities. In such an environment, new mathematical modeling approaches would allow Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) and customers the optimal operation of distribution systems and customer's loads, considering various relevant objectives and constraints. This thesis presents a mathematical model for optimal and real-time operation of distribution systems. Thus, a three-phase Distribution Optimal Power Flow (DOPF) model is proposed, which incorporates comprehensive and realistic models of relevant distribution system components. A novel optimization objective, which minimizes the energy purchased from the external grid while {{limiting the number of}} switching operations of control equipment, is considered. A heuristic method is proposed to solve the DOPF model, which is based on a quadratic penalty approach to reduce the computational burden so as to make the solution process suitable for real-time applications. A Genetic Algorithm based solution method is also implemented to compare and benchmark the performance of the proposed heuristic solution method. The results of applying the DOPF model and the solution methods to two distribution systems, i. e., the IEEE 13 -node test feeder and a Hydro One distribution feeder, are discussed. The results demonstrate that the proposed three-phase DOPF model and the heuristic solution method may yield some benefits to the LDCs in real-time optimal operation of distribution systems in the context of Smart Grids. This work also presents a mathematical model for optimal and real-time control of customer electricity usage, which can be readily integrated by industrial customers into their Energy Hub Management Systems (EHMSs). An Optimal Industrial Load Management (OILM) model is proposed, which minimizes energy costs and/or demand charges, considering comprehensive models of industrial processes, process interdependencies, storage units, process operating constraints, production requirements, and other relevant constraints. The OILM is integrated with the DOPF model to incorporate operating constraints required by the LDC system operator, thus combining voltage optimization with load control for additional benefits. The OILM model is applied to two industrial customers, i. e., a flour mill and a water pumping facility, and the results demonstrate the benefits to the industrial customers and LDCs that can be obtained by deploying the proposed OILM and three-phase DOPF models in EHMSs, in conjunction with Smart Grid technologies. 1 yea...|$|R

An effective method for estimating biomass must have accuracy comparable to the accepted standard of destructive removal. Estimation or measurement of height is commonly employed to create a relationship between height and mass. This study examined several types of ground-based mobile sensing strategies for forage biomass estimation. Forage production experiments consisting of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. ], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were employed to examine sensor biomass estimation (laser, ultrasonic, and spectral) as compared to physical <b>measurements</b> (plate <b>meter</b> <b>and</b> <b>meter</b> stick) <b>and</b> the traditional harvest method (clipping).

Differences between methods were minimal (average percent error of 11. 2 % for difference between predicted values versus machine and quadrat harvested biomass values (1. 64 and 4. 91 t·ha− 1, respectively), except at the lowest measured biomass (average percent error of 89 % for harvester and quad harvested biomass 6. 4 t·ha− 1).

We had earlier proposed a placement procedure that allows finding an optimal robust measurement location incorporating phasor <b>measurement</b> units <b>and</b> smart <b>metering</b> devices for distribution system state estimation. In this paper, the lack of detailed information on distributed generation is also considered in the optimal meter placement procedure, so that the distributed measurement system can provide accurate estimates even with limited knowledge of {{the profile of the}} injected power. Possible non-Gaussian distribution of the distributed power generation has been taken into account. With this aim, the Gaussian mixture model has been incorporated into the placement optimization by means of the so-called Gaussian component combination method.
