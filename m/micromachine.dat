Silicon <b>micromachining</b> refers to fashioning microscopic mechanical parts out of a silicon substrate or on a silicon substrate. Silicon <b>micromachining</b> comprises two technologies: bulk <b>micromachining,</b> in which structures are etched into silicon substrate and surface <b>micromachining,</b> in which the micromechanical layers are formed from layers and films deposited on the surface. Bulk <b>micromachining</b> and surface <b>micromachining</b> are the two major <b>micromachining</b> processes of silicon, and silicon wafer bonding is usually necessary for silicon microfabrication.

But in many cases the distinction between these two has diminished. A new etching technology, deep reactive-ion etching, has made it possible to combine good performance typical of bulk <b>micromachining</b> with comb structures and in-plane operation typical of surface <b>micromachining.</b> While it is common in surface <b>micromachining</b> to have structural layer thickness in the range of 2 µm, in HAR silicon <b>micromachining</b> the thickness can be from 10 to 100 µm. The materials commonly used in HAR silicon <b>micromachining</b> are thick polycrystalline silicon, known as epi-poly, and bonded silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers although processes for bulk silicon wafer also have been created (SCREAM). Bonding a second wafer by glass frit bonding, anodic bonding or alloy bonding is used to protect the MEMS structures.

40|$|<b>Micromachined</b> hotplates, membranes, filaments, and {{cantilevers}} {{have all}} been used as platforms for thermal sensing and gas detection. Compared with conventional devices, <b>micromachined</b> sensors are characterized by low power consumption, high sensitivity, and fast response time. Much of these gains {{can be attributed to}} the size reductions achieved by <b>micromachining.</b> In addition, <b>micromachining</b> permits easy, yet precise tailoring of the heat transfer characteristics of these devices. By simple alterations in device geometry and materials used, the relative magnitudes of radiation, convection and conduction losses and Joule heat gains can be adjusted, and in this way device response can be optimized for specific applications. The free-standing design of <b>micromachined</b> platforms, for example, reduces heat conduction losses to the substrate, thereby making them attractive as low power, fast-response heaters suitable for a number of applications. However, while <b>micromachining</b> solves some of the heat transfer problems typical of conventionally produced devices, it introduces some of its own. These trade-offs will be discussed in the context of several <b>micromachined</b> thermal and gas sensors present in the literature.

The increased mass alters the resonance frequency of the mechanical object, which is detected with circuitry.|$|E
