The nitrites and nitrates content {{was determined by the}} photometric method, using the Spectroquant NOVA 60 photometer. We analysed following factors impacting pollution: manure deposits, latrines, livestock farms, slope and depth of the groundwater level in wells. The distances between wells and the analysed pollution sources as well as the slope were determined in ArcGIS 9. 3. Software. The statistical analysis has been performed in Excel and GraphPad InStat. The <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentration</b> of nitrates has been exceeded in 41. 17 % of the water samples, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentration</b> of nitrites in 11. 76 % of the water samples.

The simple linear regression could explain to a very small extent this relationship but it was explained to a greater extent by multiple regression. As more factors impacting pollution have been taken into consideration as independent variables, the correlation coefficient between the nitrites content, respectively nitrates, in water and these factors increased.

30|$|The {{situation}} {{may be particularly}} worrisome in less economically developed countries where legislative standards do not exist {{as a result of}} frail institutions and tight budgets. In such cases, a prevailing absence of surveillance schemes may allow in beaches undetected pollution from stormwater, domestic sewage and industrial effluents (Kuylenstierna et al., 2009). The situation is exacerbated as less developed nations are often at a loss on how to develop workable standards for the purpose of beach water quality monitoring (Johnstone, 2007). Reimann and David Banks (2004) also highlighted the problems of setting meaningful action levels or <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentrations</b> (MAC-values) for water quality. Usually, public authorities and responsible politicians consider water quality statistics and take a decision on what proportion of failures they think can be accepted based on a consideration of political factors, economic factors and suggested MAC hinged on available empirical data. In cases where there are no indigenous studies that present empirical findings which suggest epidemiologically proven action levels or <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentrations</b> that make a case for the initiation of a beach water bacteriological quality monitoring (BQM) program, a worst case scenario of political inaction and negligence may become observable (Dada et al., 2012).|$|R

We report on the salinity contents of the groundwaters that flow in fractured volcanics, which make up the flanks of the volcano. These waters, analyzed for major ion chemistry, were sampled regularly from 1994 to 2004. Basing on nonparametric Sen’s slope estimator, time series of groundwater composition reveal that the salinity of most of the Etnean aquifers increased by 0. 5 % to 3. 5 % each year during this period. This change in the water chemistry is clearly referable to the overexploitation of the aquifers.

Following three Pt impregnation protocols different surface chemistries were obtained, as confirmed by BET, TPR, HRTEM, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. In the first protocol, the presence of Cu and Pt-Cu alloy formation has been promoted, whereas the second protocol leads to separated Pt and Cu particles in close contact. The third protocol leads to the presence of Cu, Pt and Pt-Cu alloy particles. The different catalytic behaviors were related to the differences in the surface metal chemistry of the samples. Low ammonium formation was detected in all cases but nitrite concentrations need to be improved to fulfill the <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentration</b> of the EU legislation.

30|$|One of {{the tenets}} of green {{chemistry}} {{is the use of}} substances having little or no toxic effect on {{human health and the environment}} (Sanghi et al. 2012). Therefore, the switch from Cd reduction for nitrate determination to Zn reduction will accomplish a green chemical objective (Merino 2009) because the World Health Organization’s <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentrations</b> for Cd and Zn in potable water are 0.005 and 5.0  mg L− 1, respectively (Olajire and Imeokparia 2000), thus making Zn the more attractive green option than Cd. And exposure to Zn is three orders of magnitude apparently incapable of causing appreciable harm in relation to Cd. Zn reductor is, therefore, environmentally friendly, and environmentally friendly chemical analysis is geared towards achieving sustainable development (Grudpan et al. 2011). Zinc reduction coupled to sequential injection analysis is no doubt a green chemical analytical approach for sustainable development in view of the reduced reagent input and reduced waste generation. The programmable flow derived from sequential injection analysis (SIA) in the lab-on-valve (LOV) format is a fast-growing technology in chemical process disciplines as micro-SIA-LOV minimizes resource consumption and waste generation much more than flow injection analysis (FIA) and also offers a stopflow mode for slow reactions (Solich et al. 2003).|$|R

These clays are ingested by pregnant women for diverse reasons that are related to their condition. Simulated oral (6. 5 pH 7), stomach (pH approximately 1. 8) and intestinal (pH approximately 8. 3) media were prepared separately in order to compare the quantities of the trace elements released. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry and spectrophotometry for the evaluation of copper, iron ((Fe(II) and Fe(III)), lead, manganese, nickel and zinc, since some of these elements can palliate deficiency problems and others can induce toxic effects. The quantities of the chemical elements released were pH dependent. The lower the pH, the higher the quantities of copper, Fe(III) and zinc. The quantities of Fe(II) were similar at both lower (stomach) and higher (intestinal) pH values. However, the quantities of manganese, nickel and lead were lower than quantification limits. Heating (110 C) of the clays increased the quantities of trace elements released and could also participate in the microbiological 'decontamination' of raw materials. Microbiological analysis shows that all samples tested were in compliance with the recommendations of the European Pharmacopoeia.

Increased {{concentrations of}} metals were thus detected. This concerns mainly Fe (19 % of samples showed concentrations above drinking-water quality standards) and Pb (5 %). In some samples, the <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentration</b> levels for Mn, Cu and Ni were also exceeded. This was not the case for Al, despite the use of aluminium compounds during water treatment; the Al con -centrations in treated water were, however, significantly higher than in raw water. It was also found that (1) the corrosive properties of water (low alkalinity and increased concentration of sulphates), (2) the water-treatment processes causing a decrease of the pH and an increase of the CO 2, and (3) transport of the treated water over long distances (30 km) provide favourable conditions for the leaching of metals from water-pipe networks. The type of material used in domestic plumbing and the content of Ce, Fe, Mn, Ni and Cd in the tap-water at consumers show a correlation. The high content of Pb is mainly a result of lead pipes connecting the network to the buildings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} toxic and essential metal concentrations in swine meat and offal in NW Spain, to compare these to reported metal concentrations in pigs in other countries and in cattle in this region, and to relate the observed concentrations to maximum acceptable concentrations. Samples from 63 pigs aged 6 months were randomly collected at slaughter. After acid digestion, levels of metals were determined by ICP-OES and ICP-MS. As regards the toxic metals, mean concentrations in liver, kidney and muscle were 0. 073, 0. 308 and 0. 009 mg/kg fresh weight for cadmium, 0. 004, 0. 008 and 0. 003 mg/kg for lead, 0. 013, 0. 011 and 0. 003 mg/kg for arsenic, and 0. 001, 0. 002 and 0. 001 mg/kg for mercury. These concentrations can be considered low, and in general similar to those reported in similar studies in recent years; in addition, <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentrations</b> established by the European Union were not exceeded in any sample. As regards the essential metals, concentrations in liver, kidney and muscle were 14. 9, 5. 63 and 6. 85 mg/kg for copper, 81. 3, 28. 9 and 42. 5 mg/kg for zinc, 195, 51. 6 and 26. 5 mg/kg for iron; 1. 17, 2. 51 and 0. 656 mg/kg for selenium, 3. 32, 1. 56 and 1. 01 mg/kg for manganese, 0. 023, 0. 027 and 0. 003 mg/kg for cobalt, 0. 120, 0. 077 and 0. 131 mg/kg for chromium, 0. 009, 0. 027 and 0. 026 mg/kg for nickel, and 1. 62, 0. 683 and 0. 140 mg/kg for molybdenum. These concentrations are all within the accepted adequate-safe ranges for this animal species, and in general are in line with those previously reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there are}} no legally binding {{workplace}} exposure limits for substances {{in the form of}} nanoobjects. There are different approaches to risk assessment and determination of occupational exposure limits. The {{purpose of this article is}} to compare exposure levels in the work environment proposed by international organizations and world experts, as well as the assumptions and methods used for their estimation. This paper presents the proposals of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands (RIVM), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan (NEDO) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the USA (NIOSH). The authors also discuss the reports on the levels for carbon nanotubes (Baytubes® and Nanocyl) proposed by Pauluhn and Luizi, the derived no-effect levels (DNEL) complying with the REACH Regulation, proposed by experts under the 7 th Framework Programme of the European Commission, coordinated by Professor Vicki Stone (ENRHES), and alternative estimation levels for poorly soluble particles by Pauluhn. The issue was also raised whether the method of determining <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the work environment, currently used in Poland, is adequate for nanoobjects. Moreover, the introduction of nanoreference values, as proposed by RIVM, the definition of a new fraction for particles of 1 - 100 nm, taking into account the surface area and activity of the particles, and an adequate estimation of uncertainty factors seem to be worth considering. Other important, if not key issues are the appropriate measurement (numerical concentration, surface concentration, particle size distribution), as well as the methodology and equipment accessibility to all employers responsible for a reliable risk assessment of exposure to nanoparticles in the work environment.

40|$|The {{artificial}} recharge of aquifers {{has become a}} valuable tool to increase water resources for drinking water production in many countries. In this work a total of 41 organic pollutants belonging to the classes of pesticides, estrogens, progestogens and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been monitored in the water from two {{artificial recharge}} plants located in Sweden and Denmark. The results from two sampling campaigns performed in each plant indicate good chemical status of the source water, as the contaminants detected were present at very low levels, far from those established in the legislation as <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> <b>concentrations</b> (when existing) and far from those considered as a risk. Thus, of the 17 pesticides investigated, BAM (2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide), desethylatrazine, simazine, atrazine, terbuthylazine, diuron, metolachlor, and diazinon were the only compounds detected, and total pesticides levels were below 25 ng L− 1, respectively. Estrone- 3 -sulfate was the only estrogen detected, at concentrations lower than 0. 5 ng L− 1. Progestogens were not found in any sample. Detected VOCs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and trichloroethylene) were below 0. 04 μg L− 1. The efficiency of elimination of these organic contaminants was poor as no significant decrease in their concentrations was observed through the recharge process.
