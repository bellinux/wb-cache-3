5|$|The modern {{synthesis}} of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the genetic mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms {{it came to be}} held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of heredity could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> of the sciences.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E
25|$|The rub is that post-Enlightenment historians {{work with}} <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> and {{therefore}} can neither confirm nor reject miracles.|$|E

40|$|Ecopsychology has a {{rich history}} of {{embracing}} knowledge and practices from many traditions. This large umbrella has widely embraced religious and spiritual practices while at times rejecting mainstream psychology. Considering {{the future of}} ecopsychology, is there room in such an inclusive discipline for a naturalist approach? This essay explores the current metaphysical approaches in ecopsychology and making a case for naturalism. It explores both the metaphysical and <b>methodological</b> implications of <b>naturalism</b> and suggests ecopsychology is strengthened by a methodology that seeks reliability and validity. Naturalistic methodology allows space to recognise the importance of anecdotal accounts of spirituality and avoiding a completely secular ecopsychology...|$|R
50|$|Robert T. Pennock is {{a philosopher}} {{working on the}} Avida digital {{organism}} project at Michigan State University {{where he has been}} full professor since 2000. Pennock was a witness in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, testifying on behalf of the plaintiffs, and described how intelligent design is an updated form of creationism and not science, pointing out that the arguments were essentially the same as traditional creationist arguments with adjustments to the message to eliminate explicit mention of God and the Bible as well as adopting a postmodern deconstructionist language. Pennock also laid out the philosophical history of <b>methodological</b> and philosophical <b>naturalism</b> as they underpin to science, and explained that if intelligent design were truly embraced it would return Western civilization to a pre-Enlightenment state.|$|R
25|$|This {{position}} generally {{accepts the}} viewpoint of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> a long-standing convention of the scientific method in science.|$|E
25|$|Naturalism of {{this sort}} says nothing about the {{existence}} or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism.</b> For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, {{anything that can be}} scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.|$|E
25|$|Creation {{science is}} not, and cannot be, empirically or {{experimentally}} tested: Creationism posits supernatural causes which lie {{outside the realm}} of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> and scientific experiment. Science can only test empirical, natural claims.|$|E
40|$|While naturalistic {{theories}} {{have come to}} dominate the philosophical landscape, there is still little consensus on what “naturalism” means. I trace the origins of contemporary naturalism to a view, called the “fundamental naturalistic impulse,” that originates in Quine’s turn against Carnap and which I take to be necessary for naturalism. In light of this impulse, some “substantively naturalistic” theories are examined: a weak version of non-supernaturalism, Railton’s a posteriori reduction of moral terms, and “Canberra plan” conceptual analyses of moral property terms. I suggest that if we take the fundamental naturalistic impulse seriously, {{then there is no}} need to differentiate substantive versions of naturalism over and above methodological versions. Substantive thesis in ontology or semantics can be had on account of one’s methodological commitments. This not only cuts against the distinction between <b>methodological</b> and substantive <b>naturalisms,</b> but also demonstrates just how far method can reach...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural {{economics}} {{builds on}} psychology {{rather than on}} sociology, and on cognitive science rather than the science of culture. The {{same is true for}} new behavioural scholarship in the legal discipline, whether this is referred to as 'behavioural law and economics' or 'law and the behavioural sciences'. The result of a one-sided definition of a more realist research agenda in legal scholarship is an impoverished understanding of the 'social'. In Thaler and Sunstein's famous concept of nudging, social conformity appears as a property of the individual, which can be instrumentalized by social nudges. More generally, the cognitive strand of behavioural economics lends itself to strategies of regulatory 'debiasing', which suggests {{that it is possible to}} get down to pure preferences that are free from any distortions. While this approach neglects the endogeneity, or social contingency, of individual preferences, the social strand of behavioural economics is explicitly concerned with the dynamics of social interaction, or the effects of social interdependence. However, both strands of behavioural economics are still higher on <b>methodological</b> individualism, <b>naturalism</b> or positivism and lower on institutionalism, culturalism or constructivism than a genuinely sociological approach. More specifically, their understanding of the 'social' does not sufficiently account for the social embeddedness of both rational and irrational economic action. What is more, behavioural economics also lacks the means to reflect on the link between science and politics, which includes the question of why different models of economic man are attractive at different points in time. The conceptual move from rational to behavioural economic man bears distinctive policy implications, which are in line with the transformation of welfare capitalism towards 'less state' and 'more market'. While the overall direction of this project gets blurred in Thaler and Sunstein's branding of 'libertarian paternalism', it is evident in the adaptation of consumer policies, which proceeds under the imperative of market-conformity. Accordingly, a strategy of nudging does not put into question the wider institutional context but offers a technical solution to what is defined as a problem of individual behavioural rigidities and cognitive biases in the market environment...|$|R
25|$|Metaphysical naturalism is an {{approach}} to metaphysics or ontology, which deals with existence per se. It {{should not be confused}} with <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> which sees empiricism as the basis for the scientific method.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationists {{disagree}} with the <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> {{that is part of}} the scientific method. Instead, they assert the actions of God as described in the Bible occurred as written and therefore only scientific evidence that points to the Bible being correct can be accepted. See Creation-evolution controversy for a more complete discussion.|$|E
25|$|Creation science advocates {{argue that}} {{scientific}} {{theories of the}} origins of the Universe, Earth, and life are rooted in a priori presumptions of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> and uniformitarianism, each of which is disputed. In some areas of science such as chemistry, meteorology or medicine, creation science proponents do not challenge the application of naturalistic or uniformitarian assumptions. Traditionally, creation science advocates have singled out those scientific theories judged to be in conflict with held religious beliefs, and it is against those theories that they concentrate their efforts.|$|E
25|$|A secular {{version of}} this <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> was welcomed by a younger {{generation}} of scientists who sought to investigate natural causes of organic change, and rejected theistic evolution in science. By 1872 Darwinism in its broader sense of the fact of evolution was accepted as a starting point. Around 1890 only a few older men held onto the idea of design in science, and it had completely disappeared from mainstream scientific discussions by 1900. There was still unease {{about the implications of}} natural selection, and those seeking a purpose or direction in evolution turned to neo-Lamarckism or orthogenesis as providing natural explanations.|$|E
25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
25|$|Critiques such {{as those}} based on the {{distinction}} between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines. Principles such as uniformitarianism, Occam's razor or parsimony, and the Copernican principle are {{claimed to be the}} result of a bias within science toward philosophical naturalism, which is equated by many creationists with atheism. In countering this claim, philosophers of science use the term <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> to refer to the long-standing convention in science of the scientific method. The methodological assumption is that observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes, without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are outside the realm of science. Creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close-minded.|$|E
25|$|As {{the primary}} {{organizer}} and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign, the Discovery Institute {{has played a}} central role in nearly all intelligent design cases, often working behind the scenes to orchestrate, underwrite and support local campaigns and intelligent design groups such as the Intelligent Design Network. It has provided support ranging from material assistance to federal, state and regionally elected representatives in the drafting of bills to the provision of support and advice to individual parents confronting their school boards. DI's goal is to move from battles over standards to curriculum writing and textbook adoption while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> in science. In order to make their proposals more palatable, the Institute and its supporters claim to advocate presenting evidence both for and against evolution, thus encouraging students to evaluate the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{conclusion}} led Heidegger {{to depart from}} the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (de re) and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness {{to the process of}} Daseins becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, a priori conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social constructionism), and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).|$|E
500|$|Naturalism, any {{of several}} {{philosophical}} stances, typically those descended from materialism and pragmatism {{that do not}} distinguish the supernatural from nature; this includes the <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> of natural science, which makes the methodological assumption that observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes, without assuming either the existence or non-existence of the supernatural ...|$|E
500|$|A related {{claim is}} that {{evolution}} is atheistic (see the Atheism section below); creationists sometimes merge the two claims and describe evolution as an [...] "atheistic religion" [...] (cf. humanism). This argument against evolution is also frequently generalized into {{a criticism of}} all science; {{it is argued that}} [...] "science is an atheistic religion," [...] on the grounds that its <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> is as unproven, and thus as [...] "faith-based," [...] as the supernatural and theistic beliefs of creationism.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{emphasis}} in <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> primarily {{originated in the}} ideas of medieval scholastic thinkers during the Renaissance of the 12th century: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> {{does not}} concern itself with claims about what exists, but with methods of {{learning}} what nature is. [...] It attempts {{to explain and}} test scientific endeavors, hypotheses, and events with reference to natural causes and events. This second {{sense of the term}} [...] "naturalism" [...] seeks to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature. [...] <b>Methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> is a way of acquiring knowledge. It is a distinct system of thought concerned with a cognitive approach to reality, and is thus a philosophy of knowledge. Studies by sociologist Elaine Ecklund suggest that religious scientists in practice apply <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism.</b> They report that their religious beliefs affect the way they think about the implications - often moral - of their work, but not the way they practice science.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, another {{approach}} often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like [...] "creation science" [...] is <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism.</b> Its main {{point is that}} a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations. That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be left {{a matter of personal}} belief outside the scope of science. <b>Methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena. The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} of science Ronald Numbers {{notes that the}} modern scientific assumption of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> can be also {{traced back to the}} work of these medieval thinkers: ...|$|E
2500|$|While not metaphysical naturalism per se, in {{the more}} general sense of naturalism and {{philosophy}} expressed by Kate and Vitaly (2000) [...] "there are certain philosophical assumptions made {{at the base of}} the scientific method - namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded." [...] As noted by Steven Schafersman, <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> is [...] "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within scientific method with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success (although science does have metaphysical implications), but <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is." [...] Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching Creationism or Intelligent Design in US public schools such as Eugenie Scott, Schafersman asserts that [...] "while science as a process only requires <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> I think that the assumption of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism." [...] as well as the similarly controversial assertion: [...] "I maintain that the practice or adoption of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled." [...] On the other hand, Scott argues: ...|$|E
2500|$|Assuming naturalism {{in working}} methods {{as the current}} paradigm, without the unfounded {{consideration}} of naturalism as an absolute truth with philosophical entailment, is called <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism.</b> [...] The subject matter here is a philosophy of acquiring knowledge based on an assumed paradigm.|$|E
2500|$|While {{supporting}} the <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> inherent in modern science, {{the proponents of}} theistic evolution reject the implication taken by some atheists that this gives credence to ontological materialism. In fact, many modern philosophers of science, including atheists, refer to the long-standing convention in the scientific method that observable events in nature should be explained by natural causes, with the distinction {{that it does not}} assume the actual existence or non-existence of the supernatural.|$|E
2500|$|Metaphysical naturalism, {{also called}} [...] "ontological naturalism" [...] and [...] "{{philosophical}} naturalism", is a philosophical worldview and belief system that holds {{that there is}} nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the natural sciences, i.e., those required to understand our physical environment by mathematical modeling. [...] <b>Methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> on the other hand, refers exclusively to the methodology of science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Expert {{testimony}} {{reveals that}} since the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, science has been limited {{to the search for}} natural causes to explain natural phenomena.... While supernatural explanations may be important and have merit, they are not part of science." [...] <b>Methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> is thus [...] "a paradigm of science." [...] It is a [...] "ground rule" [...] that [...] "requires scientists to seek explanations in the world around us based upon what we can observe, test, replicate, and verify.|$|E
2500|$|Metaphysical naturalism, {{also called}} ontological naturalism, {{philosophical}} naturalism, and scientific materialism is a philosophical worldview, {{which holds that}} there is nothing but natural elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the natural sciences. [...] <b>Methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is religious naturalism or spiritual naturalism. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the supernatural concepts and explanations that are part of many religions.|$|E
2500|$|During modern times, Luke's {{competence}} as {{a historian}} is questioned, depending upon one's a priori view of the supernatural.

Mark Powell claims that [...] "it is doubtful whether the writing of history was ever Luke's intent.

2500|$|Johnson popularized {{the term}} [...] "{{intelligent}} design" [...] in his book, Darwin on Trial.

2500|$|In {{the book}} Sheldrake proposes {{a number of}} {{questions}} as the theme of each chapter which seek to elaborate on his central premise that science is predicated on the belief that the nature of reality is fully understood, with only minor details needing to be filled in. This [...] "delusion" [...] is what Sheldrake argues has turned science into a series of dogmas grounded in philosophical materialism rather than an open-minded approach to investigating phenomena. He argues that there are many powerful taboos that circumscribe what scientists can legitimately direct their attention towards. The mainstream view of modern science is that it proceeds by <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> and does not require philosophical materialism.|$|E
2500|$|The major {{criticism}} of theistic evolution by non-theistic evolutionists focuses on its essential {{belief in a}} supernatural creator. These critics argue that by the application of Occam's razor, sufficient explanation of the phenomena of evolution is provided by natural processes (in particular, natural selection), and the intervention or direction of a supernatural entity is not required. The evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins considers theistic evolution a superfluous attempt to [...] "smuggle God in by the back door". The historian Edward Larson stated that the theory failed as an explanation {{in the minds of}} biologists from the late 19th century onwards as it broke the rules of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism</b> which they had grown to expect.|$|E
2500|$|Occam's razor {{may also}} be {{recognized}} in the apocryphal story about an exchange between Pierre-Simon Laplace and Napoleon. It is said that in praising Laplace {{for one of his}} recent publications, the emperor asked how it was that the name of God, which featured so frequently in the writings of Lagrange, appeared nowhere in Laplace's. At that, he is said to have replied, [...] "It's because I had no need of that hypothesis." [...] Though some point to this story as illustrating Laplace's atheism, more careful consideration suggests that he may instead have intended merely to illustrate the power of <b>methodological</b> <b>naturalism,</b> or even simply that the fewer logical premises one assumes, the stronger is one's conclusion.|$|E
