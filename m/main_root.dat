5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} {{erupted in the}} wake of the Great Recession around late 2009, and was {{characterized}} by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels. When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large capital losses, most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a bailout. At the time, the European Commission released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse. The many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debt-to-GDP ratios experienced by several European governments {{in the wake of}} the Great Recession. The <b>main</b> <b>root</b> causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and potential growth; competitive weakness; liquidation of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).|$|E

After the first frost in autumn kills the leaves, the root is dug and divided. The <b>main</b> <b>root</b> is harvested and one or more large offshoots of the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> are replanted to produce next year's crop.

[...] Where the country is named after an ethnic group, the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> means a person of that group: anglo is an Englishman, franco is a Frenchman. Originally, names of countries were created {{by the addition of}} the suffix -ujo ("container"), hence England and France would be rendered Anglujo and Francujo respectively (literally [...] "container for Englishmen/Frenchmen"). More recently, many Esperantists have adopted -io as the national suffix, thus creating names more in line with standard international practice (and less odd-looking): Anglio, Francio, nevertheless the suffix remains unofficial.|$|E
40|$|Ginsenosides {{are used}} as {{existing}} markers of red ginseng (RG) quality, and ginsenoside ratios are also indicative of the different components of red ginseng. For the analysis and classification of ginsenoside content, red ginseng was separated into three parts, namely, <b>main</b> <b>roots,</b> lateral roots, and fine roots, and each extract was subjected to ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QToF-MS) with multivariate statistical analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear discrimination between the extracts of <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> and fine roots and suggested discrimination markers (four for the <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> and five for the fine roots). The fine root markers were identified as ginsenoside. We identified two markers for the <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> of red ginseng in this study. Moreover, the contents of 22 ginsenosides were analyzed in all three components of red ginseng. Fine roots have the highest protopanaxadiol (PPD) /protopanaxatriol (PPT) ratio. The PPD group of ginsenosides, which is quantitatively dominant in fine roots, clearly distinguishes the <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> from the other parts...|$|R
30|$|Based {{on their}} part- and growth stage-specific {{accumulation}} patterns, ginsenosides could be clearly grouped into five stages (Fig.  3 a). Ginsenosides {{in the first}} year had higher levels in lateral roots than in other parts and were mainly represented by PPD-type ginsenosides, including some of the major ginsenosides such as Rc, Rb 1, and Rd. In the second year, the PPD-type such as Rc, Rb 2, Rg 3, and Rd predominated, again with higher levels in lateral roots. Moreover, in the same stage, other ginsenosides had their highest levels in the <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> and were mainly represented by PPT-type, Re, Rg 1, and Rf. Major PPD- (Rc, Rb 2, Rd, and Rg 3) and PPT-types (Re and Rg 1) were tightly grouped in lateral <b>roots</b> and <b>main</b> <b>roots,</b> respectively, during the third year. Three PPD-types, including Rc, Rh 2 and Rg 3, in the fourth year were significantly higher in lateral roots than in leaves, petioles, stems and <b>main</b> <b>roots.</b> Furthermore, one PPD-(Rb 1) and two PPT-types (Rg 1 and Rf) significantly accumulated in the <b>main</b> <b>roots.</b> Re and Rg 1 during the fifth year had highest levels in the <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> and were mainly represented by PPT, which have been characterized for their medicinal value. However, the PPD-type Rh 2 had higher levels in lateral roots, followed by stems, petioles, <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> and leaves. In addition, PPD-types Rb 1, Rb 2 and Rg 3 showed the same accumulation pattern as the PPT-types Re and Rg 1, suggesting highest accumulation in the <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> than in other parts during the fifth year.|$|R

60|$|When we {{consider}} the grinding and extortionate spirit thus shown in face of a common calamity, we may cease to wonder at the ferocity with which, when the hour struck, the people tore away privilege, distinction, and property itself from classes that had used all three only to ruin the land and crush its inhabitants into the dust. And the moment that the lord had thus transformed himself into a mere creditor, and a creditor for goods delivered centuries ago, and long since consumed and forgotten, then it was certain that, if political circumstances favoured the growing economic sentiment, there would be heard again the old cry of the Roman plebs for an agrarian law and novæ tabulæ. Nay, something was heard that is amazingly like the cry of the modern Irish peasant. In 1776 two noteworthy incidents happened. A certain Marquis de Vibraye threw into prison a peasant who refused to pay the droit de cens. Immediately between thirty and forty peasants came to the rescue, armed themselves, besieged the château, took it and sacked it, and drove the Marquis de Vibraye away in terror. Still more significant is the second incident, which happened shortly after. A relative of the Duke of Mortemart, shooting on his property, was attacked by peasants who insisted that he should cease his sport. They treated him with much brutality, and even threatened to fire on him and his attendants, 'claiming to be free masters of their lands.' Here was the <b>main</b> <b>root</b> of the great French Revolution. A fair consideration {{of the details of}} such an undertaking as Turgot's administration of the Limousin helps us to understand two things: first, that all the ideas necessary for the pacific transformation of French society were there in the midst of it; second, that the system of privilege had fostered such a spirit in one class, and the reaction against the inconsiderate manifestation of that spirit was so violent in the other class, that good political ideas were vain and inapplicable.|$|E

In the Fig.  3 b, the comprehensive PCA Q value result revealed that the overall accumulation of ginsenosides in different parts and stages followed a relatively stable distribution. The above- and belowground parts could be clearly differentiated, except for the roots of 1 -year olds. Leaves contained the lowest levels of ginsenosides, followed by petioles and stems, and second year and fifth year parts shared this uniform tendency, which these ginsenosides in leaves had lower levels than in the petioles and stems. Contrasting the aboveground parts ginsenosides changing, we observed that the belowground parts (lateral <b>roots</b> and <b>main</b> <b>roots)</b> increasing their concentration in <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> is higher than those increasing their concentration in lateral roots of 2 - and 3 -year-old plants.

40|$|Most nature-inspired {{algorithms}} simulate intelligent {{behaviors of}} animals and insects that can move spontaneously and independently. The survival wisdom of plants, as another species of biology, has been neglected to some extent {{even though they have}} evolved {{for a longer period of}} time. This paper presents a new plant-inspired algorithm which is called root growth optimizer (RGO). RGO simulates the iterative growth behaviors of plant roots to optimize continuous space search. In growing process, <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> and lateral roots, classified by fitness values, implement different strategies. <b>Main</b> <b>roots</b> carry out exploitation tasks by self-similar propagation in relatively nutrient-rich areas, while lateral roots explore other places to seek for better chance. Inhibition mechanism of plant hormones is applied to <b>main</b> <b>roots</b> in case of explosive propagation in some local optimal areas. Once resources in a location are exhausted, roots would shrink away from infertile conditions to preserve their activity. In order to validate optimization effect of the algorithm, twelve benchmark functions, including eight classic functions and four CEC 2005 test functions, are tested in the experiments. We compared RGO with other existing evolutionary algorithms including artificial bee colony, particle swarm optimizer, and differential evolution algorithm. The experimental results show that RGO outperforms other algorithms on most benchmark functions. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
