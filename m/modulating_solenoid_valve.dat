40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} steps towards {{the development of}} a low-cost wheelchair-mounted manipulator for use by the physically disabled and elderly. A detailed review of world rehabilitation robotics research has been conducted, covering fifty-six projects. This identified the main areas of research, their scope and results. From this review, a critical investigation of past and present wheelchair-mounted robotic arm projects was undertaken. This led to the formulation of the key design parameters in a final design specification. The results of a questionnaire survey of fifty electric wheelchair users is presented, which has for the first time established the needs and abilities of this disability group. An analysis of muscle type actuators, which mimic human muscle, is presented and their application to robotics, orthotics and prosthetics is given. A new type of rotary pneumatic muscle actuator, the flexator, is introduced and through extensive testing its performance characteristics elucidated. A review of direct-drive rotary pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical actuators has highlighted their relative performance characteristics and has rated their efficiency in terms of their peak torque to motor mass ratio, Tp/MM. From this, the flexator actuator has been shown to have a higher Tp/MM ratio than most conventional actuators. A novel kinematic arrangement is presented which combines the best features of the SCARA and vertically articulated industrial robot geometries, to form the 'Scariculated' arm design. The most appropriate actuator for each joint of this hybrid manipulator was selected, based on the criteria of high Tp/MM ratio, low cost, safety and compatibility. The final design incorporates conventional pneumatic linear double-acting cylinders, a vane type rotary actuator, two dual flexator actuators, and stepping motors for the fme control of the wrist/end effector. An ACSL simulation program has been developed which uses mass flow rate equations, based on one-dimensional compressible flow theory and suppressed critical pressure ratios, to simulate the dual flexator actuator. Theoretical and empirical data is compared and shows a high degree of correlation between results. Finally, the design and development work on two prototypes is discussed. The latest prototype consists of a five-axis manipulator whose pneumatic joints are driven by pulse width <b>modulated</b> <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves.</b> An 8051 microprocessor with proportional error feedback modilles the mark to space ratio of the PWM signal in proportion to the angular error of the joints. This enables control over individual joint speeds, reprogrammable memory locations and position monitoring of each joint. The integration of rehabilitation robotic manipulators into the daily lives of the physically disabled and elderly will significantly influence the role of personal rehabilitation in the next century...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Energetic {{autonomy}} of a hydraulic-based mobile field robot requires a power source capable of both electrical and hydraulic power generation. While the hydraulic power {{is used for}} locomotion, the electric power {{is used for the}} computer, sensors and other peripherals. An internal combustion engine was used as the prime mover due to the high energy density of gasoline. The primary specification for this hybrid Hydraulic-Electric Power Unit (HEPU) is that it must output constant pressure hydraulic power and constant voltage electric power. An on-board computer uses a pressure sensor and a speed sensor to regulate the pressure and voltage by <b>modulating</b> a hydraulic <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> and an engine throttle. The speed regulation also results in a system noise with predictable frequency band which allows for optimal muffler design. A novel characteristic of this power source is its cooling system in which hydraulic fluid is used to cool the engine cylinders. Several hydraulic-electric power units were built and successfully demonstrated on the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) shown on bleex. me. berkeley. edu/bleex. htm. A prototype power unit weighs 27 Kg, outputs 2. 3 kW (3. 0 hp) hydraulic power at 6. 9 MPa (1000 psi), and 220 W of electric power at 15 VDC.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Incremental {{threshold}} loading (ITL) {{is a test}} of inspiratory muscle performance {{which is}} usually performed by breathing through a weighted inspiratory plunger, the load on the inspiratory muscles being increased by externally adding weights to the intake valve. This is not a true threshold device and may be inaccurate. This method was compared with a true threshold device consisting of a <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> which only opens to supply air at a predetermined negative mouth pressure. METHODS [...] Six naive, normal subjects (three men and three women) aged 22 - 24 years underwent three tests using each system. The inspiratory loads were increased every minute by equivalent amounts, - 10 cm H 2 O with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> and by 50 g with the weighted plunger, until the subjects could not inspire or sustain inspiration for a full minute. Six experienced subjects (four men and two women) aged 23 - 41 years were subsequently randomised to perform ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve,</b> twice with the breathing pattern fixed and twice free. RESULTS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> generated a more accurate mouth pressure response and was less variable at higher loads than the weighted plunger. The work performed (expressed as the pressure-time product) was less with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> but was more reproducible. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> was not influenced by controlling the breathing pattern of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> has several features that make it superior to the weighted plunger as a device for ITL. It generates a more accurate mouth pressure response which is less variable at higher loads. Increases in load are smoother and quicker to introduce. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> is not influenced by varying breathing patterns and does not require any external regulation...|$|R
