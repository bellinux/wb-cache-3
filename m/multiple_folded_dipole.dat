40|$|A <b>folded</b> <b>dipole</b> {{is known}} as a {{classical}} wideband antenna and usually analyzed by decomposing into two coupling modes: dipole mode and twin-lead stub mode, which can be seen as an effective 2 -pole filter. A wideband microwave absorber surface can be formed by an array of receiving <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles</b> backed by a ground at λ/ 4, since the combination of the twin modes of <b>folded</b> <b>dipole</b> and the third coupling mode of λ/ 4 ground can achieve a 3 -pole filter.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis deals with designs and developments of multi(wide) -band multifunctional antennas based on <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles.</b> In the beginning, {{the concept of}} Orthogonal <b>Folded</b> <b>Dipoles</b> (OFD) are put forward. Orthogonal <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles</b> are formed by two identical two-port <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles</b> orthogonally joining with {{each other at the}} center, and can be fed through different combinations of feed nodes to offer dual- and wide-band modes, respectively. The impedances of the 2 modes are studied both by analytical models and by commercial electromagnetic simulation tools. The properties of the linearly polarized radiation patterns in the two modes vary quite little, except for ± 45 ◦  rotation of two principal planes. In this way, orthogonal <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles</b> can possibly provide pattern reconfigurability in a context of switchable types and orientations of polarizations. Next, the concept of Log-Periodic <b>Folded</b> <b>Dipole</b> Array (LPFDA) is proposed. It stems from the traditional log-periodic <b>dipole</b> array, whereas <b>folded</b> <b>dipoles</b> instead of straight dipoles are applied as the elements of the array. Two configurations, i. e. partly-scaled LPFDA and fully-scaled LPFDA, are studied through simulations and optimizations. The comparison shows that the latter outperforms the former in terms of higher directivity, reduced front-to-back ratio and lower crosspolar level. The key parts of this thesis focus on exploiting Eleven antennas, based on the LPFDAs, in a variety of applications. First, the 4 -port L-band lab model for use in satellite terminals demonstrates that the radiation patterns for monopulse tracking can be achieved through different excitation combinations of the multiport Eleven antenna. Second, a decade bandwidth, an unchanged phase center and nearly constant directivities over the whole band can be regarded as the major figure-of-merit of the Eleven antenna, which makes it suitable as feed for prime-fed reflector antennas. Through endeavors of using Genetic Algorithms, the wideband Eleven antennas have been gradually optimized in term of matching as well as efficiencies. Besides, the rotationally symmetric circular Eleven feed is a very promising solution for improving the BOR 1 efficiency and therefore the aperture efficiency by a fraction of dB. Last but not least, the two multiport L-band lab models measured in a reverberation chamber demonstrate that the Eleven antenna with MIMO diversity ports can possibly overcome narrowband multipath fading in a real radio link and improve the link quality in terms of a significant diversity gain and high maximum available capacity.
