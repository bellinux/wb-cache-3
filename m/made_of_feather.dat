5000|$|Fletching is {{traditionally}} made from bird feathers, but solid plastic vanes and thin sheet-like spin vanes are used. They are attached near the nock (rear) {{end of the}} arrow with thin double sided tape, glue, or, traditionally, sinew. The most common configuration in all cultures is three fletches, though {{as many as six}} have been used. Two makes the arrow unstable in flight. When the arrow is three-fletched, the fletches are equally spaced around the shaft, with one placed such that it is perpendicular to the bow when nocked on the string, though variations are seen with modern equipment, especially when using the modern spin vanes. This fletch is called the [...] "index fletch" [...] or [...] "cock feather" [...] (also known as [...] "the odd vane out" [...] or [...] "the nocking vane"), and the others are sometimes called the [...] "hen feathers". Commonly, the cock feather is of a different color. However, if archers are using fletching <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>feather</b> or similar material, they may use same color vanes, as different dyes can give varying stiffness to vanes, resulting in less precision. When an arrow is four-fletched, two opposing fletches are often cock feathers, and occasionally the fletches are not evenly spaced.|$|E

50|$|Aztecs and Incas perfected {{metalworking}} {{to a great}} art. Gold {{and silver}} jewelry was worn alongside ornaments <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>feathers,</b> shells, leather, and stones. Among the Aztecs, laws about which ornaments could be worn were strictly enforced. Only royalty could wear headdresses with gold and quetzal (a bird with brilliant blue-green feathers that reach three feet in length) feathers, for example. The weaving tradition, so important to Incas, helped create beautiful woven headdresses. Inca emperors wore woven hats trimmed with gold and wool tassels or topped with plumes, or showy feathers. Incas also created elaborate feather decorations for men: headbands <b>made</b> into crowns <b>of</b> <b>feathers,</b> collars around the neck, and chest coverings. In addition, wealthy Inca men wore large gold and silver pendants hung on their chests, disks attached to their hair and shoes, and bands around their arms and wrists. Inca women adorned themselves simply with a metal fastening for their cloak called a tupu. The head of their tupu was decorated with paint or silver, gold, or copper bells.|$|R

500|$|Birds and bats have {{homologous}} limbs {{because they}} are both ultimately derived from terrestrial tetrapods, but their flight mechanisms are only analogous, so their wings are examples of functional convergence. The two groups have powered flight, evolved independently. [...] Their wings differ substantially in construction. The bat wing is a membrane stretched across four extremely elongated fingers and the legs. The airfoil of the bird wing is <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>feathers,</b> strongly attached to the forearm (the ulna) and the highly fused bones of the wrist and hand (the carpometacarpus), with only tiny remnants of two fingers remaining, each anchoring a single feather. So, while the wings of bats and birds are functionally convergent, they are not anatomically convergent.|$|R

With Li Decheng also advocating the same before the Southern Tang emperor, in summer 938, Emperor Liezu converted the inner city of Run Prefecture (潤州, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) into Danyang Palace, and moved Yang Pu there.

60|$|Travelers {{who have}} been among them, in more recent times, before they had {{embarked}} in their present desperate struggle, represent them {{in much the same}} light; as leading a pleasant, indolent life, in a climate that required little shelter or clothing, and where the spontaneous fruits of the earth furnished subsistence without toil. A cleanly race, delighting in bathing, passing much of their time under the shade of their trees, with heaps of oranges and other fine fruits for their refreshment; talking, laughing, dancing and sleeping. Every chief had a fan hanging to his side, <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> <b>of</b> the wild turkey, the beautiful pink-colored crane, or the scarlet flamingo. With this he would sit and fan himself with great stateliness, while the young people danced before him. The women joined in the dances with the men, excepting the war-dances. They wore strings of tortoise-shells and pebbles round their legs, which rattled in cadence to the music. They were treated with more attention among the Seminoles than among most Indian tribes.|$|R

In order to flatter Wu Zetian and Zhang Changzong, Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang claimed that Zhang Changzong was the reincarnation of Ji Jin (姬晉), the crown prince of King Ling of Zhou, who, according to legends, rose to heaven to be a god.

50|$|The {{yellow-knobbed curassow}} (Crax daubentoni) {{is a large}} species of bird found in forest and {{woodland}} in Colombia and Venezuela. It feeds mainly on the ground, but flies up into trees if threatened. Its most striking features are its crest, <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> that curl forward, and the fleshy yellow knob {{at the base of}} its bill. Females lack this fleshy yellow knob, but otherwise resemble the male in the plumage, being overall black with a white crissum (the area around the cloaca). The adult is 84-92.5 cm (33-37 in) and weighs about 2-3 kg (4.4-6.6 lbs). It eats fruits, leaves, seeds, and small animals. Unlike most other gamebirds, curassows nest off the ground, with both sexes helping in the construction. The female lays just 2 eggs - a tiny clutch compared to those of many ground-nesting gamebirds.|$|R

5000|$|The tarsometatarsus {{and toes}} of most birds {{are covered in}} two types of scales. Large scutes run along the dorsal side of the tarsometatarsus and toes, whereas smaller scutellae run along the sides. Both {{structures}} share histochemical homology with reptilian scales, however work on their evolutionary development has revealed that the scales in bird feet have secondarily evolved via suppression of the feather-building genetic program. Unblocking the feather suppression program results in feathers growing in place of scales along the tarsometatarsus and toes. Dinosaur species {{very close to the}} origin of birds have been shown to have had [...] "hind wings" [...] <b>made</b> <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> growing from these areas, suggesting that the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>feathers</b> in dinosaurs was a whole-body event.

These data have led some researchers to suggest that reticulae are in fact highly truncated feathers ...|$|R
