Several calculations have been formulated from the load (P), elastic modulus (E), microindention hardness (H), crack length (c in Fig. 5) and flexural strength (σ). [...] <b>Modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> (<b>MOR)</b> bars with a rectangular cross-section are indented in three places on a polished surface. The bars are loaded in 4-point bending with the polished, indented surface in tension, until fracture. The fracture normally originates at one of the indentions. The crack lengths are measured under a microscope. The toughness of most ceramics is 2 - 4 MPa√m, but toughened zirconia is as much as 13, and cemented carbides are often over 20. The toughness-by-indention methods have been discredited recently and are being replaced by more rigorous methods that measure crack growth in a notched beam in flexure.|$|E

The compositions were manufactured in six different combinations of five veneers of 3. 2 mm thickness, glued with phenol-formaldehyde, resulting in treatments composed of wood of the same species or with a combination of two wood types. The evaluation of the proposed arrangements was performed under the characterization of physical properties (moisture content and density) and mechanical properties (<b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity – MOE and <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> – <b>MOR)</b> verified in flatwise and edgewise static bending tests. The results obtained indicated that, in most situations, the different positions of the veneers with higher density (in the outer, intermediate and inner layers) influenced the mechanical properties of the panels. The influence detected was varied for MOE and MOR, especially when comparing the flatwise and edgewise test values. In certain positions, on the layers of the LVL compositions, the presence of eucalypt veneers resulted in stiffness and strength increases. However, the treatments formed by interposed veneers of eucalypt and pine demonstrated interesting performances for structural use, in either flatwise or edgewise position, once they present values of MOE and MOR that allow to distinguish them as 1 st class, according to the North American standard APA/EWS PRL– 501 (2001) ...|$|R

40|$|The data {{performance}} for structural usage of highly engineered wood is very useful, however, the lacking {{of the data}} is very much concern for fast-growing indigenous timber species in timber engineering field. In correlation with that, the strength properties behaviour of Endospermum diadenum has to be studied to analyse the distribution pattern of strength properties at a different distance from the vortex also known as pith. The species have been obtained from the East Campus of Universiti Malaysia Sarawak’s forest reserve. Strength properties test were carried out namely, static bending (<b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> – <b>MOR</b> and <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> elasticity – MOE), and the compressive strength (compression stress parallel to grain). Meanwhile, physical properties test was carried out namely, moisture content (MC) and density. Small specimens measuring 20  x  20  mm were tested in green and dry conditions in accordance with British Standard, BS 373 : 1957 (British Standards Institution, 1957). The green condition refers to moisture content greater than 19 percent and dry condition with moisture content {{less than or equal}} 19 percent. All the results that had been tested were analyzed using statistical analysis as mean results. The strength properties of specimen increased from the pith towards the sapwood in which the strength is the lowest at 25  mm from pith followed by 50  mm, and the highest is at 75  mm from the pith. Distribution of the basic density also increases slightly from the pith towards the sapwood with a significant increment in average mean value at 25  mm from vortex with 0. 54  g/cm 3, 0. 62  g/cm 3 at 50  mm and 0. 66  g/cm 3 at 75  mm from the vortex. Meanwhile, for dry condition, the increases in average mean value with 0. 425  g/cm 3 at 25  mm, 0. 427  g/cm 3 at 50  mm and 0. 47  g/cm 3 at 75  mm from the vortex.

As shown in Fig.  2, the optimum hole diameter for internal bond strength was demonstrated, and as shown in Figs.  1 and 3, that for <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> and thickness swelling was not demonstrated.

30|$|The <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> is {{not well}} {{represented}} by the standard relationship with compressive strength. Tavakoli and Soroushian (1996) described that the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> tests <b>of</b> RCA concrete gave more varied results. The RCA concrete performed better in terms <b>of</b> the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> than conventional concrete at the higher water-cement ratio, but it performed worse at the lower water-cement ratio. Since the current model relating compressive and flexural strengths is inadequate, {{there should be more}} research on the impact of RCA on concrete flexural strength so that a new, more representative, relationship can be developed. Yang et al. (2008) examined how water absorption of RCA and the strength of RCA source concrete influence how well compressive strength predicts <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture.</b> This paper concluded that RCA concrete made with RCA from high strength source concrete with low water absorption perform like conventional concrete, while low strength source RCA with high water absorption yields a <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> less than predicted, likely due to the weak residual mortar layer (Yang et al. 2008). Since both compressive and tensile strengths generally decrease under the same conditions that cause reduced flexural strength, this conclusion is reasonable. While in flexure the top of the specimen experiences compression while the lower portion experiences tension. If either the compressive or tensile capacity of the specimen is compromised, the flexural strength will also be affected. Tensile strength was also greater than the predicted value for concrete with RCA from a high strength source with low water absorption. Since concrete is weaker in tension than in compression, it is reasonable that <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> would follow a similar pattern to tensile strength, the weaker chord resistance. Recent tests by Kang et al. (2012) proved that the <b>modulus</b> <b>of</b> <b>rupture</b> is moderately affected by the replacement of RCA.
