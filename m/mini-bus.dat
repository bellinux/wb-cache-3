2500|$|Sisi, who is {{reportedly}} facing a severe economic ordeal in Egypt, {{has decided to}} raise fuel prices by 78 percent as an introduction to cut the subsidies on basic food stuffs and energy, which eat up {{nearly a quarter of}} the state budget. The Egyptian government has always provided these subsidies as a crucial aid to millions of people who live in poverty, fearing people's anger in five years time. Egypt has spent $96 billion on energy subsidies in a decade which made petrol in Egypt among the world's cheapest. Cutting the energy subsidies will save 51 billion pounds. The government hopes the decision will benefit services such as health and education. Sisi also raised taxes on alcohol and cigarettes, applying a flat tax on local and imported cigarettes to between 25 and 40 cents per pack, as well as new property taxes, and plans to introduce a new scheme for value-added taxes. Chicken prices would reportedly rise by 25 percent days after the decision because of added transportation costs. <b>Mini-bus</b> and taxi fares were raised by about 13 percent. Slashing subsidies was recommended by international financial institutions, but no Egyptian leader had managed to broach the issue, fearing unrest in a country where nearly 50 percent of the population live in poverty and rely on government aid. President Sisi defended the decision to raise fuel prices, saying it was [...] "bitter medicine" [...] that should have been taken before and was [...] "50 years late" [...] but was not taken, as governments feared a backlash like the Bread Riots of 1977. Sisi, who had previously accepted only half of his own pay, called on Egyptians to make sacrifices, vowing to repair an economy growing at the slowest pace in two decades. Sisi warned Egyptians of more pain {{over the next two years}} from economic problems that he said had accumulated over the last four decades and needed to be fixed. Egypt also paid more than $6 billion it owed to foreign oil companies within two months. By March 2015 after 8 months of Sisi's rule, Egypt's external debt fell to $39.9billion, a drop of 13.5 percent.|$|E
50|$|As a driver-mechanic, Mr. Silvino Escobar {{learned the}} rudiments of the trade, so to speak, as he {{exercised}} complete discretion over his unit such as, but not limited to, trip schedules, unit maintenance and servicing, purchase and replacement of spare parts.
