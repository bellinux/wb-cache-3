On the eve of his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled blasting cap which he reportedly held in his <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cigar (the blast blew off half his face and he survived in agony for six hours).|$|E
500|$|Lloyd {{described}} Martello as [...] "a lanky, hungry scrapper with piercing eyes, {{the face}} of a dark angel, and a <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bear trap", while in her encyclopaedia on Wicca, Rosemary Ellen Guiley described him as [...] "a colourful figure, known for his humor". Bruno described him as [...] "a loving man, yet sometimes caustic", stating that to know him [...] "was an honor, and ever a challenge". He was often noted for his scruffy appearance, with him typically wearing second-hand clothes.|$|E
500|$|On an {{edition of}} ITV's The South Bank Show in November 1992, Richards commented that Formby [...] "embodied qualities that people admired and found reassuring in the depression... {{and you thought}} that here's a man whom {{whatever}} is thrown at him, will come through and come out smiling—and people wanted that". H.J. Igoe, writing in The Catholic Herald, thinks that [...] "Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slashed coconut, the silly little songs... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang a picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".|$|E

2500|$|Rath: Humpty Dumpty says {{following}} the poem: [...] "A 'rath' {{is a sort}} of green pig". [...] Carroll's notes for the original in [...] Mischmasch state that a 'Rath' is [...] "a species of land turtle. Head erect, <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shark, the front forelegs curved out so that the animal walked on its knees, smooth green body, lived on swallows and oysters." [...] In the 1951 animated film adaptation of the previous book, the raths are depicted as small, multi-coloured creatures with tufty hair, round eyes, and long legs resembling pipe stems.|$|E
2500|$|After her {{graduation}} from Vassar in 1917, Millay moved to New York City. She {{lived in a}} number of places in Greenwich Village, including a house owned by the Cherry Lane Theatre and 75½ Bedford Street, renowned for being the narrowest in New York City. [...] The critic Floyd Dell wrote that the red-haired and beautiful Millay was [...] "a frivolous young woman, with a brand-new pair of dancing slippers and a <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> valentine." [...] Millay described her life in New York as [...] "very, very poor and very, very merry." [...] While establishing her career as a poet, Millay initially worked with the Provincetown Players on Macdougal Street and the Theatre Guild. In 1924 Millay and others founded the Cherry Lane Theater [...] "to continue the staging of experimental drama." [...] Magazine articles under a pseudonym also helped support her early days in the village.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his article}} [...] "Too Gay for the U.S.A.", Andrew Webster of The Escapist used {{the history of}} Birdo in the lead-in to his article, commenting on how Nintendo tried to hide Birdo's gender confusion, and how [...] "He's {{just one of a}} long line of Japanese {{videogame}} characters forced to hide their true sexual identity". GamesRadar UK listed Birdo as one of [...] "gaming's most repelling anti-babes", describing her as a [...] "pink, egg blowing, transvestite dinosaur with a <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> burst fire hose," [...] thereby describing her as [...] "terrifying". Morgan Webb of X-Play created a video titled [...] "Birdo WTF", commenting that everyone initially thought of Birdo as a [...] "cute little dinosaur". She also describes her as a very feminine male character if she really is transgender. Nintendo Power listed Birdo as one of three weirdos, citing her change from being male to being a love interest for Yoshi. They described her gender as one of life's biggest questions, commenting on how she shoots eggs out of her mouth as another oddity. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commented that Birdo is [...] "the most gender-confused character in the history of Nintendo". He also commented on the relationship Yoshi and Birdo formed in Mario Tennis, stating, [...] "They were both sexually chaotic as individuals" [...] as [...] "Yoshi is supposedly a male, but lays eggs like a female. Birdo is supposedly a female, but was originally called a male." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{description}} of the beast is found primarily in Revelation chapters thirteen and seventeen. Chapter thirteen gives the fullest description. John saw it [...] "rise {{up out of the}} sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy." [...] (...) It was like a leopard, with feet like the feet of a bear, and had a <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lion. One of its heads had a mortal wound which healed itself, causing people to wonder at it and follow it. (...) This description draws many parallels with a vision in the Book of Daniel where four beasts symbolizing a succession of kingdoms come out of the sea in the forms of a lion, bear, leopard and a beast with ten horns. In Revelation chapter seventeen we learn of a third beast, scarlet in color and some of the symbols are explained. The prevailing view is that the scarlet beast is another, distinct, visualisation of the same subject as the beast of the sea, which is pictured with crowns on its horns, unlike the scarlet beast. The scarlet beast is shown being ridden by a harlot who [...] "reigns over the kings of the earth", (...) whereas the beast of the sea is not described as being ridden, and is given [...] "power and great authority." [...] The seven heads represent both seven mountains and seven kings, and the ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received kingdoms. Of the seven kings, five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come. The beast itself is an eighth king who is of the seven and was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition." ...|$|E

It was a single pill-shaped body and head with a mono-eye drawn on it, with rope-like limbs and <b>a</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> octopus.
