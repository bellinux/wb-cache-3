40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to the design of}} user interfaces for computer systems is the menu selection technique. Each <b>menu</b> <b>frame</b> can be considered a node in an information/action network. The set of nodes and the permissible transitions between them (menu selections) form a directed graph which, in a system of substantial size, can be large and enormously complex. The solution to this problem of unmanageable complexity is the same for menu networks as for programs: the disciplined use of a set of well-defined one-in-one-out structures. This paper defines a set of such structures and offers some guidelines for their use...|$|E
40|$|UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) is a web {{engineering}} methodology {{which provides}} a systematic approach to development of web applications. It provides a UML extension, defining modeling elements considering the extension mechanisms that are offered by UML. Navigation model {{is presented as a}} very critical characteristic in all the hypermedia and web methodologies; also homepage {{one of the most important}} pages on the web sites, because it is the key to showing the quality of websites. The UWE navigation model defined as a new proposal meaning still now need it to improve, the problem is elements of the UWE navigation model until now cannot support modules of the homepage especially new modules as Tab, Flash News, Main <b>Menu,</b> <b>Frame,</b> Multi Data and Application Icons, meaning it has weaknesses, in this paper we enhance the UWE navigation model through defining six elements by using an extension mechanism to fully support homepage development...|$|E
40|$|We assess {{investment}} sophistication in a {{large sample}} of auto-enrolled, retirement plan member choices. A strong preference for using {{a small number of}} investment options is provided with little evidence, overall, to support equally weighted allocations. However, when multiple options are selected, one-third are equally weighted allocations and this is more prevalent when an easily divisible number of options are used. Positive learning is suggested in patterns of choices with sophisticated choice more likely in later choices. Possible consequences of <b>menu</b> <b>framing,</b> specifically <b>menu</b> size, do not support influence on effective asset allocations...|$|R
50|$|Extensive {{changes were}} made in version 3.3 to use Yahoo!'s YUI library. This has {{increased}} {{the complexity of the}} version 3.2 code. The 3.3 application sports a more modern interface with drop down <b>menus</b> and no <b>frame.</b> Much of the 3.2 simple HTML user interface is still available depending on the menu items selected.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the validity of psychological experimental methods within human–computer interaction research (Carroll, 1989) and to examine design guidelines pertaining to hypertext link colour and positioning of navigation <b>menu</b> <b>frames</b> as part of web documents. The results of past research on both link colour and positioning of menus are mixed and guidelines are usually not based on empirical evidence (Tullis, 1997; Shneiderman, 1997). The study used a repeated measures experimental design. Participants carried out both a visual search task and an interactive search task. Task performance on the two tasks did not to correlate (p> 0. 05), indicating that the visual search task may lack external validity. Results of the interactive search task suggest that the design convention of blue links (Nielsen, 1999 a) should be retained as responses for blue {{were found to be}} significantly quicker than red, F(1, 117) = 14. 526, p< 0. 001, MScolour= 89. 866. Furthermore, an effect of presentation position, F(3, 117) = 8. 410, p< 0. 001, MSposition= 61. 015, was found, with support for menus on the left (Nielsen, 1999 a; Campbell & Maglio, 1999) or right (Nielsen, 1999 a). Evidence was also found to support the conjecture that experienced Internet users might have formed automatic attention responses to specific web page designs. The need for validation of behavioural and psychometric methods with task performance and the use of cognitive-perceptual-motor modelling are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Also, a Microsoft-compatible mouse is recommended. Windows 3.0 cannot run in {{full color}} on most 8086/88 machines, as the {{built-in}} 640×350 (16 color) EGA and 640×480 (16 color) VGA drivers contained Intel 80186 instructions. MCGA 320×200 (256 color) and 640×480 (2 color) drivers {{did not contain}} these instructions. This could be worked around by installing the Windows 2.x EGA/VGA drivers (which support color <b>menus</b> and <b>frames,</b> but not in-program graphics), replacing the CPU with an NEC V20/V30 (8086/88 pin-compatible chips with an 80186 instruction set), or by using a modified VGA driver that supports the 8086/88 (originally written in 2013). Microsoft had dropped support for the Tandy 1000 line by 1990, so a Tandy graphics driver was not provided for Windows 3.0, but the Windows 2.x Tandy driver could be copied into the target system and used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} virtual reality user {{interfaces}} (VRUI) is still an open field of research and development. One category of VRUI is the 3 D floating menus that can be manipulated by users in free space. These menus can contain various controls such as buttons, sliders, and text. This article presents an experimental study that aims at testing the impact of five spatial reference frames on human performance with VRUI. Fifteen subjects participated in the study. Wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) and tracking hardware, {{they were asked to}} move a slider on a floating menu in a 3 D virtual space. The menus were completely virtual such that no physical surface was providing haptic feedback to the user. Main results show that the reference frame has a determinant impact on task execution time, positional accuracy and user preference. We also found a link between the number of degrees of freedom shared between these reference frame and user performance. Results also show that user preference can greatly differ from experimental results obtained by measuring task completion times and positional accuracy.

40|$|Very {{powerful}} {{data base}} management systems (DBMS) now exist which allow medical personnel access to patient record data bases. DBMS's {{make it easy}} to retrieve either complete or abbreviated records of patients with similar characteristics. In addition, statistics on data base records are immediately accessible. However, the price of this power is a large computer with the inherent problems of access, response time, and reliability. If a general purpose, time-shared computer is used to get this power, the response time to a request can be either rapid or slow, depending upon loading by other users. Furthermore, if the computer is accessed via dial-up telephone lines, there is competition with other users for telephone ports. If either the DBMS or the host machine is replaced, the medical users, who are typically not sophisticated in computer usage, are forced to learn the new system. Microcomputers, because of their low cost and adaptability, lend themselves to a solution of these problems. A microprocessor-based intelligent terminal has been designed and implemented at the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine to provide a transparent interface between the user and his data base. The intelligent terminal system includes multiple microprocessors, floppy disks, a CRT terminal, and a printer. Users interact with the system at the CRT terminal using <b>menu</b> selection (<b>framing).</b> The system translates the menu selection into the query language of the DBMS and handles all actual communication with the DBMS and its host computer, including telephone dialing and sign on procedures, as well as the actual data base query and response. Retrieved information is stored locally for CRT display, hard copy production, and/or permanent retention. Microprocessor-based communication units provide security for sensitive medical data through encryption/decryption algorithms and high reliability error detection transmission schemes...|$|R
60|$|Yet {{he decided}} {{he was in no}} great hurry for lunch, in spite of an {{internal}} protest, and turned eastward along the Strand in a leisurely manner. He tried {{to find a place to}} suit him soon enough. He tried to remember the sort of things Walshingham had ordered. Before all things he didn't want to go into a place and look like a fool. Some of these places rook you dreadful, besides making fun of you. There was a place near Essex Street where there was a window brightly full of chops, tomatoes and lettuce. He stopped at this and reflected for a time, and then it occurred to him that you were expected to buy these things raw and cook them at home. Anyhow, there was sufficient doubt in the matter to stop him. He drifted on to a neat window with champagne bottles, a dish of asparagus and a <b>framed</b> <b>menu</b> of a two shilling lunch. He was about to enter, when fortunately he perceived two waiters looking at him over the back screen of the window with a most ironical expression, and he sheered off at once. There was a wonderful smell of hot food half way down Fleet Street and a nice looking Tavern with several doors, but he could not decide which door. His nerve was going under the strain.|$|R
40|$|Development of the {{integral}} referral Information System on Investigations of the Adriatic Sea, with built-in functional and organizational {{aspects of the}} performed investigations, is described. According to the selected development method, adapted to the software available CASE (Computed Aided System Engineering) »POSE« & RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System) »INGRES«, the Information System (IS) has been designed and implemented. The IS design process is described in detail. The system was subdivided into three subsystems: POM (Project Organization Module), EOM (Expedition Organization Module), and SPMM (Sampling and Parameter Measurements Module). The necessary entities and their relationships were defined using the E-R (Entity-Relationship) diagram concept. The integral E-R diagram {{was transformed into a}} set of 3 NF (Third Normal Form) relation schemes. The SQL (Structured Query Language) command file was generated and started in the INGRES, producing a relational database scheme. The integrity constraints were built into the database by defining 87 SQL procedures and 146 rules for 61 relation schemes. Therefore, the database integrity control could be performed while the data were inserted. The developed application is based on hierarchically organized <b>frames</b> (<b>Menu,</b> Browse and Report), allowing the information flow (»top- down«) between them. The application enables data presentation in space and time under user-defined conditions. The verification of the system was performed using real data from three research projects...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} non-standard economic behavior. The first chapter concerns two widely observed violations of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives, the Compromise and Attraction effects. I construct a novel method of representing them by reducing {{the context of a}} <b>menu</b> to a <b>frame,</b> encompassing the worst option along each attribute in the menu, and observing a collection of preferences indexed by frames. The agent behaves as though a good’s attractiveness along each attribute is judged relative to the frame with declining marginal utility. This allows me to give a novel interpretation of the compromise and attraction effects: they are consistent with indifference curves rotating clockwise as the frame moves down, and counter- clockwise as it goes left. It also allows me to give a representation theorem showing the behavioral axioms associated with a utility representation taking a good and the frame as arguments. The second chapter applies the representation from Chapter One to electoral politics. It shows that incorporating these preferences generates equilibria where extremist candidates enter plurality elections in order to attractively frame their preferred moderate candidate, even if the extremists have probability zero of obtaining office themselves. While such candidates are frequently observed in elections, and there are papers generating equilibria with centrist sure losers (including Solow (2015)), this is the first paper generating equilibria with these extremist candidates without unusual assumptions on election rules, or non single-peaked preferences. This paper creates a four candidate equilibrium with two extremist sure loser candidates, each on the fringes of opinion. The third chapter concerns the effect of guilt on preferences in the circumstance of gift giving. A decision maker who experiences guilt may receive an increase in surplus from a gift card allowing guilt-free indulgence, potentially beyond even the surplus she’d receive from an equivalent cash gift. This paper isolates the behavior of guilt avoidance by exploiting a multi-period setting which incorporates a distinction between the decision maker’s preferences over what she’d receive, and what she would choose. A representation inspired by Kopylov (2009) is adapted to this setting, providing a representation theorem for these preferences...|$|R
