25|$|The 1968 festival {{was halted}} on 19 May. Some directors, such as Carlos Saura and Miloš Forman, had {{withdrawn}} their films from the competition. On 18 May, filmmaker Louis <b>Malle</b> {{along with a}} group of directors took over the large room of the Palais and interrupted the projections in solidarity with students and labour on strike throughout France, and in protest to the eviction of the then President of the Cinémathèque Française. The filmmakers achieved the reinstatement of the President, and they founded the Film Directors' Society (SRF) that same year. In 1969, the SRF, led by Pierre-Henri Deleau created the Directors' Fortnight (Quinzaine des Réalisateurs), a new non-competitive section that programs a selection of films from around the world, distinguished by the independent judgment displayed in the choice of films.|$|E

500|$|Thillana Mohanambal, shot in Eastmancolor, {{was filmed}} in Thanjavur, Thiruvarur and Madurai, in the Cauvery delta. Many of the film's {{aesthetics}} were borrowed from Indian theatre, of which Nagarajan was an artist. The competition sequence between Ganesan and Padmini took about nine {{takes to be}} filmed. The film presented a mise-en-scène feel, mostly using frontal shots. The actors were lined up to face the camera and deliver their dialogue. Nagarajan, a former employee of the T. K. S. drama company, paid tribute to Shankardas Swamigalfrom whom the company had its ancestral rootsby naming a drama company in the film after the company's name.

500|$|During {{the classic}} period, {{there were many}} films {{produced}} in Europe, particularly in France, that share elements of style, theme, and sensibility with American film noirs and may themselves {{be included in the}} genre's canon. In certain cases, the interrelationship with Hollywood noir is obvious: American-born director Jules Dassin moved to France in the early 1950s {{as a result of the}} Hollywood blacklist, and made one of the most famous French film noirs, Rififi (1955). Other well-known French films often classified as noir include Quai des Orfèvres (1947) [...] and Les Diaboliques (1955), both directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot; Casque d'Or (1952) and Touchez pas au grisbi (1954), both directed by Jacques Becker; and Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (1958), directed by Louis <b>Malle.</b> French director Jean-Pierre Melville is widely recognized for his tragic, minimalist film noirs—Bob le flambeur (1955), from the classic period, was followed by Le Doulos (1962), Le deuxième souffle (1966), Le Samouraï (1967), and Le Cercle rouge (1970).|$|E

He said [...] "there is only one scene missing in this re-construction, a scene that isn't very important. It's a scene with me and Roland Toutain that deals with the maids' sexual interest." [...] The {{restored}} version premiered at the 1959 Venice Film Festival, where it was called a masterpiece. Claude Chabrol, Alain Resnais and Louis <b>Malle</b> were all in attendance and publicly called Renoir their master while praising the new {{version of the}} film. In 1961 Howard Thompson of the New York Times said the film [...] "completely justified its European reputation... a memorable experience." [...] Archer Winsten of the New York Post praised the film for [...] "showing the corruption of French society from top to bottom" [...] and a New York Herald Tribune review called it [...] "a satire on French society... a sharp criticism of social pretenses." [...] The reconstructed version of the film was exhibited in France on April 23, 1965. It won the 1966 Bodil Award for Best Non-American Film/Best European Film (Bedste europæiske film) (Spillets regler) in Denmark.|$|E

500|$|Short Cuts {{was one of}} a trio of {{successive}} film appearances that boosted Moore's reputation. It {{was followed}} in 1994 with Vanya on 42nd Street, a filmed version of her ongoing Uncle Vanya workshop production, directed by Louis <b>Malle.</b> Moore's performance of Yelena was described as [...] "simply outstanding" [...] by Time Out, and she won the Boston Society of Film Critics award for Best Actress. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops multiple chemical sensitivity in Todd Haynes' low-budget film Safe (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, Empire magazine writes that Safe [...] "first established [...] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation." [...] The film historian David Thomson later described it as [...] "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s," [...] and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Actress. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, [...] "They all came out at once, and I suddenly had this profile. It was amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{especially}} appreciated by filmmakers and film critics {{associated with the}} French New Wave movement. André Bazin said [...] "as a conventional love story, the film {{could have been a}} success if the scenario had respected the rules of the movie game. But Renoir wanted to make his own style of drame gai, and the mixture of genres proved disconcerting to the public." [...] Film critic Claude Beylie called it [...] "the cornerstone of the work of Jean Renoir, the point of arrival and the swan song of the French cinema of the thirties...The Rules of the Game is a rare combination of satire, vaudeville and tragedy." [...] It was a major source of inspiration for Alain Resnais, who said seeing the film was [...] "the single most overwhelming experience I have ever had at the cinema";and [...] Louis <b>Malle,</b> who said [...] "for all of us, my generation of French filmmakers, La Regle du jeu was the absolute masterpiece." [...] François Truffaut articulated the film's enormous influence and said [...] "it isn't an accident that The Rules of the Game inspired a large number of young people who had first thought of expressing themselves as novelists to take up careers as filmmakers." [...] He also said [...] "It is the credo of movie lovers, the film of films, the film most hated when it was made and most appreciated afterwards, {{to the extent that it}} ultimately became a true commercial success." ...|$|E
2500|$|Damage, a UK and French co-production, is {{the story}} of a British {{conservative}} minister played by Jeremy Irons who embarks on a torrid affair with his son's fiancée (Binoche). Based on the novel by Josephine Hart and directed by veteran French director Louis <b>Malle,</b> Damage seemed to be the ideal international vehicle for Binoche; however the production was wrought with difficulties and dogged by rumours of serious conflict. In an on-set interview, <b>Malle</b> stated that it was the [...] "most difficult" [...] film he had ever made, while Binoche commented that [...] "the first day was one big argument". Damage opened in the UK late in 1992 and debuted early in 1993 on US screens. Reviews were somewhat mixed. For her performance, Binoche received her fourth César nomination.|$|E

Almodóvar also recommended Suárez watch Elevator to the Gallows (1958) by Louis <b>Malle</b> and The Hours (2002) by Stephen Daldry, and that she contemplate Lucian Freud's paintings. Suárez also watched Almodóvar's complete filmography and stayed alone in Madrid {{to prepare for the}} character. [...] "It's a very tough character.

The French have a similar word, <b>malle</b> for a trunk or large box, and mála is the Irish term for a bag. In the 17th century, the word mail began to appear as a reference for a bag that contained letters: [...] "bag full of letter" [...] (1654). Over the next hundred years the word mail began to be applied strictly to the letters themselves, and the sack as the mailbag. In the 19th century the British usually referred to mail as being letters that were being sent abroad (i.e. on a ship), and post as letters that were for localized delivery; in the UK the Royal Mail delivers the post, while in the U.S. the U.S. Postal Service delivers the mail. The term email (short for [...] "electronic mail") {{first appeared in the}} 1970s. The term snail-mail is a retronym to distinguish it from the quicker email.
