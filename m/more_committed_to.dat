5|$|Braun herself {{attempted}} suicide on 10 or 11 August 1932 by shooting {{herself in the}} chest with her father's pistol. Historians feel the attempt was not serious, but was a bid for Hitler's attention. After Braun's recovery, Hitler became <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> her {{and by the end}} of 1932 they had become lovers. She often stayed overnight at his Munich apartment when he was in town. Beginning in 1933, Braun worked as a photographer for Hoffmann. This position enabled her to travel—accompanied by Hoffmann—with Hitler's entourage as a photographer for the Nazi Party. Later in her career she worked for Hoffman's art press.|$|E

5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

40|$|Aim of the study: {{to study}} {{hospital}} employees‘ {{job satisfaction and}} organizational commitment in Šilalė district hospital and Klaipėda county hospital. The methods of the study. The anonymous questionnaire, containing 23 questions, was developed for the survey. The {{respondents were asked to}} score responses on a 7 -point Likert scale where 1 stood for „completely disagree/completely dissatisfied“ and 7 – „completely agree/completely satisfied“. The response rate of Šilalė hospital employees‘ was 91 % (N = 117) and of Klaipėda hospital – 60 % (N = 378). The collected survey data was analysed using SPSS statistical analysis package, version 11. 0. Results. Employees‘ overall job satisfaction (5, 5) and the level of organizational commitment (4, 2) is not high. Šilalė hospital employees, comparing them with Klaipėda, are more satisfied with the job (accordingly 5, 9 ir 5, 3) and are <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> <b>to</b> the organization (accordingly 4, 7 ir 4, 0). Health professionals are mostly satisfied with such job dimensions as relationship with their colleagues (5, 7), opportunity for professional growth (5, 1) and possibility for using their skills at work (4, 9). The main dissatisfiers are salary (2, 8), opportunity for advancement (3, 7), social security (3, 9). The level of affective and continuance commitment is not high (accordingly 4, 7 and 4, 4), and normative commitment – low (3, 6). The strongest correlation (Spearmen‘s ratio) was observed between overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with proffesion - 0, 464, satisfaction with career - 0, 487. Hospital employees‘ satisfaction with their profession is not high (4, 4) – doctors and nurses are not likely to recommend their proffesion for the children (2, 8). Elder emloyees and these having big job experience are more satisfied with their profession and <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> <b>to</b> the organization. Doctors and nurses who has less workload are more satisfied with their job and <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> <b>to</b> the organization. Conclusions. Hospital employees are satisfied with the job but their organizational commitment is relatively low. The doctors and nurses are mostly satisfied with relationship with colleagues, opportunity for professional growth and possibility for using their skills at work. The main factors influencing job dissatisfaction are salary, opportunity for advancement, social security. Elder emloyees and these having big job experience and less workload are <b>more</b> <b>more</b> <b>commited</b> <b>to</b> the organization...|$|R

In 2012, philanthropic sources provided 15.9% of the total funding. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been a leader in providing funding for neglected disease drug development. They have provided $444.1 million US dollars towards neglected disease research in 2012. To date, they have donated over $1.02 billion US dollars towards the neglected disease discovery efforts.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol myopia {{has also}} been found to affect one’s level of {{commitment}} to a personal goal. Individual commitment to a goal is dependent upon level of personal desire and feasibility of the goal. A person’s ability to appropriately interpret feasibility is inhibited by alcohol myopia. This is because desire is a more salient stimulus than feasibility, causing those experiencing alcohol myopia to ignore the less salient stimulant of feasibility. Because one is less inhibited {{by the prospect of}} unfeasible goals, those under the influences of alcohol myopia tend to feel <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> their goals than sober individuals. Studies testing the relationship between intoxication and level of commitment to goals support the theory that increased goal commitment (despite level of feasibility) is a side effect of alcohol myopia.|$|E

He moved to Perth to attend secondary schooling at Guildford Grammar School, where he became <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> swimming. Competitive swimming was not well developed in Western Australia; races were held in muddy river pools. So in late 1955, O'Halloran moved to the east coast to support his attempt to qualify for the Olympics. His new coach, Frank Guthrie, overhauled his training regimen, and within a year O'Halloran had reduced his times by approximately ten percent. He gained Olympic selection in the relay and the 400-metre freestyle. O'Halloran led off the Australian quartet {{on the way to a}} new world record, before placing sixth in the 400-metre.|$|E

McPherson argued that even Angelou's decision to leave show business was political, and regarded this book as [...] "a social and cultural history of Black Americans" [...] during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Angelou saw herself as a historian of both the Civil Rights movement and the Black literary movement of the time. She became more attracted to the causes of Black militants, both in the U.S. and in Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make, and became <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> activism. She became an active political protestor during this period, but she did not think of herself in that way. Instead, the focus was on herself, and she used the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the Civil Rights movement influenced one person involved in it. According to Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and effective.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Quebec did {{not support}} the Charter (or the Canada Act 1982), with [...] "conflicting interpretations" [...] as to why. The {{opposition}} could have owed to the Parti Québécois leadership being allegedly uncooperative, because it was <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> gaining sovereignty for Quebec. It could have owed to Quebec leaders being excluded from the negotiation of the Kitchen Accord, which they saw as being too centralist. It could have owed to provincial leaders' objections to the Accord's provisions relating to the process of future constitutional amendment. They also opposed the inclusion of mobility rights and minority language education rights. The Charter is still applicable in Quebec because all provinces are bound by the Constitution. However, Quebec's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has led to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution (the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec's political approval of the Canadian constitutional order.|$|E
2500|$|The {{response}} to this union crisis in Australia is the Organising Works program which was established in 1994 to recruit organizers from union members and university students. The Organizing Works Program, in Australia, was established after representatives from Australian unions visited the U.S. and observed the organizing model in practice. Organising Works is a relatively unique program in Australia, in that it combines explicit training in trade unionism with an apprenticeship system with specific trade unions. Bob Carter and Rae Cooper state that Organizing Works was successful in spreading {{the message of the}} model and recruiting new members for unions, and in general, Australian unions were <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the organizing model than were British unions. David Peetz and Barbara Pocock state that in the first six years of the Organizing Works Program in Australia, [...] "...it had produced over 300 trainees..." [...] Carter and Cooper discuss the [...] "Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU)" [...] as one of the main Australian unions to implement the organizing model on a large scale in {{response to}} union decline. Peetz and Pocock talk about the [...] "Unions@Work" [...] report that was published for unions in 1999, which even continued the mission of the Organizing Works program. Peetz and Pocock emphasize that the organizing model was implemented differently in different Australian unions and that the aspects of the organizing model that got implemented differed by union.|$|E

[...] As she told a reporter in a 1934 interview, [...] "I had no clients. And I had no money. [...] But I had great hopes." [...] However, in order to become successful, what she needed was some experience, so she did volunteer work with the local Legal Aid Society, where she not only got that experience but got involved with an important case about suffrage. [...] As a child, her mother had taken her to see famous suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw giving talks about women's rights. [...] And the belief that women should be treated as equals under the law undoubtedly resonated with her even more {{as a result of her}} struggles to be taken seriously as an attorney. [...] She became even more interested in politics, and <b>more</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the cause of women's suffrage. [...] She was active in the Women's Suffrage Party and began challenging local laws that limited women's participation in the political process. And she argued one particular case that went all the way to the Ohio Supreme Court: thanks to her efforts, she won the women of East Cleveland the right to vote in municipal elections. [...] During this time, she also became involved in another cause, one that would be important to her all of her life: [...] disarmament and the quest for world peace. [...] For Allen, this was personal: [...] both of her brothers died while serving their country during the First World War.|$|E

A survey of business school and public administration school students challenged conventional wisdom. A majority of participants expressed greater commitment to interpersonal than leadership goals and, overall, men's commitment to interpersonal goals was similar to women's. Finally, {{there was no evidence of}} a perceived tradeoff between goals: most groups in our sample exhibited a strong positive correlation between commitments to interpersonal and leadership goals. We discuss implications for multiple commitments research, the experience of leadership, and possible differences between today's emerging leaders and their predecessors. ...|$|R
