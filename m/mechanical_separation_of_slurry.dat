Acidification and <b>mechanical</b> <b>separation</b> are currently implemented independently at the farm scale in different European countries. However there are drawbacks associated to the current acidification treatment, and it is unknown how acidification before separation affects slurry characteristics and gaseous emissions. This thesis presents an in-depth investigation of the combined acidification and <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>slurry</b> by analyzing {{the composition of the}} fractions obtained and the impact on gaseous emissions during storage. Systematic studies for acidification were performed using different additives, target pH values and approaches and different techniques were used to separate different types <b>of</b> <b>slurries.</b> The effects <b>of</b> acidification on <b>slurries</b> dry matter, organic matter and nutrient (N and P) content and their soluble forms were studied and gaseous emissions were followed during storage. The effects <b>of</b> acidification on <b>slurry</b> particle size, nutrient distribution among particles and on separation efficiency were studied. In the acidification experiments, alum emerged as a highly efficient additive for reducing NH 3 emissions. The nutrient composition and potential of N mineralization <b>of</b> acidified <b>slurry</b> fractions differed depending on the separation technique used. Acidification affected differently the particle size in slurries, the nutrient distribution among particles and the separation efficiency depending on the additive used. The use of alum promoted an increase of the solid fraction and an almost complete removal of P (90 %) to the solid fraction. According to our results, combined acidification and separation improves slurry management: It increases the amount of solid fractions, preserves N in slurries by reducing NH 3 emissions during separation, increases the P separation efficiency to the solid fraction, and reduces the total NH 3 and GHG emissions during storage. Therefore, the combined technology provides farmers with an economically sound and environmentally safe approach to slurry re-us...|$|R

From genetic and mating call analysis and, researchers were able to identify that two populations of the túngara frog were almost completely reproductively isolated.

Specifically, the Yasuní population females prefer the male mating call that includes a whine, while the other population does not prefer this whine. Subsequently, the Yasuní males include the whine in their call, while the other males do not.
