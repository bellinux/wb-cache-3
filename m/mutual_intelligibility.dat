5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects typically have relatively high degrees of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> but the degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E
5|$|Differences in {{pronunciation}} between Ottawa {{and other}} dialects of Ojibwe, {{resulting in a}} lower degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four major Chinese-speech {{groups are}} {{represented}} in Indonesia: Hokkien, Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese. In addition to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect that has some degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> {{among these}} ASL {{varieties}} is high, and the variation is primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), {{as shown in the}} videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E
5|$|Swedish is an Indo-European {{language}} {{belonging to}} the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. In the established classification, {{it belongs to the}} East Scandinavian languages together with Danish, separating it from the West Scandinavian languages, consisting of Faroese, Icelandic and Norwegian. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: Insular Scandinavian (Faroese and Icelandic), and Continental Scandinavian (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic.|$|E
5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> the Continental Scandinavian languages {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Slovak dialects {{have the}} {{greatest}} degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with Polish of all the Slovak dialects followed by Rusyn, but both lack technical terminology and upper register expressions. Polish and Sorbian also differ quite considerably from Czech and Slovak in upper registers, but non-technical and lower register speech is readily intelligible. Some <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> occurs with spoken Rusyn, Ukrainian, and even Russian (in this order), although their orthographies {{are based on the}} Cyrillic script.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainian has {{varying degrees}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with other Slavic {{languages}} and {{is considered to be}} most closely related to Belarusian.|$|E
25|$|Ethnologue still {{uses the}} earlier pre-Wichmann classification, based on surveys of <b>Mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> and {{comparative}} work by William Wonderly, {{as a basis}} for their work. This classification is not used by historical linguists, and Lyle Campbell's authoritative 1997 presentation uses Wichmann's classification.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Ukrainian {{language is}} {{regulated by the}} National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NANU), particularly by its Institute for the Ukrainian Language, Ukrainian language-information fund, and Potebnya Institute of Language Studies. The Ukrainian language retains a degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with Belarusian and Russian.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{vocabulary}} and pronunciation differences, there is <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> among Burmese dialects, {{as for the}} most part, they share the same four tones, consonant clusters {{and the use of}} the Burmese script. However, several dialects substantially differ in Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes.|$|E
25|$|The dialects of the Catalan {{language}} {{feature a}} relative uniformity, especially {{when compared to}} other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. <b>Mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%. The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Alguerese dialect.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} main Breton dialects: Gwenedeg (Vannes), Kerneveg (Cornouaille), Leoneg (Leon) and Tregerieg (Trégor), which have {{varying degrees of}} <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> In 1908, a {{standard}} orthography was devised. The fourth dialect, Gwenedeg, {{was not included in}} this reform, but was included in the later orthographic reform of 1941.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} main dialects, {{two of which}} are on {{probably}} the verge of extinction, one (Kaiwaligau Ya) through convergence to the neighbouring Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Within the dialects there are two or more subdialects. The average <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> rate, based on a Swadesh count, is around 97%.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 90 to 95% of Afrikaans vocabulary {{is ultimately}} of Dutch origin, {{and there are}} few lexical {{differences between the two}} languages. Afrikaans has a considerably more regular morphology, grammar, and spelling. There is a degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> between the two languages, particularly in written form.|$|E
25|$|Swedish is the {{official}} language of Sweden and is spoken by {{the vast majority of}} the 10 million inhabitants of the country. It is a North Germanic language and quite similar to its sister Scandinavian languages, Danish and Norwegian, with which it maintains partial <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> and forming a dialect continuum.|$|E
25|$|An Austronesian language, it {{is related}} to such {{languages}} as Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Tetum, Chamorro, Fijian, Maori, Hawaiian, Samoan, Tahitian, Paiwan and Malagasy. It {{is closely related to}} some of the other Austronesian languages of Northern Luzon, and has slight <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with the Balangao language and the eastern dialects of the Bontoc language.|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> between Dutch and Afrikaans {{is better}} than between Dutch and Frisian or between Danish and Swedish. The South African poet writer Breyten Breytenbach, {{attempting}} to visualize the language distance for anglophones once remarked that the differences between (Standard) Dutch and Afrikaans are comparable to those between the Received Pronunciation and Southern American English.|$|E
25|$|Slovene is {{a highly}} diverse Slavic {{language}} in terms of dialects, with different degrees of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> Accounts {{of the number of}} dialects range from as few as seven dialects, often considered dialect groups or dialect bases that are further subdivided into as many as 50 dialects. Other sources characterize the number of dialects as nine or as eight.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began with}} the {{separation}} of a distinct speech, perhaps {{while it was still}} forming part of the Proto-Indo-European dialect continuum. It contained many innovations that were shared with other Indo-European branches to various degrees, probably through areal contacts, and <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with other dialects would have remained for some time. It was nevertheless on its own path, whether dialect or language.|$|E
25|$|Although Quebec French {{constitutes}} a coherent and standard system, {{it has no}} objective norm since the very organization mandated to establish it, the Office québécois de la langue française, believes that objectively standardizing Quebec French would lead to reduced <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with other French communities around the world, linguistically isolating Quebecers and possibly causing the extinction of the French language in the Americas.|$|E
25|$|Affirmation of the {{classification}} of Macedonian as a separate language {{is an important issue}} for the ethnic Macedonian self-view. Critics often treat it as a dialect of Bulgarian, due to their close structural affinity and <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> in both written and spoken forms; they also point to Macedonian's recent emergence as a separate standard language, and the political motivation behind its promotion in the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the core}} {{vocabulary}} and grammar of Galician are still noticeably closer to Portuguese than {{to those of}} Spanish. In particular, like Portuguese, it uses the future subjunctive, the personal infinitive, and the synthetic pluperfect. <b>Mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> (estimated at 90% by R. A. Hall, Jr., 1989) is excellent between Galicians and northern Portuguese. Many linguists consider Galician to be a co-dialect of the Portuguese language.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans {{acquired}} some lexical and syntactical borrowings {{from other}} languages such as Malay, Khoisan languages, Portuguese, {{and of the}} Bantu languages, and Afrikaans has also been significantly influenced by South African English. Dutch speakers are confronted with fewer non-cognates when listening to Afrikaans {{than the other way}} round. <b>Mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> thus tends to be asymmetrical, as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand Afrikaans than for Afrikaans speakers to understand Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Although Afrikaans {{has adopted}} words from other languages, {{including}} Portuguese, the Bantu languages, Malay, German and the Khoisan languages, an estimated 90 to 95% of {{the vocabulary of}} Afrikaans is of Dutch origin. Therefore, differences with Dutch often lie in the more analytic morphology and grammar of Afrikaans, and a spelling that expresses Afrikaans pronunciation rather than standard Dutch. There is a large degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> between the two languages—especially in written form.|$|E
25|$|The 12th century Icelandic Gray Goose Laws {{state that}} Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, dǫnsk tunga ("Danish tongue"; {{speakers}} of Old East Norse {{would have said}} dansk tunga). Another term used, used especially commonly with reference to West Norse, was norrǿnt mál ("Nordic/Northern speech"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Slavic {{language}} varieties tend to {{be closely}} related, and have had a large degree of mutual influence, due to the complicated ethnopolitical history of their historic ranges. This {{is reflected in the}} many features Slovak shares with neighboring language varieties. Standard Slovak shares high degrees of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> with many Slavic varieties. Despite this closeness to other Slavic varieties, significant variation exists among Slovak dialects. In particular, eastern varieties differ significantly from the standard language, which is based on central and western varieties.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic {{features}} of Turkish, such as vowel harmony, agglutination, {{and lack of}} grammatical gender, are universal within the Turkic family. There is also {{a high degree of}} <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> among the various Oghuz languages, which include Turkish, Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Qashqai, Gagauz, Balkan Gagauz Turkish, and Oghuz-influenced Crimean Tatar. Although methods of classification vary, the Turkic languages are usually considered to be divided equally into two branches: Oghur, the only surviving member of which is Chuvash, and Common Turkic, which includes all other Turkic languages including the Oghuz subbranch.|$|E
25|$|Many Occitan {{linguists}} and writers, {{particularly those}} {{involved with the}} pan-Occitan movement centred on the Institut d'Estudis Occitans, disagree with the view that Occitan is a family of languages and think that Limousin, Auvergnat, Languedocien, Gascon, Provençal and Vivaro-Alpine are dialects of a single language. Although there are indeed noticeable differences between these varieties, {{there is a very}} high degree of <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> between them; they also share a common literary history, and in academic and literary circles, have been identified as a collective linguistic entitythe for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Faroese retains many {{similarities}} but {{is influenced}} by Danish, Norwegian, and Gaelic (Scottish and/or Irish). Although Swedish, Danish and the Norwegian languages have diverged the most, they still retain asymmetric <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> Speakers of modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish can mostly understand each other without studying their neighboring languages, particularly if speaking slowly. The languages are also sufficiently similar in writing that they can mostly be understood across borders. This could be because these languages have been mutually affected by each other, as well as having a similar development influenced by Middle Low German.|$|E
25|$|Most {{inhabitants}} of Silesia today speak the national languages {{of their respective}} countries (Polish and Czech, {{both of which are}} Western Slavic languages, with some, albeit limited, <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility).</b> The population of Upper Silesia is native (with some immigrants from Poland who came in the 19th to 20th centuries), while Lower Silesia was settled by a German-speaking population before 1945. An ongoing debate exists whether Silesian speech should be considered a dialect of Polish or a separate language. Also, a Lower Silesian German dialect is used, although today it is almost extinct. It is used by expellees within Germany, as well as Germans who were left behind.|$|E
25|$|The four Yupik languages, by contrast, {{including}} Alutiiq (Sugpiaq), Central Alaskan Yup'ik, Naukan (Naukanski), and Siberian Yupik, {{are distinct}} languages with phonological, morphological, and lexical differences. They demonstrate limited <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> Additionally, both Alutiiq and Central Yup'ik have considerable dialect diversity. The northernmost Yupik languages – Siberian Yupik and Naukanski Yupik – are linguistically only slightly closer to Inuit than is Alutiiq, {{which is the}} southernmost of the Yupik languages. Although the grammatical structures of Yupik and Inuit languages are similar, they have pronounced differences phonologically. Differences of vocabulary between Inuit and {{any one of the}} Yupik languages are greater than between any two Yupik languages. Even the dialectal differences within Alutiiq and Central Alaskan Yup'ik sometimes are relatively great for locations that are relatively close geographically.|$|E
25|$|When Braille {{was first}} adapted to {{languages}} other than French, many schemes were adopted, including mapping the native alphabet to the alphabetical order of French – e.g. in English W, {{which was not}} in the French alphabet at the time, is mapped to braille X, X to Y, Y to Z, and Z to the first French-accented letter – or completely rearranging the alphabet such that common letters are represented by the simplest braille patterns. Consequently, <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> was greatly hindered by this state of affairs. In 1878, the International Congress on Work for the Blind, held in Paris, proposed an international braille standard, where braille codes for different languages and scripts would be based, not on the order of a particular alphabet, but on phonetic correspondence and transliteration to Latin.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{differences}} in dialect and denomination, linguists consider Catalan and Valencian two varieties {{of the same}} language. They feature relative uniformity in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology and phonology. <b>Mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> ranges from 90 to 95%, which is considerably higher than between dialects of an assumed single German language (High German). Furthermore, there is a dialect continuum where speakers at the Catalan–Valencian border share the same dialect. In practice, Catalan and Valencian share the same written standard, as established by the AVL and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans respectively. Much of the bibliography used in the Valencian education system consists of Catalan works and translations in Catalan with only occasionally some words being swapped for those more commonly used in Valencia. Furthermore, the Universities of Valencia and Alicante refer to Valencian studies of language and literature as Catalan Philology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the ninth century, the Slavic dialect spoken north of Thessaloniki, in the hinterlands of Macedonia, became the basis for the first written Slavic language, created by the {{brothers}} Cyril and Methodius who translated portions of the Bible and other church books. The language they recorded is known as Old Church Slavonic. Old Church Slavonic is not identical to Proto-Slavic, having been recorded at least two centuries after the breakup of Proto-Slavic, and it shows features that clearly distinguish it from Proto-Slavic. However, it is still reasonably close, and the <b>mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> between Old Church Slavonic and other Slavic dialects of those days was proved by Cyril and Methodius' mission to Great Moravia and Pannonia. There, their early South Slavic dialect used for the translations was clearly understandable to the local population which spoke an early West Slavic dialect.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began its}} {{evolution}} as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European {{that had lost}} its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels {{as well as one}} or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. <b>Mutual</b> <b>intelligibility</b> might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, {{but it would have been}} strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.|$|E
