25|$|The {{degree of}} {{inactivation}} by ultraviolet radiation {{is directly related}} to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as <b>microwatt</b> seconds per square centimeter (µW·s/cm2). Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000µW·s/cm2. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for one-decimal-logarithm reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500µW·s/cm2 is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the <b>microwatt</b> level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur {{even in an}} idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum envelope to conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.|$|E

40|$|The {{applicability}} of the LKB flow microcalorimeter in a microalgal system was tested. Respiration and its sensitivity to 2, 4 -dinitrophenol during different stages of a synchronous culture of Scenedesmus obtusiusculus were studied. In cells harvested during the first 8 hours of illumination, heat evolution was 10 to 15 <b>microwatts</b> per 10 million cells and then rose to a peak of about 80 <b>microwatts</b> per 10 million when the cells were harvested {{in the beginning of}} the dark period, just before the onset of the divisions. Calculated per milligram dry weight, the highest values were about 140 <b>microwatts,</b> also obtained early in the dark period, after which the values dropped. They were roughly 90 <b>microwatts</b> per milligram at the onset of light and a little below 70 <b>microwatts</b> per milligram after 8 hours of illumination. Thus, the synthesis of new cell material does not give rise to actively respiring mitochondria during the first half of the light period, after which the situation is reversed. Low concentrations of dinitrophenol increased heat evolution, and high concentrations were inhibitory. Cells from the early stages of development were more sensitive to dinitrophenol than older cells. Young cells gave a transient peak of heat evolution even when the steady state was inhibited. Coupled oxidative phosphorylation seems necessary for substrate mobilization and transport to the mitochondria of the young cells. Possibly, young cells use mainly fatty acids and old cells carbohydrates as their main substrate for respiration...|$|R

50|$|Superregeneration is most {{valuable}} above 27 MHz, and for signals where broad tuning is desirable.

It is easily possible to build superregen receivers which operate at <b>microwatt</b> power levels, in the 30 to 6,000 MHz range. It removes {{the need for the}} operator to manually adjust regeneration level to just below the point of oscillation - the circuit automatically is taken out of oscillation periodically, but with the disadvantage that small amounts of interference may be a problem for others. These are ideal for remote-sensing applications or where long battery life is important.

40|$|The Soft Xray Spectrometer (SXS) {{instrument}} on-board the ASTRO-H X-ray {{mission is}} based on microcalorimeters operating at 50 mK. Low temperature is achieved by use of an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) cyclically operating up to a heat sink at either 1. 2 K or 4. 5 K. The 1. 2 K heat sink is provided by a 40 liter superfluid helium dewar. The parasitic heat to the helium from supports, plumbing, wires, and radiation, and the cyclic heat dumped by the ADR operation determine the liquid helium lifetime. To measure this lifetime we have used various techniques to rapidly achieve thermal equilibrium and then measure the boil-off rate of the helium. We have measured a parasitic heat of 650 <b>microwatts</b> and a cyclic heat of 100 <b>microwatts</b> {{for a total of}} 750 <b>microwatts.</b> This closely matches the predicted heat load.

40|$|Abstract — The {{first ever}} planar Schottky diode multi-plier working over a THz will be {{presented}} in this paper. A tunerless 1. 2 THz waveguide frequency tripler has been de-signed, fabricated and tested. The frequency multiplier con-sists of a 3 micron-thick GaAs frameless-membrane mono-lithic circuit, mounted in a split waveguide-block, which in-cludes a built-in Picket-Potter horn. The 1. 2 THz membrane tripler is driven by a 400 GHz solid-state chain composed of HEMT based power amplifiers followed by two tunerless planar diode frequency doublers. At room temperature, out-put power up to 80 <b>microwatts</b> was measured at 1126 GHz with a peak-efficiency of 0. 9 % and a 3 dB bandwidth of about 3. 5 %. The output power of the multiplier chain increased dramatically with a decrease of the ambient temperature up to 195 <b>microwatts</b> was measured at 120 K.

50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of pulse-based UWB SAR {{is that the}} transmitting and receiving front-end electronics are difficult to design for high-power applications. Specifically, the transmit duty cycle is so exceptionally low and pulse time so exceptionally short, that the electronics must be capable of extremely high instantaneous power to rival the average power of conventional radars. (Although {{it is true that}} UWB provides a notable gain in channel capacity over a narrow band signal because of the relationship of bandwidth in the Shannon-Hartley theorem and because the low receive duty cycle receives less noise, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, there is still a notable disparity in link budget because conventional radar might be several orders of magnitude more powerful than a typical pulse-based radar.) So pulse-based UWB SAR is typically used in applications requiring average power levels in the <b>microwatt</b> or milliwatt range, and thus is used for scanning smaller, nearer target areas (several tens of meters), or in cases where lengthy integration (over a span of minutes) of the received signal is possible.

50|$|Until {{the quartz}} {{revolution}} of the 1970s, all watches were mechanical. Early watches were terribly imprecise; a good one could vary as much as 15 minutes in a day. Modern precision (a few seconds per day) was not attained by any watch until 1760, when John Harrison created his marine chronometers. Precision was attained as from 1854 first by the Waltham Watch Company, through the industrialisation of the manufacturing process of the movement part, in order to attain the necessary precision: they won a Gold Medal at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition {{with a lot of}} watches taken at random out of the production line, showing the way to their peers in U.S.A.

Because the mainspring provides an uneven source of power (its torque steadily decreases as the spring unwinds), watches from the early 16th century to the early 19th century featured a chain-driven fusee which served to regulate the torque output of the mainspring throughout its winding. Unfortunately, the fusees were very brittle, were very easy to break, and were the source of many problems, especially inaccuracy of timekeeping when the fusee chain became loose or lost its velocity after the lack of maintenance.|$|E
