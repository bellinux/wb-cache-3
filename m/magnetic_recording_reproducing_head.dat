50|$|On Christmas Day, 1932 the British Broadcasting Corporation {{first used}} a steel tape {{recorder}} for their broadcasts. The device used was a Marconi-Stille recorder, {{a huge and}} dangerous machine which used steel tape that had sharp edges. The tape was 0.1 in wide and 0.003 in thick running at 5 ft/s past the <b>recording</b> and <b>reproducing</b> <b>heads.</b> This meant that the length of tape required for a half-hour programme was nearly 1.8 mi and a full reel weighed 55 lb.|$|R
25|$|The {{position}} of the <b>recording</b> and <b>reproducing</b> <b>heads,</b> mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted so that several recordings could be cut on the same wax-coated strip. Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is interesting as a predecessor to the later magnetic tape recorder, which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined {{at one of the}} Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's playback head was missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning the machine could be put back into working order.|$|R

40|$|Two end-item tape {{recorders}} lost 4 : 1 mode data recording mode capability {{at less than}} half of their 1 6, 000 -cycle, 4 -year operating life. Subsequent life tests on two spare recorders also experienced 4 : 1 mode data loss at 8, 000 and 11, 700 cycles.

The objective was to establish how operating conditions (tape speed, humidity, temperature, stop/start cycles) affects head life with the goal of extending head life on the remaining in-service {{tape recorders}}. Another interest was to explain why an earlier vendor life test showed capability beyond 16, 000 cycles...|$|R

40|$|Today <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> {{is still}} the leading {{technology}} for mass data storage. Its dominant role is being reinforced {{by the success of}} cloud computing, which requires storing and managing huge amounts of data on a multitude of servers. Nonetheless, the hard-disk storage industry is presently at a crossroads as the current <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> technologies are unable of achieving densities beyond 1 Tbit/in 2. Pushing the recording density in the terabit regime requires new storage materials, novel recording schemes, and media designs in order to solve signal-to-noise ratio, thermal stability, and writability issues. In this book, worldwide experts from universities, public research institutions, and industry collaborate to illustrate the most recent progresses in <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> from the media perspective and to highlight the future prospects of the technology. Theoretical, experimental, and technological aspects are covered in a clear and comprehensive way, making the book a useful reference for final-year undergraduates, postgraduates, and research professionals in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> area. The first two chapters introduce the fundamentals of magnetism and <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> and are useful to guide the reader in the chapters that follow. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 focus on the materials for conventional perpendicular recording media, next-generation recording media, and exchange-coupled composite media. The most promising technologies for next-generation <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording,</b> i. e., energy assisted and bit-patterned recording, are extensively treated in chapters 6 and 7, while chapter 8 covers the techniques and protocols for <b>magnetic</b> characterization of <b>recording</b> media.

40|$|The {{data storage}} {{industry}} recently substituted its five-decade-old technology (longitudinal <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording),</b> which reached its fundamental limitations due to thermal instabilities {{in the recording}} media, with perpendicular <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording.</b> Nonetheless, the lifetime of this newly adopted technology and other next generation alternatives including heat-assisted <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> (HAMR) and bit patterned media (BPM) is comparably short. In order to defer the superparamagnetic limit substantially beyond 1 Tbits/in^ 2, {{it may be necessary}} to stack information in a third (vertical) dimension. This vertical stacking underlies the concept of multilevel (ML) three-dimensional (3 D) <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> and memory. In 3 D magnetic devices, information is recorded, not only on one surface (as in all modern 2 D applications), but in the entire 3 D bulk of the recording media. As a result, substantially larger amount of data could be recorded on the same surface area (as compared to any 2 D alternative). This study addresses design configuration, media fabrication, and characterization techniques for a particular ML 3 D <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> device. A newly developed ML 3 D <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> media enables selective reading and writing of up to 4 distinct signal levels, in comparison to only two signals in conventional 2 D-based <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> media. It is believed that at least over six layers (or over 2 ^ 6 = 64 signal levels) could be independently accessed in a ML 3 D <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> device. Gallium ion implantation as a potential method to alter the magnetic properties of 3 D media is also discussed. Furthermore, with every emerging technology, both fabrication systems and characterization techniques must be developed. One of the most crucial characterization tools, which enable the direct visualization of the smallest bit of magnetic information, is Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM). MFM is thus an integral part of the development and characterization of ML 3 D <b>magnetic</b> <b>recording</b> devices. Nevertheless, the best lateral resolution conventional state-of-the-art probes can produce under ambient conditions is limited to about ~ 25 nm. In this study, newly developed fabrication techniques for MFM probes are presented. Specifically, plateau probes to enhance the overall capabilities of MFM and high lateral resolution (below 10 nm in ambient conditions) multi-domain MFM probe. The enhancement in MFM capabilities has the potential to facilitate the development of HAMR, BPM, and ML 3 D magnetic systems...|$|R
