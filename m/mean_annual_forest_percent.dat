To evaluate the readjustment of forest fire precautionary periods and to provide information for forest fire prevention and suppression strategies, {{the temporal}} and spatial characteristics of forest fire occurrences and spread in Korea were analysed using statistics from 1970 to 2003. Monthly forest fire occurrences and burned area were examined using time-series analysis, and F-tests were conducted among forest fire occurrences, burned area, and fire area growth rate to understand monthly forest fire characteristics. To understand the spatial characteristics of forest fires, cities and counties with similar forest fire characteristics were grouped based on cluster analysis of forest fire occurrences and spread characteristics. A seasonal exponential smoothing model was selected for forest fire occurrences and burned area. The number of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>forest</b> fire occurrences was 429, and <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> burned area was 2908 ha year− 1 in Korea. The seasonal differences in forest fire characteristics were clearly distinguished, with 61 % of total forest fire occurrences and 90 % of total burned area being in March andApril. Forest fire precautionary periods are suggested based on forest fire occurrence patterns. A total of 226 cities and counties throughout the country were classified into three groups. Group 1, which had frequent forest fire occurrences with smaller burned areas and slower fire growth area rates, was distributed {{in the western part}} of Korea and metropolitan regions. Group 3, which had a relatively small number of forest fire occurrences but larger burned areas and fas...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} in {{the southern}} United States are dramatically altered by three major disturbances: timber harvesting, hurricane, and permanent land conversion. Understanding and quantifying effects of disturbance on forest carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles is critical for sustainable forest management in this region. In this study, we introduced a process-based ecosystem model for simulating forest disturbance impacts on ecosystem carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles. Based on forest mortality data classified from Landsat TM/ETM+ images, this model was then applied to estimate changes in carbon storage using Mississippi and Alabama as a case study. <b>Mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>forest</b> mortality rate for these states was 2. 37 %. Due to frequent disturbance, over 50 % of the forest land in the study region was less than 30 years old. Forest disturbance events caused a large carbon source (138. 92 Tg C, 6. 04 Tg C yr- 1; 1 Tg= 1012 g) for both states during 1984 – 2007, accounting for 2. 89 % (4. 81 % if disregard carbon storage changes in wood products) of the total forest carbon storage in this region. Large decreases and slow recovery of forest biomass were the main causes for carbon release. Forest disturbance {{could result in a}} carbon sink in few areas if wood product carbon was considered as a local carbon pool, indicating the importance of accounting for wood product carbon when assessing forest disturbance effects. The legacy effects of forest disturbance on ecosystem carbon storage could last over 50 years. This study implies that understanding forest disturbance impacts on carbon dynamics is of critical importance for assessing regional carbon budgets...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of {{nutrient}} {{elements in}} organisms {{and in the}} abiotic environment are key factors influencing ecosystem structure and function. We studied how concentrations and stoichiometries of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in leaves of forest trees are related to phylogeny and to environmental factors (<b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>forest</b> type, and nitrogen deposition). Using data for 4691 forest plots from across Spain, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) that foliar stoichiometries of forest trees are strongly influenced by phylogeny, (ii) that climate, as an important driver of plant uptake and nutrient use efficiency, affects foliar stoichiometry, (iii) that long-term loads of N influence N, P and K concentrations and ratios in natural vegetation, and (iv) that sympatric species are differentiated according to their foliar stoichiometry, thereby reducing the intensity of resource competition. Our analyses revealed that several factors contributed to interspecific variation in elemental composition and stoichiometry. These included phylogeny, forest type, climate, N deposition, and competitive neighborhood relationships (probably related to niche segregation effect). These findings {{support the notion that}} foliar elemental composition reflects adaptation both to regional factors such as climate and to local factors such as competition with co-occurring species...|$|R
40|$|AimTo understand: (1) how temperature, {{precipitation}} {{and stand}} age control the above-ground biomass carbon density (BCDa) of mature forests and its macroecology patterns across latitudes; (2) the age threshold for old-growth forests at a global scale. LocationGlobal forests. MethodsWe compiled a database (897 sites) of mature forests between 80 and 1200 years old. The site data include latitude, longitude, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation, <b>forest</b> type, stand age, BCDa, living biomass (above- and below-ground biomass) carbon density and total (living plus dead) biomass carbon density. Based {{on the site}} data, we performed regression analyses to show how BCDa changes with climate and forest stand age. ResultsAt a global scale, the highest BCDa of mature forests occurred mainly in the mid-latitude regions where <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperatures were 8 - 10 degrees C and <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation was between 1000 and 2500 mm.

For forests between 80 and 450 years old, which form the majority of mature forests, carbon accumulation was faster in dead biomass than in living biomass. Main conclusionsThe highest BCDa of mature forests is located in mid-latitude regions with cool temperatures and moderate precipitation. The age threshold for old-growth forests at a global scale should be 450 - 500 years, which is much older than the previously documented age of 100 - 200 years.

40|$|Long-term annual water {{balances}} {{are analyzed}} for two forest catchments located in Gwangneung covered with forests {{of different types}} and ages. The water balance trends of the two catchments from 1982 to 2009 are compared to identify the effect of forest growth and thinning on the water balance in a planted coniferous forest catchment. According to the averaged annual precipitation and runoff for the four designated periods from 1982 to 2009, the water balance of the old natural broad-leaved forest catchment (GB) remained relatively unchanged. In contrast, the young planted coniferous forest catchment (GC) showed {{significant changes in the}} water balance due to the forest growing and thinning. The results showed that the catchment runoff decreases with increasing tree age whereas the forest thinning results in an increase in catchment runoff. The <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> runoff from the catchment GC after thinning increased by 1. 7 times, compared with the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> runoff before <b>forest</b> thinning. The <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> runoff from the catchment GB was very stable throughout the period. However, such an effect of forest thinning appeared to last only for about 10 year-period, after which the water yield increment in the catchment GC disappeared. It indicates that the proper forest management should be reconsidered at the interval of 10 years to effectively reduce water loss and increase water yield in the planted coniferous forest.

40|$|Tracking the {{response}} of forest ecosystems to climate change demands large (≥ 1 ha) monitoring plots that are repeatedly measured over long time frames and arranged across macro-ecological gradients. Continental scale networks of permanent forest plots have identified links between climate and carbon fluxes by monitoring trends in tree growth, mortality and recruitment. The relationship between tree growth and climate in Australia has been recently articulated through analysis of data from smaller forest plots, but conclusions were limited by (a) absence of data on recruitment and mortality, (b) exclusion of non-eucalypt species, and (c) {{lack of knowledge of}} stand age or disturbance histories. To remedy these gaps we established the Ausplots Forest Monitoring Network: a continental scale network of 48 1 ha permanent plots in highly productive tall eucalypt forests in the mature growth stage. These plots are distributed across cool temperate, Mediterranean, subtropical and tropical climates (<b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation 850 to 1900 mm per year; <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature 6 to 21 °C). Aboveground carbon stocks (AGC) in these forests are dominated by eucalypts (90 % of AGC) whilst non-eucalypts in the understorey dominated species diversity and tree abundance (84 % of species; 60 % of stems). Aboveground carbon stocks were negatively related to <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, with <b>forests</b> at the warm end of the temperature range storing approximately half the amount of carbon as forests at the cool end of the temperature range. This may reflect thermal constraints on tree growth detected through other plot networks and physiological studies. Through common protocols and careful sampling design, the Ausplots Forest Monitoring Network will facilitate the integration of tall eucalypt forests into established global forest monitoring initiatives. In the context of projections of rapidly warming and drying climates in Australia, this plot network will enable detection of links between climate and growth, mortality and carbon dynamics of eucalypt forests...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation {{of water}} balance at the {{watershed}} scale {{is a fundamental}} step for estimating streamflow in watersheds. <b>Mean</b> <b>annual</b> water balance of 17 watersheds across Michigan were evaluated by comparing observed streamflow with simulated streamflow estimated using Fu’s Equation, {{which is based on}} the Budyko Hypothesis. The Budyko Hypothesis describes <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> water balance as a function of available water and energy. Impact of long-term climatic controls (e. g., precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (ETP)) on <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> water balance was also investigated with Fu’s Equation. Results indicated that observed streamflow ranged from 237 to 529 mm per year, with an average of 363 mm per year in the study watersheds during 1967 – 2011. On average, 40 % of long-term precipitation in the study watersheds was converted into surface runoff.

We investigated spatial {{patterns of}} Chinese seed plant species diversity and analyzed the correlation between species richness and climatic factors at a large scale. Floral information was obtained from national and regional records of seed plants, and climatic data were taken from 642 observatory sites across China between 1970 and 2000. We detected large spatial variation in speciesrichness and density. Species density decreased with latitude. The following {{did not affect the}} spatial patterns of species richness and species density: area, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation, and frost-free days. Spatial patterns of species richness were affected by <b>annual</b> variation in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>mean</b> temperature during the coldest month, spatial variation of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature and precipitation. Spatial patterns of species density were principally shaped by <b>annual</b> variation in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>mean</b> temperature during the coldest month, spatial variation of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature per unit area and spatial variation of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation per unit area.

However, data generation regarding forest maps and statistics in the Philippines is hampered by multiple imagery sources, varying scale and resolutions, undisclosed methods of mapping and different forest classes and definitions used. In this study, processed Landsat forest cover data was analyzed to quantitatively measure {{the rates of}} forest loss on the regional level, to analyze its level of applicability and to validate forest changes through various geospatial and other forestry data. Raw data consists of forest tree cover, loss, gain and loss year layers. Five forest vectors were used to extract forest areas from the main data rasters before subsetting them regionally. A forest tree cover threshold of 85 percent and above was used to isolate densely forested rasters. These rasters were further analyzed to produce gain, loss and aggregate net change ranking; <b>annual</b> <b>forest</b> loss and <b>annual</b> <b>forest</b> cover trends, with their corresponding maps and statistics. Among the regions, Zamboanga Peninsula had the highest aggregate net change (- 7. 18 %) followed by CALABARZON (- 3. 41 %) and CARAGA (- 3. 16 %) from 2000 - 2012.
