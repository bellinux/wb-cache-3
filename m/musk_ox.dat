25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} Ice Age, between 8000â€“7000 BCE Kentucky's climate stabilized, leading to a rise in {{population}} and technology advances, resulting in more sedentary lifestyle. This warming trend killed the Pleistocene big game megafauna, such as the mammoth, mastodon, giant beavers, tapirs, short faced bear, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed tiger, horse, bison, <b>musk</b> <b>ox,</b> stag-moose, and peccary, all of which were native to Kentucky during the Ice Age, became extinct or moved north as the glacial ice retreated.|$|E
25|$|The {{biodiversity}} of tundra is low: 1,700 {{species of}} vascular plants and only 48 species of land mammals can be found, although millions of birds migrate there {{each year for}} the marshes. There are also a few fish species. There are few species with large populations. Notable animals in the Arctic tundra include caribou (reindeer), <b>musk</b> <b>ox,</b> Arctic hare, Arctic fox, snowy owl, lemmings, and polar bears (only near ocean-fed bodies of water). Tundra is largely devoid of poikilotherms such as frogs or lizards.|$|E

25|$|Focused on {{the culture}} of the Inuit and Eskimos of Alaska, the museum housed over 5,000 {{artifacts}} in a former home on the campus of Western Oregon University in Monmouth. Included among the artifacts are items that demonstrate the natural environment of these native Alaskans. To showcase the environment, the museum had a room dedicated to Arctic wildlife. This life-sized diorama is called the Circumpolar Room and had an automated system that provides a narrative on the animals of the Arctic while lights illuminate busts of these animals. Animals on display included <b>musk</b> <b>ox,</b> wolves, Arctic fox, a polar bear, brown bears, a snowy owl, and caribou.|$|E
500|$|In {{this chapter}} Beddard {{continues}} {{to explore the}} possible direct effect of the environment, i.e. with [...] "no possible relation to natural selection". The effects of different foods, temperature and humidity are discussed. Beddard argues against Poulton's view that natural selection has removed the pigment from cave-dwelling animals, agreeing rather with Wallace that pigment is produced as a by-product. Beddard grants that the change to white of arctic animals in winter looks like natural selection, rather than a direct effect of the environment, but argues that some animals do not change, including the <b>musk</b> <b>ox</b> which he describes as [...] "comparatively defenceless".|$|E
500|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America [...] arrived in Canada at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. [...] It is believed the [...] inhabitants entered the Americas pursuing Pleistocene mammals {{such as the}} giant beaver, steppe wisent, <b>musk</b> <b>ox,</b> mastodons, woolly mammoths and ancient reindeer (early caribou). One route hypothesized is that people walked south by way of an ice-free corridor {{on the east side}} of the Rocky Mountains, and then fanned out across North America before continuing on to South America. [...] The other conjectured route is that they migrated, either on foot or using primitive boats, down the Pacific Coast to the tip of South America, and then crossed the Rockies and Andes. Evidence of the latter has been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of metres following the last ice age.|$|E

Archidiskodon imperator maibeni left remains in Lincoln County. Platycerabos dodsoni was a wild cow known from Cass County. Other Late Pleistocene mammals included Ambelodon fricki, extinct bison species, modern bison, modern coyotes, and a saber-toothed cat unrelated to Smilodon. The camel Camelops appeared during the later Pleistocene. Some Nebraskan fossil-bearing deposits of Late Pleistocene age preserve animal remains associated with humans.|$|R

500|$|The white {{protective}} coloration {{of arctic}} animals was noted by an early student of camouflage, the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in his 1889 book Darwinism; he listed the polar bear, the American polar hare, the snowy owl and the gyr falcon as remaining white all year, while the arctic fox, arctic hare, ermine and ptarmigan change their colour, and observed [...] "the obvious explanation", {{that it was}} for concealment. Later zoologists such as Hugh B. Cott have echoed his observations, adding that other animals of the Arctic such as <b>musk</b> <b>ox,</b> moose, reindeer, wolverine and raven never become white [...] "even in the coldest parts of their range". Cott noted that both animals that hunt, like polar bear and stoat, and prey animals like ptarmigan and mountain hare, require camouflage to hide from prey or from predators respectively. There is little experimental evidence for the adaptiveness of white as camouflage, though the ornithologist W. L. N. Tickell, reviewing proposed explanations of white plumage in birds, writes that in the ptarmigan [...] "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that cryptic brown summer plumage becomes a liability in snow, and white plumage is therefore another cryptic adaptation." [...] All the same, he notes, [...] "in spite of winter plumage, many Ptarmigan in NE Iceland are killed by Gyrfalcons throughout the winter." ...|$|E
500|$|The fur {{of mammals}} has many uses protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflage, {{with the primary}} usage being thermoregulation. The types of hair include definitive, which may be shed after {{reaching}} a certain length; vibrissae, which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers; pelage, which consists of guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair; spines, which are a type of stiff guard hair used for defense in, for example, porcupines; bristles, which are long hairs usually used in visual signals, such as the mane of a lion; velli, often called [...] "down fur," [...] which insulates newborn mammals; and wool which is long, soft and often curly. Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation, as some tropical mammals, such as sloths, have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals. The denseness of fur can increase an animal's insulation value, and arctic mammals especially have dense fur; for example, the <b>musk</b> <b>ox</b> has guard hairs measuring [...] {{as well as a}} dense underfur, which forms an airtight coat, allowing them to survive in temperatures of [...] Some desert mammals, such as camels, use dense fur to prevent solar heat from reaching their skin, allowing the animal to stay cool; a camel's fur may reach [...] in the summer, but the skin stays at [...] Aquatic mammals, conversely, trap air in their fur to conserve heat by keeping the skin dry.|$|E

50|$|North of the fjord, in {{southern}} Peary Land, there are remains of dwellings with elliptical floor plan, built by Early Paleoeskimo Independence I culture. These people used tools made from rocks and bones, and subsisted from hunting wildlife like <b>musk</b> <b>oxen</b> and Arctic hares.

2500|$|Late ice age climatic changes caused plant {{communities}} and animal populations to change. Groups moved {{from place to}} place as preferred resources were depleted and new supplies were sought. Small bands utilized hunting and gathering during the spring and summer months, then broke into smaller direct family groups for the fall and winter. Family groups moved every 3â€“6 days, possibly traveling up to [...] a year. [...] Diets were often sustaining and rich in protein due to successful hunting. Clothing was made from a variety of animal hides that were also used for shelter construction. During much of the Early and Middle Paleo-Indian periods, inland bands are thought to have subsisted primarily through hunting now-extinct megafauna. Large Pleistocene mammals were the giant beaver, steppe wisent, <b>musk</b> <b>ox,</b> mastodons, woolly mammoths and ancient reindeer (early caribou).|$|E
