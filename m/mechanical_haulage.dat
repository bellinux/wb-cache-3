25|$|The most {{successful}} freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson's Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. Tipper wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line {{and then up}} the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by <b>mechanical</b> <b>haulage</b> up the ramp. After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding (in what is now New Romney station car park), the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.|$|E
50|$|At {{the factory}} there were {{approximately}} seventeen miles of standard gauge railway tracks and fifteen miles of narrow gauge trolley tracks for internal transport. Six locomotives {{were available for}} shunting purposes and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>haulage</b> system moved specially built wagons around the factory. The six wheeled wagons were designed to carry weights of up to 1000 lb and around 1,000 were built. Georgetown railway station {{was used by the}} facility during production but closed years later.|$|E
50|$|The term {{comes from}} the days of sailing ships, when a rigger was a person who worked with rigging, that is, ropes for {{hoisting}} the sails. Sailors could put their rope skills to work in lifting and hauling. In an era before <b>mechanical</b> <b>haulage</b> and cranes, ropes, pulleys and muscle power were all that was available to move heavy objects. In time, rigging became a trade in itself, giving rise to modern usages, with its roots all but forgotten.|$|E
50|$|By 1900 {{there were}} almost 3,500 miners and 500,000 tons of coal production.From 1900 to 1914 the Société des Mines de Carmaux modernized its {{equipment}} and methods.It introduced electric traction by trolley, <b>mechanical</b> <b>haulage,</b> hydraulic backfilling, electrification {{at the bottom}} favored {{by the absence of}} flammable firedamp.At the same time organization of labour improved, the company searched for new outlets and adapted its products to commercial needs.From 1908 to 1913 production of coal was around 600,000 tons per year. During World War I (1914-18) output rose to 819,000 tons in 1917 and 845,000 tons in 1918.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the peak}} of this {{practice}} in 1913, there were 70,000 ponies underground in Britain. In later years, <b>mechanical</b> <b>haulage</b> was quickly introduced on the main underground roads replacing the pony hauls, and ponies tended to be confined to the shorter runs from coal face to main road (known in North East England as [...] "putting") which were more difficult to mechanise. As of 1984, 55 ponies were still in use with the National Coal Board in Britain, chiefly at the modern pit in Ellington, Northumberland. When Ellington closed {{for the first time}} in 1994, four pit ponies were brought out (no ponies were used there during the RJB era). Of the four, two went to the National Coal Mining Museum for England at Caphouse. The last surviving pony was Tony who died in 2011 aged 40.|$|E
5000|$|Ponies {{began to}} be used underground, often {{replacing}} child or female labour, as distances from pit head to coal face became greater. The first known recorded use in Britain was in the County Durham coalfield in 1750; in the United States, mules were the dominant source of animal power in the mine industry, with horses and ponies used to a lesser extent. At the peak in 1913, there were 70,000 ponies underground in Britain. In later years, <b>mechanical</b> <b>haulage</b> was quickly introduced on the main underground roads replacing the pony hauls and ponies tended to be confined to the shorter runs from coal face to main road (known in North East England as [...] "putting", in the United States as [...] "tramming" [...] or [...] "gathering") which were more difficult to mechanise.
