5000|$|At {{the request}} of François Mitterrand, Huntzinger {{organized}} initial [...] "Mediterranean Forums" [...] for non-governmental entities from Algeria, France, Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, and Tunisia. These forums were held during February 1988 (Marseilles) and May 1989 (Tangier) and resulted {{in the creation of}} the 5+5 Dialogue of the Western <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Forum</b> for foreign ministers from Algeria, France, Italy, Libya, Malta, Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, and Tunisia. Huntzinger was instrumental in organizing the first 5+5 Dialogue held in 1990. This effort was dampened by the Gulf War, Algerian Civil War and the Lockerbie and UTA airplane bombings, but the 5+5 Dialogue has recovered to become a significant regional forum. Huntzinger also coordinated the Mediterranean Cultural Forum in 2008 and engaged in numerous other efforts to encourage dialogue among Mediterranean constituents.|$|E
40|$|During recent years, the {{discourse}} concerning international migration has gained momentum. 2008, in particular, saw many developments with {{an impact on}} this issue: the re-evaluation of the Barcelona Process, its proposed reform through the Union for the Mediterranean (where a fourth basket, namely migration, has been added), the Pact for Migration, the Blue Card, {{as well as an}} overwhelming financial and economic crisis that is weathering international markets. These factors are being played out on the same stage and their interactions will play a decisive role in the coming years regarding the Euro-Mediterranean area. This article aims to analyse this evolution, taking into consideration an interdisciplinary approach and some inherent problems {{that will have to be}} rethought in order to permit greater political coherence in the future. As was written by Calleya (2004 : 2), “the growth of regional arrangements since the end of the Cold War is partly due to the fact that great powers and regional powers welcome the opportunity to participate in collective security and cooperative frameworks in which the costs of foreign policy actions are shared among several actors”. As part of this trend and wave of optimism (Schumacher, 2004 : 89; Rudolph, C. 2003 : 603), there emerged the 5 + 5 initiative, the Council of the Mediterranean launched by the Maltese government, the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Forum</b> initiated by the Egyptian Government, the Italian-Spanish proposal to flesh out...|$|E
40|$|The European Journal of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (EJPRM) {{is listed}} in PubMed and Current Contents and in 2010 will have its first Impact Factor; the {{unofficial}} one {{in the last two}} years was around 1. 00, coming from 0. 04 in 2004; also the independent SCImago Journal Rate and Cites per Doc (2 years) have increased steadily since 2005. These results in the main bibliometric indexes are due to many reasons, including a careful internal audit to guarantee a continuous quality increase of the journal. The aim of this short paper is to report the results of this audit. We continuously register each step of our editorial work to check if there is any problem and where. The evolution of these indicators in the last five years is here analyzed using simple statistical tools. The EJPRM receives today 12 papers per month and publishes more than 600 pages in 4 issues. The rejection rate is now around 60 %, starting from 40 % in 2005. The review and publication times are 1. 54 (quartiles 0. 57 - 2. 79) and 8. 4 (5. 47 - 10. 93) months, respectively: these parameters have decreased in these years, particularly the last one. Papers are mainly clinically oriented, original papers prevails with a 12 % of RCTs, meta-analysis and Cochrane reviews in the last 5 years. The EJPRM has a well balanced coverage of different rehabilitation topics. How these indices have been used to improve quality for the readers and authors is here discussed. The actual literature requires such a process, that is one of the main points for quality continuous improvement of scientific journals. The growth of the EJPRM in these years comes from the internal audit using the correct quality indicators and working to increase the actual standards. Together with this, also external factors (development of the specialty in our continent and region, European Society and <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Forum</b> of PRM role, etc.) and other internal ones (e-Pub, Open Access, Special Sections, Awards, Cochrane reviews, collaboration with other journals, etc.) played for sure a role, but the last are in any case mainly led by, and checked through, our audit system...|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{initiatives}} to use foresight as a mechanism to build shared visions in international relations. To mention just a few examples: UNESCO, UNIDO, OECD and WEF all have explicit units or projects for foresight. Private and non-profit organisations also take initiatives. For example, RAND has initiated the <b>Mediterranean</b> Foresight <b>Forum</b> and the Atlantic Council has its Foresight, Strategy and Risks Initiative. The international security situation brings technology and innovation into these initiatives. But also {{in the context of}} international social affairs the attention for innovation is growing, with topics such as the impact on labour markets and social security of automation, robotics and artificial intelligence. Foresight thus may become a valuable tool for innovation diplomacy, building on and broadening a strong tradition of technology foresight.|$|R
40|$|Regional {{approaches}} to EU energy {{policies have been}} termed the ‘Schengenisation’ of energy, making reference to the Schengen Convention eliminating intra-European border controls. They aim to hone the effectiveness of EU energy policy objectives through enhanced policy coordination at the regional scale. Typically, this includes energy market integration while accounting for member states’ continued deployment of national-level policy instruments regarding the appropriate energy mix and the security of energy supply, which is foreseen in the EU Treaty. This report explores the potential for such regional approaches. It assesses lessons from existing initiatives, regional energy arrangements such as the Danube Energy <b>Forum,</b> the <b>Mediterranean</b> Energy <b>Forum,</b> the Pentalateral Energy Forum, the North Seas Countries’ Offshore Grid Initiative and the Nordic Co-operation partnership, to determine whether regional energy initiatives are an efficient, effective and politically acceptable approach toward reaching three EU energy policy objectives: competitiveness, supply security and sustainability. Regional approaches could possibly {{play an important role}} for governing EU renewables policy, which the European Commission has identified in the 2030 climate and energy framework as an important element for governance...|$|R

In May 1962, Louis Pauwels also organized a show in a Parisian gallery of four painters of fantastic realism who had been featured in the magazine.|$|R
