The cutter is then angled to the gashing angle. The gashing angle is calculated from the lead and pitch diameter of the worm; often tables are available with the gashing angles for common diameters and leads. The cutter is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and cut. This is repeated until all of the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|E

2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. [...] It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests). [...] Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform {{a vast number of}} complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.|$|E
2500|$|Threads may be milled with a {{rotating}} <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> if the correct helical toolpath can be arranged. This was formerly arranged mechanically, {{and it was}} suitable for mass-production work although uncommon in job-shop work. With the widespread dissemination of affordable, fast, precise CNC, it became much more common, and today internal and external threads are often milled even on work where they would formerly have been cut with taps, die heads, or single-pointing. Some advantages of thread milling, as compared to single-point cutting or taps and dies, are faster cycle times, less tool breakage, and that a left- or right-hand thread can be created with the same tool. Additionally, for large, awkward workpieces (such as a fire hydrant casting), it is simply easier to let the workpiece sit stationary on a table while all needed machining operations are performed on it with rotating tools, as opposed to rigging it up for rotation around the axis of each set of threads (that is, for the [...] "arms" [...] and [...] "mouth" [...] of the hydrant).|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} tool styles used in arbor milling are: double angle, form relived, plane, and {{staggered}} tooth Among many other tool styles. The double angle <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> {{can make a}} wide variety of V shaped cuts with straight surfaces in the material. A form relieved <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> can produce U shaped cuts with curved surfaces, unlike the double angle cutter, into the material. A plane <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> can produce surfaces similar to a planer but can make varying contours across the material. A staggered tooth <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> can produce a rectangular groove in the material at varying depths and widths. The cutters can be stacked to mill combined profiles. The typical width of cuts made by arbor milling range from [...]25 in. to 6 in, and the typical depths range from [...]02 in. to [...]05 in.|$|E

40|$|Generally the study, {{evaluation}} and general understanding of end <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> are {{complicated by the}} complexity of the cutting process and of the cutting tool.

50|$|Milling is {{a cutting}} process {{that uses a}} <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> to remove {{material}} {{from the surface of}} a workpiece. The <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points. As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter. As the <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> enters the workpiece, the cutting edges (flutes or teeth) of the tool repeatedly cut into and exit from the material, shaving off chips (swarf) from the workpiece with each pass. The cutting action is shear deformation; material is pushed off the workpiece in tiny clumps that hang together {{to a greater or lesser}} extent (depending on the material) to form chips. This makes metal cutting somewhat different (in its mechanics) from slicing softer materials with a blade.|$|E

The results of discussion with this method was enhancement of feedrate and timing of cooling the rate wear cutter increases. Type of cutter wear that occurs is flank wear and began to grow relatively quickly then followed by a relatively slow growth to a certain cutting. The smallest edge of the cutter rate wear occurs when interaction feedrate 0. 11 mm/rev with a timing of cooling 10 minutes value is 562. 57 Î¼m, while the largest edge of the cutter rate wear occurs when interaction feedrate 0. 15 mm/rev with a timing of cooling 20 minutes value is 958. 65 Î¼m.

30|$|The {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) diamond film {{is attractive}} as an ideal coating for excellent characteristics, such as the high hardness, favorable wear resistance, low friction coefficient, high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient and excellent chemical stability [4, 5]. It is demonstrated that during the machining processes of the Al alloy workpieces, especially under the circumstance of the rough machining, the deposition of diamond films on the cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> can prolong the working lifetime significantly, and improve the machining quality to some extent, because the excellent tribological properties of the diamond film can reduce the adhesion between the cutter and workpiece [6]. However, for the finish machining, since the cutting depth is relatively small, it is supposed that the optimal-designed uncoated WC-Co <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> can meet the requirement of the machining quality during their life cycles, but one drawback is that they wear out rapidly, followed by {{the deterioration of the}} machining quality. The employment of the turning or <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> made of the monocrystalline diamond is believed as the best choice for finish machining Al alloy workpieces, regardless of the cost, which can be directly used for mirror finishing [7, 8]. It is another option to adopt the polycrystalline diamond (PCD) as the cutting edges [9, 10], the wear resistance of which is undoubtedly much higher than that of WC-Co, while lower than those of the monocrystalline diamond and CVD diamond film. This is because the PCD is composed of not only diamond crystals but also some metallic bonding phases. Moreover, for either the monocrystalline diamond or PCD, it is rather difficult to form <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> with complicated shapes. Consequently, prolonging the tool life and guaranteeing the long-time machining quality with low cost are main aims of depositing diamond films on <b>milling</b> <b>cutters.</b>|$|R
