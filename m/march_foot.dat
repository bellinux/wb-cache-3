60|$|Cheyne {{glanced up}} sharply during the prelude, and then, {{feeling that the}} girl's eyes were upon him, nodded as out of the {{swelling}} harmonies there crept the theme. It suggested the tramp of <b>marching</b> <b>feet,</b> {{but there was a}} curious unevenness in its rhythm, and the crescendo one of the listeners looked for never came. The room was almost dark now, but none of those who sat there seemed to notice it as they listened to the listless tramp of <b>marching</b> <b>feet.</b> Then the harmonies drowned it again, and Hetty looked at Cheyne.|$|R
50|$|A marching {{machine is}} a {{percussion}} instrument designed {{to produce the}} sound of <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> when played on a wooden or metal surface. It is constructed {{from a number of}} short pieces of wooden dowel suspended by string netting within a wooden frame.|$|R
60|$|The song roared up to Graham now, {{no longer}} upborne by music, but coarse and noisy, and {{the beating of}} the <b>marching</b> <b>feet,</b> tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, interwove with a thunderous {{irregularity}} of footsteps from the undisciplined rabble that poured along the higher ways.|$|R

6000|$|Weeks passed; and at my window, leaving [...] bed, [...] By night I mused, of easeful sleep bereft, [...] On those 'brave boys (Ah War! thy theft); [...] Some <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> Found pause at last by cliffs Potomac cleft; [...] Wakeful I mused, {{while in}} the street Far footfalls died away till none were left.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it? Who comes?" [...] {{were the}} {{questions}} that men asked one another, as both aristocrats and sansculottes paused in their bloody labours. It was close at hand. So close at hand that they could discern the tramp of <b>marching</b> <b>feet.</b> In the infernal din of that fight upon the stairs they had not caught the sound of this approach until now that the new-comers--whoever they might be--were at the very gates of Bellecour.|$|R
5000|$|Marching troops feature {{again in}} the final {{sequences}} in the main parade ground, with tributes to the fallen from Hitler and Röhm, and various flag ceremonies which appear to have quasi-religious significance {{to the members of}} the party. The shots of <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> and legs has an almost hypnotic effect on the viewer, well parodied by a later British wartime short which matches the time of the marching to the popular song [...] "The Lambeth Walk".|$|R
6000|$|Then God spoke, and {{the dream}} that I had dreamed came true. Far away there rose a single cry, and after it other cries, {{and the sounds of}} {{shouting}} and of <b>marching</b> <b>feet.</b> Far away tongues of fire leapt into the air, and each man asked his neighbour, [...] "What is this?" [...] Then from all the thousands of the feasting people rose one giant scream, and that scream said, [...] "Fung! Fung! The Fung are on us! Fly, fly, fly!" ...|$|R
60|$|FOR a {{time the}} tramp of <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> throbbed softly along the carretera that wound, a black thread of shadow, through the dusky cane. The dust was clogged with {{moisture}} and deadened the sound, while the Sin Verguenza were not shod after the fashion of British infantry. Some of them, indeed, wore no shoes at all, and {{as he watched the}} dim, half‐seen figures flit almost silently through the night Appleby could have fancied he was marching with a company of shadows through a land of dreams.|$|R
60|$|It was {{followed}} by a low murmuring that suggested the sound of the sea, and gazing at the rows of intent faces Appleby noticed that hats were swept off as the prisoners passed, and that here and there a man crossed himself. Once a burst of Vivas went up, but the murmurs that answered them were hoarse and angry, and for a space of minutes there was once more a heavy silence that seemed intensified by the beat of <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> and the tapping of the drums.|$|R

40|$|I {{ride over}} the hills and I see the sun rise on America. I see a vast {{continent}} through the purple haze. I see the deserts and the jungles - the summer sun and the winter snow. I see {{the people who live}} in this country - as they came, different a! 2 ̆ 7 the corners of the earth they left, and as they are today, one and indivisible - the lifeblood of the land. I see their farms and their great cities. I see them alone and in milling crowds, and I hear the tramp of their <b>marching</b> <b>feet...</b>|$|R
60|$|THERE was a pale {{shining in}} the eastern sky when the Sin Verguenza came into sight of Santa Marta. The town lay, a smear of deeper shadow, upon the dusky levels in front of them, but the {{transition}} from darkness to light is swift in that country, and {{here and there a}} flat roof higher than those it stood among grew out of the obscurity into definite form. Save for the rhythmic beat of <b>marching</b> <b>feet,</b> there was stillness among the cane, and nothing moved on all the dim levels but the long black column that crawled down the shadowy road.|$|R

5000|$|The game's {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Frank Klepacki and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by PC Gamer and Gameslice magazines. Among {{his most famous}} songs from the series {{is the theme of}} Red Alert, titled [...] "Hell March", which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of <b>marching</b> <b>feet,</b> and synthesizers to a sampled drill command. Originally intended to be the theme for the Brotherhood of Nod faction in the Covert Operations expansion to the 1995 Command & Conquer, the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the Red Alert series instead.|$|R
60|$|From {{the street}} came the dull roll of beaten drums and the rhythmical fall of <b>marching</b> <b>feet.</b> But {{the sound was}} too common in revolutionary Paris to arrest attention, and he wrote on, heeding it as little as he did the gruff voice of a pastry-cook crying his wares, the shriller call of a milkman, or the {{occasional}} rumblings of passing vehicles. But of a sudden one of those rumblings ceased abruptly at his door. He heard the rattle of hoofs and the grind of the wheel against the pavement, and looking up, he glanced across at the ormolu timepiece on his overmantel. It was not yet four o'clock.|$|R

5000|$|The Hobart Mercury wrote:The {{inherent}} {{drama of}} the many newsreel shots Is heightened by the excellently spoken commentary, and the film inspires a justifiable pride in the growing strength of the British Empire in its struggle against the totalitarian States. [...] "The Road to Victory" [...] shows Australia and Britain at peace, and compares this peace with the <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> In other lands. Then war-and the film presents many thrilling pictures of air and sea battles. Several not-able British victories in the past 12 months are depicted. The film is expertly edited and {{is the first of}} a series of Australian short subjects to be Issued under the aegis of the Department of Information.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dismiss {{your hopes}} of that," [...] {{put in the}} Count, with a solemn shake of his head. And then, before another word was uttered, young Fanfulla degli Arcipreti leapt of a sudden to his feet, his brows knit, and an {{expression}} of alarm spreading upon his comely face. A second he remained thus; then, going swiftly to the door, he opened it, and stood listening, followed by the surprised glances of the assembled company. But it needed not the warning cry with which he turned, to afford them the explanation of his odd behaviour. In the moment's tense silence that had followed his sudden opening of the door they had caught from without the distant fall of <b>marching</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R

[...] He used those dictatorships in Latin America as an example, stating: [...] "I am talking not about <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> but helping hands." [...] As military operations increased in Vietnam in mid-February, Nixon's standing against President Johnson improved. A Harris poll showed that he trailed the president 43% to 48%. Near the end of the month, Nixon's opponent George Romney exited the race, mostly due to comments he made about being [...] "brainwashed" [...] during a visit to Vietnam. This left Nixon nearly unopposed for the upcoming primaries, narrowing his opponents to Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan, neither of whom had announced their candidacies.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{had been}} sitting on the bridge, but he jumped up as a rhythmic tramp of feet came down the hillside. Dust rose among the cornfields and hung in a white streak {{along the edge of}} a wood, and then with a {{twinkling}} flash of steel, small, ocher-colored figures swung out of the shadow. They came on in loose fours, in an unending line that wound down the steep slopes and reached the bridge-head. Then orders rolled across the stream, the line narrowed, and the measured tramp changed to a sharp uneven patter. The leading platoon were breaking step as they crossed the bridge. Dick frowned impatiently. This was a needless precaution. The engineers' work was good; it would stand the percussive shock of <b>marching</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
50|$|Romans derived {{measurements}} from <b>marching.</b> Five <b>feet</b> {{was equal}} to one pace (which is appropriately a double step). 1,000 paces measured a Roman mile, which was somewhat {{smaller than the}} English statute mile. This Roman system was adopted, with local variations, throughout Europe as the Roman Empire spread.|$|R
60|$|Blameless {{master of}} the games, King of sport that never shames, He shall daily joy {{dispense}} Hid in song's sweet influence.

500|$|After {{the bridge}} {{companies}} were founded, they invited engineers to submit plans and cost estimates for a suspension bridge that carried a railway. [...] The invitation {{was met with}} skepticism among the engineering community. [...] At that time, {{there was not a}} suspension bridge that could allow a train to pass over it safely. [...] While the Europeans were erecting suspension bridges by the hundreds, the Americans mostly ignored them out of safety concerns; in 1831 Sir Samuel Brown's Broughton Suspension Bridge in Britain had collapsed under the <b>marching</b> <b>feet</b> of a troop of soldiers, sending those on its deck into the River Irwell. [...] Furthermore, many American bridges had collapsed without experiencing weight and pressure equivalent to railroad traffic, and American engineers feared that any railway bridge would likely fail—especially a suspension bridge.|$|R

60|$|Towards midnight the teasing, {{monotonous}} bark of the house-dog disturbed the quietude {{of their}} vigil. Caroline rose, {{and made her}} way noiselessly through the dark passages to the kitchen, intending to appease him with a piece of bread. She succeeded. On returning to the dining-room she found it all dark, Miss Keeldar having extinguished the candle. The outline of her shape was visible near the still open window, leaning out. Miss Helstone asked no questions; she stole to her side. The dog recommenced barking furiously. Suddenly he stopped, and seemed to listen. The occupants of the dining-room listened too, and not merely now to the flow of the mill-stream. There was a nearer, though a muffled, sound on the road below the churchyard--a measured, beating, approaching sound--a dull tramp of <b>marching</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 21 August 1941, the {{regiment}} was transported to Romania. From there, it spent several weeks <b>marching</b> on <b>foot</b> {{to the front}} line.
