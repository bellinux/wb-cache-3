50|$|The MiG-29 has two widely spaced Klimov RD-33 {{turbofan}} engines, each {{rated at}} 50.0 kN (11,240 lbf) dry and 81.3 kN (18,277 lbf) in afterburner. The {{space between the}} engines generates lift, thereby reducing effective wing loading, hence improving maneuverability. The engines are fed through intake ramps fitted under the leading-edge extensions (LERXs), which have variable ramps to allow high-Mach speeds. As an adaptation to rough-field operations, the main air inlet can be closed completely and the auxiliary air inlet on the upper fuselage {{can be used for}} takeoff, landing and low-altitude flying, preventing ingestion of ground debris. Thereby the engines receive air through louvers on the LERXs which open automatically when intakes are closed. However the latest variant of the family, the MiG-35, eliminated these dorsal louvers, and adopted the mesh screens design in the <b>main</b> <b>intakes,</b> similar to those fitted to the Su-27.|$|R

50|$|The {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1914 when a railway siding was built. The town {{was named after}} the Norton family who were farming in the area since the 1890s and {{were killed in the}} First Chimurenga in 1896. The town grew as an administrative and commercial hub in a rich agricultural area. It later developed into a key industrial centre due to its proximity to water and power supplies, with a <b>main</b> <b>intake</b> point from the Lake Kariba hydroelectric dam to the national grid located nearby. The construction of the nearby Lake Chivero dam provided a further boost to development.|$|E
50|$|It was {{proposed}} by the Department that Ashendene be {{used in conjunction with}} Hillside Boys' Home in Glen Waverley with both institutions taking boys with a long history of institutional care and some offending behaviour. Unlike Hillside, boys at Ashendene were able to attend local schools. By 1977, Ashendene's <b>main</b> <b>intake</b> was from Baltara Reception Centre, older teenage boys requiring longer term accommodation. In 1978 the capacity of the Home was reduced to 24 as the building was considered to be overcrowded. In November 1988, Ashendene was relocated to a new facility in Croydon - a regional medium term residential unit for up to eight male and female adolescents.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{based on}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) {{was developed and}} validated in order to analyse 10 phenols in water samples. The optimised conditions were obtained using polyacrylate fibre (PA), 20 ml of sample volume, 10 % NaCl, pH 4. 0 and direct extraction at 35 degrees C and 1000 rpm, for 40 min. The linear range and quantification limits for these compounds by SPME-GC-MS were defined. An evaluation of the main uncertainty sources of this method is included, which allows expanded uncertainties in the 9. 4 - 35 % range {{for the majority of}} the compounds. The main source of uncertainty is associated with matrix effects. The validated method is suitable for monitoring the production and distribution of potable water and was used, in field trials, for the analysis of samples from <b>main</b> <b>intakes</b> of water (surface or underground) and from water supply system of a large area (Lisbon and neighbour municipalities).

40|$|The {{analysis}} of BTEX and other substituted benzenes in water samples using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and quantification by gas chromatography with {{flame ionization detection}} (GC-FID) was validated. The best analytical conditions were obtained using PDMS/DVB/CAR fibre using headspace extraction (HS-SPME) at 50 degreesC for 20 min without stirring. The linear range for each compound by HS-SPME with GC/FID was defined. The detection limits for these compounds obtained with PDMS/DVB/CAR fibre and GC/FID were: benzene (15 ng L- 1), toluene (160 ng L- 1), monochlorobenzene (54 ng L- 1), ethylbenzene (32 ng L- 1), m-xylene (56 ng L- 1), p-xylene (69 ng L- 1), styrene (35 ng L- 1), o-xylene (42 ng L- 1), m-dichlorobenzene (180 ng L- 1), p-dichlorobenzene (230 ng L- 1), o-dichlorobenzene (250 ng L- 1) and trichlorobenzene (260 ng L- 1). This headspace SPME-GC-FID method was compared with a previously validated method of analysis using closed-loop-stripping analysis (CLSA). The headspace SPME-GC-FID method is suitable for monitoring the production and distribution of potable water and was used, in field trials, for the {{analysis of}} samples from <b>main</b> <b>intakes</b> of water (surface or underground) and from the water supply system of a large area (Lisbon and neighbouring municipalities) ...|$|R

5000|$|A dive from steam-powered surface {{operation}} normally required 30 minutes. [...] Minimum {{time needed to}} secure the main engines, shift to battery motors and dive under emergency conditions was nearly 5 minutes, which though better than the 15 minutes of the Swordfish prototype was considered barely adequate. The boiler fires were first extinguished to prevent submerged buildup of fumes: a complicated series of hydraulics and mechanical rods and levers lowered the twin funnels {{away from each other}} to a horizontal position in wells in the superstructure as well as simultaneously closing hatches over the funnel uptakes. The <b>main</b> <b>intake</b> ventilators were likewise closed along with sea water connections for condensers and boiler feed. It was considered that with their 24 kn of speed the submarines could turn and outrun almost any threat if they were attacked on the surface, dispensing with a need for a rapid dive. This was perhaps wishful thinking, and just excused the fact that the record breaking 'crash dives' of the conventional boats (particularly the later World War II U boats) was unattainable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a slight fall in the roof in Goodall’s gate, on the West side of the mine, 943 yards from the Downcast shaft. [...] A small quantity of fire-damp escaping from the crack in the roof was ignited by a miner’s candle at 7:15am, just as the men were starting work. No gas had previously been found in the New North Road or Goodall’s Gate in the West Level. Two miners and their ponies were killed at the point of impact, and four more were killed as they began to flee. The explosion travelled south, down New North Road against the air flow, as coal dust dislodged by the explosion carried the dull flame beyond its point of origin, and expanded into a roaring flame when it reached the air in the West Level <b>main</b> <b>intake,</b> and then continued to expand through the mine, killing miners and trapping them, as roofs fell. The explosion tore through the stables, killing and burning the horsekeeper, plus 12 of the 14 pit ponies. The two pit ponies who survived were stood in the middle, partly sheltered by the other ponies.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of 28 pharmaceuticals and 10 estrogens {{has been investigated}} in waters from {{the lower part of}} the Llobregat River basin, where the <b>main</b> <b>intakes</b> for production of drinking water for Barcelona (Spain) are located. Sampling was programmed to monitor the same mass of water on its way down the river to reflect inputs from discharges, contribution from subsidiaries plus persistence of the compounds in the surface water. Analysis of pharmaceuticals was performed by off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole analyzer (LC–QqQ–MS/MS). Further analysis by ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry with a time-of-flight analyzer (UPLC–TOF–MS) has been proposed and applied for confirmation of several of these target compounds. Estrogens have been analysed by on-line SPE–LC–QqQ–MS/MS. Within the class of pharmaceuticals, 23 out of the 28 compounds investigated, were detected in at least one sample. The highest concentrations were observed for the β-blockers metoprolol (8042 ng L− 1) and sotalol (788 ng L− 1), the antibiotic ofloxacin (1904 ng L− 1), and the lipid regulator gemfibrozil (1014 ng L− 1). Within the group of estrogens, only estrone and estrone- 3 -sulfate were positively identified, with concentrations for the former (0. 82 – 5. 81 ng L− 1) close in some locations to those considered sufficient to induce estrogenic effects in aquatic organisms (1 – 10 ng L− 1). As a general pattern, concentration of target compounds increases along the river flow as expected. This work has been supported by Agbar Foundation and reflects the author’s view.

50|$|The MCA-Jet {{system has}} a small third valve {{separate}} from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the <b>main</b> <b>intake</b> manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet {{it was found that}} stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet valve(s) to stick open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Fortunately, each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980's.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{reconstruction}} by Prieto-Márquez and Wagner {{also led}} to a new hypothesis about the internal air passages of the crest. Yang had assumed that the tubular hollowing in the preserved part of the holotype would have served as the <b>main</b> <b>intake</b> of air. This was rejected by Prieto-Márquez and Wagner who {{pointed out that the}} tube was closed at its lower end and that with lambeosaurines in general the air passages are located in a more forward position, the bony nostrils being completely enclosed by the praemaxillae. They assumed that Tsintaosaurus would have had a standard lambeosaurine arrangement in the snout, the air, when inhaling, entering the skull through the paired pseudonares, the [...] "fake nostrils" [...] of the praemaxillae behind the upper beak. From there the air would have been transported through paired passages below the median processes of the praemaxillae {{to the top of the}} crest, subsequently entering a common median chamber within the lobe. The rear of the chamber was formed by the nasal bones and probably homologous to the nasal cavity. The chamber was divided into two smaller cavities, one at the front, the other at the rear, by curved median processes of the praemaxillae, forming hooks around a passage between the cavities. From the rear cavity the air was transported to below, towards the internal skull cavity. Although it is usually assumed that a single passage served for this purpose, Prieto-Márquez and Wagner saw indications in the form of the nasal that there were paired downward passages, to the inside of the lateral processes of the praemaxillae. From this they concluded that the entire airflow was likely separated, the common medium chamber probably being divided into a left and right section by a cartilaginous septum.|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{techniques were}} used to quantify the flow field inside a production computer chassis. The flow field was characterized for both original and alternative chassis configuration. The alternative chassis configuration consisted in blocking any possible air vents except for the main and secondary intakes. The smoke-wire flow visualization technique generates fine smoke lines inside the enclosure that follow the airflow created by the fan-induced forced convection heat transfer process. The smoke-wire images were taken at a back, center and front planes within the enclosure. The back plane images suggest that the air enters through the <b>main</b> <b>intake</b> for the alternative configuration, whereas very little flow comes through for the original configuration. The center plane shows very little movement. The front section in the original configuration shows that the flow is being pulled through the <b>main</b> <b>intake.</b> The alternative configuration shows that air is not drawn in through the <b>main</b> <b>intake</b> in this plane.
