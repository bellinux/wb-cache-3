5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, that she <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> {{up to her}} {{overbearing}} father {{just as he had}} done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed out of the window, Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E
5|$|The anthem is {{mandatory}} at the swearing-in of the President of Russia, for {{opening and closing}} sessions of the Duma and the Federation Council, and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio {{at the beginning and}} end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 hours and again at midnight. The anthem is also played on New Year's Eve after the New Year Address by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played officially, everybody <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.|$|E

5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> aside if Buffy is {{to face her}} {{responsibilities}} in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E

25|$|Balance {{refers to}} the {{relative}} volume {{of each of the}} instruments. Because chamber music is a conversation, sometimes one instrument <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> out, sometimes another. It is not always a simple matter for members of an ensemble to determine the proper balance while playing; frequently, they require an outside listener, or a recording of their rehearsal, to tell them that the relations between the instruments are correct.|$|E

25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> as a postulate.|$|E
25|$|When a try {{is awarded}} by the referee, the team scoring the try {{has the right}} to attempt a {{conversion}}. A conversion is a kick at goal that passes between the two posts and above the crossbar. The ball has to be either place kicked or drop kicked, and if successful will earn the team two points. The conversion attempt is taken from a spot perpendicular to where the try was scored and must be completed within one minute from the time the player has indicated his intention to kick. The opposition <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> behind their goal line. When the kicker moves forward with the intention of kicking the ball they may run at the kicker in an attempt to charge the ball down or put the kicker off. They can not shout while doing this, but if the ball falls over after the kicker has started his approach they can continue with the charge.|$|E
25|$|The play Lover’s Vows {{marks the}} novel’s turning point as despite her dislike for {{a play that}} “combines {{political}} radicalism and sexual permissiveness”, Price reluctantly takes part as she sees {{the importance of being}} socially involved to influence society for the better. Previously lost in a world of books, Price sees she <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> up to win the love she craves from Edmund. It is this change in personality, seen by Sir Thomas, who now appreciates Price’s moral qualities, who allows Price a dinner with the Grants and provides her with a carriage that befits a lady, despite the efforts of Mrs. Norris to sabotage Price’s social coming out. When Henry Crawford complains of how Lover's Vows was shut down by Sir Thomas, Price firmly expresses her disapproval of his attitude, which makes Crawford to pay attention to her for the first time. Reflecting her new social prestige, Price is given the honor of opening the ball at Mansfield Park.|$|E

25|$|A {{line-out}} {{consists of}} at least two players from each team standing in a two straight lines between five and fifteen metres from, and at right angles to, the scoring bay. The gap between the two teams must be 1 metre and the opposing team cannot have more players in the line-out than the team that was last in 'fluid possession'. One player from each team has to stand two metres back from the line-out to receive the ball and the opposing team must have a player standing {{at the front of the}} line-out two metres from the centre of the line-out. The player throwing the ball stands outside the field of play and must throw it at least five metres down the centre of the line-out. If the throw in is incorrect the opposing team has the choice of taking a scrum fifteen metres from the sideline or throwing the ball in themselves. The player throwing the ball in must not delay or pretend to throw the ball in. Players not taking part in the line-out <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> back ten metres or on the goal line if that is closer.|$|E

What made him {{remarkable}} was the stubbornness {{with which he}} clung to his principles... {{became one of the}} best-loved and most-respected figures in the labour movement. Lansbury's legacy has been the adamantine insistence among an element within the Labour Party that Britain <b>must</b> <b>stand</b> for moral principles, must set the world a moral example. Concretely, this has meant demanding the total abolition of capitalism and unilateral disarmament, policies that Labour's leaders have usually thought utopian or worse.|$|E
