25|$|I {{jumped into}} a seal hole, pushing the ice away as I entered, and they handed me <b>my</b> <b>camera.</b> Surprisingly, I wasn't too cold, except around where my mouth {{held on to}} my regulator, and that {{instantly}} froze and became numb. Suddenly everything was quiet and I found myself looking at easily {{one of the most}} extraordinary scenes I had ever, ever experienced. When I dropped down {{through a hole in the}} ice, I was completely surrounded by ice: a tunnel maybe twenty feet across. Everything above me on the land was roaring with wind and down there, there was absolutely no sound except for the distant trills of Weddell seals.|$|E

So we just had to dig in and put everything to the side and really work on something ... we had no idea that it would turn out as good as it did. It was a great experience It took me about a good two weeks to put all of the ideas that we had together. The good thing about the video is that we went in knowing we were gonna shoot the video onstage a few times. I was actually able to get <b>my</b> <b>camera</b> crew onstage" ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} Timberlake's {{tunnel vision}} {{of his love}} interest, with several voyeuristic references. The singer professes his love: [...] "I look around and everything I see is beautiful, because all I see is you." [...] According to The Huffington Posts Dean, Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] or his 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". However, his lyrics have an obsessive quality: [...] "A million people in a crowded room, but <b>my</b> <b>camera</b> lens is only set to zoom and it all becomes so clear." [...] Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on [...] "Tunnel Vision", Timberlake is lyrically [...] "playing the rom-com director": [...] "Just like a movie shoot, I’m zoomin’ in on you as we ride off into the sun." [...] According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times, Timberlake uses references to [...] "cameras and reflective surfaces" [...] {{to reflect on the}} [...] "changing nature of celebrity".|$|E

I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on <b>my</b> <b>camera</b> and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned <b>my</b> <b>camera</b> away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back in Iraq, deposed {{dictator}} Saddam Hussein {{made what}} an American photographer present called [...] "the ultimate perp walk", in restraints, escorted by two Iraqi security personnel, with a media presence, {{to the start}} of his trial in 2004. [...] "I felt his anger at <b>my</b> <b>camera,</b> at me," [...] Karen Ballard recalled, [...] "and actually thought he might spit on me. He didn't know exactly {{what was about to happen}} and, suddenly, the formerly fierce dictator seemed small and disheveled." [...] To her, and other observers, it symbolized the end of his reign and the beginning of hopes for a more democratic Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of the Music series he took his smaller 4" [...] x 5" [...] Graflex camera and shot dozens of {{pictures}} of the sky in the summer of 1923. He arranged many of these photographs into distinct series he called Songs of the Sky. In late 1924 he exhibited sixty-one of his cloud photos in a single room at the Anderson Galleries. In the catalog to the exhibition he wrote [...] "Songs of the Sky – Secrets of the Skies as revealed by <b>my</b> <b>Camera</b> are tiny photographs, direct revelations of a man's world in the sky – documents of eternal relationship – perhaps even a philosophy." [...] After seeing the exhibition, Ananda Coomaraswamy, who was then curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, persuaded Stieglitz to donate some of his photographs, including five from Songs of the Sky, to the museum. This was the first time a major museum in the U.S. acquired photographs as part of its permanent collection.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It was a horrible sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload <b>my</b> <b>camera.</b> I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. Then I saw a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E

To get that wide screen I had the projector running sideways ... I had the double frame.

2500|$|Except for {{footage of}} him {{arriving}} {{at his new}} setting, and being retrieved {{at the end of}} the week, the content of each episode is taped entirely by Stroud himself using several DV cameras that he must carry with him everywhere that he goes (he later switched to a number of HDV cameras). The burden of having to carry, place, and retrieve the camera equipment for each shot adds to the challenge and difficulty of each survival situation, and in several episodes Stroud chooses to leave a camera behind, videotaping him as he departs the area (the camera is retrieved later), and in one episode taking place in the Amazon, Stroud is forced to flee his camp and abandon all but two of his cameras due to fear of a stalking jaguar. His camera and audio gear typically weigh about [...] in total. During the [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] episode, Stroud explains that [...] "setting up or tearing down all of <b>my</b> <b>camera</b> gear takes about 65% of my time." [...] The episode also explains that Stroud and his team extensively scout their locations ahead of time and consult with survivalists and natives to the area. [...] The goal is both to ensure Stroud's safety and to sketch out interesting scenarios and techniques that can be illustrated on the show. [...] He later records a voice-over commentary in the studio, where he explains his decision-making process and details of how he accomplished various tasks.|$|E

Winant mentions the relationship between the practical aspects of filming such a scene, with that of the visual effects, to which he states, [...] "The visual effects people will have to combine the real actors with the fake dummies. The dummies become real as soon as their under the van tumbling around.

Also during this period, Linder applied for work at Pathé Frères in Vincennes {{at the suggestion of}} film director Louis Gasnier and began appearing in small bit parts, mostly in slapstick comedies. Linder continued to appear on the stage {{for the next two years}} and was not a significant film star at first. However, an often-told legend about the origins of Linder's film career is that French film producer Charles Pathé personally saw Linder on the stage and wrote him a note that read [...] "In your eyes lies a fortune.

All of the proceeds go directly to the Mammoth Lakes Foundation, which helps develop education and the arts in the Eastern Sierra. “The family and the community were always a big part of our success, as they helped play in the big sandbox as well,” McCoy says. “It shows that no man does anything alone.
