5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 December 1955, during the stations' construction, {{switchgear}} exploded in the South station's substation, closing down the generators. Dunston power station could not take the extra load and it also shut down, creating a total blackout on Tyneside. Around 400,000 people were affected by the fault, including 20,000 miners trapped in over a hundred collieries. Power was fully reconnected by that evening. but the failure caused an interruption of work and services worth more than £1,000,000, {{as well as the}} loss of 300 <b>megawatts</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1996, the Portrack Incinerator on the River Tees burned 200,000 tonnes of Teesside's waste every year, {{generating}} 20 <b>megawatts</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> {{in doing}} so. In November 1996, {{the plant was}} closed down after it failed to meet emission regulations; it was then demolished in stages between 1998 and 2000. Following {{the closure of the}} Portrack plant, a new facility to burn Teesside's refuse was constructed. Teesside Energy from Waste plant was opened in May 1998 as a collaboration between SITA UK (the station's operator) and the local authorities of Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Redcar & Cleveland.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Limoneira {{completed}} two state-of-the-art solar projects. The first, at company {{headquarters in}} Santa Paula, CA., is a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates a full <b>megawatt</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> Representing one-third <b>of</b> the Company’s total use.

5|$|In 1883, Cornell {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{university}} campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo. In 1904, a hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 <b>megawatts</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity.

500|$|Kepier {{power station}} {{refers to a}} {{cancelled}} coal-fired power station on the River Wear at Kepier, [...] north east of Durham, County Durham, North East England. Planned by the North Eastern Electric Supply Company (NESCo) in 1944, it was never realised as the scheme faced stiff opposition from those who claimed it would obstruct views of the historic Durham Cathedral from the East Coast Main Line. A number of people supported the scheme as it would help meet the increasing demand for electricity and provide much needed jobs in the post-depression, post-war economy of Britain. The station, which had been designed by architect Giles Gilbert Scott, would have been operational by the late 1940s and would have generated 150 <b>megawatts</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> However, following a public inquiry the plans were not approved and instead NESCo installed new capacity at their existing power stations.|$|E
