500|$|Enough Said was {{the fifth}} film written and {{directed}} by Nicole Holofcener. After the release of her fourth film, Please Give (2010), she was approached by Matthew Greenfield and Claudia Lewis from Fox Searchlight, who offered to produce Holofcener's next project on the condition that it was more mainstream than her previous films. She wrote three drafts of the screenplay over six months. The premise was partly inspired by Holofcener's own life as a divorced mother of two teenagers and her [...] "feelings and fears about what [...] life will be like when [...] kids go away". While writing the film, she said, [...] "I was having thoughts about <b>my</b> <b>ex-husband</b> and my new boyfriend and thinking about being married and how I'm trying to have a relationship that's happier the second time." [...] Small details of the plot were also drawn from her life; Albert's guacamole-eating habit was inspired by a story that her boyfriend told her about his ex-wife.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is going to just ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, <b>my</b> <b>ex-husband</b> and I. And I think at the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E

I left about eight months after I moved here, went on a bus-and-truck tour of Me and My Girl for a year, and then did another tour and then met <b>my</b> now <b>ex-husband</b> and moved to Colorado. I lived for about seven years in Colorado, and I would work in Seattle and TUTS in Houston and Sacramento Music Circus a lot while I lived in Denver. And, then in 1998, I came back here and was here for two weeks and got a Broadway show." ...|$|R

After a six-month courtship Jackson married actor, producer and fellow Southerner Andrew Stevens, the son of actress Stella Stevens, in August, 1978. They later separated and divorced in 1981. After the divorce from Stevens Jackson was quoted, [...] "I felt as if <b>my</b> <b>ex-husband</b> drove up to my bank account with a Brink`s truck."

They formed Shoot The Moon Productions together, the company that produced Jackson's series Scarecrow and Mrs. King. [...] They separated and divorced after two years in 1984.|$|E

40|$|Twitter cuts a broad swathe across {{communities}} around the world. Even Barak Obama twitters writes Meera Atkinson in Meanjin. Sometime last year <b>my</b> <b>ex-husband</b> discovered Twitter and his ‘tweets’—mini-blog messages limited to 140 characters—started showing up on his Facebook page dutifully proffering answers to the quintessential Twitter question: what are you doing? Frankly, I couldn’t see the point. But {{then all of a}} sudden it seemed like the world was abuzz about Twitter. My curiosity got the better of me and I signed up to see what all the fuss was about. By this time my ex had lost interest and no longer twittered and I expected to follow suit. In fact, as one who is not fond of inane conversation, the prospect of a flood of sound bytes from strangers left me quite cold. Even worse was the thought that you could not only twitter on the web; you could ‘tweet’ and be tweeted at via mobile phone. There’s even an ‘adult’ Twitter. Had humanity given up on the notion of peace of mind all together? Twitter cuts a broad swathe across {{communities around}} the world, from soccer mums to celebrities, including Hugh Jackman and Ashton Kutcher, who beat CNN in a race to reach 1 million followers. Even Barak Obama twitters. Read the full article in Meanji...|$|E
30|$|The way women narrate {{being stuck}} in a vicious cycle have {{different}} aspects in common. We name this type of narrating narratives of non-directional distress. Zeynep’s story, a 49 -year old Turkish marriage migrant, forms a good example; “He [her ex-husband] went to other women. It was really hard.. I was depressed, going to a psychiatrist. Really not ok. Many problems. The children and me alone. I carry many things on my shoulders, huh? My parents are in Turkey, I am all alone here, my brother is also here, but.. You know, in that moment, then, uhh.. I just wanted to kill <b>my</b> <b>ex-husband,</b> really! My psychologist.. Uhh.. my head got a little weird. Yes in my brain, very busy brain. I went to the psychiatrist, he gave me medicine. I could’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I lost 10 kilos. Yes, he went to other women.. ehh, I forgot the word. You know, I forget many things […] I don’t know. When I go home I cry, when I go to social services I cry, ehh, when walking I cry, when people ask me, ‘are you married?’, I cry. […] Nobody knows tomorrow, I don’t know. Insha’Allah, I hope I’ve had it all, I can’t take any more. […] what can I do? There is nothing I can do but await what will come.” This excerpt {{is a good example}} of the unstructured and fragmented nature of a narrative of non-directional distress. Topics are switched, sentences not finished, and the temporal timeline switches. When asking her about her future, she indicates that no one knows what the future will bring, reflecting a lack of purpose or direction within her life story. Zeynep mentions how she carries a big load on her shoulders. This seems to reflect how she positions herself in her life narrative, as the bearer of a heavy load or the bearer of her story, not as the active author who influences the course of the story.|$|E
