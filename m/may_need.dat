Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements.

5|$|Animal-sourced foods (meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, dairy) provide zinc. The {{concentration}} of zinc in plants {{varies with the}} level in the soil. With adequate zinc in the soil, the food plants that contain the most zinc are wheat (germ and bran) and various seeds (sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, mustard). Zinc {{is also found in}} beans, nuts, almonds, whole grains, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and blackcurrant. Plant phytates interfere with zinc absorption, so people consuming a vegetarian or vegan diet <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to increase zinc intake.|$|E
5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres <b>may</b> <b>need</b> several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle and desert camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can {{to some extent}} be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E

These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E

In the future, such compounds <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis <b>may</b> <b>need</b> two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|In 627, Honorius was consecrated as {{archbishop}} by Paulinus of York at Lincoln. Honorius {{wrote to}} Pope Honorius I asking the pope {{to raise the}} see of York to an archbishopric, so that when one archbishop in England died, the other {{would be able to}} consecrate the deceased bishop's successor. The pope agreed, and sent a pallium for Paulinus, but by this time, Paulinus had already been forced to flee from Northumbria. When Paulinus, after the death of King Edwin of Northumbria in October 633, fled Northumbria, he was received by Honorius and appointed to the bishopric of Rochester. The papal letter is dated to June 634, and implies that news of Edwin's death had not reached the pope. This evidence may mean that the traditional date of Edwin's death <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to be moved to October 634. The papal letter may also mean that the traditional date of consecration for Honorius <b>may</b> <b>need</b> re-dating, as the long gap between 627, when he {{is said to have been}} consecrated, and 634, when he finally received a pallium, is much longer than usually found. It may be that Honorius was consecrated closer to 634. The papal letter to Honorius is given in the Ecclesiastical History of the medieval writer Bede.|$|E

5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection).

Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
