One of the early, equal-wheel carrier cycles Pashley {{sold in the}} 1930s (the 'Model L' for £7.10.0) had a front metal tubular carrier and nameplate {{in a similar manner}} to the 'Courier' that the company sells currently. This led on to motorised delivery tricycles and the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> carts, railway station platform refreshment trolleys and specialist units for the dairy and catering trades. The company continues to make ice cream vending tricycles (Classic No. 33) alongside its other workbike products.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- The caja (Spondias mombin L.) {{is used in}} the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream,</b> jams, pulps, bever-ages being also {{consumed}} in natura. One of the most important procedures in food conservation is drying, considering that most fresh fruits contain approximately 80 % of water. Food drying is used to obtain two basic aspects: (1) the economic factor; in the shipping and handling of the product; (2) at the manipulation; once dried and grinded, the material is rehydrated, at desirable levels, to formulate a new product as in ice cream, jams, yoghurts and drinks and may also be added to pasta, biscuits and other industrialized products. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the kinetics of caja bagasse drying in a fixed-bed tray dryer, using central composite factorial planning. The following factors were evaluated: temperature (55, 65 and 75 oC), dryer inlet air velocity (3. 2, 4. 6 and 6. 0 m. s- 1) and cake thickness (0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6 cm) where the response of the considered variable was caja bagasse moisture content (b. s.) and the results showed that the main effects and their interactions were significant at a 95 % confidence level being the best condition obtained at temperature of 75 oC, velocity of 6. 0 m. s- 1 and cake thickness of 0. 8 cm...|$|E

40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} {{are one of the}} most prevalent and broadly consumed foodstuffs. Ice-cream occupies an important place in a wide range of dairy products. The goal of the paper. To analyze the technological process <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> production in the one of the most advanced enterprise UAB Vikeda. To examine the influence of biologically valuable additives on the technological process <b>of</b> the <b>ice-cream</b> production and quality. Novelty of the paper. Samples <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> have been produced under laboratory conditions of the Technology Laboratory at Lithuanian Food Institute using the following additives: wheat fiber gel Vitacel, acacia gum fiber Fibergum, lupine proteins Lupine protein and Omega-fatty acids. Physical and sensual qualities <b>of</b> the <b>ice-cream</b> have been examined. Methods of research. Research has been performed in UAB Vikeda located in Kedainiai and in Lithuanian Food Institute. The following qualities <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> have been analyzed: melting of ice-cream; hardness of ice-cream; sensual evaluation of ice-cream; research of consumers. The melting <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> samples has been determined in accordance with the methods presented by Lithuanian Food Institute. Instrumental research of the hardness <b>of</b> the <b>ice-cream</b> texture has been performed using the semi-automatic penetrometer Labor. Sensual qualities <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> have been evaluated in accordance with the „Methods on Sensual Evaluation of Milk and Dairy Products Sensual Analysis“, worked out by Lithuanian Food Institute. Conslusions: 1) The usage of Vitacel (0. 8 - 1. 2 %) adds to the product no negative gustatory qualities. It allows supposing that the chosen concentrations of Vitacel may be used in the production <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> and concentration <b>of</b> the mentioned amount has no negative influence on sensual quality <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream.</b> 2) After adding Fibergum (1 - 1. 5 %) ice-cream has become harder and melted more slowly. The additive used has influenced freezing sense, however, it has not provided the product with negative gustatory qualities. Therefore, the additive may be used in the production <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream.</b> 3) The additive of lupine proteins (1 - 2 %) has influenced both gustatory and texture qualities. It allows supposing that the chosen concentrations of lupine proteins should not be used in the production <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream.</b> 4) The additive of Omega- 3 fatty acids (0. 2 - 0. 3 %) has demonstrated no influence on the production process and the quality <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream</b> and may be used in production <b>of</b> <b>ice-cream...</b>|$|R
