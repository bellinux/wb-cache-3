5|$|In {{a passive}} ALF, the input {{frequency}} must correspond almost exactly {{to the natural}} absorption lines of the vapor cell. Active ARFs are much <b>more</b> <b>flexible,</b> however, as the vapor may be stimulated {{so that it will}} absorb other frequencies of light.|$|E
5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> than a solid design.|$|E

5|$|More than 60 Catsuits were {{designed}} in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each. The Batsuit was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> foam rubber material than the suit from Batman.

5|$|Such {{recycling}} of revenue from permit auctions could offset {{a significant proportion}} of the economy-wide social costs of a cap and trade scheme. As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> in distributing costs, they provide more incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} renamed Gipsy in 1969, which they {{considered}} more macho and Western-sounding. The {{schedule for the}} band, which had no manager, became increasingly busy, since they had begun giving regular performances at Ismail Marzuki Park. As a result, Chrisye decided {{to drop out of}} UKI; in 1970 he transferred to Trisakti Tourism Academy, where he considered the study schedule to be <b>more</b> <b>flexible.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some optimal real-time and post-processing estimators {{of vehicle}} position using odometer and map-matched GPS measurements. These estimators {{were based on}} a simple statistical error model of the odometer and the GPS which makes the model generalizable to other applications. Firstly, an asymptotically minimum variance unbiased estimator and two optimal moving fixed interval filters which are <b>more</b> <b>flexibles</b> are exposed. Then, the post-processing case leads to the construction of two moving fixed interval smoothers. These estimators are tested and compared with the classical Kalman filter with simulated and real data, and the results show a good accuracy of each of them...|$|R

5|$|The section {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} social behaviour in different taxa. The theme is that evolution is progressive, with four pinnacles of social evolution, namely the colonial invertebrates such as corals, the social insects, mammals other than humans, and finally humans. The last chapter argues that natural selection has made humans far <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> in social organisation than any other species.|$|E
5|$|This line — {{with many}} non-hamburger sandwiches, {{including}} chicken and fish — significantly expanded {{the breadth of}} the Burger King menu. The amount of new additions, several new sandwiches made with disparate ingredients was made possible due the design of Burger King's kitchen. The chain's kitchen is modeled around a <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> concept that allows for a multiple work-flow operations where preparation stations can be re-tasked more easily. In comparison, McDonald's kitchen at the time was a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to new products. This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King and other similar chains that were <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa in 1950, Harvey {{was offered a}} job in captain Lindsay Hassett's sports store. Harvey accepted immediately because sports stores gave <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> arrangements for leave to play cricket. Harvey was sponsored by Stuart Surridge to use their cricket equipment. He was paid £300 a year, but nevertheless lived at home and shared a bedroom with his brothers Brian and Ray until he married, due to poverty. He used the same cricket uniforms {{for more than five}} years.|$|E

5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> labour practices.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> than more basal bony fishes. Their {{skeletal}} structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E
5|$|In the Shetland Islands, sand eels (Ammodytes marinus) {{normally}} form {{at least}} 90% {{of the food}} fed to chicks. It was found that, in years where the availability of sand eels was low, breeding success rates fell, with many chicks starving to death. In Norway it is the herring (Clupea harengus) that is the mainstay of the diet. When herring numbers dwindled, so did puffin numbers. In Labrador the puffins seemed <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> and when the staple forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) declined in availability, {{they were able to}} adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would create a <b>more</b> <b>flexible,</b> less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E

They also endorsed changes to NATO’s defence planning, hoping that the Alliance’s long-term defence planning process would become <b>more</b> <b>flexible,</b> thereby helping member countries generate forces that can reach further, faster and still take on the full range of missions.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April, a new Jetstream 32 {{aircraft}} {{was taken into}} service. This allowed capacity to increase from 12 to 19 passengers, {{and at the same}} time travel time was reduced from 47 to 39 minutes. By September, the most popular departures were being booked full, and Vildanden asked Coast Air for a larger aircraft, with about 30 seats. In addition to allowing more passengers, larger planes would give higher comfort, and allow a <b>more</b> <b>flexible</b> ticket pricing scheme. An agreement with Danish Air Transport (DAT) to operate an ATR 42, with a capacity of 48 seats, was signed in mid-October.|$|E
