40|$|Background. A {{clinical}} trial of mass azithromycin distributions for trachoma created a convenient experiment {{to test the}} hypothesis that antibiotic use selects for clonal expansion of preexisting resistant bacterial strains. Methods. Twelve communities in Ethiopia received mass azithromycin distributions every 3 months for 1 year. A random sample of 10 children aged 0 – 9 years from each community was monitored by means of nasopharyngeal swab sampling before mass azithromycin distribution and after 4 <b>mass</b> <b>treatments.</b> Swab specimens were tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and isolates underwent multilocus sequence typing. Results. Of 82 pneumococcal isolates identified before treatment, 4 (5 %) exhibited azithromycin resistance, rep-resenting 3 different sequence types (STs) : 177, 6449, and 6494. The proportion of isolates that were classified as one of these 3 STs and were resistant to azithromycin increased after 4 <b>mass</b> azithromycin <b>treatments</b> (14 of 96 isolates [15 %]; P =. 04). Using a classification index, we found evidence for a relationship between ST and macrolide resis-tance after <b>mass</b> <b>treatments</b> (P <. 0001).

Methodology/Principal Findings: In a collection of cluster-randomized clinical trials, mass oral azithromycin was administered to 40 villages in Ethiopia. The village prevalence of ocular chlamydia was determined before treatment, and at two and six months post-treatment. The mean prevalence of ocular chlamydia was 48. 9 % (95 % CI 42. 8 to 55. 0 %) before <b>mass</b> <b>treatments,</b> decreased to 5. 4 % (95 % CI 3. 9 to 7. 0 %) at two months after treatments (p, 0. 0001), and returned to 7. 9 % (95 % CI 5. 4 to 10. 4 %) by six months after treatment (p = 0. 03). Antibiotic coverage ranged from 73. 9 % to 100 %, {{with a mean of}} 90. 6 %.
