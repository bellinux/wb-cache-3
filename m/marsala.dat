Nino Bixio was involved in the pursuit of a group of Austro-Hungarian raiders in December 1915, but did not engage them before they escaped. <b>Marsala</b> briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the late 1920s, the victims of very tight naval budgets and their own poor performance.|$|E

5|$|Marsalas keel {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 15 February 1911, {{the same day as}} Nino Bixio. Work on <b>Marsala</b> proceeded slower than on her sister, and she was launched on 24 March 1912, where she was named for the city where Giuseppe Garibaldi launched the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860. After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 4 August 1914. Italy declared neutrality at the start of World War I in August 1914, but by May 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E

He was raised in France and began his {{football}} career playing for various clubs in the Île-de-France region such as hometown club CO Les Ulis and CSF Brétigny. In 1997, he had a stint at professional club Paris Saint-Germain. A year later, Evra seized his first footballing opportunity in neighbouring Italy when he signed his first professional contract with <b>Marsala</b> in Sicily. He made his professional debut with the club and, in the ensuing season, joined Monza. After a year playing with Monza, Evra returned to France to play for Nice. Originally a midfielder, while playing at Nice, he was converted into a full-back. In 2002, Evra joined Monaco and contributed to the club that won the Coupe de la Ligue in 2003. He also featured in European competition {{for the first time in}} his career and, in the 2003–04 season, was the starting left back on the Monaco team that reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final.

5000|$|As {{the popular}} taste in jazz moved to Bop in the mid-1940s, the <b>Marsalas</b> {{realized}} that they enjoyed the style of music that they produced and were reluctant to change. After composing a hit song, [...] "Don't Cry Joe", recorded by Frank Sinatra, Joe moved with Adele and their daughter, Eleisa, to Aspen, Colorado in 1949. Joe wrote songs for a musical about the town and Adele performed the leading role, and continued to play harp with Joe at local venues. It was in Aspen that Joe wrote [...] "And So To Sleep Again", his final hit, which was recorded by Patti Page. The multi-talented Adele was not only adept at playing piano and harp. In Aspen she brought all her abilities as organist for the church choir, equestrienne and horse trainer, and crackerjack skier as well as singer and performer to the fore.|$|R
60|$|And {{the effect}} of a bodega is picturesque, too, though in a {{different}} way. It is a bright and cheerful spot, a huge shed with whitewashed walls and an open roof supported by dark beams; great casks are piled up, impressing you in their vast rotundity with a sort of aldermanic stateliness. The whole place is fragrant with clean, vinous perfumes. Your guide carries a glass and a long filler. You taste wine after wine, in different shades of brown; light wines to drink with your dinner, older wines to drink before your coffee; wines more than a century old, of which the odour is more delicate than violets; new wines of the preceding year, strong and rough; Amontillados, with the softest flavour in the world; Manzanillas for the gouty; <b>Marsalas,</b> heavy and sweet; wines that smell of wild-flowers; cheap wines and expensive wines. Then the brandies--the distiller tells you proudly that Spanish brandy is made from wine, and contemptuously that French brandy is not--old brandies for which a toper would sell his soul; new brandies like fusel-oil; brandies mellow and mild and rich. It is a drunkard's paradise.|$|R

40|$|With the {{observation}} of spiral organism in the stomach about {{one hundred years ago}} a long history of a bacterium started ending up in a worldwide research programs, studies and consensuses. With this bacterium rediscovered by Marshall and Warren and later named Helicobacter pylori, a milestone of research was laid nearly twenty years ago. Helicobacter pylori is now recognized as the main cause of most cases of gastritis and ulcer disease in the stomach and the duodenum. In the course of the Helicobacter pylori research, Helicobacter pylori was found to trigger neoplastic alterations on the ground of the inflammation in the stomach. At first, a large number of publications served to describe the connection between Helicobacter pylori and the low malignant B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the stomach. Furthermore, on the basis of numerous seroepidemiological studies, researchers succeeded in documenting the participation of H. pylori, at least as a co-factor, in the development of gastric carcinoma. From large epidemiological studies made during the last twenty years as well as from microbiological research we have learned much more about this in the beginning nameless and mysterious bacterium. Helicobacter pylori mikroorganizmo tyrinėjimai pradėti daugiau kaip prieš šimtą metų, kuomet Bizozeras ant skrandžio gleivinės aptiko spiralinės formos bakterijų. Šia bakterija dar labiau susidomėta, kuomet B. <b>Maršalas</b> ir R. Vorenas iš naujo atrado Helicobacter pylori ir išaugino jos kultūrą.

25|$|Garibaldi {{was furious}} that his birthplace, Nice, had been ceded to France, and wished to {{recapture}} the city, but a popular insurrection in Palermo on April 4, 1860 diverted him southward.

25|$|The {{documentary}} {{evidence for the}} construction of ancient galleys is fragmentary, particularly in pre-Roman times. Plans and schematics in the modern sense did not exist until the 17th century and nothing like them has survived from ancient times. How galleys were constructed has therefore been a matter of looking at circumstantial evidence in literature, art, coinage and monuments that include ships, some of them actually in natural size. Since the war galleys floated even with a ruptured hull and virtually never had any ballast or heavy cargo that could sink them, not a single wreckage of one has so far been found. The only exception has been a partial wreckage of a small Punic liburnian from the Roman era, the <b>Marsala</b> Ship.|$|E

They were adopted {{in whole or in}} part by several later writers. Michel Gall, for example, followed Bérard throughout except that he placed the Laestrygonians in southern Corsica. Ernle Bradford had meanwhile added some new suggestions: the land of the Cyclopes was around <b>Marsala</b> in western Sicily; the island of Aeolus was Ustica off Sicily; Calypso was on Malta. The Obregons, in Odysseus Airborne, follow Bradford in some identifications but add several of their own. The Lotus Eaters are in the Gulf of Sidra; the Cyclops and Aeolus are both to be found in the Balearic Isles; the island of Circe is Ischia in the Bay of Naples; most unexpectedly, Scherie is Cyprus.|$|E
25|$|Selinunte was {{the most}} {{westerly}} of the Greek colonies in Sicily, {{and for this reason}} they soon came into contact with the Phoenicians of western Sicily and the native Sicilians in the west and northwest of the island. The Phoenicians do not at first seem to have conflicted with them; but as early as 580BCE the Selinuntines were engaged in hostilities with the non-Greek Elymian people of Segesta, whose territory bordered their own. A body of emigrants from Rhodes and Cnidus who subsequently founded Lipara, supported the Segestans on this occasion, leading to their victory; but disputes and hostilities between the Segestans and Selinuntines seem to have occurred frequently, and it is possible that when Diodorus speaks of the Segestans being at war with the Lilybaeans (modern <b>Marsala)</b> in 454BCE, that the Selinuntines are the people really meant.|$|E
25|$|Sicily is {{the third}} largest wine {{producer}} in Italy (the world's largest wine producer) after Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The region is known mainly for fortified <b>Marsala</b> wines. In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-known native varietals, and Sicilian wines have become better known. The best known local varietal is Nero d'Avola, named for a small town not far from Syracuse; the best wines made with these grapes come from Noto, a famous old city close to Avola. Other important native varietals are Nerello Mascalese {{used to make the}} Etna Rosso DOC wine, Frappato that is a component of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine, Moscato di Pantelleria (also known as Zibibbo) used to make different Pantelleria wines, Malvasia di Lipari used for the Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine and Catarratto mostly used to make the white wine Alcamo DOC. Furthermore, in Sicily high quality wines are also produced using non-native varietals like Syrah, Chardonnay and Merlot.|$|E
25|$|This was a problem, as some 20,000 mercenaries, {{formerly}} {{under the}} command of Hamilcar Barca (who had resigned his command {{at the end of the}} First Punic War), would shortly be returning from Lilybaeum (modern <b>Marsala</b> in Sicily) to Carthage. Concerned about the possibility of a large, disgruntled, mercenary force encamped near Carthage, Gesco (Gisco), the Carthaginian commandant responsible for transporting the mercenaries from Sicily, attempted to deploy the mercenaries throughout Carthaginian territory. It was his plan to bring the mercenary units back to the capital one at a time, for demobilization and payment. However, delays by the Carthaginian government, and a belief that the mercenaries could be convinced to settle for less than their agreed wages, resulted in the eventual gathering of most of the mercenary armies near Carthage. Wary of such a large foreign army near the capital, and alarmed by the disruptive effects they were having on the city, the Carthaginian government convinced the mercenaries to withdraw to the nearby city of Sicca Veneria (modern El Kef), 170km south-west of Carthage, taking their families and baggage trains with them.|$|E
