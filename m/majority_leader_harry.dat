The holdouts {{came down to}} Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucused with Democrats, and conservative Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson. Lieberman's demand that the bill not include a public option was met, although supporters won various concessions, including allowing state-based public options such as Vermont's Green Mountain Care.|$|E

This was due to Senate <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid and other Democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling that Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.|$|E

Flake and U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) were featured on a Discovery Channel reality TV show, Rival Survival, where the two stayed on a small Micronesian island for six days. Flake later joked during {{a speech at the}} National Press Club that sending both Senate <b>leaders</b> (<b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> Senator <b>Harry</b> Reid D-NV and Republican Mitch McConnell R-KY) to a remote island together might reduce partisanship and allow more legislation to move forward.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{numerous}} calls by Democrats, including Rep.

[...] "For {{the good of the}} nation, I think it is time for fresh leadership at the Department of Justice", Putnam said. This was met with surprise by many Republicans, who were remaining silent on the Gonzales issue. However, Putnam mentioned that there remained severe discontent within the GOP circle over Gonzales and as the Chairman of the House Republican Conference, he thought {{that it was important to}} send this message out.|$|R

When Senate <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid (D-NV) {{called for a}}n up or down vote, McConnell objected to the vote and ended up filibustering it himself.

25|$|Under Schumer, in the 2006 elections, the Democratic Party gained six {{seats in}} the senate, {{defeating}} incumbents {{in each of those}} races and regaining control of the senate {{for the first time since}} 2002.

5000|$|During {{his first}} term, President Bush {{nominated}} 46 people to {{federal appeals court}} seats, of which 36 were confirmed. Democrats blocked the confirmation of 10 nominees, {{on the grounds that}} they were too [...] "out of the mainstream" [...] for a lifetime appointment. At the beginning of his second term, Bush resubmitted seven of the 10 names. Senate Minority <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid (D-Nev.) vowed to fight their confirmation. Senate <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> Frist threatened to use the nuclear option to get them confirmed.|$|R
5000|$|Because of the {{political}} split in the Senate at the time (55 Republicans, 44 Democrats and one Independent), if six Senators from each party could reach an agreement, these twelve could both forestall the [...] "nuclear option" [...] and enable cloture on nominees. A cloture vote on the nomination of Priscilla Owen was scheduled for Tuesday, May 24, 2005. Its predicted failure was expected to start the Republicans moving to [...] "nuclear option". Senate <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> Bill Frist and Minority <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid had evidently given up all pretense of finding a compromise (each {{have been accused of}} having desired the showdown for their own political ends).|$|R

25|$|In October 2007, Scripps Howard News Service {{reported}} that the nomination was in trouble though he retained the support of several Republicans and the White House.

25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative.

She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>Harry</b> Reid.|$|E
