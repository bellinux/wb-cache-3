40|$|Evaluations of the Weatherization Assistance Program (the Program) serve {{three major}} purposes: (1) to {{document}} the energy savings and cost effectiveness of the Program, (2) to attract and maintain funding, and (3) to identify opportunities for improving the Program's performance.

In this evaluation guide, we focus almost entirely on the issues related to the measurement of energy savings. Because the Program's main goal is to reduce the energy use and energy burden of low-income households, the minimum output of an evaluation study should be an estimate of energy savings. If resources are limited, the first priority is to obtain this estimate of savings. Some states may be interested in other issues such as determining Program cost effectiveness, testing the value of various audit types, or identifying the best opportunities for increasing energy savings.

40|$|ASHRAE?s Guideline 14 has {{identified}} three methods for <b>measuring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings,</b> including component isolation, before-after measurements, and calibrated simulation (ASHRAE 2002). These methods {{are intended to}} be guidelines that {{will serve as a}} foundation for the development of reliable and accurate measurement of energy and demand savings from energy conservation retrofits. Guideline 14 describes linear, change-point linear, variable-based degree-day, and multivariable linear regression models as the modt used models for calculating before-after savings from energy conservation retrofits. ASHRAE?s Inverse Model Toolkit (IMT) is a FORTRAN 90 application for calculating linear, change-point linear, variable-based degree-day, multi-linear, and combined regression models (Kissock et al. 2002). The development of the IMT was sponsored by ASHRAE research project RP- 1050 under the guidance of Technical Committee 4. 7, Energy Calculations. This report reviews the reported uncertainty of ASHRAE?s Inverse Model Toolkit (IMT) analysis method and the linear, and change-point linear algorithms that it uses by reviewing the published literature on the related accuracy of IMT and its algorithms versus other well-accepted statistical analysis tools, such as SAS. This report begins with a review {{of the history of the}} IMT, and the linear and change-point linear models. Then it reviews the published comparisons of the IMT and other analysis software, relying heavily on the accuracy testing that was performed as part of ASHRAE?s Research Project 1050 -RP. It also includes a detailed description of the basic algorithms and an example of the IMT weather-normalization analysis. In summary, from the literature it was found that the algorithms in the IMT almost exactly reproduce the same regression analysis one would get by running any one of the programs that it was compared against (i. e., usually to several significant digits). Therefore, it can be concluded that the IMT is accurate, when it is called upon to perform weather normalized regressions for modeling building energy use...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The development of the energy services industry and the implementation of energy savings retrofits by energy services companies has increased the focus on the performance of energy saving retrofits. Energy savings measurement, though not an exact science, has been developing as well to ensure the benefit of a retrofit and to provide a level of assurance for the customers of energy services companies. This thesis presents a useful methodology for datelining campus utility usage using regression modeling techniques and measured daily data for the purpose of <b>measuring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> The methodology of this thesis improves upon previous regression modeling of individual buildings by extending commercial building energy usage models to an entire campus, modeling the operation of a central plant, and modeling central plant equipment performance with regression models. By adding equipment production layers, the user can more easily determine the cause of changes in the primary energy usage of a central plant. The case study for the application of the methodology of this thesis was the Texas A&M University main campus central plant. Useful results were obtained by utilizing one portion of the data to develop an energy usage baseline model and using the second portion of the data to validate the performance of the baseline model.

40|$|In {{the discussions}} of the 20 % energy saving target for 2020, and in {{particular}} {{in the discussion of}} the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), the issue of a binding energy saving targets for Member States was extensively debated. In the EED there is an EU target on maximum primary energy consumption (in Mtoe), that can be monitored with statistical data. Mandatory targets for Member States are not imposed due to the complexity of defining them (apportioning based on different possible criteria such as energy efficiency potential, economic capabilities, etc.), and due to the complexity of <b>measuring</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> In particular beside the shortcomings of the different energy savings methods (bottom up, top down based on indicators, econometric models, etc.) also the data needed to measure the energy saving in an accurate manner is often missing and it is not of the desired quality. As an alternative to measuring energy consumption, efficiency progress in the different sectors can be monitored by using indicators (e. g. Odyssee). The paper argues that policies and measures are key to achieving both EU and national energy savings. It is therefore important to monitor and evaluate which policies and measures MSs have adopted, how these policies are part of a coherent strategy to achieve policy goals, how these policies and measures have been implemented, including financing. The experience of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plans under the ESD is a first positive step in this direction, even if only a few NEEAPs submitted allows for a good assessment of the quality of policy measures. The papers argues and concludes/ that a combination of detailed NEEAPs (including assessment of the policy implemented under different criteria), with detailed indicators or bottom up calculations, when good data is available, could be used as alternative to binding MSs targets, and should allow to predict the path/trajectory towards the achievement of the EU 2020 target.

The functional forms of empirical models of cooling and heating energy use in commercial buildings are derived from an engineering analysis of constant-air-volume and variable-air-volume HVAC systems.

40|$|The {{potential}} of solar water heating systems to reduce domestic energy use is frequently acknowledged. However {{there are two}} factors that are rarely discussed when studying this technology. Firstly the real performance of the installed systems in operation, and secondly a life cycle perspective of its energy use. These two issues are reviewed in this paper, and a field study in Ireland is also presented. In the review, some studies show that measured real performance of domestic solar water heating systems can be lower than expectations. Concerning their life cycle energy performance, existing {{studies show that the}} initial energy investment for the systems (their embodied energy) is {{a small portion of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> over their lifetime with calculation paybacks generally lower than 2 years.

40|$|It {{is easy to}} <b>measure</b> <b>energy</b> {{consumption}} with a power meter. However, <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> {{cannot be}} directly computed by the powers measured using existing power meter technologies, since the power consumption only reflects parts of the real energy flows. The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) was proposed by the Efficiency Valuation Organization (EVO) to quantify <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> using four different methodologies of A, B, C and D. Although <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> can be estimated following the IPMVP, there are limitations on its practical implementation. Moreover, the data processing methods of the four IPMVP alternatives use multiple sensors (thermometer, hygrometer, Occupant information) and power meter readings to simulate all facilities, {{in order to determine}} an energy usage benchmark and the <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> This study proposes a simple sensor platform to <b>measure</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> Using usually the Electronic Product Code (EPC) global standard, an architecture framework for an information system is constructed that integrates sensors data, power meter readings and occupancy conditions. The proposed sensor platform is used to monitor a building with a newly built vertical garden system (VGS). A VGS shields solar radiation and saves on energy that would be expended on air-conditioning. With this platform, the amount of energy saved in the whole facility is measured and reported in real-time. The data are compared with those obtained from detailed measurement and verification (M&V) processes. The discrepancy is less than 1. 565 %. Using measurements from the proposed sensor platform, the <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> for the entire facility are quantified, with a resolution of ± 1. 2 %.

The purpose of the field test was to <b>measure</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and cost effectiveness of the audit-directed retrofit program for optimizing the programs benefit-to-cost ratio. The audit-directed retrofit program is described briefly in this report and in more detail by another report in this series (ORNL/CON- 228 /P 3). The purpose of this report is to describe the methods and results of the field test. Average <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> of the 20 retrofitted houses are likely (0. 90 probability) to lie between 152 and 262 therms/year/house. The most likely value of the average savings is 207 therms/year/house. These savings are significantly (p <. 05) smaller than the audit-predicted savings (286 therms/year/house). Measured savings of individual houses were significantly different than predicted savings for half of the houses. Each house received at least one retrofit. Thirteen of the 20 retrofitted houses received a new condensing furnace or blown-in wall insulation; all but two of the houses received one or more minor retrofits. The seven houses which received condensing furnaces saved, on average, about as much as predicted, but three of the seven houses had significantly more or less savings than predicted. The six houses which received wall insulation saved, on average, about half as much as predicted. The remaining houses which received only minor retrofits saved, on average, less than predicted, but the difference was not significant. Actual retrofit costs were close to expected costs. Overall <b>measured</b> <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> averaged 15 therms/year per hundred retrofit dollars invested.
