By redesigning of the iron-cored electricity generator, Axial-flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) configuration minimizes the usage of ferrite material. AFPM, one of the coreless electricity generator configuration has a less counter electromotive force (CEMF) compare to the cored electricity generator. AFPM configuration also has no cogging torque and low starting torque. Application of a coreless electricity generator is the most suitable compare to the cored electricity generator.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the temporal evolution of <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> emerging <b>within</b> a granule in the quiet-Sun internetwork at disk center. We combined IR spectropolarimetry performed in two Fe I lines at 1565 nm with speckle-reconstructed G-band imaging. We determined {{the magnetic field}} parameters by a LTE inversion of the full Stokes vector using the SIR code, and followed their evolution in time. To interpret the observations, we created a geometrical model of a rising loop in 3 D. The relevant parameters of the loop were matched to the observations where possible. We then synthesized spectra from the 3 D model for a comparison to the observations. We found signatures of <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> emergence <b>within</b> a growing granule. In the early phases, a horizontal magnetic field with a distinct linear polarization signal dominated the emerging flux. Later on, two patches of opposite circular polarization signal appeared symmetrically {{on either side of}} the linear polarization patch, indicating a small loop-like structure. The mean <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> density of this loop was roughly 450 G, with a total <b>magnetic</b> <b>flux</b> of around 3 x 10 ^ 17 Mx. During the ~ 12 min episode of loop occurrence, the spatial extent of the loop increased from about 1 to 2 arcsec. The middle part of the appearing feature was blueshifted during its occurrence, supporting the scenario of an emerging loop. The temporal evolution of the observed spectra is reproduced to first order by the spectra derived from the geometrical model. The observed event can be explained as a case of flux emergence in the shape of a small-scale loop.
