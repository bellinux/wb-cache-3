40|$|Volatile {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for <b>the</b> aromas of <b>butter.</b> A simple technique for the determination of these components is described {{which is based on}} solid-phase extraction (SPE) after <b>melting</b> of <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> and separation of the aqueous phase from the fat. Volatile flavours present in the water fraction are collected by off-line SPE on cartridges packed with a copolymer sorbent. After desorption with 500 μl of methyl acetate, 1 -μl aliquots are quantified and/or identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The procedure was tested with respect to recovery, linearity and limit of detection in real-life samples using five polar model analytes. It allows the characterisation of polar flavour compounds in butter prior to and after heat treatment at 170 °C. From the five model compounds, vanillin, traces of diacetyl and maltol were found to be present in <b>the</b> <b>butter</b> samples.

40|$|Summary. Melted {{butter is}} made from dairy <b>butter</b> by {{rendering}} <b>the</b> fat phase. It has specific taste and aroma, high-calorie content and good assimilability. Defects of butter which appeared during the storage causes {{by the development of}} microbiological processes or by the chemical oxidation. On the development of these processes influence quality and composition of fresh butter, its physical structure, content of the increased amount of gas phase and content of heavy metals, storage conditions. Microbiological spoilage of butter occurs generally due to damage of plasma which is good environment for the development of microorganisms. Defects of microbiological origin include: unclean, sour, moldy, yeasty, cheesy, bitter taste. Defects of test and smell chemical origin are formed due to hydrolytic digestion of lipids. It's prevailed at long storage of <b>butter</b> in <b>the</b> conditions of freezing temperatures. It's picked out the following main processes of spoiling: souring, acidifying and sallowness. Often these processes take place simultaneously. It has been investigated melted butter with lactated additive. The latter improves the microbiological and toxicological safety, prolongs the storage condition of the products. Technological efficiency of the additives is achieved by a multilayer products formation from the inactive bound water, preventing microorganisms growth and by the barrier layer with lactate inhibiting hydrolytic reactions. Oil samples were obtained with <b>the</b> batch-type <b>butter</b> maker application, then they were melted and after that lactated additive were supplemented. It has been studied organoleptic and physico-chemical indices of <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> <b>butter</b> samples. <b>The</b> fatty-acid composition of melted butter were studied. Comparative analysis of fatty-acid composition of cow's milk fat and produced melted butter has shown their similarity. Also in the last sample there is increased weight fraction of linoleic and linolenic acids. The obtained experimental data for melted butter allow to conclude about its high quality...|$|R
