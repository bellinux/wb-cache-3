Secondary outcomes were body composition (lean body and fat free <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>kg),</b> and muscle strength (% change in 1 RM, dynamometry, change in maximum weight lifted). ResultsThe search yielded nine relevant trials that evaluated 372 people with type 2 diabetes. Compared to not exercising, progressive resistance exercise led to small and statistically significant absolute reductions in HbA 1 c of 0. 3 % (SMD – 0. 25, 95 % CI – 0. 47 to – 0. 03). When compared to aerobic exercise {{there were no significant}} differences in HbA 1 c.

The source rate from Enceladus at Saturn has been reported to be an order of magnitude smaller (in absolute numbers) than that from Io at Jupiter. Both reference values, however, are also smaller at Saturn than at Jupiter, by factors ~ 40 to 60; expressed in dimensionless form, the estimated mass input from Enceladus may be larger than that from Io by factors ~ 4 to 6.

Methods: Twenty four male adult (mean (SD) age 24 (2) years, weight 75. 7 (7. 2) kg, VO 2 MAX 66. 6 (5. 2) ml/lbm/min, where lbm is lean body <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>kg)</b> and 21 youth (14 (0. 4) years, 60. 2 (7. 3) kg, 66. 5 (5. 9) ml/lbm/min) elite soccer players {{took part in}} the study. Allometric equations were used to determine the relation between maximal and submaximal oxygen cost of running (running economy) and body mass. Results: Maximal and submaximal oxygen uptake increased in proportion to body mass raised to the power of 0. 72 (0. 04) and 0. 60 (0. 06) respectively. The VO 2 MAX of adult players was {{similar to that of the}} youth players when expressed in direct proportion to body mass—that is, ml/kg/min—but 5 % higher (p, 0. 05) when expressed using appropriate procedures for scaling.

The sample included 60 obese schoolchildren of both genders, aged 8 to 13 years, recruited from a school in the city of Santiago (Chile). The intervention included physical exercise (strength training 3 times per week), during 3 months. Multi-compartmental body composition was estimated using isotopic dilution, plethysmography, radiographic absorptiometry and 4 C model as the gold standard. Presence of metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to Cook criteria and cardiovascular risk factors were determined using anthropometric and biochemical indicators. We found differences in schoolchildren in pubertal stages III & IV. Compared to girls, boys showed significant reductions in body fat in kg and percentage (4 -Component model) and isotopic dilution in kg (p < 0, 05). Likewise, we observed an increase in the fat-free <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>kg,</b> in the 4 -Component Model (p < 0, 01).

Seventy-three (n= 73) consecutive trans-tibial (TTA) and trans-femoral amputees (TFA) attending an outpatient prosthetic clinic were studied. Prosthetic weight bearing was measured on a bathroom scale (<b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>kg),</b> normalised to body mass then expressed as a percentage and labelled static weight bearing (SWB). Maximum safe self-selected ambulatory velocity over a 10 metre level walkway (m/s) was measured with a stopwatch. The SWB mean for the TTA group was 94. 93 % (range 77 - 100 %) and 88. 36 % for the TFA group (range 43 - 100 %). The mean ambulatory velocity was 1. 70 m/s (range 0. 07 - 5. 75) for the TTA group and 0. 78 m/s (range 0. 10 - 1. 54) for the TFA group. A statistically significant relationship (p< 0. 05) was found between SWB and ambulatory velocity in trans-tibial and trans-femoral amputees in this study. A ceiling effect was noted in the trans-tibial group with 42 % achieving 100 % SWB through their prosthetic limb so it was concluded that ambulatory velocity was the more sensitive measure in established trans-tibial prosthetic limb users. SWB may be the more appropriate quantifiable measure for use in established trans-femoral prosthesis users. Prosthetic training programmes would benefit from the objective measurement of SWB.

Positive associations were found between the polyunsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio and indices of FFM, and inverse associations were found with PFE, SFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and trans fatty acids (TFAs) (all as % of energy).

The field tests for carrying out in different dates (different phenological stages), and in three dairy farms, represents the typical pastures in Alentejo region (grasses; leguminous; and bio divers mixture). For each sample were collecting 30 readings with the probe. In each field square, six geo-referenced pasture samples were collected from 1 m 2 areas where the pasture had been protected using exclosure cages.

Obesity related non-communicable disease is considerably associated with high accumulation of calorie and uneven or less expenditure of calorie due to inadequate physical activity. Obesity could be related with many non-communicable diseases — Hypertension, Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), and NIDDM for example. The main objective of the present study is to estimate the prevalence of over weight and obesity in the Bengali population and its association with few body compositional variables, physiological variables and risk score of coronary heart disease (CHD). Mean age in male was 48. 99 yrs and in 46. 06 years in female, significant sex difference was seen (P< 0. 05) in weight, BMI, Heart disease risk score, WHR, PBF, FM and FFM. Fat <b>mass</b> <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> was found to be higher in female than male but risk score of CHD was seen higher in male than female, life style factor may be the one of the reasons.

Total risk score (TRS) gave significant correlation with BMI, Blood pressure and PBF. However, PBF was significantly correlated with BMI, WHR, TRS and blood pressure. The present study demonstrated that obesity is one of the major factors for hypertension and Coronary heart disease. Obesity and other lifestyle factor increase the risk of coronary heart disease.

40|$|According to geometry, {{as objects}} {{of the same}} shape {{increase}} in size, their surface area will increase {{in proportion to the}} 2 / 3 power of their volume. In other words, if two objects have the same shape and density but one has twice the mass of the other, the surface area of the larger object will only be 59 % greater and not double that of the smaller object. This relationship between relative surface area and size of similar shaped objects permeates biology and the understanding of animal function. For example, Sarrus and Rameaux (1839, cited by Kleiber, 1961) used this relationship to propose that if different-sized mammals are to maintain the same body temperature then the heat production (i. e. metabolic rate) of different mammals should be proportional to surface area and not body mass. This described the ‘surface law ’ of metabolism, which Rubner (1883) experimentally tested by comparing the heat production at 15 °C of dogs ranging in body mass from 3 to 31 ·kg. He found that the heat production of his dogs was more constant when expressed per m 2 of body surface area than when expressed per kg body mass. Later Krogh (1916) suggested the use of a more empirical approach {{to examine the relationship between}} metabolic rate and body size of animals.

40|$|Title: The {{relationship}} of body composition and aerobic fitness {{in the elderly}} Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the aerobic fitness of students at University of Third Age at the UK FTVS and to investigate whether there exists an association between body composition and aerobic fitness. Methods: The research involved 54 seniors (age 64 ± 2. 71 years, body height 163. 23 ± 6. 05 cm) who studied at University of the 3 rd Age at the UK FTVS at the time of research. The original sample of probands was 91, but people aged over 70 years and people taking heart-rate medications had to be excluded. Measurments of body composition was performed using BIA 2000 M multifrequency bioimpedance analysis. The investigated parameters were total body water (TBW), intracellular water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW) in litres, fat free <b>mass</b> (FFM) <b>in</b> <b>kg,</b> percentage of body fat (% BF) and extracellular and body cell mass ratio (ECM/BCM). Measurement of aerobic fitness was performed by a 2 km test pass, evaluated by Stejskal at the athletic stadium UK FTVS. Time and heart rate were scanned by sporttester (Polar S 610 i). The data was processed using the IBM SPSS statistics 22. Results: The results showed that our group belongs to "avarage seniors" in terms of aerobic fitness. A significant relationship [...] ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{goal of the}} XMASS {{experiment}} is direct detection of dark matter using single-phase liquid xenon. The current-phase detector XMASS-I has the largest target <b>mass</b> (835 <b>kg</b> <b>in</b> total) and achieves the lowest energy threshold (300 -eV-electron equivalent). The next phase detector XMASS- 1. 5 will have a total five tons of liquid xenon and is planned to start in 2015. This paper reports results of searches conducted with XMASS-I [low-mass weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), solar axions, annual modulation of event rate at low energy, and inelastic scattering of 129 Xe nuclei by WIMPs] {{the current status of}} hardware modification of XMASS-I to reduce background, and progress in designing XMASS- 1. 5...|$|R
