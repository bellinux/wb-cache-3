2500|$|In 1844, Karl Marx (1818–1883), an atheistic {{political}} economist, {{wrote in}} his Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right: [...] "Religious suffering is, at {{one and the same}} time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people." [...] Marx believed that people turn to religion in order to dull the pain caused by the reality of social situations; that is, Marx suggests religion is an attempt at transcending the <b>material</b> <b>state</b> of affairs in a society—the pain of class oppression—by effectively creating a dream world, rendering the religious believer amenable to social control and exploitation in this world while they hope for relief and justice in life after death. In the same essay, Marx states, [...] "an creates religion, religion does not create man".|$|E

40|$|The {{multiaxial fatigue}} {{behaviour}} of materials with different ductility under constant and changing principal stress directions is also applicable to welded joints of different materials. For this, welded flange tube connections {{of the fine}} grained steel StE 460 and the artificially aged aluminium alloy AlSilMgMn T 6 were investigated under constant amplitude combined bending and torsion. Out-of-phase loading, i. e. changing principal stress directions, of the steel joints led to a decrease of fatigue life, which is observed at ductile <b>material</b> <b>states.</b> However, for the aluminium joints out-of-phase loading resulted same behaviour as in-phase loading, which indicates a semi-ductile material behaviour. The results for the welded steel joints were evaluated on basis of local stresses by the integral hypothesis of the Effective Equivalent Stress EES (WVS). This hypothesis for ductile <b>material</b> <b>states</b> {{takes into account the}} life decreasing influence of out-of-phase loading by considering the interaction of the shear stresses on different planes. The fatigue behaviour of the aluminium welds is described by the critical plane based combination of shear and normal stresses (KoNoS), which is valid for semi-ductile <b>material</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

He put forward in his defence the <b>material</b> <b>state</b> of Guerriere. The frigate was originally French-built, captured by the Royal Navy in 1806, and therefore not as sturdy as British-built ships. Also, Guerriere was badly decayed and proceeding to Halifax to refit at the time, and the fall of the mizzen mast which hampered Guerriere early in the fight was claimed to be due as much to rot as battle damage. There was no suggestion that Dacres and his men had not done their utmost, or that Dacres had been reckless to engage Constitution. Dacres was therefore acquitted.|$|E
