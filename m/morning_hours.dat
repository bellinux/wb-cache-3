5|$|For the {{following}} ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track {{for ten days}} due to a persistent mid to upper-level tropospheric ridge. Gradual intensification took place as the system developed strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures aided in fueling further development.

By the late <b>morning</b> <b>hours</b> of September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E

30|$|From {{all these}} results, it {{essentially}} means that movements of vehicles during <b>morning</b> peak <b>hours</b> 6  am to 9  am are less dispersed but more significant connoting that <b>morning</b> peak <b>hour</b> movements have similar patterns {{as compared to}} evening off-peak from 4  pm to 7  pm. The hours with least patterns are morning off-peak from 9  am to 12 noon, even though {{day of the week}} and time of the day have more significance on morning peaks than off-peak hours as also verified by [48]. This is understandable in that for <b>morning</b> peak <b>hours</b> most people are either moving to their workplace, school or regular activity for the day, whereas with off-peak hours, the movement is less predictable as no regular pattern is discerned. For weekends, it is reasonable that there will be more vehicular movement during off-peak hours since most people do not need to meet the <b>morning</b> <b>hour</b> rush time but can decide to travel after 9  am.|$|R
