5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E

Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat.

Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E

They {{advanced}} quickly along the main road protected by flank guards; the 36th Jacob's Horse, 11th Cavalry Brigade, capturing some German soldiers along the way. About 100 enemy soldiers retreating {{from the direction of}} Mount Ephraim were captured during this advance, and while <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> the railway through Shatta into Beisan another 100 or more soldiers with three 150-mm howitzers facing eastwards were captured.

5|$|Cincinnati's offense {{took over}} at the spot of the {{interception}} and immediately began <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> the field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first down at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first down at the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive {{came to an end}} when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in the end zone, denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in the end zone for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.|$|E

5|$|Fighting at the Notch {{continued}} through the afternoon, but, the attack still unsuccessful, the North Korean troops withdrew suddenly in the mid-afternoon, allowing American forces to recover most of the casualties and vehicles from the Notch. In the meantime, they set up roadblocks to prevent further North Korean attacks from <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> the road. North Korean forces disengaged from the fight without attempting to flank the Americans, and by nightfall {{they were out of}} the region. In the meantime, the 27th Infantry Regiment surprised a large column of North Korean forces advancing on the south road and captured many trucks of supplies. During the North Koreans' retreat from the two roads, US Air Force planes mounted an airstrike against the North Koreans and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Galerius was reinforced, {{probably}} {{in the spring of}} 298, by a new contingent collected from the empire's Danubian holdings. Narseh did not advance from Armenia and Mesopotamia, leaving Galerius to lead the offensive in 298 with an attack on northern Mesopotamia via Armenia. It is unclear if Diocletian was present to assist the campaign; he might have returned to Egypt or Syria. Narseh retreated to Armenia to fight Galerius' force, to Narseh's disadvantage; the rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry, but not to Sassanid cavalry. In two battles, Galerius won major victories over Narseh. During the second encounter, Roman forces seized Narseh's camp, his treasury, his harem, and his wife. Galerius continued <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> the Tigris, and took the Persian capital Ctesiphon before returning to Roman territory along the Euphrates.|$|E
5|$|On {{its opening}} day in North America, the film debuted at ninth place, {{grossing}} $967,329 from 1,185 theaters.

Steve Mason of Hollywood.com believed that Miracle at St. Annas negative reviews and moviegoers' declining interest in war films contributed to the film's poor box office performance.

The huia {{is thought to have}} undertaken seasonal movements, living in montane forests in the summer and <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> into lowland forests in the winter to avoid the harsher weather and cold temperatures of higher altitudes. Like the surviving New Zealand wattlebirds, the saddleback and the kōkako, the huia was a weak flier and could only fly for short distances, and seldom above tree height. More often it would use its powerful legs to propel it in long leaps and bounds through the canopy or across the forest floor, or it would cling vertically to tree trunks with its tail spread for balance.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor {{decided to}} take their {{companies}} up Baby 700. Instead of going round to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> Battleship Hill, {{and for the next}} hour they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th Battalions crossed Malone's Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on Baby 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby 700. From his headquarters at the head of Monash Valley, Maclagen could see the Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when <b>moving</b> <b>down</b> columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
