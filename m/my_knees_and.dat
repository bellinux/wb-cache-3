500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony herself said, [...] "Work {{and worship}} are one with me. I {{can not imagine}} a God of the {{universe}} made happy by my getting down on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> calling him 'great.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{got down}} on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> I did say 'thank you' to God. And {{right then and there}} joy and peace came into my soul. I knew then what it was to be 'born again,' and the Bible which had been so dry to me before, became everything." ...|$|E
60|$|Unfolding the {{manuscript}} I spread it carefully on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> began to read.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father's {{going to}} read to us, father's {{going to read}} to us," [...] she cried, finally clambering up on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> snuggling against me.|$|R
6000|$|Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx! and {{put your}} head upon <b>my</b> <b>knee!</b> <b>And</b> let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the Lynx! ...|$|R
2500|$|She did {{not claim}} that she fought until being wounded, {{but she did}} say her weapon jammed {{immediately}} and {{that she could not}} have done anything anyway. Interviewed by Diane Sawyer, Lynch claimed, concerning the media and the Pentagon: [...] "They used me to symbolize all this stuff. It's wrong. I don't know why they filmed [...] or why they say these things." [...] She also stated [...] "I did not shoot, not a round, nothing. I went down praying to <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> <b>And</b> that's the last I remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born in Kenansville, North Carolina English {{was raised}} by parents Aubine and Grace English, in a town called North East, near Wallace, North Carolina. English {{performed}} in his family's singing group, The Singing Samaritans, from 1972 until 1980.

It was then that he had his first big success in southern gospel music with the live recording of what would become his signature song, [...] "I Bowed On <b>My</b> <b>Knees</b> (<b>And</b> Cried Holy)".|$|E
2500|$|One famous {{crossing}} at Putney {{was that}} of Cardinal Wolsey in 1529 upon his 'disgrace' in falling out of favour with Henry VIII and on ceasing to be the holder of the Great Seal of England. As he was riding up Putney Hill he was overtaken {{by one of the}} royal chamberlains who presented him with a ring as a token of the continuance of his majesty's favour. When the Cardinal had heard these words of the king, he quickly lighted from his mule and knelt down in the dirt upon both knees, holding up his hands for joy, and said [...] "When I consider the joyful news that you have brought to me, I could do no less than greatly rejoice. Every word pierces so my heart, that the sudden joy surmounted my memory, having no regard or respect to the place; but I thought it my duty, that in the same place where I received this comfort, to laud and praise God upon <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> most humbly to render unto my sovereign lord my most hearty thanks for the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gamaliel," [...] {{she said}} sharply, [...] "straighten up and don't talk {{nonsense}} to me. I've had you on <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> I knew {{your mother and}} father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think of it, Thirza--that child! Why, it's {{only a year}} or two {{since she}} used to sit on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> tickle <b>my</b> face with her hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The water weets my tae," [...] she said; [...] "The water weets <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>And</b> hold up <b>my</b> bridle reins, sir knight, For {{the sake}} of Our Ladye." ...|$|R
60|$|But their locked bodies smote against <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> I was overthrown.|$|E
6000|$|Where {{touched the}} check-floored chancel [...] <b>My</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> his? The step looks shyly at the sun, And says, [...] "'Twas here {{the thing was}} done, [...] For bale or else for bliss!" [...] Of all those there I least was ware [...] Would it be that or this When touched the check-floored chancel [...] <b>My</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> his! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{pointed to}} the door. Then I felt a sudden revulsion. I fell on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> seized her hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You'll do what I {{want you}} to do, sonny,' said Marshall, 'or I'll jest turn you over <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> give you one of those spankings your mother forgot.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen {{anything}} like this," [...] Isobel said softly. I looked up from the writing-pad on <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> she met <b>my</b> glance with a smile of contrition.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't SAY anything," [...] {{retorted}} Aunt Janet. [...] "I'd simply {{turn you}} over <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> {{give you a}} sound, solid spanking, Miss Sara. You'd find that penance enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hail Christmas! On <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> fowl I fall: [...] For greater {{grace and}} better gravy call. [...] Vive l'Humbug!--that's to say, God bless us all! ...|$|E
60|$|Taking {{this as an}} intimation to {{obey the}} old man's commands, I went down on <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> touched my lips to the hand he extended.|$|E
60|$|Yes, bunch {{yourself}} between <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> lie still. Lie on {{me with a}} hot, plumb, live weight, {{heavy as}} a stone, passive, yet hot, waiting.|$|E
6000|$|Adele {{sang the}} canzonette tunefully enough, {{and with the}} naivete of her age. This achieved, she jumped from <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would put}} you across <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> whip you, you snarling little puppy, that's what I would do!" [...] cried the Colonel, who had found breath by this time, and vented another {{explosion}} of fury.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I had, I {{probably}} should have put you on <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> told you fairy tales, or cut dolls for you out of this bark, instead of sitting respectfully silent and making a basket for your stores." ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then two}} or three big bubbles rose to the surface, and silently exploded. Quick as {{lightning}} I dropped on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> raised my arms.|$|E
60|$|It was a sign--{{a sign of}} pardon, a sign of grace. It {{could be}} naught else. I fell upon <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> {{rendered}} my deep and joyous thanks.|$|E
60|$|I {{struggled}} to <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> if ever I felt terrified {{in my life}} it was then, and I am not ashamed to say that I hesitated and hung back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tommy Dermott," [...] I said, when I had got {{my nerves}} back somewhat. [...] "Tommy Dermott, I'm {{going to lay}} you across <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> give you the {{greatest}} thrashing a boy ever got in the world's history." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, little one, {{you must}} sit here,' said I, raising her up from <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> placing {{her on a}} chair in a corner. 'You must be a brave lass and sit still, {{whatever}} may chance. Will you do so?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you won't {{leave us}} now, will you?" [...] said little Ivanka pitifully, getting on <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> {{nestling}} on <b>my</b> breast; [...] "you {{will stay with}} father, won't you, and help {{to take care of}} us? I'm so frightened!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She said, 'I {{went to my}} room, trembling. I {{fell down}} on <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> prayed to my heavenly Father to have mercy on them. I thought, [...] "What shall I do?"' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{dropped on}} <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> fell {{to work on}} his ankle bonds. Whack came something--I know not what--and splashed the livid streamlet into drops about us. Far away on our right a piping and {{whistling}} began.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honourable!" [...] {{said the}} widow with bitter scorn. [...] "Oh, brother, {{what is this}} you call honour? If my boy has been guilty, he must marry her. I would go down on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> pray him to do so." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{of which}} is neither here nor there. The speed with which I ran from the galley caused excruciating pain in <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> I sank down helplessly at the break of the poop. But the Cockney had not pursued me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit on {{the stool}} at <b>my</b> <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> give me your hand," [...] said Challenger to his wife. [...] "I think, my friends, that a further delay in this insufferable {{atmosphere}} is hardly advisable. You would not desire it, dear, would you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} {{thinking}} that I {{should have a}} doll to match your knife. I feel as if I should enjoy trotting a staring fright on <b>my</b> <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> singing Hush-a-by. But I fancy even your magic cannot produce such a thing,--can it, my lad?" ...|$|R
