40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of eutrophication on arsenic speciation in lake waters was investigated. Surface water samples (n = 1 - 10) were collected from 18 lakes in Japan during July 2007 and February 2008. The lakes were classified into <b>mesotrophic</b> (7 <b>lakes)</b> and eutrophic (11 lakes) based on the total phosphate (T-P) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in water column. Inorganic, methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic species were determined by combining hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry with ultraviolet irradiation. Organoarsenicals (mainly methylated and ultraviolet-labile fractions) comprised 30 - 60 % of the total arsenic in most lakes during summer. On the other hand, inorganic arsenic species (As(III + V)) dominates (about 60 - 85 %) during winter. The occurrence of ultraviolet-labile fractions of arsenic was higher in eutrophic lakes than those in <b>mesotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> in both seasons. The concentration of dimethyl arsenic (DMAA) was high in eutrophic lakes during winter; and in <b>mesotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> during summer. The {{results suggest that the}} conversion of As(III + V) to more complicated organoarsenicals occurred frequently in eutrophic lakes compared to that in <b>mesotrophic</b> <b>lakes,</b> which is thought to be {{the influence}} of biological activity in the water column. The distribution of arsenic species were well correlated with phosphate concentrations than those of Chl-a. This might be due to the competitive uptake of As(V) and phosphate by phytoplankton. The organoarsenicals (OrgAs) /As(V) ratio was higher at low phosphate concentration indicating that conversion of As(V) to OrgAs species was more active in phosphate-exhausted lakes with high phytoplankton density. © 2009 Elsevier B.

25|$|Lakes can be also {{categorized}} on {{the basis}} of their richness in nutrients, which typically affect plant growth. Nutrient-poor lakes are said to be oligotrophic and are generally clear, having a low concentration of plant life. <b>Mesotrophic</b> <b>lakes</b> have good clarity and an average level of nutrients. Eutrophic lakes are enriched with nutrients, resulting in good plant growth and possible algal blooms. Hypertrophic lakes are bodies of water that have been excessively enriched with nutrients. These lakes typically have poor clarity and are subject to devastating algal blooms. Lakes typically reach this condition due to human activities, such as heavy use of fertilizers in the lake catchment area. Such lakes are of little use to humans and have a poor ecosystem due to decreased dissolved oxygen.|$|R

40|$|In {{central and}} {{southern}} Florida Diuptomus dorsaks is the sole diaptomid in most eutrophic lakes whereas Diuptomusfloridanus and Diuptomus mississippiensis co-occur in oligotrophic and <b>mesotrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> The importance of food availability and water quality in determining the species distributions of Diuptomus was ascertained by culturing the three species in water from a lake of each type with its natural phytoplankton present and with the natural phytoplankton removed and Chlamydomonas added at a concentration above feeding satu-ration. The experimental evidence indicated that neither food availability nor water quality is important in excluding D. jloridunus and D. mississippiensis from the eutrophic lakes. Ad-ditional data suggested that strong predation pressure may prevent these two species from occupying lakes of this type. However, low food availability seemed of major importance in excluding D. dorsalis from the oligotrophic and <b>mesotrophic</b> <b>lakes.</b> Competition is likely because food levels are always limiting and a potential competitor {{is present in the}} form of D. $oridunus- in the same subgenus and close to the same size. Additional evidence suggests that predation is probably of lesser importance to the zooplankton in lakes of these types. Three major factors have been sug-gested to influence regional distributions of freshwater Calanoid copepods of the genus Diaptomus. Competition for food has been considered important because it is rare to find co-occurring species of Diaptomus of the same subgenus and near the same size (Hutchinson 1951, 1967; Cole 1961, 1966; Nauwerck 1980). When such species of Diaptomus do oc-cur in the same lake, they are often sep-arated vertically or seasonally (Sander-cock 1967; Hammer and Sawchyn 196 s). Water chemistry has been suggested as a direct or indirect regulator of distribu-tions (Moore 1952; Whittaker and Fair...|$|R
