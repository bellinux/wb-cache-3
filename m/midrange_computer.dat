50|$|At the time, the IBM Displaywriter System {{dominated}} the dedicated word processor market. IBM's main competition was Wang Laboratories. Such machines were expensive and were generally accessed through terminals connected to central mainframe or <b>midrange</b> <b>computers.</b>|$|R
50|$|IBM System/3X {{was a line}} {{of general}} {{business}} <b>midrange</b> <b>computers</b> that were developed and marketed by the IBM Company beginning in 1975.

5000|$|IBM {{introduced}} the IBM 3310 Direct Access Storage Device on January 30, 1979 for IBM 4331 <b>midrange</b> <b>computers.</b> [...] Each drive has {{a capacity of}} 64.5MB. The 3310 was a fixed block architecture device, used on DOS/VSE and VM, the only S/370 operating systems that supports FBA devices.|$|R
50|$|The IBM System/32 (IBM 5320) {{introduced}} in January 1975 was a low-end business computer with builtin display screen, disk drives, printer, and database report software. It was used primarily by small to midsize businesses for accounting applications. RPGII was the (main) programming language for the machine.It was {{the successor to}} the IBM System/3 model 6 in the IBM <b>midrange</b> <b>computer</b> line.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM System/3 was an IBM <b>midrange</b> <b>computer</b> {{introduced}} in 1969, and marketed until 1985. It {{was produced by}} IBM Rochester in Minnesota as a low-end business computer aimed at new customers and organizations that still used IBM 1400 series computers or unit record equipment. The first member of what IBM refers to as their [...] "midrange" [...] line, it also introduced the RPG II programming language.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{challenge for}} harnessing {{the power of}} a <b>midrange</b> <b>computer</b> is interacting with an online user and providing ease of use. So what if your customer file has a million records... can your computer operator find the right one quickly? Concepts such as ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) have been around {{since the early days of}} computing. Using a display format, with colors, blinking fields, command keys, and scrolling functions, an operator can quickly adjust to advanced programs and become more effective.|$|E
50|$|IBM {{launched}} their own proprietary Token Ring product on October 15, 1985. It ran at 4 Mbit/s, and attachment was possible from IBM PCs, <b>midrange</b> <b>computers</b> and mainframes. It used a convenient star-wired physical topology, and ran over shielded twisted-pair cabling, and shortly thereafter {{became the basis}} for the (ANSI)/IEEE standard 802.5.|$|R
50|$|Minicomputers {{were also}} known as <b>midrange</b> <b>computers.</b> They grew to have {{relatively}} high processing power and capacity. They were used in manufacturing process control, telephone switching and to control laboratory equipment. In the 1970s, they were the hardware {{that was used to}} launch the computer-aided design (CAD) industry and other similar industries where a smaller dedicated system was needed.|$|R
50|$|The company {{objectives}} were twofold: to provide in-house computer processing support to Golden United Life Insurance; {{and to develop}} as an independent business in the computer time-sharing industry, by renting time on its PDP-10 <b>midrange</b> <b>computers</b> during business hours. It was spun off as a separate company in 1975, trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol CMPU.|$|R
5000|$|Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) is an eight-bit {{character}} encoding used {{mainly on}} IBM mainframe and IBM <b>midrange</b> <b>computer</b> operating systems. EBCDIC {{descended from the}} code used with punched cards and the corresponding six bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. [...] It is also supported on various non-IBM platforms such as Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, the SDS Sigma series, and Unisys VS/9 and MCP.|$|E
5000|$|... 1969: The IBM System/3, renting {{for less}} than $1,000 a month, the {{ancestor}} of IBM's <b>midrange</b> <b>computer</b> product line, aka. minicomputers, was aimed at new customers and organizations that still used IBM 1400 series computers or unit record equipment. It featured a new, smaller, punched card with a 96 column format. Instead of the rectangular punches in the classic IBM card, the new cards had tiny (1 mm), circular holes much like paper tape. By July 1974 more than 25,000 System/3s had been installed.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM System/34 was an IBM <b>midrange</b> <b>computer</b> {{introduced}} in 1977. It was withdrawn from marketing in February, 1984. [...] It was a multi-user, multi-tasking {{successor to the}} single-user System/32. Most notably, it included two very different processors, one based on System/32 and the second based on older System/3. Like the System/32 and the System/3, the System/34 was primarily programmed in the RPG II language. One of the machine's interesting features was an off-line storage mechanism that utilized [...] "magazines" [...] - boxes of 8-inch floppies that the machine could load and eject in a nonsequential fashion. Borrowing mainframe features such as programmable job queues and priority levels, the System/34 ran on 64K of memory.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} format for {{hexadecimal}} on IBM mainframes (zSeries) and <b>midrange</b> <b>computers</b> (IBM System i) running the traditional OS's (zOS, zVSE, zVM, TPF, IBM i) is , {{and is used}} in Assembler, PL/I, COBOL, JCL, scripts, commands and other places. This format was common on other (and now obsolete) IBM systems as well. Occasionally quotation marks were used instead of apostrophes.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{introduced}} the IBM 3370 Direct Access Storage Device in January 1979 for IBM 4331, 4341, and System/38 <b>midrange</b> <b>computers.</b> [...] It has seven fixed 14 in disks, and each unit has {{a capacity of}} 571 MB. It was the first HDD to use thin film head technology; research on that technology started at Thomas J. Watson Research Center in the late 1960s. [...] The 3370 was a fixed block architecture device, used on DOS/VSE and VM, the only S/370 operating systems that supported FBA devices.|$|R
50|$|Although the 8086 was {{primarily}} developed for embedded systems and small multi-user or single-user computers, {{largely as a}} response to the successful 8080-compatible Zilog Z80, the x86 line soon grew in features and processing power. Today, x86 is ubiquitous in both stationary and portable personal computers, and is also used in <b>midrange</b> <b>computers,</b> workstations, servers and most new supercomputer clusters of the TOP500 list. A large amount of software, including operating systems (OSs) such as DOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and macOS, functions with x86-based hardware.|$|R
