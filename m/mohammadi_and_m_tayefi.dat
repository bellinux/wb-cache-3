40|$|Pairing {{correlations}} {{and their}} influence on nuclear properties has been studied within BCS model. Using this theoretical model with inclusion of pairing interaction between nucleons, nuclear level density and entropy of Pd(105, 106, 107) have been extracted. The results well coincide with the empirical values of the nuclear level densities obtained by Oslo group. Then the entropy excess of Pd 107 and Pd 105 compared to Pd 106 {{as a function of}} the temperature has been studied. Also the role of neutron and proton system in entropy excess have been investigated by the using of the entropy excess ratio proposed by Razavi et al. [R. Razavi, A. N.

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{identify}} factors led some farmers to use renewable energy in their poultry farms. The research was a practical study {{in terms of}} goal and a descriptive-correlation study in terms of methodology. The population {{of the study was}} composed of Semnan Province poultry farmers that used any type of renewable energy in their farms. Based on the farmer's viewpoints, the most important factors made farmers use renewable energy in their poultries were poultry farm revenue, bank loans with low interest rate, and technology and equipment availability. Also, according to stepwise regression, 78. 4 % of the variance of the dependent variable was accounted for by the variables of economic, technical, subsidies reform, and policies factors. Therefore, financial incentives such as bank loans with low interest, distribution of technical equipment requirements and supportive legislation can be effective on the development of renewable energy use among other farmers.

40|$|We give a {{criterion}} for bounding the homological finiteness length of certain HF-groups. This {{is used in}} two distinct contexts. Firstly, the homological finiteness length of a non-uniform lattice on a locally finite n-dimensional contractible CW-complex is less than n. In dimension two it solves a conjecture of Farb, Hruska and Thomas. As another corollary, we obtain an upper bound for the homological finiteness length of arithmetic groups over function fields. This gives an easier proof of a result of Bux and Wortman that solved a long-standing conjecture. Secondly, the criterion is applied to integer polynomial points of simple groups over number fields, obtaining bounds established in earlier works of Bux, <b>Mohammadi</b> <b>and</b> Wortman, {{as well as new}} bounds.

30|$|In 1940, Fowler et al. {{discovered}} a new structure of the hydrates, which is formed by tetra-n-butylammonium salts (Fowler et al. 1940). Because in these structures some water lattice sites are replaced by the guest molecules (anions), they are called semi-clathrates. In semi-clathrates formed by tetra-n-butylammonium salts, tetra-n-butylammonium chains occupy the large cages and the small cages remain vacant or partially occupied with water molecules or small gas molecules (Bonamico et al. 1962; Fowler et al. 1940; Hughes 2008; Komarov et al. 2007; Makino et al. 2009; McMullan et al. 1963; Mohammadi et al. 2013, 2014 b). <b>Mohammadi</b> <b>and</b> coworkers have widely investigated the thermodynamic conditions of gas hydrate formation {{in the presence of}} some semi-clathrate formers such as tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF), tetra-n-butylammonium chloride (TBAC), and tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) (Belandria et al. 2011, 2012; Mohammadi et al. 2013, 2014 b; Mohammadi et al. 2012; <b>Mohammadi</b> <b>and</b> Richon 2009). They found that the presence of studied semi-clathrate formers moderates the thermodynamics of gas hydrate formation dramatically (Belandria et al. 2011, 2012; Mohammadi et al. 2013, 2014 b, 2012; <b>Mohammadi</b> <b>and</b> Richon 2009).
