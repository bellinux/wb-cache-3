5000|$|The [...] "optimal {{denomination}} problem" [...] is {{a problem}} for people who design entirely new currencies. It asks what denominations should be chosen for the coins in order to minimize the average cost of <b>making</b> <b>change,</b> that is, the average number of coins needed to make change? The version of this problem assumed that the people <b>making</b> <b>change</b> will use the minimum number of coins (from the denominations available). One variation of this problem assumes that the people <b>making</b> <b>change</b> will use the [...] "greedy algorithm" [...] for <b>making</b> <b>change,</b> even when that requires more than the minimum number of coins. Most current currencies use a 1-2-5 series, but some other set of denominations would require fewer denominations of coins or a smaller average number of coins to make change or both.|$|R

The magazine has since been <b>making</b> <b>changes</b> {{to make it more}} of a general interest music news source, as opposed to solely an industry trade.

Min hired Tony Gervino as the publication's editor, which was different than Billboard's historical appointments, in {{that he did not have}} a background in the music industry. Tony Gervino was appointed editor-in-chief in April 2014. An item on NPR covered a leaked version of Billboards annual survey, which it said had more gossip and focused on less professional topics than prior surveys. For example, it polled readers on a lawsuit pop-star Kesha filed against her producer alleging sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be <b>making</b> <b>changes...</b> so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E
5|$|The match {{followed}} a familiar pattern of Arsenal dictating {{the pace and}} creating chances, but failing to breach the Liverpool defence. Arsenal had a penalty appeal turned down in the first half, when defender Stéphane Henchoz handled the ball to deny Thierry Henry a goalscoring opportunity. Henchoz's partner Sami Hyypiä {{made a series of}} goalline clearances during the second half, but was helpless to stop Arsenal taking the lead in the 72nd minute. Liverpool responded by <b>making</b> <b>changes</b> and equalised in the 83rd minute; Arsenal's failure to deal with a free-kick presented Michael Owen the chance to score. Owen then outpaced Lee Dixon and Tony Adams to score his second and the match winner, two minutes before the end of normal time. Liverpool's victory marked the second part of their unique treble of the 2000–01 season: they had won the League Cup in late February and added the UEFA Cup four days later.|$|E
