40|$|The {{research}} {{was inspired by}} recent reports in the news that Prince George would be attending a <b>Montessori</b> <b>nursery,</b> and to continue my own personal study conducted last year into the Montessori educational approach. It is estimated that there are 700 <b>Montessori</b> <b>nurseries,</b> preschools and <b>schools</b> within the United Kingdom, {{all of which have}} to comply with the requirements set by the Department for Education, in the statutory framework the Early Years Foundation Stage. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} find out the effectiveness of the Montessori educational approach within one UK early years provision. In order to research this question, a review of the literature was undertaken, which included the history of Maria Montessori and other educational pioneers who influenced her studies, how the educational approach has been adapted within the United Kingdom, the training requirements needed to work within a UK Montessori early years setting and how the educational approach incorporates play to comply with the requirements set by the Early Years Foundation Stage. To discover the effectiveness of the Montessori educational approach the staff at one UK Montessori preschool were interviewed, to discover their thoughts and feelings on the educational approach. The data was gathered and analysed thematically, key themes were found around the training, play opportunities and the Early Years Foundation Stage. It was also found that the use of technology supports Montessori practitioners deliver the Montessori educational approach while meeting the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage. Therefore this study concluded that the Montessori educational approach has been adapted in the United Kingdom, to meet the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage. The practitioners are given technology to help assist with delivering the Early Years Foundation Stage, and Montessori practitioners within the United Kingdom are not required to hold an official Montessori qualification...|$|R

40|$|In the {{academic}} {{part of my}} degree project I focused mostly on describing the Montessori system.

In the chapter "Individual scopes of the teaching" I expound the method in practice in kindergartens. In {{order to be able}} to compare the nowadays favoured personality approach towards the child, I first defined its development and nature, and then tried to find connections with the Montessori method. In the end of {{the academic}} part I try to expound individuation in the contemporary nursery school system and individuation in <b>Montessori</b> <b>nursery</b> <b>school.</b> In the practical part I focused on how the individual needs of children in nurseries are fulfilled in the ordinary versus Montessori nursery schools.
