The two kinds of ferrites show different magnetic properties, e. g. coercivity and magnetization. Anomalous Hall effect and positive magnetoresistance have been observed. Our study suggests a ferrimagnet/semiconductor hybrid system for potential applications in <b>magneto-electronics.</b> This hybrid system can be tuned by selecting different transition metal ions (from Mn to Zn) to obtain various magnetic and electronic properties.

40|$|<b>Magneto-electronics</b> is {{certainly}} one of the most rapidly expanding fields in basic research and industrial application. Magnetic multilayers are the key devices in this field; they allow the utilization of unique micromagnetic, magneto-optic, and magneto-electronic phenomena which cannot be realized on the basis of conventional materials. This book provides a detailed and well-balanced introduction to both the underlying physical fundamentals and the technological applications in terms of devices that are just entering the market or are of high industrial relevance for the near future. In particular, the employment of magnetic multilayers in magneto-optical recording, in GMR and spin-valve devices, and as configurations yielding a striking nonlinear magneto-optical response is discussed in a comprehensive way. This state-of-the-art review involves an extensive list of key references to original work and thus makes the vast knowledge already accumulated in the field accessible to the reader...|$|E
40|$|Atomically thin {{graphene}} holds exceptional {{promise to}} enable new functionalities and drastically improve performance of electronic, energy, sensing, and bio-medical devices. One {{of the most}} promising approaches to device-compatible graphene synthesis is chemical vapour deposition on a copper catalyst; this technique however is limited by very high temperatures (∼ 900 °C) and a lack of control as well as post-growth separation from the catalyst. We demonstrate and explain how, {{through the use of a}} plasma, a graphene film containing single layer graphene can be grown at temperature as low as 220 °C, the process can be controlled and an instant and water-mediated decoupling mechanism is realised. Potential use of our films in flexible transparent conductive films, electrical devices and <b>magneto-electronics</b> is demonstrated. Considering the benefits of catalyst reuse, energy efficiency, simplicity, and environmental friendliness, we present this versatile plasma process as a viable alternative to many existing graphene production approaches...|$|E

We report that the Dirac surface states are insensitive to Cr doping, and a perfect robust long-range ferromagnetic order is unveiled in epitaxial Sb 2 -xCrxTe 3 films. The anomalous Hall effect is modulated by applying a bottom gate, contrary to the ferromagnetism in conventional diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs), here the coercivity field is not significantly changed with decreasing carrier density. Carrier-independent ferromagnetism heralds Sb 2 -xCrxTe 3 films as the base candidate TI material to realize the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. These results also indicate the potential of controlling anomalous Hall voltage in future TI-based <b>magneto-electronics</b> and spintronics.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{demonstrated that}} topologically stable magnetic skyrmions {{have the potential}} to provide new solutions for efficient low power, high density data processing and retrieval. Skyrmion diameters can be as small as a few atom spacings, suggesting applications for ultra-high density data encoding and it has also been observed that skyrmions can be easily manipulated using spin-polarised currents five orders of magnitude smaller than those required in conventional <b>magneto-electronics.</b> In this work, we show that nanoscale patterned thin film samples support a new class of stable incomplete and complete skyrmions without need of external fields or anisotropy. We demonstrate hysteretic behaviour of a single skyrmion in disk and square shaped nanostructures, and show that the skyrmion core reverses via Bloch point occurrence and propagation. The ever increasing need for data storage creates great challenges for the development of high-capacity storage devices that are cheap, fast, reliable, and robust. Nowa-days, hard disk drive technology uses magnetic grains pointing up or down to encode binary data (0 or 1) in so-called perpendicular recording media. Current tech...|$|E
30|$|Ni–SiO 2 {{composite}} {{could be}} used from traditional industries from general mechanics, automobiles, paper mills, electrical devices to high-tech industries such as microelectronics, <b>magneto-electronics</b> and nanotechnology, and also for the preparation of high corrosion resistance, good hardness and wear coatings [1, 2, 14]. It {{is well known that}} the major challenges in the co-deposition of SiO 2 particles are the low amount of nanoparticles in the composite, and also the agglomeration of particles suspended in the electroplating solutions due to high surface free energy of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the high ionic strength of the electrolyte and also the high concentration of the inert particles in the electroplating bath increase the tendency of the particles to be agglomerated. Various additives have been studied to reduce the particle agglomeration to increase the volume fraction of the particles in the deposit with good dispersion and improved properties [22, 23]. In general, surface-active additives are used to change the surface characteristics of the particles. According to the literature [14], the addition of accelerants and organic surfactants to an electrolytic bath improves the amount and distribution of the co-deposited particles.|$|E
40|$|The strong {{sensitivity}} of the current flow between two ferromagnetic metals (FM’s) separated by a non-magnetic region to the relative orientation of their magnetization vectors is a fundammental physical phenomenon with a huge impact in the <b>magneto-electronics</b> industry[1]. The quantity characterizing this phenomenon is the so-called magneto-resistance (MR) which {{is defined as the}} difference in resistance between antiparallel (AP) and parallel (P) relative magnetic orientations of the FM’s normalized to the maximal or minimal resistance of the two orientations. Recently a number of groups [2 - 4] have studied MR in break junction systems, where two sections of a Ni wire are connected through an atomicsize contact. In this arrangement the intermediate region connecting the two bulk FM’s has a different geometry but the same chemical composition, in contrast to GMR [5] and TMR [6] systems. Some groups have obtained extremely high values of MR compared to GMR[2] while others obtain moderate or even negative values[3, 4]. Mainly, two different mechanisms have been proposed so far to account for the large values of MR, when observed: Ballistic domain-wall (DW) scattering [7] and magnetostriction[4]. Previous theoretical works present mutually conflicting results with methodologies that either use...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{magnetic}} and electrical characteristics of some nanostructured magnetic thin layers has fundamental importance to understand magnetization dynamics and {{is related to}} applications in <b>magneto-electronics</b> devices. This paper {{is devoted to the}} investigation of Fe-Pt alloy films with the aim to obtain by electrolysis nanostructured films with GMR effect. The Fe-Pt samples were prepared onto polycrystalline Cu substrates using electrodeposition with controlled potential, from a solution containing: K 2 PtCl 6, Fe(NH 4) 2 (SO 4) 2. 6 H 2 O, H 3 BO 3 and NaCl. The samples were characterised by torsion magnetometry, by an induction method, by SEM and EDAX. The studied samples showed uniaxial anisotropy perpendicular to the plane of the film. The nanostructured FexPt 1 -x films, with x ≈ 30 – 38 % and granular morphology exhibit large values of the magnetoresistance (of about 11 % in current perpendicular-to-plane configuration). Such electrodeposited alloys near to stoichiometric concentration FePt 3, are composed from antiferromagnetic clusters in addition to ferromagnetic ones, i. e. a mixed ferro- antiferro-magnetic state. The local concentration fluctuations generated during the film preparation results in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{description of}} electron transport properties through nanoscale systems {{is one of}} the major challenges of contemporary solid state physics. <b>Magneto-electronics,</b> spin-electronics or molecular-electronics are emerging new fields with a great potential for future nano-electronics. In this thesis a new method is established, based on the combination of the embedding green-function method and the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method, to describe the coherent and the sequential electron transport through realistic systems. By use of the density functional theory (DFT) material depended properties of realistic systems can be described on the atomic scale. The FLAPW method is today one of the most reliable and precise numerical methods available for first-principle electronic structure calculations based on the DFT. However, different to standard problems of a periodic solid, the description of electron transport requires the treatment of the scattering problem. This is particularly difficult when described with a plane-wave basis. Thus, a key part of the present thesis is devoted to the development of a new computational scheme which is able to deal with a scattering region sandwiched between two semi-infinite leads. Realizing the ideas put forward by J. Inglesfield, the existing FLEUR code is modified to calculate the single-electron green function for the embedded scattering region. The semi-infinite leads are described in terms of a transfer-matrix formalism which enables one to obtain the so-called complex bandstructure of bulk materials The electron transport is described using either the Landauer model or Bardeen's formalism of tunneling. These two formulas are discussed as two different limits of single-particle transport and their reformulation in terms of quantities readily available from the embedding method is presented. Besides the presentation of the theory and the details of its implementation the thesis describes how the method has been applied to several different test systems to validate the implementation. The spin-dependent transport properties of a Fe/MgO/Fe tunneljunction, the model system of tunnel-magnetoresistance (TMR), were investigated. It is shown that the details of the Fe/MgO interface in this junction is of crucial importance for the tunneling conductance. While the pure relaxation of a Fe/MgO interface already changes the conductance, even more drastic modifications are found as soon as one FeO layer is inserted or if the interface is modified by interchanging the Mg and O atoms.

40|$|Spinel {{structured}} ferrites exhibit remarkable {{properties and}} phenomena, which are attractive for application in sensors and actuators, <b>magneto-electronics,</b> and {{electrochemical energy storage}} devices. Among spinel ferrites, cobalt ferrite CoFe 2 O 4 (CFO) has attracted remarkable attention and widely studied because of their electro-magnetic properties, chemical stability and mechanical hardness. The properties and phenomena of CFO ceramics are dependent on microstructure and chemistry, which in turn depend on the synthesis processes and conditions employed for fabrication. Generally exact chemical composition, processing temperature, reactive or processing atmosphere (if any) and the ions that substitute Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + ions dictate the structure and properties of a Co ferrite. Our recent approach demonstrated that doping with different rare-earth (RE) ions is a straightforward and versatile way to tune the structure and physical properties. However, technological challenges that limit the commercialization of these ceramics are: (1) fabrication with density values equal or approaching to theoretical density, (2) quantitative understanding of the RE ion induced effects, and (3) identifying dopants to enhance the resistivity and temperature stability while retaining the magnetrostrictive ferrite phase, the most important condition to design stress sensors and actuators for automotive and power generation systems. ^ In this work, Gadolinium (Gd) incorporated cobalt ferrites (CoFe 2 -xGdxO 4, referred to CFGO) with variable Gd content (x= 0. 0 - 0. 4) were synthesized by solid state ceramic method. Al/CFGO/Al capacitors were fabricated and tested under {{a wide range of}} frequency (f= 20 Hz – 1 MHz) and temperature (T= 30 - 900 °C). The CFGO ceramics exhibit lattice expansion due to larger Gd-ions. Frequency dependent dielectric measurements at room temperature obey the modified Debye model. The frequency and temperature dependent dielectric constant analyses indicate that pure CFO exhibits two dielectric relaxations in the frequency range of 1 - 10 kHz while Gd substituted CFO compositions exhibit only single relaxation at 1 kHz. Dielectric constant of CFGO ceramics is enhanced compared to pure CoFe 2 O 4 due to the lattice distortion upon Gd incorporation. The tan δ (loss tangent) - T data reveals the typical behavior of relaxation loses. Activation energy of the dielectric relaxation calculated employing Arrhenius equation varies from 0. 564 to 0. 668 (± 0. 003) eV with increasing x values from 0. 0 to 0. 4. Thermally activated small polaron hopping mechanism is evident in temperature dependent electrical properties of CFGO. A two-layer heterogeneous model consisting of moderately conducting grain interior (ferrite-phase) regions separated by insulating grain boundaries (resistive-phase) accurately account for the observed temperature and frequency dependent electrical properties in CFGO ceramics. The results demonstrate that Gd incorporation promotes temperature tolerance, resistivity and performance of CFO to the high end as desired for several industrial applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Zirconium oxide (ZrO 2) is an {{important}} material with a potential {{for a wide range}} of technological applications. The outstanding chemical stability, electrical and mechanical properties, high dielectric constant, and wide band gap of ZrO 2 make it suitable for several industrial applications in the field of optics, electronics, <b>magneto-electronics,</b> and optoelectronics. ZrO 2 is frequently used as a high refractive index material in multilayer optical coatings in high power laser systems. ZrO 2 is employed in super plastic structural ceramics that demonstrate excellent strength and fracture toughness. ZrO 2 has been considered as a promising dielectric to replace SiO 2 in advanced metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices in gate stack. In addition, ZrO 2 exhibits functionality in the ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the properties can be tuned, it can become a useful candidate for all applications in the desired regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, it is well known that the electrical and optical properties of ZrO 2 thin films are highly dependent on the film-substrate interface structure, morphology, and chemistry, which are in turn controlled by the film-fabrication technique, growth conditions, and post-deposition processes. ^ The goal of present work is to grow and demonstrate the high quality of ZrO 2 thin films for application in electronic and optoelectronic devices. The specific objectives of the work are: (1) grow ZrO 2 films under varying growth conditions using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, (2) gain a better understanding of the growth and local structure, interface structure and chemical reactions at the ZrO 2 -Si interface for ZrO 2 films grown on Si (100) substrates, (3) study the material properties and (4) optimize the conditions to produce high quality ZrO 2. In the present work, ZrO 2 thin films have been prepared by the radio-frequency magnetron sputter-deposition onto Si (100) substrates as a function of growth temperature (Ts) varied in a wide range of 30 - 400 °C. ^ The growth behavior, surface structure, morphological features, interface structure, and chemical analysis of surfaces and interfaces have been examined by the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). The crystal structure and interface analysis have been performed using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray reflectivity (XRR). The optical and electrical properties were evaluated by studying the optical absorption and capacitance-voltage measurements, respectively. The results indicate that the effect of Ts on the surface structure, interface layers and morphology of ZrO 2 films is significant. ZrO 2 films grown at 30 °C are nanocrystalline without an interface layer (IL) formation. An increase in Ts results in the improvement in the crystallinity of ZrO 2 films. The grain sizes determined were in the range 5 - 40 nm, where the temperature-dependence is clear. Similarly, it was found that the effect of Ts is significant on the optical band gap and dielectric constant of ZrO 2 films. Efforts are made to explain the quantitative information, obtained based on the electron microscopy results, making use of the existing models to account for growth behavior and interface structure. ...|$|E
