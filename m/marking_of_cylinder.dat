50|$|Diving {{beyond the}} range of {{application}} of a gas mixture. Gas mixtures must be used that are suited to the dive, {{and it must be}} possible to positively identify {{the range of}} application for the mixture in use. Clear labeling of maximum operating depth is the most effective way <b>of</b> <b>marking</b> the <b>cylinder.</b> Opening the cylinder valve only after checking the MOD and testing the regulator is a positive method for ensuring that the correct gas is in use. Restricting END to 100 ft minimises the risk of nitrogen narcosis contributing to poor judgement and reduced efficiency. Stress on the diver can be caused by a large range of factors. It is not possible to eliminate them all, but a large number may be reduced by appropriate training, adequate skills and fitness, the use of suitable equipment in effective configurations, and effective teamwork and communications. In effect, this is the purpose of the DIR system.|$|R

The {{finite element method}} carries out the calculated analysis of traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> necks on tubular preforms in a spherical matrix. Finite shapes of products are defined at traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure. The backpressure usage eliminates fracture of the preform metal at a deforming and heightening <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> necks. Force conditions of the preforms forming, the stress-strain state of metal and exact sizes <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> necks are calculated. Backpressure operation leads to heightening of intensity of strains and a reinforcement of metal after block pressing. The aforesaid ensures reliability of a screw joint of the block pressed articles with other details. The further explorations of block pressing with a backpressure are necessary to lead in a direction <b>of</b> obtaining <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> necks on the hollow articles with a bottom, and also determinations of effect of width of a wall <b>of</b> preform on <b>cylinder</b> necks forming. ?????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ??????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????. ??????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???????. ??????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ????????????????. ?????????? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????, ??????????-??????????????? ????????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ? ????????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??????...|$|R

The air pressure signal in cylinder and vibration signals <b>of</b> <b>cylinder</b> head were measured {{at the same time}} when the diesel engine was driven by the motor. According to port timing, the vibration signal excited by cylinder pressure was separated using time domain analysis.

Moreover for control of that arrangement <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder,</b> usually controlled by 4 / 3 servovalve, the same mount of flows comes in and comes out to each of chambers <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder.</b> Presented paper deal with development of extended form of analytic linear model of single piston rod hydraulic cylinder which respects different action piston areas and volumes inside of chambers <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> and also two different input flows <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder.</b> In extended model are also considered possibilities of different dead volumes in hoses and intake parts <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder.</b> Dead volume has impact on damping <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder.</b> Because the system <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> is generally presented as a integrative system with inertia of second order: eq, we can than obtain time constants and damping <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> for each <b>of</b> analytic form model.
