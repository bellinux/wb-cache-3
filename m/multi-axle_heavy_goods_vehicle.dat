When a <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{is involved in}} a fatal accident, more than 90 % of killed people are in opposite traffic units. For light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> this share is around 60 % and for cars around 20 %. These results suggest that fatalities in counterpart units should also be considered when analysing the meaning of cars and especially <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> for road safety.|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} driver’s {{car following}} headway on multilane highways. The {{aim of this}} study is to analyse the driver’s car following headway along multilane highway at four selected locations. The objectives of this study were to determine car headway at Jalan Batu Pahat – Ayer Hitam multilane highway and to develop linear regression models to present the relationships between headway and speed. Videotaping method was used in field data collection during peak hours. Data were extracted from recorded video by using the image processing technique software. The distance headways and associated vehicles speeds were classified into vehicle following category by vehicle type: car following car, car following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> and <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> following car categories. Linear regressions models were used to develop the relationships between headway and speed. Based on all headway distribution, it is found that patterns of the vehicle headways at four study locations were similar, which shown a significant number of the vehicles travel at headways less than 5 seconds. Furthermore, it can be concluded that many drivers tend to follow the vehicles ahead closely on multilane highways. The regression models were significantly reliable based on their R-square values which are ranging between 0. 80 and 0. 95. From the analysis, cars were found to maintain larger headways when following <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> compare to when following other cars...|$|R

40|$|The SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research investigated: (a) the {{problems}} occurring on Dutch municipal roads that involve <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles; and (b) what measures {{can be taken}} to correct these problems. A survey was conducted among 24 municipalities to accomplish this study. According to the Regional Committees for Road Safety, twelve of these municipalities experienced (or are experiencing) problems with <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The remaining twelve municipalities were selected from the Statistics Netherlands' file of Dutch municipalities by means of a stratified sample. `Obvious' problems mentioned by the municipalities were: (1) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> within, and travelling through, the town centre; (2) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> on major roads inside built-up areas; and (3) inconveniences caused by these vehicles. It is described which measures have already been taken and which ones are being prepared. Only two measures were mentioned by {{more than half of the}} municipalities: (i) concentrating business within industrial sites; and (ii) instituting entry prohibitions for lorries. It is concluded that definitely more attention should be given to measures concerning <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The approach to problems involving these vehicles was based on the principles of the `sustainably safe' concept. Measures recommended for solving these problems were: realising major roads, and creating areas with low vehicle concentrations. (A...|$|R

40|$|Demand {{elasticity}} {{for petrol}} or diesel {{is an important}} policy parameter, both from energy security and global warming perspective. Despite an abundance of literature on petrol demand, there are few studies on diesel demand, and even fewer on demand by different vehicle types. This paper aims to model diesel demand for different freight duty vehicle types (e. g. <b>heavy</b> vs. light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> and rigid vs. articulated trucks) in the UK. We argue that the switch to diesel from petrol engines in the light vehicles sectors could have biased earlier petrol or diesel demand elasticities in Europe, and show that it was indeed {{the case for the}} light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> sector. Results show that both light and <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> have similar income elasticities, although within the heavy duty sector, articulated trucks are more elastic than rigid trucks. Overall, <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were responsive to fuel prices, but light <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> were not. Within the heavy duty sector, rigid trucks showed statistically significant price elasticity, but articulated trucks did not respond to changes in fuel prices. Our results show that price-based policies to curb fuel consumption from the light or <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicles</b> are unlikely to be effective...|$|R
