5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} has both native and {{introduced}} predators. Native predators include the fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), the <b>Madagascar</b> harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), the <b>Madagascar</b> buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the <b>Madagascar</b> ground boa (Boa madagascariensis). Introduced predators include the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), the domestic cat and the domestic dog.|$|E
5|$|Western {{recreational}} activities {{were introduced to}} <b>Madagascar</b> {{over the past two}} centuries. Rugby union is considered the national sport of <b>Madagascar.</b> Soccer is also popular. <b>Madagascar</b> has produced a world champion in pétanque, a French game similar to lawn bowling, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands. School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. <b>Madagascar</b> sent its first competitors to the Olympic Games in 1964 and has also competed in the African Games. Scouting is represented in <b>Madagascar</b> by its own local federation of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other mammals, {{including}} the cat-like fossa, are endemic to <b>Madagascar.</b> Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic. The few families and genera of reptile that have reached <b>Madagascar</b> have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90percent of these being endemic (including one endemic family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's chameleon species, including the smallest known, and researchers have proposed that <b>Madagascar</b> may be the origin of all chameleons.|$|E

Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent <b>Madagascar</b> as deputies (députés) in the French National Assembly. The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill to liberate <b>Madagascar</b> from French rule, but French deputies rejected it.|$|E

5|$|Antananarivo is the {{administrative}} capital and largest city of <b>Madagascar.</b> It {{is located in}} the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga. As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of <b>Madagascar,</b> Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of <b>Madagascar</b> adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of <b>Madagascar</b> after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants. The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Elita was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that made landfall on <b>Madagascar</b> three times. The fifth named storm of the 2003–04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Elita developed in the Mozambique Channel on January 24, 2004. It strengthened to tropical cyclone status before striking northwestern <b>Madagascar</b> on January 28; {{it was the first}} storm to strike western <b>Madagascar</b> at that intensity since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. Elita weakened to tropical depression status while crossing the island, and after exiting into the southwest Indian Ocean, it turned to the west and moved ashore in eastern <b>Madagascar</b> on January 31. After once again crossing the island, the cyclone reached the Mozambique Channel and re-intensified. Elita turned to the southeast to make its final landfall on February 3 along southwestern <b>Madagascar.</b> Two days later, it underwent an extratropical transition; the remnant system moved erratically before dissipating on February 13.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Filao was {{the most}} notable storm of the season, {{originating}} in late February off northern <b>Madagascar.</b> It ultimately struck Mozambique on March1, where it killed about 100people and left $10million in damage (1988USD). In January, both tropical storms Calidera and Doaza crossed <b>Madagascar,</b> the latter of which helped end a drought. Long-lasting Tropical Storm Hely also struck the country in March. The strongest cyclone of the season was Gasitao, which formed {{at the same time}} as Hely and attained peak winds of 150km/h (95mph). The season ended when Tropical Storm Iarisena dissipated northeast of <b>Madagascar</b> in the middle of May.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Kamisy was {{considered}} the worst tropical cyclone to affect northern <b>Madagascar</b> since1911. A tropical disturbance formed near Diego Garcia on April3, 1984 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying into a moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by April9. Kamisy reached winds of 170km/h (105mph) before making landfall in extreme northern <b>Madagascar</b> near Diego Suarez. It weakened upon entering the Mozambique Channel, but briefly re-intensified on April10. That day while passing near Mayotte, the cyclone turned to the southeast, striking <b>Madagascar</b> again near Majunga. Kamisy quickly crossed the country. After emerging into the Indian Ocean off {{the east coast of}} <b>Madagascar,</b> the system reintensified into a moderate tropical storm before dissipating on April16.|$|E
5|$|Damage in <b>Madagascar</b> was {{heaviest}} near Vatomandry, where 85% {{of buildings}} were destroyed and 23people were killed. Manou destroyed about 24,500houses nationwide, leaving 114,480people homeless.

5|$|During the 2000s, {{molecular}} {{studies have}} revealed that the widely distributed African, Eurasian, and Australian genus Miniopterus is much more species-rich than previously thought. In a 1995 contribution to Faune de <b>Madagascar</b> on Malagasy bats, Randolph Peterson and colleagues listed four species of Miniopterus on <b>Madagascar</b> and the nearby Comoros, including the small Miniopterus manavi with a broad distribution on both <b>Madagascar</b> and the Comoros. In 2008 and 2009, however, Steven Goodman and colleagues presented evidence that the former concept of M.manavi in fact encompassed five morphologically and molecularly distinct species of small Miniopterus. These included M.manavi itself in the Central Highlands, M.griveaudi and M.aelleni in the Comoros and northern and western <b>Madagascar,</b> M.brachytragos in northern and western <b>Madagascar</b> only, and M.mahafaliensis in southwestern <b>Madagascar.</b> The five recognized species of M.manavi-like bats are not each other's closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the <b>Madagascar</b> owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis).

Diurnal raptors, such as the <b>Madagascar</b> buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and <b>Madagascar</b> cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the <b>Madagascar</b> harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|E
