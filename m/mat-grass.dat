2500|$|The {{reserve is}} part of the Western Sudetes {{mountains}} stretching from south-central Poland along the northern border of the Czech Republic to eastern Germany. The mountains are located at the watershed dividing the Baltic Sea and North Sea basins. The area is known for its high biodiversity in four altitudinal vegetation belts, from submontane to alpine. The river valleys and lower layers form the sub-montane zone made up of forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). The higher parts form the montane vegetation zone characterized by forested areas of Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). Above [...] is the subalpine zone, which is marked by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo), <b>mat-grass</b> meadows and subarctic highmoors. There are three subapline bogs that support an extensive algal community important for migratory birds and raptors. The alpine vegetation zone, is characterized by large rocky deserts with herbaceous perennials such as Carici (rigidae)-Nardetum and Festucetum supinae.|$|E
50|$|Bavington Crags is {{situated}} within {{an area of}} acid grassland characterised by an abundance of crested dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and <b>mat-grass</b> (Nardus stricta). The dip-slope areas of the site provide a habitat for, unusual to Northumberland, chives (Allium schoenoprasum), hairy stonecrop (Sedum villosum) bristle club-rush (Isolepis setacea), changing forget-me-not (Myosotis discolor), field madder (Sherardia arvensis), and early hair-grass (Aira praecox). Maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides) is found in dry soil on ledges. Wetter areas exhibit <b>mat-grass,</b> carnation sedge (Carex panicea), spring sedge (C. caryophyllea), cuckoo flower (Cardamine pratensis), red fescue (Festuca rubra), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) and lady’s bedstraw (Galium verum).|$|E
50|$|Acid {{grassland}} on {{the site}} is a habitat for <b>mat-grass</b> Nardus stricta, tormentil Potentilla erecta, heath-grass Danthonia decumbens, devil's-bit scabious Succisa pratensis and betony Stachys officinalis, as well as, in wetter areas, glaucous sedge Carex flacca and pepper-saxifrage Silaum silaus.|$|E
5000|$|Dry heath {{and acid}} {{grassland}} is found on peripheral {{areas of the}} plateau, the former supporting heather, wavy hair - grass (Deschampsia flexuosa) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), and with heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) dominating the latter, with <b>mat-grass</b> (Nardus stricta), wavy hair-grass tormentil, (Potentilla erecta) and heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile).|$|E
5000|$|Cryo-oromediterranean zone (Alpine); 2600 to 2800 m elevation. Ligneous {{plants can}} not grow {{here because of}} the {{seasonal}} dryness typical of the Mediterranean climate {{and the presence of}} snow for more than 8 months. The vegetation has similarities to the Arctic tundra, with the <b>Mat-grass</b> (Nardus stricta) as the most common species.|$|E
50|$|The area to {{the north}} of the central {{embankment}} is heathland which supports Purple Moor-grass and <b>Mat-grass.</b> Petty Whin grows in abundance on this site and is the only recorded occurrence in the county. Heather and European Gorse are also present. A range of typical heathland flowers flourish, including Heath Bedstraw, Lousewort, Tormentil and Sneezewort.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} local wetland areas {{strongly}} influenced by limestone characterised by marsh valerian (Valeriana dioica), butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), lesser club-moss (Selaginella selaginoides), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris), dioecious sedge (Carex dioica), few-flowered spike-rush (Eleocharis quinqueflora) and black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans). Dry limestone flora {{are for the most}} part not found on the moors, with the exception of areas of <b>mat-grass</b> (Nardus stricta).|$|E
5000|$|In the subalpine <b>mat-grass</b> grasslands (Aveno-Nardetum plant community) {{are found}} the spring pasqueflower (Pulsatilla vernalis), the alpine pasqueflower (Pulsatilla alpina) and Scheuchzer's bellflower (Campanula scheuchzeri). In the alpine bent sedge grasslands (Caricetum curvulae), there are red-flowered dwarf primula (Primula minima) and sticky {{primrose}} (Primula glutinosa). In the coloured fescue grasslands on the south-facing steep slopes, {{there are the}} villous primula (Primula villosa, [...] "red spike") in the dark blue flowered form endemic to the northern alps. In the Polsterfluren, Wulf's androsace (Androsace wulfeniana), endemic to the eastern alps, and Wulf's houseleek (Sempervivum wulfenii) grow.|$|E
50|$|In the {{northern}} part of the site, areas where the underlying limestone outcrops at the surface, or has been cut into by small streams, are marked by bands of grassland, typically dominated by <b>mat-grass,</b> Nardus stricta, and with herbs such as heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile, and tormentil, Potentilla erecta. Where the limestone soils are thinner, a more species-rich grassland is found: wild thyme, Thymus praecox, and selfheal, Prunella vulgaris, are common, and in some places there are large populations of spring gentian, Gentiana verna, a nationally rare species that is found nowhere else in Great Britain outside the Teesdale area.|$|E
50|$|Above {{the timber}} line at about 1250 to 1350 m is the subalpine {{vegetation}} zone, which {{is marked by}} knee timber, <b>mat-grass</b> meadows and subarctic high moors. This habitat of special importance in the Krkonoše is a relic of Arctic tundra, which was typical in Central Europe during the ice age. At the same time, however, there was {{a connection to the}} alpine grasslands of the Alps, and plant species coexist here which are otherwise separated by several thousand kilometers, such as cloudberries. Some species evolved under the specific conditions of the Krkonoše unlike in the Alps or in the tundra, especially in Śnieżne Kotły. They are endemic, which means they only appear here.|$|E
50|$|The {{summit of}} the Kahler Asten {{is part of a}} {{mountain}} heath. Because many rare and threatened species live there, it has been placed under conservation protection as part of the Kahler Asten nature reserve and Special Area of Conservation (48.69 ha). Hardly any trees grow on the heath, because the vegetation is kept short by sheep grazing. In places, however, natural reforestation has already taken a strong hold because the grazing is insufficient. Through manual intervention using chain saws and strimmers, attempts are being made to stop this reforestation. The vegetation consists mainly of common heather (Calluna vulgaris), <b>mat-grass</b> and subshrubs. Breeding birds on the heath include the meadow pipit and tree pipit. The black grouse used to breed here, but the population died out decades ago.|$|E

40|$|Epigeic spiders were sampled using pitfall traps {{during one}} year in an {{anthropogenic}} open site within the city of Karlsruhe (Alter Flugplatz Karlsruhe). The area, historically used as a military parade ground and airport, is protected as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) within the Natura 2000 network of the EU and since 2010 as a German nature reserve. We {{were interested in the}} diversity, assemblage structure and distribution of spider species within the area and investigated three different plant formations: sparse grass-dominated vegetation with frequent open sand patches (sandy turf), closed grassland dominated by the <b>mat-grass</b> (Nardus stricta) and ruderal vegetation with blackberry bushes. 123 species were identified from these captures, including many specialists of xerothermic habitats and rare and endangered species like Alopecosa striatipes, Agroeca lusatica, Haplodrassus dalmatensi s, Styloctetor romanus, Typhochrestus simoni and Xysticus striatipes as well as extremely rare species of unclassified red list status like Mysmenella jobi, Theonoe minutissima and Zora parallela. The three investigated habitat types were quite similar concerning α-diversity, while measures of β-diversity indicated a strong species turnover. By performing an ecological habitat analysis (using autecological data on spiders) essential differences between the three habitat types could not be discovered, especially not between <b>mat-grass</b> and sandy turf. However, analysing the guild structures showed that different ways of using habitat resources dominated in the different habitat types. For Nardus-grassland several species could be identified as indicator species. While many xero- and photophiles live in the open grassland, the stenotopic psammophiles of inland dunes in the region were not found. The ruderal area houses a mix of grassland- and forest species...|$|E
40|$|By {{collecting}} and analysing plant names linguistically, {{a knowledge of}} popular botany and its relationshipto scientific botany can be obtained. This study has two primary aims: to describe the popular botanical view of the part of thevegetal world represented by grasses and to illustrate the dialectal use of plant names. The material consists of dialectal names for grasses and has been taken chiefly from variousarchives. The area investigated is primarily Sweden, but other parts of Fenno-Scandinavia, chieflyNorway and parts of Finland where Swedish is spoken, have also been included. The plant namesanalysed are either equivalents or synonyms: {{they have the same}} meaning but different geographicalareas of distribution or the same meaning and the same geographical areas of distribution. Three popular "species", each of which represents three different correspondences betweenpopular and scientific botany are described. "Grass with a panicle" illustrates underdifferentiation. A number of grasses are collectivelygiven the same name. The grasses are primarily characterised by their similarity in appearance,but they are also used in the same way, as fodder grasses. "Grass with a panicle" has five namesin Swedish dialects: ven, tåtel, bunk, jägarn and tannar. "Vegetative tillers" exemplifies overdifferentiation. The tillers are only one part of the plant,which means that the popular classification is more differentiated than the scientific one. Thereare probably several reasons for this differentiation: The vegetative tillers are the first to appearin spring, before the culms with panicles. The tillers are grazed, not cut like the flowering stems. The names found in Swedish dialects are rysk, tov and sia. "Mat-grass" represents one-to-one correspondence. The "species" is on the whole identicalwith the scientific species <b>mat-grass.</b> The reason for this identity is the characteristic appearanceof the plant and its hardness. It is difficult to cut. In Swedish dialects <b>mat-grass</b> has five nameswhich are widely spread: stagg, finnskägg, hära, sägg and fnugg. But it also has a great numberof names with a very limited distribution. Because of the special efforts required at harvesttime—mat-grass often bent to the scythe only to rise again soon afterwards—this grass could stirup emotions and hence it has been subject to affective word-formation. The material points to the conclusion that external characteristics of plants may be decisive fortheir classification in popular botany. It is important to note, however, that the use made of aplant is also important in the popular division of "species".   Omslagets illustration producerad av konstnären Eva Skåreus. digitalisering@um...|$|E
40|$|The phytosociological {{database}} as a {{tool for}} synthetic and comprehensive study of semi-natural meadows in the Polish part of the Carpathians is presented. It has been developed in the Institute of Nature Conservation of the Polish Academy of Sciences since 2007. All accessible phytosociological relevés were digitalized and stored in a TURBOVEG database. As of January 2013, 4620 relevés have been collected in the database, chiefly from mesic meadows of Arrhenatherion alliance (76 %) and <b>mat-grass</b> swards of Nardo-Callunetea class (18 %). They were recorded between 1923 and 2012 at an altitude range of 195 – 2000 m above sea level. For improving territorial coverage of the region by vegetation sampling, since 2009 an extensive field survey has been carried out to collect data from previously unexplored areas and record the actual stage of semi-natural grasslands. As a result 1146 recent unpublished relevés were collected. The statistics of available resources, discussion on the data quality and the application prospects of the database are outlined. The database “Grasslands in the Polish Carpathians” is an intrinsic part of the research on the diversity of vegetation in the Polish Carpathian grasslands, as well as a record of the changes it undergoes...|$|E
