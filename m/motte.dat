5|$|<b>Motte</b> was a London {{publisher}} {{who took}} over Benjamin Tooke's publishing business, which printed many of Swift's earlier works. In 1726, Swift sent <b>Motte</b> a copy of Gulliver's Travels to be printed anonymously. <b>Motte</b> took great care to protect {{the identity of the}} author, and employed five publishing houses to speed production of the book and avoid unlicensed copying. In 1727, <b>Motte</b> formed his first direct contract with Swift in order to publish Swift's Miscellanies. As part of the contract, <b>Motte</b> paid Tooke for the original copyright to the work.|$|E
5|$|The bailey was an {{enclosed}} courtyard overlooked by the <b>motte</b> {{and surrounded by}} a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch. The bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular <b>motte,</b> but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain. The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was {{the centre of the}} castle's economic activity. The bailey was linked to the <b>motte</b> either by a flying bridge stretching between the two, or, more popularly in England, by steps cut into the <b>motte.</b> Typically the ditch of the <b>motte</b> and the bailey joined, forming a figure of eight around the castle. Wherever possible, nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.|$|E
5|$|Thetford Castle is {{a medieval}} <b>motte</b> and bailey castle {{in the market}} town of Thetford in the Breckland area of Norfolk, England. The first castle in Thetford, a {{probable}} 11th century Norman ringwork called Red Castle, was replaced in the 12th century by a much larger <b>motte</b> and bailey castle {{on the other side}} of the town. This new castle was largely destroyed in 1173 by Henry II, although the huge <b>motte,</b> the second largest man-made mound in England, remained intact. The <b>motte,</b> recognised as a scheduled monument, now forms part of a local park, and the remains are known variously as Castle Hill, Castle Mound and Military Parade.|$|E
500|$|Newer castle designs placed less {{emphasis}} on <b>mottes.</b> Square Norman keeps built in stone became popular following the first such construction in Langeais in 994. Several were built in England and Wales after the conquest; by 1216 there were around 100 in the country. These massive keeps could be either erected on top of settled, well established <b>mottes,</b> or could have <b>mottes</b> built around them – so-called [...] "buried" [...] keeps. The ability of <b>mottes,</b> especially newly built <b>mottes,</b> to support the heavier stone structures, was limited, and many needed to be built on fresh ground. Concentric castles, relying on several lines of baileys and defensive walls, made increasingly little use of keeps or <b>mottes</b> at all.|$|R

5|$|Clare Castle {{was built}} between the River Stour and the Chilton Stream {{and took the}} form of a <b>motte</b> and bailey design, with two baileys rather than the more common one. The <b>motte</b> is 850 feet (259 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) tall, with its flat summit 63 feet (19 m) across. The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the <b>motte</b> along the north and east, were protected by deep ditches and steep palisades, with either a causeway or a drawbridge linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by the curve of the Chilton.|$|E
5|$|<b>Motte,</b> {{without power}} {{to halt the}} {{introduction}} of Faulkner's work on his own, asked Swift to intervene, but Swift passively refused. Even without the backing of Swift, <b>Motte</b> turned to the English legal system to halt the introduction of Faulkner's edition. <b>Motte</b> issued a Bill of Complaint and sued under the Statute of Anne, claiming that Faulkner's publishing of the 1735 Works infringed on his right to publish works like Gulliver's Travels. The case was heard by the Court of Chancery, and they agreed with <b>Motte</b> in a ruling by Lord Talbot, the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. In the 28 November 1735, it was determined <b>Motte</b> could put forth an injunction to the whole of Swift's works. Although works like the Drapier's Letters were not under Motte's copyright and some works were printed before 1709, Faulkner's complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England.|$|E
5|$|Several {{short-lived}} {{buildings were}} later constructed {{on top of}} the <b>motte.</b> The first of these {{around the turn of the}} 19th century was a banqueting house constructed by Lord Stafford. In 1808 Marquess of Landsdowne built a mansion in a Gothic style {{on top of the}} <b>motte</b> using some of the stone remains of the old keep; it became known as Landsdowne Castle, providing famous views across the town. Landsdowne Castle was pulled down in either 1815 or 1818, and most of the <b>motte</b> was subsequently flattened.|$|E

5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark in the formal grid system. The castle was built in a <b>motte</b> and bailey design and {{was probably}} much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the <b>motte</b> and the inner bailey.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman Conquest of England, William the Conqueror {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Wales. According to the Domesday Survey of 1086, the Norman Robert of Rhuddlan was nominally in command of the whole of northern Wales. He was killed by the Welsh in 1088. His cousin Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester, reasserted Norman control of north Wales by building three castles: one at an unknown location somewhere in Meirionnydd, one at Aberlleiniog on Anglesey, and another at Caernarfon. This early castle was built on a peninsula, bounded by the River Seiont, the Menai Strait; {{it would have been a}} <b>motte</b> and bailey, defended by a timber palisade and earthworks. While the <b>motte,</b> or mound, was integrated into the later Edwardian castle, the location of the original bailey is uncertain, although it may have been to the north-east of the <b>motte.</b> Excavations on top of the <b>motte</b> in 1969 revealed no traces of medieval occupation, suggesting any evidence had been removed. It is likely that the <b>motte</b> was surmounted by a wooden tower known as a keep. The Welsh recaptured Gwynedd in 1115, and Caernarfon Castle came into the possession of the Welsh princes. From contemporary documents written at the castle, it is known that Llywelyn the Great and later Llywelyn ap Gruffudd occasionally stayed at Caernarfon.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the worsening security situation, William conducted his second northern campaign in 1069. He built another castle in York, on what is now Baile Hill {{on the west bank}} of the Ouse opposite the first castle, in an effort to improve his control over the city. This second castle was also a <b>motte</b> and bailey design, with the Baile Hill <b>motte</b> probably reached by a horizontal bridge and steps cut up the side of the <b>motte.</b> Later that year, a Danish Viking fleet sailed up to York along the Humber and the Ouse, and attacked both castles with the assistance of Cospatrick of Northumbria and a number of local rebels. The Normans, attempting to drive the rebels back, set fire to some of the city's houses. The fire grew out of control and also set fire to York Minster and, some argue, the castles as well. The castles were captured and partially dismantled, and Malet was taken hostage by the Danes.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} if Swift allowed Faulkner {{to publish the}} works {{in order to allow}} an Irish publisher to compete against an English publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to <b>Motte</b> in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works but made sure to admonish the attitude and action of <b>Motte</b> as a publisher for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that Faulkner would be allowed to reprint the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes, the first containing the Drapier's Letters, in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition {{led to the}} <b>Motte</b> v Faulkner (1735) lawsuit, since the London bookseller Benjamin <b>Motte</b> had publication rights, under British copyright legislation, {{to many of the}} works included in Faulkner's edition. Although the Drapier's Letters were not under copyright, the complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England by a ruling on 28 November 1735. It is uncertain if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish the works to allow an Irish publisher to compete against a British publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to <b>Motte</b> in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works.

5|$|The current castle, {{built in}} stone {{during the reign}} of King Henry II, is on the same site as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. A keep used to stand on the <b>motte</b> which is on the south west of the site, {{although}} most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period. In the 17th century the <b>motte</b> was landscaped {{with the addition of a}} path. The bailey was incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.|$|E

5000|$|In 1735 an Irish publisher, George Faulkner, {{printed a}} set of Swift's works, Volume III of which was Gulliver's Travels. As {{revealed}} in Faulkner's [...] "Advertisement to the Reader", Faulkner had access to an annotated copy of <b>Motte's</b> work by [...] "a friend of the author" [...] (generally believed to be Swift's friend Charles Ford) which reproduced most of the manuscript without <b>Motte's</b> amendments, the original manuscript having been destroyed. It is also believed that Swift at least reviewed proofs of Faulkner's edition before printing, but this cannot be proved. Generally, this {{is regarded as the}} Editio Princeps of Gulliver's Travels with one small exception. This edition had an added piece by Swift, A letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson, which complained of <b>Motte's</b> alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that [...] "I do hardly know mine own work" [...] and repudiating all of <b>Motte's</b> changes as well as all the keys, libels, parodies, second parts and continuations that had appeared in the intervening years. This letter now forms part of many standard texts.|$|R

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War, Bedford sided with Parliament; the town was temporarily captured by Prince Rupert of the Rhine in 1643 and the castle was refortified {{for the duration of the}} war. A probable wooden fort and prison were built on the remains of the <b>motte</b> and defended by a hundred-man garrison. After the war the <b>motte</b> became used as a bowling green until the 19th century. In 1804 the north-east tower of the castle was turned into a hexagonal building for the local militia unit. Bedford began to spread eastwards in the late 19th century and the castle baileys became desirable property for housing; in 1851 the last parts of the barbican were destroyed to make way for the construction of cottages.|$|E
