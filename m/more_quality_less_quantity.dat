5000|$|Iqbal Suhail {{believes}} trading lesser quality foodstuffs {{for better}} <b>quality</b> and <b>less</b> <b>quantity</b> was forbidden because the frugality and austerity of Muhammad was offended by {{something like the}} spending resources on higher quality foodstuffs [...] "for the sake of gratification of the palate."Others believe riba al-fadl makes little sense as a prohibited sin but does {{as a sort of}} consumer advice. Mohammed Fadel (of the faculty of law, University of Toronto) calls it a ‘prudential regulation’. Farooq suggest it may have arisen to warn Muslims that barter is usually less profitable than buying and selling separately, and notes several hadith where Muhammad tells a Muslim not to trade dates of different quality but never mentions riba. [...] Khan argues that the prohibition against riba al-fadl comes not from any clear understanding of the ahadith but from an attempt to find a plausible explanation [...] "to rationalize the ambiguity in the text".|$|R

In this paper, multiobjective optimization of logic circuits based on a fnzzified Ant Colony (ACO) algorithm is presented. The results obtained using the proposed algorithm are compared to those obtained using SIS in terms of area, delay and power for some known circuits. It is shown that the circuits produced by the proposed algorithm are better as compared to those obtained by SIS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHeating, {{ventilation}} and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems {{account for}} more the 50 % of energy use in residential buildings [1] and approximately three-quarter in healthcare environments [2]. Hence, HVAC systems are a favorable sector for sustainability with a great potential of energy savings. The engineering approach to this issue {{has led to the}} advent of newer and more sustainable technologies. Dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) are a case in point. By decoupling the sensible and latent loads, an enormous saving can be achieved in the amount of air to be conditioned. Ventilation systems are designed to satisfy three predominant requirements: (1) to deliver fresh air to occupants and dilute the indoor generated contaminants, (2) to control the temperature and humidity in indoor spaces, and (3) to pressurize the space. There is ample evidence that the DOAS facilitates the last two requirements with <b>more</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>less</b> cost, which makes it more sustainable. This work, however, focused on the effect of using this system on the first requirement, particularly with regard to the indoor generated contaminants. The results showed that compared to the traditional ventilation systems, the DOAS system less effectively treats the indoor generated contaminants. Therefore, other mechanisms such as filtration must be properly implemented to limit the contaminants level below their standard threshold...|$|R

At a general level we {{have contributed to the}} basic framework within evolutionary biology and ecology and at a more specific level, as the proximate mechanisms controlling the associations between immune response, parasite intensities and traits indicative of sperm quality are not straightforward, we examined the effect of increased immunological activity on sperm traits. Our results have established the significance of male social status, and in the two inter-disciplinary studies, showed that parasitized and infected males seem to invest <b>more</b> in sperm <b>quality,</b> <b>less</b> in ornamental development and adapt to sperm competition (i. e., subordinate mating tactic). Thus, as reproductive decisions in charr seem to be strongly influenced by parasites and antigens, host parasite co-evolution may have been a significant mechanism in the maintenance and evolution of both male sexual behaviour and ornamentation...|$|R

40|$|Inclusive Business’ has {{enormous}} potential to contribute positively to development outcomes. Working through core business models, the ‘Inclusive Business’ approach requires minimal outside support and can often reach a scale unattainable by most direct development interventions. Take for example, Vodafone’s M-PESA service, which has reached more than 18. 5 million individuals since 2007 {{and continues to}} be a profitable business model (BCtA 2011). But when is business ‘inclusive’ and when is it simply business? How does Coca-Cola’s business model in El Salvador contribute more to women’s empowerment than its typical approach to selling fizzy drinks? Accurate information about business impacts—direct and indirect, positive and negative—can help practitioners to better identify (and support) the approaches that can most positively contribute to development. This paper analyses some of the current approaches and frameworks for evaluating ‘Inclusive Business’ impacts. It finds that while they shed light on the complex network of effects that businesses have {{and the ways in which}} some firms are attempting to contribute to development, they are unable to provide information about the actual impacts of business activities. <b>More,</b> higher <b>quality,</b> and <b>less</b> partial ‘Inclusive Business’ evaluations are needed to better enable us harness the potential for business to contribute positively to development...|$|R

Therefore ICTD estimation should be adopted in BCC schemes for improving the overall quality considering image width. It is clear from Figure 7 that the scheme without ICTD has the lowest scores and the average value is 2.3, whereas the BCC scheme with DFT-based or NDFT-based ICTD estimation has an advantage over it. Moreover, the NDFT-based scheme yields higher scores than the DFT-based scheme except for the excerpt sample 4. It is from the right part of Figure 7 that the average score for the DFT-based scheme and NDFT-based scheme are 3.6 and 4.1, respectively. Obviously, NDFT-based scheme {{is better than the}} DFT-based scheme, and it is the best choice in terms of the audio quality and image width.|$|R

40|$|Respiratory viruses {{are among}} the most {{important}} causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially for infants and young children. In the past years, a few commercial multiplex RT-PCR assays have been used to detect respiratory viruses in spite of the high cost. In the present study, an improved single-tube multiplex reverse transcription PCR assay for simultaneous detection of 13 respiratory viruses was evaluated and compared with a previously reported two-tube assay as the reference method using clinical nasopharyngeal aspirates samples. Of 310 prospectively tested respiratory specimens selected from children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness, 226 (72. 90 %, 226 / 310) and 214 (69. 03 %, 214 / 310) positive for one or more viruses were identified by the single-tube and the two-tube assays, respectively, with combined test results showing good concordance (Kappa value = 0. 874). Individually, the single-tube assay for adenovirus (Adv), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV 1), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV 3) and parainfluenza virus type 4 (PIV 4) showed the significantly superior sensitivities to those of the two-tube assay. No false positives were found. In conclusion, our results demonstrates the one-tube assay revealed significant improvements over the two-tube assay in terms of the better sensitivity, <b>more</b> accurate <b>quality</b> control, <b>less</b> nonspecific amplification, more cost-effective and shorter turn-around time and will be a valuable tool for routine surveillance of respiratory virus infection in China...|$|R

40|$|Up to now, few {{analytical}} {{models have}} studied the incentives for cooperation in quality improvements among hospitals. Only those dealing with reimbursement systems have shown that, {{from the point of}} view of individual or competing hospitals, retrospective reimbursement is more likely to encourage quality improvements than prospective financing, while the reverse holds for efficiency improvements. This paper studies the incentives to improve the quality of hospital care, in an analytical model, taking into account the possibility of cooperative agreements, price besides non-price (quality) competition and quality improvements that may simultaneously increase demand, increase or reduce costs and spill over to rival hospitals. In this setting quality improvement efforts rise with the rate of prospective reimbursement, while the impact of the rate of retrospective reimbursement is ambiguous, but likely to be negative for quality improvements that are highly cost-reducting and create large spillovers. Cooperation may lead to <b>more</b> or <b>less</b> <b>quality</b> improvement than non-cooperative conduct, depending on the magnitude of spillovers and the degree of product market competition, relative to the net effect of quality on profits and the share of costs that is reimbursed retrospectively. Finally, the stability of cooperative agreements, supported by grim trigger strategies, is shown to depend upon exactly the opposite interaction between these factors. status: publishe...|$|R
