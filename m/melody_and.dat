5|$|A {{homophonic}} texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts have the same rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of homophony. The {{most common type of}} homophony is melody-dominated homophony, in which one voice, often the highest, plays a distinct <b>melody,</b> <b>and</b> the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony.|$|E
5|$|The final song on each disc {{is written}} {{in the form of}} a sonnet, {{depicting}} the relationship of man with each of the particular elements. Each of these songs is in iambic pentameter, with a concluding rhyming couplet. These final couplets also contain the same vocal <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> chord progression as each other, although they are in different keys.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{theme is}} {{repeated}} throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's {{position in the}} song; {{it is unclear whether}} the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Aided by {{additional}} Silurian and Judoon forces, the Doctor and {{his allies}} secure the base, find Amy, and reclaim Melody before Kovarian can flee with the child. The Doctor celebrates his victory, but finds Kovarian had been scanning <b>Melody</b> <b>and</b> found traces of Time Lord DNA; the Doctor speculates that Melody had been conceived while Amy and Rory were in transit on the TARDIS. The Doctor provides an old Gallifreyan cot for Melody, claiming it was his own.|$|E
5|$|As most {{explicitly}} {{noted by}} the first quatrain, the poem was originally intended to be sung. Indeed, as noted by Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> verse. However, due to the oral tradition of the time, the original melody of the song was not notated and {{over the course of}} time was forgotten.|$|E

The album was co-written with Markus Popp, of the pioneering German glitch group Oval, who contributed to the electronic aspects of the album.|$|R

5|$|Avril {{talked about}} her life and what things were {{important}} to her – she was {{the inspiration for the}} song :-) :-). Matthew began creating the <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying in bed for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
5|$|Benchley's return yielded {{two more}} short films, and his {{high-profile}} prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows, {{including the first}} television entertainment program ever broadcast, an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on the Empire State Building. The radio program, <b>Melody</b> <b>and</b> Madness, was more a showcase for Benchley's acting, as he {{did not participate in}} writing it. It was not well received, and was removed from the schedule.|$|E

Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> lyrics.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Singapore {{attained}} self-government and the City Council was dissolved. The Government {{felt that}} a national anthem was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. The Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye selected the City Council's song as it was already popular. At Toh's request, Zubir modified the lyrics and <b>melody,</b> <b>and</b> the revised song {{was adopted by the}} Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959. On 30 November, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of these national emblems.|$|E
5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} opinion {{has been}} kinder {{than that of}} Bizet's day. Commentators describe {{the quality of the}} music as uneven and at times unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet's gifts for <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Melodies,</b> Rhythm <b>and</b> Cognition in Foreign Language Learning is a {{collection}} of essays reflecting on the relationship between language and music, two unique, innate human capacities. This book provides a clear explanation of the centrality of <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> rhythm to foreign language learning acquisition. The interplay between language music brings to applied linguists inquiries into the nature and function of speech melodies, the role of prosody and the descriptions of rhythmical patterns in verbal behaviour. Musical students seem to be better equipped for language learning, although <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> rhythm can benefit all types of students at any age. In fact, in this book <b>melodies</b> <b>and</b> rhythm are considered to be a springboard for the enhancement of the learning of foreign languages...|$|R

5|$|My Bloody Valentine are an Irish {{rock band}} formed in Dublin in 1983. Since 1987, the band's lineup has {{consisted}} of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar) and Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums), with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). Their work {{is known for}} integrating experimental guitar techniques, ethereal <b>melody,</b> <b>and</b> unorthodox production approaches, resulting in their pioneering a musical style known as shoegazing during the late 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{described}} the heroic past of Lithuania and exhorted its people {{to care for}} the land, care for humanity, and live in honor. Kudirka also urged the country to become a source of enlightenment and virtue. Without a melody, Kudirka took the time to compose the music just before dying of tuberculosis. Both the <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> the lyrics were printed in Varpas in September 1898. Upon his death in 1899, Kudirka's tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem (later destroyed by the authorities).|$|E
5|$|While at university, Taborn toured and {{recorded}} with jazz saxophonist James Carter. Taborn {{went on to}} play with numerous other musicians in electronic and acoustic settings, while also building {{a reputation as a}} solo pianist. He has a range of styles, and often adapts his playing {{to the nature of the}} instrument and the sounds that he can make it produce. His improvising, particularly for solo piano, often adopts a modular approach, in which he begins with small units of <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> rhythm and then develops them into larger forms and structures.|$|E

5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E
5|$|But Melody's {{love of the}} sea proves {{too strong}} and she visits Morgana, who turns her into a mermaid temporarily. King Triton uses his trident to {{transform}} Ariel back into her own mermaid form to find and rescue Melody. Morgana tricks Melody into {{taking part in a}} plot to steal her grandfather King Triton's trident. Together with Tip the Penguin and Dash the Walrus she goes to Atlantica and succeeds in acquiring the trident. Ariel arrives as they return with it to Morgana, and tries to persuade Melody to give back the trident. Morgana captures Ariel, tightly wrapping her tentacle around Ariel's mouth and body. She then seals Melody behind a block wall. Tip and Dash rescue <b>Melody</b> <b>and</b> Ariel manages to free themselves. Morgana then uses the trident's magic to force everyone to bow before her.|$|E
5|$|Fresh off {{spending}} {{the previous year}} touring the world with U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas. To this end, West incorporated the synthesizer into his hip-hop production, utilized slower tempos, and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980s. In addition to U2, West drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin in terms of <b>melody</b> <b>and</b> chord progression. To make his next effort, the third in a planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums, more introspective and personal in lyricism, West listened to folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his wordplay and storytelling ability.|$|E
