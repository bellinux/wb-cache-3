5|$|The adrenal <b>medulla</b> is at {{the centre}} of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by the adrenal cortex. The chromaffin cells of the <b>medulla</b> are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the <b>medulla.</b> Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|The adrenal <b>medulla</b> {{is driven}} by the {{sympathetic}} nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal <b>medulla</b> can be considered as a specialized sympathetic ganglion. Unlike other sympathetic ganglia, however, the adrenal <b>medulla</b> lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} the molecular {{mechanisms by which}} catecholamine synthesis is controlled in pheochromocytomas – tumors that synthesize and release catecholamines, which are related to various clinical manifestations of the condition. Methods: We measured the concentrations of mRNA coding for the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine b-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT) and for the catecholamine contents in 12 pheochromocytomas and 12 normal adrenal <b>medullas.</b> Results: The mean content of total catecholamine and the b-actin mRNA expression in the pheochromocytomas were almost {{the same as those}} in the normal adrenal <b>medullas.</b> However, the tyrosine hydroxylase, AADC and DBH mRNA concentrations in the pheochromocytomas were greater than those of the normal adrenal <b>medullas.</b> Conversely, the PNMT mRNA concentration in the pheochromocytomas was lower than that in the normal adrenal <b>medullas.</b> These differences are responsible for the difference in the proportions of catecholamines between pheochromocytomas and normal adrenal <b>medullas.</b> The constitutive expression of the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme mRNAs varied in magnitude among the pheochromocytomas, and the tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expressions correlated with the contents of total catecholamine in the tumors (r= 0. 964, P< 0. 0001). Conclusions: These findings indicate that catecholamine production in pheochromocytomas is pri-marily controlled by the level of gene expression. European Journal of Endocrinology 138 383 – 38...|$|R
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal <b>medulla,</b> which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the <b>medulla</b> is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the <b>medulla</b> is derived from the neural crest, which is of ectodermal origin.|$|E

5|$|It is {{connected}} to the midbrain of the brainstem by the superior cerebellar peduncles, to the pons by the middle cerebellar peduncles, and to the <b>medulla</b> by the inferior cerebellar peduncles. The cerebellum consists of an inner <b>medulla</b> of white matter and an outer cortex of richly folded grey matter. The cerebellum's anterior and posterior lobes appear {{to play a role in}} the coordination and smoothing of complex motor movements, and the flocculonodular lobe in the maintenance of balance although debate exists as to its cognitive, behavioral and motor functions.|$|E
5|$|The adrenal <b>medulla</b> {{is derived}} from neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal <b>medulla</b> and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal <b>medulla</b> are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
40|$|Daily urinary {{excretion}} of catechol amines {{in normal}} rats and in rats {{from which the}} adrenal <b>medullae</b> had been removed has been determined by a photofluorimetric method. In both groups, reserpine (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produces: (1) A decrease in the urinary excretion of noradrenaline which persists for more than 3 weeks; this action is not influenced by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and mecamylamine. (2) An increase, within 20 to 68 hr, in the urinary excretion of adrenaline, even though the urine of rats without adrenal <b>medullae</b> does not usually contain adrenaline. These effects are prevented by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and, in the normal animals, are reduced by mecamylamine. In both groups, dexamphetamine (6 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produces {{an increase in the}} excretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline, the adrenaline appearing in the urine of the rats without adrenal <b>medullae</b> within 20 to 44 hr. Mecamylamine prevents the effect of dexamphetamine on the excretion of noradrenaline. Dexamphetamine, administered within a week of reserpine treatment, produces its usual effects on the urinary excretion of catechol amines in normal rats, but has no effect in rats without adrenal <b>medullae.</b> The results are discussed with regard to both the mechanism by which reserpine and dexamphetamine influence the peripheral stores of adrenaline and noradrenaline, and the significance of the adrenal and extra-adrenal chromaffin system...|$|R
40|$|The {{localization}} and {{characterization of}} carbohydrates in adrenal medullary cells were studied by histochemical and cytochemical methods. Adrenaline (A) -and noradrenaline (N) -storing granules were argentaphobic when ultrathin sections of Araldite-embedded <b>medullae</b> were stained {{according to the}} periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate technique of Thiery. A small amount of glycogen {{in the form of}} single beta-particles as well as lysosomes were, however, visualized by this technique. The entire core of the A granules was markedly positive after ultrathin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed, glycol methacrylate (GMA) -embedded <b>medullae</b> were stained with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) at low pH (0. 3). The N granules, in contrast, were mostly unreactive. In the A cells, PTA stained {{a large part of the}} Golgi complex, whereas in the N cells the Golgi complex was mostly unstained. In both cell types, the cell coat, lysosomes, and multivesticular bodies reacted to PTA. The periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) technique showed A but not N granules in semithin sections of GMA- or Araldite-embedded <b>medullae.</b> The PTA and PAS stains were abolished by acetylation, restored by saponification, unchanged by methylation, and greatly diminished by sulfation. In ultrathin sections of GMA- or Araldite- embedded <b>medullae</b> incubated with colloidal iron according to various techniques, the cell coat and lysosomes of both cell types were stained, unlike all the other cytoplasmic organelles. These results indicate that A granules and the Golgi complex of A cells, unlike the same structures in N cells, are rich in glycoproteins which are probably not acidic...|$|R
40|$|Many humans with IDDM {{eventually}} {{lose the}} capacity to secrete epinephrine from their adrenal <b>medullae.</b> The mechanism for this pathological change is unknown. We hypothesized that this abnormality is attributable to neuropathic changes in the greater splanchnic nerves or in the chromaffin cells that they innervate. To study this hypothesis, we isolated rat adrenal glands, perfused them ex vivo, and measured the epinephrine content of the perfusate under various conditions of stimulation. We used transmural electrical stimulation (20 - 80 V, at 10 Hz) to induce epinephrine secretion indirectly by selectively activating residual splanchnic nerve terminals within the isolated glands. Under these conditions, epinephrine secretion was severely attenuated in glands from female BB-Wistar rats with diabetes of 4 mo duration compared with their age-matched, nondiabetic controls. These perfused diabetic adrenal <b>medullae</b> also demonstrated decreased catecholamine release in response to direct chromaffin cell depolarization with 20 mM K+, evidence that a functional alteration exists within the chromaffin cells themselves. Nonetheless, total catecholamine content of adrenal <b>medullae</b> from these diabetic rats was {{not significantly different from}} controls, indicating that the secretory defect was not simply attributable to a difference in the amount of catecholamines stored and available for release. Herein, we also provide histological evidence of degenerative changes within the cholinergic nerve terminals that innervate these glands...|$|R
5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the <b>medulla)</b> through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the <b>medulla</b> oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E

5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the <b>medulla.</b> They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the <b>medulla</b> to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the <b>medulla</b> and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Halimeda is an {{important}} reef-building green alga. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy spectrum tests on green and white Halimeda collected from Shidao Island in the Xisha Islands show that carbonate is predominantly deposited in the cortexes and <b>medullas,</b> especially in the aragonite raphides of them, as the case of calcium carbonate. These modern carbonate sediments are then compared with their ancient counterparts that are collected from Xichen- 1 well in the Yongle Atoll, where {{a large number of}} Halimeda segments have been recognized in about 100 -m-long late Miocene-middle Miocene whole-coring succession. In addition, there are developed great numbers of algal-frame holes, including secondary dissolved pores and intercrystalline pores in the <b>medullas</b> and in aragonites between cysts, which have formed particular network systems and pore throats...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of neuropeptide gene expression {{has been investigated}} by using rat adrenal <b>medullae</b> grown in explant culture. After 3 days in culture the (now denervated) explants exhibited a 10 -fold increase in leucine-enkephalin (leu-EK) content. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide completely blocked the rise, whereas inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D or alpha-amanitin inhibited the increase by 50 %. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with 1 -beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytosine arabinoside) had no discernible effect. To determine whether the rise in leu-EK was associated {{with an increase in}} specific mRNA coding for the opiate peptide precursor, blot hybridization analysis was performed. A single species of preproenkephalin mRNA was detected after various culture periods. The amount of mRNA increased 34 -fold after 2 days in culture and 74 -fold after 4 days. Consequently, the rise in mRNA levels preceded the increase in the amount of leu-EK. Depolarization of the adrenal <b>medullae</b> with either elevated potassium or veratridine, which prevents leu-EK accumulation, inhibited the increase in the amount of preproenkephalin mRNA. Moreover, the effect of veratridine was blocked by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that transmembrane sodium ion influx affects the increase in the amount of message. Our studies suggest that elevation of leu-EK in explanted (denervated) <b>medullae</b> is associated with increased amounts of mRNA coding for the peptide precursor and that these processes can be regulated by depolarization...|$|R

5|$|Blood {{pressure}} {{and heart rate}} {{are influenced by the}} vasomotor centre of the <b>medulla,</b> which causes arteries and veins to be somewhat constricted at rest. It does this by influencing the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems via the vagus nerve. Information about blood pressure is generated by baroreceptors in aortic bodies in the aortic arch, and passed to the brain along the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve. Information about the pressure changes in the carotid sinus comes from carotid bodies located near the carotid artery and this is passed via a nerve joining with the glossopharyngeal nerve. This information travels up to the solitary nucleus in the <b>medulla.</b> Signals from here influence the vasomotor centre to adjust vein and artery constriction accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system.

40|$|Stimulation of nociceptors by {{intradermal}} capsaicin produces {{depression of}} bradykinin (BK) -induced synovial plasma extravasation (PE) that is markedly enhanced by subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. This depression is {{mediated by the}} adrenal <b>medullae,</b> a propriospinal pathway between the afferent nociceptive input and preganglionic neurones projecting to the adrenal <b>medullae,</b> and a spino-bulbo-spinal pathway. Here we investigated the role of spinal ascending and descending pathways in the interaction between noxious and vagal afferent inputs, leading to inhibition of BK-induced PE mediated by the adrenal <b>medullae.</b> Nociceptors in the paw were activated by capsaicin and depression of BK-induced PE was measured in rats with intact or cut subdiaphragmatic vagus nerves. After cutting the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) contralateral to the stimulated hindpaw (segmental level C 5 /C 6 and T 8 /T 9), depression of BK-induced PE was weak or absent both in rats with intact vagus nerves and in vagotomised rats, suggesting that an ascending excitatory pathway was interrupted. After cutting the DLF ipsilateral to the stimulated hindpaw, depression of BK-induced PE was already markedly enhanced, {{even in the absence}} of vagotomy. Ipsilateral DLF lesion (L 2 /L 3) below the level of the spinal output to the adrenal <b>medullae</b> produced the same effect, suggesting interruption of a descending inhibitory pathway that relays the effect of vagal activity to the level of the capsaicin-induced nociceptive input. Contralateral and ipsilateral hemisection of the spinal cord (C 5 /C 6) produced the same changes as the corresponding DLF lesions. Ipsi- or contralateral lesion of the dorsal funiculus at the spinal level T 8 /T 9 had no effect on depression of BK-induced PE generated by cutaneous noxious stimulation of the forepaw. We suggest that noxious stimulation activates an ascending pathway of the spino-bulbo-spinal excitatory circuit which projects through the DLF contralateral to the nociceptive input, and that the inhibitory pathway which is activated by vagal afferent activity projects through the DLF ipsilateral to the nociceptive input...|$|R
40|$|The {{localization}} of the type- 2 angiotensin II receptor (AT 2) in the {{adrenal glands}} of rats, guinea pigs, bovines, and humans was examined at the mRNA and protein levels.

5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the <b>medulla</b> and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less clear function. In the <b>medulla</b> a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the <b>medulla,</b> the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E
