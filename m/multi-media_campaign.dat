40|$|The poststructuralist turn {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} in contemporary applied and sociolinguistics (Rampton 2006, Blommaert 2010). While for many this paradigmatic shift has been a welcome challenge to segregationalist approaches (Mühlhäusler 1996, Makoni and Pennycook 2007) and deficit discourses in relation to multilingualism (Jacquemet 2005, Jaffe 2007), {{it is not an}} unproblematic concept for minority language media and language sustainability. For those committed to activism and engagement with policy makers, the current paradigmatic shift, which has been described in terms of a performance era for minority language media (Pietikäinen and Kelly-Holmes 2011), presents particular challenges which have the potential to undermine gains made in previous eras in relation to media rights for minority language speakers.

40|$|MBA thesis - WBSThe {{cornerstone}} {{of a successful}} energy efficiency strategy is strong and unequivocal government support, through the promulgation of appropriate legislation that accurately locates energy efficiency within an integrated energy strategy. Energy legislation that accurately captures {{the true cost of}} energy in the pricing thereof, is yet another important lessons to be learnt from countries that have had a measure of success in implementing energy efficiency. The legislation must also bring into existence the energy efficiency agency - the key ingredient of a successful energy efficiency strategy. Lack of consumer awareness in South Africa, about the social, environmental and financial benefits of energy efficiency, as well as the long-term cost of energy, need to be prioritised, and addressed through a comprehensive <b>multi-media</b> <b>campaign</b> reaching both rural and metropolitan energy consumers.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{survey of}} Western Australia's general practitioners' (GPs') {{knowledge}} and practices relating to genital chlamydia infection {{was conducted in}} mid- 2005, prior to a <b>multi-media</b> <b>campaign</b> which encouraged 15 – 24 year olds to seek chlamydia testing through their general practitioner (GP). The survey aimed to raise GPs' awareness of chlamydia {{in preparation for the}} campaign and to establish a baseline measure of their chlamydia-related knowledge and practices. Methods All 2038 GPs registered on the Australian Medical Publishing Company's database as practising in Western Australia were sent a survey which covered clinical features of chlamydia, investigations, treatment and public health issues; 576 (29 %) responded. Results Most GPs were aware of chlamydia being common in the 20 – 24 year old age group, but less than half were aware that it is common in 15 – 19 year olds. GPs missed many opportunities for chlamydia testing in patients likely to be at risk of STIs, largely because they thought the patient would be embarrassed. It is of concern that public health responsibilities in relation to chlamydia, ie notification and contact tracing, were not undertaken by all GPs. Conclusion Australia is currently piloting chlamydia screening. For this to be successful, GPs will need to maintain current knowledge and clinical suspicion about chlamydia, and be comfortable in asking and receiving information about sexual behaviours. Only then will GPs {{have a significant impact on}} curbing Australia's ever-increasing rates of chlamydia. </p...|$|E
