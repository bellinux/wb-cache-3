25|$|On modern ploughs {{and some}} older ploughs, the <b>mouldboard</b> is {{separate}} from the share and runner, so these parts can be replaced without replacing the <b>mouldboard.</b> Abrasion eventually destroys all parts of a plough that {{come into contact with}} the soil.|$|E
25|$|The basic plough, with coulter, ploughshare and <b>mouldboard,</b> {{remained}} in {{use for a}} millennium. Major changes in design did not become common until the Age of Enlightenment, when there was rapid progress in design. Joseph Foljambe in Rotherham, England, in 1730 used new shapes {{as the basis for}} the Rotherham plough, which also covered the <b>mouldboard</b> with iron. Unlike the heavy plough, the Rotherham (or Rotherham swing) plough consisted entirely of the coulter, <b>mouldboard</b> and handles. It was much lighter than conventional designs and became very popular in England. It may have been the first plough to be widely built in factories and the first to be commercially successful.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mouldboard</b> plough {{greatly reduced}} {{the amount of}} time needed to prepare a field, and as a consequence, allowed a farmer to work a larger area of land. In addition, the {{resulting}} pattern of low (under the <b>mouldboard)</b> and high (beside it) ridges in the soil forms water channels, allowing the soil to drain. In areas where snow buildup causes difficulties, this lets farmers plant the soil earlier, as the snow runoff drains away more quickly.|$|E
25|$|Improvements on this {{followed}} {{developments in}} metallurgy: steel coulters and shares with softer iron <b>mouldboards</b> to prevent breakage, the chilled plough (an early example of surface-hardened steel), and eventually <b>mouldboards</b> with faces {{strong enough to}} dispense with the coulter.|$|R

25|$|The {{manufacture}} {{of the four}} suits took four or five months. Two stolen circular saws and iron tacks were tried and found not to be bulletproof. <b>Mouldboards</b> for plough shares were ultimately adopted. It was likely that the first suit made was defective, and was therefore discarded.|$|R
25|$|To grow crops {{regularly}} in less-fertile areas, the soil must be turned to bring nutrients to the surface. A major advance {{for this type}} of farming was the turnplough, also known as the <b>mouldboard</b> plough (UK), moldboard plow (US), or frame-plough. A coulter (or skeith) could be added to cut vertically into the ground just ahead of the share (in front of the frog), a wedge-shaped cutting edge at the bottom front of the <b>mouldboard</b> with the landside of the frame supporting the undershare (below-ground component).|$|E
25|$|Share, landside, <b>mouldboard</b> are {{bolted to}} the frog which is an {{irregular}} piece of cast iron. The base of a plough body is called the frog and the soil wearing parts are bolted to it.|$|E
25|$|Before the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220), Chinese ploughs {{were made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood, except the iron blade of the ploughshare. By the Han period, the entire ploughshare was made of cast iron; these are the first known heavy <b>mouldboard</b> iron ploughs.|$|E
50|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} reversible ploughs, {{mounted on a}} tractor via a three-point linkage. These commonly have between two {{and as many as}} seven <b>mouldboards</b> - and semi-mounted ploughs (the lifting of which is supplemented by a wheel about halfway along their length) can have as many as eighteen <b>mouldboards.</b> The hydraulic system of the tractor is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth. The ploughman still has to set the draughting linkage from the tractor so that the plough is carried at the proper angle in the soil. This angle and depth can be controlled automatically by modern tractors. As a complement to the rear plough a two or three mouldboards-plough can be mounted {{on the front of the}} tractor if it is equipped with front three-point linkage.|$|R
25|$|A {{ridging plough}} {{is used for}} crops, such as {{potatoes}} or scallions, which are grown buried in ridges of soil using a technique called ridging or hilling. A ridging plough has two <b>mouldboards</b> facing away from each other, cutting a deep furrow on each pass, with high ridges either side. The same plough {{may be used to}} split the ridges to harvest the crop.|$|R
60|$|In the meanwhile, Witham sat swaying on the driving-seat, {{mechanically}} {{guiding the}} horses and noticing how the prairie sod rolled away in black waves beneath the great plough. He heard the crackle of fibres beneath the triple shares, and the swish of greasy loam along the <b>mouldboard's</b> side; but his thoughts were far away, and when he raised his head, {{he looked into the}} dim future beyond the long furrow that cut the skyline on the rise.|$|R
25|$|The {{reversible}} plough has two <b>mouldboard</b> ploughs mounted back-to-back, one {{turning to the}} right, {{the other to the}} left. While one is working the land, the other is carried upside-down in the air. At the end of each row, the paired ploughs are turned over, so the other can be used. This returns along the next furrow, again working the field in a consistent direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{turnwrest plough}} allows {{ploughing}} {{to be done}} to either side. The <b>mouldboard</b> is removable, turning to the right for one furrow, then being moved {{to the other side of}} the plough to turn to the left (the coulter and ploughshare are fixed). In this way adjacent furrows can be ploughed in opposite directions, allowing ploughing to proceed continuously along the field and thus avoiding the ridge and furrow topography.|$|E
25|$|An {{advance on}} the basic design was the iron ploughshare, a {{replaceable}} horizontal cutting surface mounted {{on the tip of}} the share. The earliest ploughs with a detachable and replaceable share date from around 1000 BC in the Ancient Near East, and the earliest iron ploughshares from ca. 500 BC in China. Early mouldboards were basically wedges that sat inside the cut formed by the coulter, turning over the soil to the side. The ploughshare spread the cut horizontally below the surface, so when the <b>mouldboard</b> lifted it, a wider area of soil was turned over. Mouldboards are known in Britain from the late 6th century on.|$|E
25|$|These ploughs {{date back}} to the days of the steam engine and the horse. In almost {{universal}} use on farms, they have right- and left-handed <b>mouldboards</b> enabling them to work up and down the same furrow. Reversible ploughs may either be mounted or semi-mounted and are heavier and more expensive than right-handed models, but they have the great advantage of leaving a level surface which makes seedbed preparation and harvesting easier. Very little marking out is necessary before ploughing can start and idle running on the headland is minimal compared with conventional ploughs.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that different types of tillage implements have a different impact on soil translocation. Tillage experiment descriptions in the bibliography are usually incomplete in their description of the implements and the experimental tillage conditions, which makes some difference if one wants to compare different experiments through time and space. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a diagnostic of the problem, showing the importance of describing the implements and at the same time to present a proposal for a standard description of <b>mouldboards,</b> disc harrows and cultivators that should be taken into account when tillage experiments are carried out...|$|R
25|$|Early steel ploughs, {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking ploughs, directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} plough. The steel ploughs were so much easier to draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or clods was no longer necessary, as the plough could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was not long after that the first riding ploughs appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier ploughs the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to riding ploughs with multiple <b>mouldboards,</b> dramatically increasing ploughing performance.|$|R
25|$|The Romans {{achieved}} the heavy wheeled <b>mouldboard</b> plough {{in the late}} 3rd and 4th century AD, when archaeological evidence appears, inter alia, in Roman Britain. The first indisputable appearance after the Roman period is from 643, in a northern Italian document. Old words connected with the heavy plough and its use appear in Slavic, suggesting possible early use in this region. The general adoption of the carruca heavy plough in Europe appears to have accompanied {{the adoption of the}} three-field system in the later eighth and early ninth centuries, leading to an improvement of the agricultural productivity per unit of land in northern Europe. This was accompanied by larger fields as well, known variously as carucates, ploughlands, and ploughgates.|$|E
25|$|Driving {{the tractor}} with the furrow-side wheels in the furrow bottom {{provides}} the most efficient line of draft between tractor and plough. It is also easier to steer the tractor and driving with the front wheel against the furrow wall will keep the front furrow at the correct width. This is less satisfactory when using a tractor with very wide front tyres, for although they make better use of the tractor power, the tyres may compact part of the last furrow slice turned on the previous run. The use of furrow widener or a longer <b>mouldboard</b> on the rear body will overcome the problem. The latter moves the soil further towards the ploughed land leaving more room for the tractor wheels on the next run.|$|E
25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the <b>mouldboard</b> plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E

25|$|The {{chisel plough}} {{is a common}} tool to get deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main {{function}} of this plough is to loosen and aerate the soils while leaving crop residue {{at the top of}} the soil. This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan. Unlike many other ploughs the chisel will not invert or turn the soil. This characteristic has made it a useful addition to no-till and low-till farming practices that attempt to maximise the erosion-prevention benefits of keeping organic matter and farming residues present on the soil surface through the year. Because of these attributes, the use of a chisel plough is considered by some to be more sustainable than other types of plough, such as the <b>mouldboard</b> plough.|$|E
25|$|When {{dragged through}} a field the coulter cuts {{down into the}} soil and the share cuts {{horizontally}} from the previous furrow to the vertical cut. This releases a rectangular strip of sod that is then lifted by the share and carried by the <b>mouldboard</b> up and over, so that the strip of sod (slice of the topsoil) that is being cut lifts and rolls over as the plough moves forward, dropping {{back to the ground}} upside down into the furrow and onto the turned soil from the previous run down the field. Each gap in the ground where the soil has been lifted and moved across (usually to the right) is called a furrow. The sod that has been lifted from it rests at about a 45 degree angle in the next-door furrow and lies up the back of the sod from the previous run.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} two-field system, a three-field system allows for {{significantly}} more land to be put under cultivation. Even more important, the system allows for two harvests a year, reducing the risk that a single crop failure will lead to famine. Three-field agriculture creates a surplus of oats {{that can be used}} to feed horses. Because the system required a major rearrangement of real estate and of the social order, it took until the 11th century before it came into general use. The heavy wheeled plough was introduced in the late 10th century. It required greater animal power and promoted the use of teams of oxen. Illuminated manuscripts depict two-wheeled ploughs with both a <b>mouldboard,</b> or curved metal ploughshare, and a coulter, a vertical blade in front of the ploughshare. The Romans had used light, wheel-less ploughs with flat iron shares that often proved unequal to the heavy soils of northern Europe.|$|E

50|$|Simple {{ballistic}} armor was sometimes constructed by criminals. During the 1880s, {{a gang of}} Australian bushrangers led by Ned Kelly made basic armour from plough blades. By this time the Victorian Government had a reward for the capture {{of a member of}} the Kelly Gang at £8,000 (equivalent to 2 million Australian dollars in 2005). One of the stated aims of Kelly was the establishment of a Republic in North East Victoria. Each of the four Kelly gang members had fought a siege at a hotel clad in suits of armour made from the <b>mouldboards</b> of ploughs. The maker's stamp (Lennon Number 2 Type) was found inside several of the plates. The armour covered the mens' torsos, upper arms, and upper legs, and was worn with a helmet. The suits were roughly made on a creek bed using a makeshift forge and a stringy-bark log as a muffled anvil. The suits had a mass of around 44 kg (96 lb), making the wearer a spectacular sight, but greatly hampering movement. In a police raid at Glenrowan, the Kelly Gang armour deflected many hits with none penetrating, but eventually was of no use as the suits lacked protection for the legs and hands.|$|R
500|$|Before the sod blocks were cut, {{the grass}} was mown short or burned off. [...] At times, the surface was scored with a cutter or disc; the blocks could then be removed with a spade. [...] This approach, however, tended to produce rough and {{non-uniform}} blocks, which complicated the task of laying them in even courses. [...] Blocks could also be cut with a plow. [...] An ordinary plow could be used, given considerable skill and care {{on the part of}} the operator; however, the <b>mouldboard</b> tended to turn over and break up the blocks; even if intact blocks were produced, they were generally not of uniform thickness. [...] In the late 19th century, a modified plow designed specifically for sod cutting was invented: this [...] "grasshopper plow" [...] replaced the <b>mouldboard</b> with a set of adjustable rods, which allowed the operator to cut a uniform strip of sod three to six inches (...) deep and [...] wide. [...] This strip could then be cut into blocks. [...] The dimensions of these depended, among other things, on the strength of the builderthe blocks were dense, and had to be sized so that the builders could lift them. [...] Typical blocks cut with a grasshopper plow might measure four inches (...) deep by [...] wide by [...] long.|$|E
500|$|By [...] 900, {{developments}} in iron smelting allowed for increased production in Europe, leading to {{developments in}} the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs, hand tools and horse shoes. The carruca heavy plough improved on the earlier scratch plough, with the adoption of the Chinese <b>mouldboard</b> plough to turn over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of northern European forests and an increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population. At the same time, some farmers in Europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations permitted nitrogen-fixing legumes such as peas, lentils and beans. Improved horse harnesses and the whippletree further improved cultivation.|$|E
500|$|The Romans {{had used}} a two-field crop {{rotation}} agricultural system, but from the 8th century on, a three-field system became more common. [...] One field would be sown with a winter crop, the second with a spring crop, and the third left fallow. [...] This allowed a greater amount of spring crop of oats to be grown, which provided fodder for horses. Another advance during the Middle Ages was {{the development of the}} heavy <b>mouldboard</b> plough, which allowed dense and heavy soils to be tilled easily; this technology required the use of larger teams of draught animals including oxen and horses, as well as the adoption of larger fields. [...] Particularly after the 12th century, the increased use of both the horse collar and [...] use of iron horse shoes allowed horsepower to be directed more efficiently. Horse teams usually were four horses, or perhaps six, as compared to eight oxen, and the lesser numbers compensated {{for the fact that the}} horses needed to be fed grain on top of pasture, unlike oxen. The increased speed of horses also allowed more land to be ploughed in a day, with an eight ox plough team averaging half of an acre per day, but a horse team averaged a full acre per day.|$|E
2500|$|... (In addition, slatted mouldboards are {{preferred}} by some farmers, {{though they are}} a less common type. They consist {{of a number of}} curved steel slats bolted to the frog {{along the length of the}} <b>mouldboard,</b> so that there are gaps between the slats. They tend to break up the soil more than a full <b>mouldboard</b> and improve soil movement across the <b>mouldboard</b> when working in sticky soils where the solid <b>mouldboard</b> does not scour well.) ...|$|E
2500|$|A runner {{extending}} {{from behind the}} share {{to the rear of}} the plough controls the direction of the plough, because it is held against the bottom land-side corner of the new furrow being formed. The holding force is the weight of the sod, as it is raised and rotated, on the curved surface of the <b>mouldboard.</b> Because of this runner, the <b>mouldboard</b> plough is harder to turn around than the scratch plough, and its introduction brought about a change in the shape of fields– from mostly square fields into longer rectangular [...] "strips" [...] (hence the introduction of the furlong).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>mouldboard</b> is {{that part}} of the plough which {{receives}} the furrow slice from the share. The <b>mouldboard</b> is responsible for lifting and turning the furrow slice and sometimes for shattering it, {{depending on the type of}} moldboard, plowing depth, and soil conditions. The intensity of this action depends on the type of the moldboard. [...] To suit different soil conditions and crop requirements, mouldboards have been designed in different shapes, each producing its own furrow profile and surface finish, but they still basically conform to the original plough body classification. Traditionally, the various types of plough body have been classified as general purpose, digger, and semi-digger, as described below.|$|E
