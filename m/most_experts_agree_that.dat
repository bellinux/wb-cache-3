25|$|Platinum coins are {{a popular}} investment, {{and each year}} {{the number of such}} coins sold by Sberbank of Russia {{increases}} by 30–50%. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> such investments should have a long-term character, as the rise of the platinum price is relatively slow– about 80% over the last 5 years, except for a rapid rise followed by decline in 2008. Also, whereas most banks can sell platinum coins, only a few buy them, as this requires evaluation by an experienced professional. For example, only 5% of offices of Sberbank (the major bank of Russia) in the capital city of Moscow redeem precious metal coins. The selling price is also much affected by visible scratches, spots, patina, and other defects introduced by bad handling. For this reason, most bullion coins are sealed in transparent plastic right after removal from the press. They are then stored in a dry room with relative humidity below 80% and at temperatures between 15 and 40°C. If a coin is removed from its plastic seal, it is recommended not to store it in PVC albums, as PVC molecules gradually break down, releasing organochlorine compounds which produce patina on the coins. These compounds may also form acids by reacting with moisture. Unlike silver, platinum does not corrode. However, as is true for all unprotected coins, platinum coins are prone to contamination which can be caused even by washing with (chlorine-containing) tap water.|$|E

50|$|Mayorga {{started the}} fight by almost falling Trinidad with a jab. A famous {{part of this}} round sees Mayorga drop his hands {{sticking}} his chin in the air daring the vicious puncher Trinidad to try his best. Trinidad threw three left hooks and Mayorga simply did a mocking dance to taunt Trinidad. In round two, Trinidad and Mayorga traded power punches evenly, with <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>that</b> Trinidad landed {{with a little more}} power.|$|R
50|$|The {{great loss}} of weight is {{to some extent}} {{accounted}} for by the fact that Voorzanger discovered several flaws, one especially big, that he found it necessary to cut away. Although Prince Albert was dissatisfied with such a huge reduction, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Voorzanger had made the right decision and carried out his job with impeccable skill. When Queen Victoria showed the re-cut diamond to the young Maharaja Duleep Singh, the Koh-i-Noor's last non-British owner, he was apparently unable to speak for several minutes afterwards.|$|R
500|$|The {{destruction}} of Hood spurred a relentless pursuit by the Royal Navy involving dozens of warships. Two days later, heading for occupied France to effect repairs, Bismarck {{was attacked by}} 16 obsolescent Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier one scored a hit that rendered the battleship's steering gear inoperable. In her final battle the following morning, the already-crippled Bismarck was severely damaged during a sustained engagement with two British battleships and two heavy cruisers, [...] was scuttled by her crew, and sank with heavy loss of life. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the battle damage would have caused her to sink eventually. The wreck was located in June 1989 by Robert Ballard, and has since been further surveyed by several other expeditions.|$|E
500|$|The {{aquarium}} {{should be}} decorated {{to mimic the}} natural environment and include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> a pair of convicts {{should be kept in}} a 20-gallon aquarium or larger. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species also consumes aquatic plants so plastic plants or robust plants such as java fern are recommended. [...] Convict cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone. Brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the species' tendency to dig, external filtration is superior to undergravel filter systems. Its relatively small size, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care.|$|E
2500|$|In the AD year {{numbering}} system, whether {{applied to}} the Julian or Gregorian calendars, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year [...] "0" [...] between them. Because of this, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> a new century begins in a year which has [...] "01" [...] as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This {{is at odds with}} the much more common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the worldwide celebration of the new millennium took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.|$|E
2500|$|The 49ers had handily {{beaten the}} Bengals in a December game played in Cincinnati and {{consequently}} were installed as a 2-point favorite. That said, going into Super Bowl XVI, <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> both teams were very evenly matched, but many thought Pete Johnson's rushing ability {{could prove to}} be the difference. Some also pointed out that Ken Anderson was an established 11-year veteran who had just finished the best season of his career, while the young Montana was only just starting to emerge as a top-notch quarterback. [...] Furthermore, Anderson had advanced through the playoffs without throwing a single interception, while Montana had been intercepted 4 times, 3 of them occurring in the NFC title game.|$|R

2500|$|By {{analogy with}} {{the health of the}} body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or mental health.

25|$|While <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> a torpedo had exploded, they {{differed}} on {{what caused}} the explosion. Many Russians {{did not believe that}} Kursk could be so easily sunk. The tragedy spawned a number of wild conspiracy theories to explain the disaster. One theory offered was an explosion located in the high-pressure air tanks used to blow the ballast tanks, located near the torpedo tubes. Mainstream publications like Der Spiegel, Berliner Zeitung, and the Sunday Times claimed to possess documentation proving that the submarine was struck by a missile fired by Pyotr Velikiy. This was the largest naval exercise that the Russian navy had conducted in more than a decade, which increased the chances of a friendly fire incident. Other theories included Chechen espionage, human error, sabotage, and that Kursk was testing a new top-secret torpedo, Shkval (Squall), capable of speeds in excess of , for which the Western navies have no defence. Another theory was that USS Memphis had fired a torpedo at Kursk.|$|R

50|$|A 2002 {{survey of}} two {{movement}} disorder experts, two neuropsychiatrists, and two rehabilitation experts {{did not seem}} to shed any light on the matter of differentiating aboulia from other DDMs. The experts used the terms apathy and aboulia interchangeably and debated whether or not aboulia was a discrete entity, or just a hazy gray area on a spectrum of more defined disorders. Four of the experts said aboulia was a sign and a symptom, and the group was split on {{whether or not it was}} a syndrome. Another survey, which consisted of true and false questions about what aboulia is distinct from, whether it is a sign, symptom, or syndrome, where lesions are present in cases of aboulia, what diseases are commonly associated with aboulia, and what current treatments are used for aboulia, was sent to 15 neurologists and 10 psychiatrists. <b>Most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> aboulia is clinically distinct from depression, akinetic mutism, and alexithymia. However, only 32% believed aboulia was different from apathy, while 44% said they were not different, and 24% were unsure. Yet again, there was disagreement about whether or not aboulia is a sign, symptom, or syndrome.|$|R

Its stability and reliability has a great effect on national economy and welfare of citizens. Electric-power industry in Russia experienced many reforms but some of the fundamental problems have not been solved and the level of its efficiency is still questionable. Nowadays <b>most</b> <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> Russia and the whole world are on the threshold of energy crisis that is why one of the priorities of economic policy should be energy efficiency which is a way of reducing the consumption of energy resources by enterprises and households. These actions should be taken due to the necessity of reducing negative impact on the environment associated with consuming of energy resources and waste products of enterprises and increasing requirements for energy efficiency in today’s world. At present it’s rather hard to analyze electricity sector in Russia. Statistics from different official sources do not correspond with each other. Sometimes it is hard or even impossible to differentiate electric power from heat energy among all resources. All these facts and many other circumstances make the analysis of electric energy market very difficult. To increase the efficiency of electric-power industry in Russia several problems must be solved, among them environmental protection issues related to reduction of electricity producing in cost. Thus it will help us to prevent possible negative technological, socioeconomic and ecological consequences of certain operations. This article considers fundamental problems of electric-power industry in Russia, their possible solutions, and development strategy of this industry to 2035...|$|R
