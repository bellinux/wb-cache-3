However, most current research works on centralized scheduling for WiMAX <b>mesh</b> <b>networks</b> {{are based on}} a unidirectional concurrent scheme, i. e., transmissions of uplinks and downlinks are considered separately.

We propose a packet scheduling problem to formulate centralized scheduling in WiMAX <b>mesh</b> <b>networks</b> with bidirectional concurrent transmission, and make simulations to verify the effect of it with various scheduling algorithms.

We also prove that the minimum-latency multicasting problem in multi-channel wireless <b>mesh</b> <b>networks</b> is NP-hard.
