25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as <b>motor-operated</b> control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of DC motors tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E
25|$|A {{spindle motor}} {{in the drive}} rotates the {{magnetic}} medium at a certain speed, while a stepper <b>motor-operated</b> mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along {{the surface of the}} disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5¼") or disk insertion was complete (3½"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the floppy disk controller, which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.|$|E

5000|$|Searchlight signals {{were the}} most often used signal type in the U.S. until recently, {{although}} these have become less popular due to vandalism. In these, a single incandescent light bulb is used in each head, and either an A.C. or D.C. relay mechanism is used to move a coloured spectacle (or [...] "roundel") {{in front of the}} lamp. In this manner, gravity (fail safe) returns the red roundel into the lamp's optical path.

An elliptical reflector focuses the lamp through the roundel, a small lens and then a larger single or compound lensing arrangement is employed.

Such high-throughput proteomic approaches require automation of all post-separation steps and the in-gel digest of proteins especially {{is often the}} bottleneck in the protein identification workflow. With the objective of reaching the same high performance of manual low-throughput in-gel digest procedures, we have developed a novel stack-type digestion device and implemented it into a commercially available robotic liquid handling system. This modified system is capable of performing in-gel digest, extraction of proteolytic peptides, and subsequent sample preparation for MALDI-MS without any manual intervention, but with a performance at least identical to manual procedures as indicated {{on the basis of}} the sequence coverage obtained by peptide mass fingerprinting.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{deals with}} a new <b>motor-operated</b> valves (MOVs) {{condition}} monitoring method.

The successful implementation of motor current signature analysis (MCSA) as a diagnostic for valves led to its application to other devices and to refinements in the methodologies used. Motor current and power analysis have been found to provide information that is complementary to that available from conventional diagnostics, such as vibration and pressure pulsation analysis. Inherent signal filtering associated with rotor to stator magnetic field coupling does limit the high frequency response capability of the motor as a transducer; as a result, certain phenomena, such as pump or fan vane pass energy, is not readily apparent in the motor electrical signals.

The evalua-tion of the operating experience with French 900 MWe plants seems to reveal, for MOV of one system, a trend similar to some international findings about ageing-related events with increasing operating time; this trend will have to be confirmed. For the German NPPs so far, there appears to be no significant increase of ageing-related events concerning MOV as the plants get older. Future work on ageing scheduled at IPSN and GRS includes further co-operation on this issue, too; a deep analysis is necessary to explain the reasons of such apparent differences before any conclusion...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} Stage 2 of the Regulatory Instrument Review are {{presented}} in this volume. Selected regulatory instruments, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Regulatory Guides, and ASME Codes, were investigated {{to determine the extent}} to which these regulations apply aging management to selected safety-related components in nuclear power plants. The Regulatory Instrument Review was funded by the NRC under the Nuclear Plant Aging Research (NPAR) program. Stage 2 of the review focused on four safety-related structures and components; namely, cables, containment and basemat, reactor coolant pumps, and <b>motor-operated</b> valves. The review suggests that the primary-emphasis of the regulatory instruments was on the design, construction, start-up, and operation of a nuclear power plant, and that aging issues were primarily addressed after an aging-related problem was recognized. This Stage 2 review confirms the results of the prior review; (see Regulatory Instrument Review: Management of Aging of LWR Major Safety-Related Components NUREG/CR- 5490. The observations indicate that the regulations generally address management of age-related degradation indirectly. Specific age-related degradation phenomena frequently are dealt with in bulletins and notices or through generic issues, letters, etc. The major recommendation of this report, therefore, is that the regulatory instruments should more directly and explicitly address the aging phenomenon and the management of the age-related degradation process...|$|E
