5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>observers</b> took a {{moderate}} tone in their reaction, acknowledging that funding {{should be provided}} for further national missile defense tests, but also saying that the US should not rush into developing technology that might prove ineffective and too costly.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{order in}} which the French lined up as they exited the bay is also uncertain. Larrabee notes that <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> wrote up {{different}} sequences when the line was finally formed, and that Bougainville recorded several different configurations.|$|E
5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this surprising {{turn of events}} defused the situation, but to <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> the scene on the balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance. However pleased {{it may have been}} by the royal displays, the crowd insisted that the king come back with them to Paris.|$|E
40|$|The debate {{surrounding}} {{the current status}} of monetary policy and future inflation has, to varying degrees (depending on the speaker and the date), appealed to the existence of an output gap that will prevent the resurgence of substantial inflation even with a federal funds interest rate that <b>many</b> <b>observer...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to <b>many</b> <b>observers,</b> {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev {{was perhaps the}} best defenceman in the tournament {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, were not on the ice for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The BBRC {{conducted}} a detailed review into the controversial {{identification of a}} curlew seen at Druridge Bay in Northumberland in 1998, coming {{to the conclusion that}} it was, as had been believed by <b>many</b> <b>observers,</b> a first-summer slender-billed curlew. This identification was accepted by the British Ornithologists Union's Records Committee, leading to the addition of this species to the British List. The record is currently being reviewed again by BBRC to establish whether this earlier decision should be upheld.|$|E
5|$|The vote, to be {{administered}} by the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET), was originally scheduled for 8 August but later postponed until 30 August. Indonesia also took responsibility for security; this arrangement caused worry in East Timor, but <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> believe that Indonesia would have refused to allow foreign peacekeepers during the vote.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising <b>many</b> <b>observers.</b> His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular {{with members of the}} Klan, who felt that he had embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E
50|$|Volpe {{remained}} one of Martin's {{most prominent}} Toronto-area supporters after 1990. <b>Many</b> political <b>observers</b> believe this association {{kept him out}} of cabinet during Chrétien's tenure as prime minister, from 1993 to 2003.|$|R
50|$|In Georgia's 10th congressional district, the Club's PAC {{endorsed}} incumbent Paul Broun who defeated {{state representative}} Barry Fleming 71% to 29% in the July 15, 2008, primary election. Broun's victory surprised <b>many</b> political <b>observers.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1921–22, the {{prominent}} Tribune Tower competition {{was held to}} design a new headquarters for the Chicago Tribune, a major US metropolitan newspaper. It attracted 260 entries. First place was awarded to a design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood, a neo-Gothic building completed in 1925. Saarinen was awarded $20,000 for second place; his design was never constructed. <b>Many</b> <b>observers</b> felt that Saarinen's simplified yet soaring setback tower was the most appropriate entry, and his novel modernist design influenced many subsequent architectural projects.|$|E
5|$|Libya's prompt retreat took <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> by surprise. One reason lay in Gaddafi's {{desire to}} host the OAU's annual conference in 1982 and assume the organization's presidency. Another was Libya's {{difficult}} situation in Chad where, without some popular and international acceptance for Libyan presence, {{it would have been}} difficult to take the concrete risk of causing a war with Egypt and Sudan, with US support. Gaddafi had not renounced the goals he had set for Chad, but he had to find a new Chadian leader, as Goukouni had proved himself unreliable.|$|E
5|$|The only quagga to {{have been}} photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five {{photographs}} of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed {{that this is an}} optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. Embryological evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.|$|E

50|$|The Court's {{obscenity}} jurisprudence {{would remain}} fragmented until 1973's Miller v. California. <b>Many</b> legal <b>observers</b> feel that after Miller, it remained confusing and vague. What is obscene {{in one place}} can be completely legal in another.|$|R
25|$|Moreover, Pakistan {{had lost}} more ground {{than it had}} gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of {{capturing}} Kashmir; this result has been viewed by <b>many</b> impartial <b>observers</b> as a defeat for Pakistan.|$|R
5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> {{believed}} that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game in a small room backstage, {{out of sight of the}} spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E
5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> {{to be well}} handled, despite a {{previous}} belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 season, Reutemann {{took the}} first three {{victories}} of his Formula One career, and Brabham's first since 1970. The team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship, fielding the much more competitive BT44s. After a strong finish to the 1974 season, <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> felt the team were favourites to win the 1975 title. The year started well, with a first win for Brazilian driver Carlos Pace at the Interlagos circuit in his native São Paulo. However, as the season progressed, tyre wear frequently slowed the cars in races. Pace took another two podiums and finished sixth in the championship; while Reutemann had five podium finishes, including a dominant win in the 1975 German Grand Prix, and {{finished third in the}} Drivers' Championship. The team likewise ranked third in the Constructors' Championship {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> {{baseball}} <b>observers</b> expected Chesbro {{to return}} to form in 1906. That season, Chesbro registered a 23–17 record while leading the AL in earned runs allowed. He was removed from his starts sixteen times, {{the most in the}} AL.|$|R
50|$|However, in 1977, O'Sullivan {{surprised}} <b>many</b> political <b>observers</b> when {{he announced}} that he was leaving politics to enter the Roman Catholic priesthood, eventually becoming Director of Vocations for the Archdiocese of Toronto, as well as publisher of The Catholic Register newspaper.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Niyazov {{announced}} {{that his country}} would downgrade its links with the Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose alliance of post-Soviet states; he furthermore promised {{free and fair elections}} by 2010 in a move that surprised <b>many</b> Western <b>observers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The 2004–05 {{lock-out}} {{ensured that}} several players {{who would otherwise}} have been playing in the NHL, including Getzlaf, were available to return to the national team for the 2005 World Junior Championship. One of 12 players with previous experience at the tournament for Canada, Getzlaf was a leading player for what <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> have called the greatest team in the tournament's history. With 12 points in 6 games, Getzlaf finished second in overall scoring to teammate Patrice Bergeron's 13. He scored one goal and added two assists in the championship game against Russia as the Canadians won the gold medal by a 6–1 score; it was the nation's first title in eight years at the event.|$|E
5|$|When Antoine was alive, <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> {{thought that}} the healings he {{obtained}} resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by <b>many</b> <b>observers</b> as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E
50|$|<b>Many</b> other <b>observers,</b> {{including}} Human Rights Watch military experts, {{reported seeing}} white phosphorus air bursts over Gaza City and the Jabalya refugee camp. The BBC published {{a photograph of}} two shells exploding over a densely populated area on 11 January.|$|R
