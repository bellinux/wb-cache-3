5|$|As a maximum-security prison, it hosts {{dangerous}} {{as well as}} highly dangerous criminals, such as rapists, murderers, and child molesters. They compose half of the population, while {{a third of the}} residents are drug offenders. Sex offenders, who may face violence from other inmates, and prisoners who require close psychiatric or <b>medical</b> <b>supervision,</b> are located in Unit A, a restrictive and separated area. There is also a special unit (C8) focused on addiction recovery. Most inmates live in Units B and C, which are freer and have mixed cell blocks. Halden Prison receives both domestic and international criminals; as only around three-fifths of the prisoners are Norwegians (as of 2015), both Norwegian and English are used, and the prison has English teachers. However, fluency in Norwegian is a requirement to live in C8, because group and individual counseling is conducted in Norwegian.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As medical {{sciences}} have progressed and new medicines discovered, {{the use of}} {{more precise}} and optimal methods of injecting medicinal fluids and more specifically injection in longer time spans has become evident. Peristaltic pump is used in almost all <b>medical</b> <b>supervisions</b> which require precision application of medicines more common in hospitals, elderly housings, clinics and private home patient care taking. This pump {{may be used for}} slow liquid medicine injections for the purpose of pain reduction in a wide spectrum of inpatient treatments as well as for tube feeding in patients incapable of eating solid foods. Due to the vital importance of peristaltic pump applications in medical institutions and in respect to previous design efforts done on this machine, the objective of this research is designing multipurpose model of it and preparing necessary plans for its industrial manufacturing using interaction design. In order to obtain the hospital nurses opinions as target population about the application and desired characteristics of a peristaltic pump, a survey research method (questionnaire, personal interview and observation) are applied. Finally, proposed plan for a novel product consists of a pump body taking into consideration the functional; ergonomics as well as aesthetics aspects are represented...|$|R
