40|$|AbstractInformation {{about the}} size of spatial regions is often easily {{accessible}} and, when combined with other types of spatial information, it can be practically very useful. In this paper we introduce four classes of qualitative and <b>metric</b> <b>size</b> constraints, and we study their integration with the Region Connection Calculus RCC- 8, a well-known approach to qualitative spatial reasoning with topological relations. We propose a new path-consistency algorithm for combining RCC- 8 relations and qualitative size relations. The algorithm is complete for deciding satisfiability of an input set of topological constraints over one of the three maximal tractable subclasses of RCC- 8 containing all the basic relations. Moreover, its time complexity is cubic and {{is the same as the}} complexity of the best-known method for deciding satisfiability when only these topological relations are considered. We also provide results on finding a consistent scenario in cubic time for these combined classes. Regarding <b>metric</b> <b>size</b> constraints, we first study their combination with RCC- 8 and we show that deciding satisfiability for the combined sets of constraints is NP-hard, even when only the RCC- 8 basic relations are used. Then we introduce RCC- 7, a subalgebra of RCC- 8 that can be used for applications where spatial regions cannot partially overlap. We show that reasoning with the seven RCC- 7 basic relations and the universal relation is intractable, but that reasoning with the RCC- 7 basic relations combined with <b>metric</b> <b>size</b> information is tractable. Finally, we give a polynomial algorithm for the latter case and a backtracking algorithm for the general case...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{context-aware}} hybrid classification {{system for the}} problem of fine-grained product class recognition in computer vision. Recently, retail product recognition has become an interesting computer vision research topic. We focus on the classification of products on shelves in a store. This is a very challenging classification problem because many product classes are visually similar in terms of shape, color, texture, and <b>metric</b> <b>size.</b> In shelves, same or similar products {{are more likely to}} appear adjacent to each other and displayed in certain arrangements rather than at random. The arrangement of the products on the shelves has a spatial continuity both in brand and <b>metric</b> <b>size.</b> By using this context information, the co-occurrence of the products and the adjacency relations between the products can be statistically modeled. The proposed hybrid approach improves the accuracy of context-free image classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), by combining them with a probabilistic graphical model such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The fundamental goal of this paper is using contextual relationships in retail shelves to improve the classification accuracy by executing a context-aware approach...|$|E
