40|$|AbstractOxidative {{stress in}} the retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) is a well-accepted pathogenic change in vision-threatening diseases such as age-related macular degeneration. One source of oxidative stress is excessive light exposure, which causes excessive activation of the visual cycle. Because short wavelength light (blue light) has more energy, it {{is reported to be}} more harmful to photoreceptor cells than the other wavelengths of light. However, the biological effect of blue light in the RPE of living animals and the protective effect of a yellow intraocular lens (IOL) material that blocks blue light is still obscure. Therefore, we compared the pathogenic effect in the RPE-choroid complexes of mice exposed to light in a box made of a clear or a yellow IOL material. We measured the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines and a macrophage marker by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the protein level of monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) by ELISA. The ROS level after light exposure was suppressed in the RPE-choroids of light-exposed mice in the yellow IOL <b>material</b> <b>box.</b> In parallel, all the inflammatory cytokines that we measured and a macrophage marker were also suppressed in the RPE-choroids of light-exposed mice in the yellow IOL <b>material</b> <b>box.</b> Therefore, a yellow IOL material suppressed, and thus blue light exacerbated, the increase in the ROS level and inflammatory cytokine expression as well as macrophage recruitment in the RPE-choroid in vivo after light exposure...|$|E

The definitive version is available online at: [URL] need to use more recycled and marginal materials in pavement foundations is encouraging moves towards performance based specifications. Such an approach needs data on the fundamental material parameters of stiffness and resistance to permanent deformation (strength) to allow analytical design and achieve comparable compliance testing on site. Whilst a number of laboratory and field tests to measure such performance exist, all have limitations relative to either the particle size of materials that can be tested and/or correlation between the laboratory and field derived data. This paper presents the development of a large scale resiliently lined steel laboratory <b>material</b> <b>box</b> tests proposed for routine material assessment. The test utilises a Lightweight Deflectometer, similar to that proposed for field compliance testing to provide performance data from compacted large particle size granular materials. The system developed utilises a “soft” base condition to replicate typical subgrade stiffness and allows wetting and drying of materials to assess their environmental stability. The results show that such a test can simply provide suitable data for performance based design, but consideration needs to be given to the water content of materials, the time of testing after compaction, and the use of appropriate boundary conditions. These findings have both implications not only for the developed tests but for field compliance testing of pavement foundations...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase in}} the level of green house gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices are the main driving forces behind efforts to more effectively utilize various sources of renewable energy. In many parts of the world, direct solar radiation is considered {{to be one of the}} most prospective sources of energy. Among the different energy end uses, energy for cooking is one of the basic and dominant end uses in developing countries. Energy requirement for cooking accounts for 36 % of total primary energy consumption in India. Hence, there is a critical need for the development of alternative, appropriate, affordable mode of cooking for use in developing countries. However, the large scale utilization of this form of energy is possible only if the effective technology for its storage can be developed with acceptable capital and running costs. Thermal energy storage is essential whenever there is a mismatch between the supply and consumption of energy. Latent heat storage in a phase change material is very attractive because of its high storage density with small temperature swing. The choice of PCM plays an important role in addition to heat transfer mechanism in the PCM. In this present work a review has been made to study all the research and development work carried out in the field of solar cooker in particular the storage type solar cookers. A novel concept of PCM-based storage type solar cooker is also presented which is under experimental investigation.

40|$|Assembly line {{balancing}} problems (ALBP) consist of distributing the total workload for manufacturing any {{unit of the}} products to be assembled among the work stations along a manufacturing line as used in the automotive or the electronics industries. Usually, it is assumed in research papers that, within each station, tasks can be executed in an arbitrary precedence-feasible sequence without changing station times. In practice, however, the task sequence may influence the station time considerably as sequence-dependent setups (e. g., walking distances, tool changes, withdrawal of parts from <b>material</b> <b>boxes)</b> have to be considered. Including this aspect leads to a joint balancing and scheduling problem, which we call SUALBSP (setup assembly {{line balancing}} and scheduling problem).
