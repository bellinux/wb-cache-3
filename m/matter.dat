5|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{outstanding}} {{problems associated with}} the currently favored cold dark <b>matter</b> model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem.

5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} <b>matter</b> in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that <b>matter</b> remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all <b>matter</b> appears to be dark <b>matter,</b> which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of <b>matter,</b> within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|Dark <b>matter</b> is the <b>matter</b> in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the <b>matter</b> in {{the universe}} is dark <b>matter.</b> The spatial distribution of dark <b>matter</b> {{in the universe}} is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible <b>matter</b> in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the <b>matter</b> in the universe is dark <b>matter</b> that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic <b>matter.</b> In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal <b>matter</b> led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark <b>matter.</b> While dark <b>matter</b> has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E

5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark <b>matter,</b> and baryonic <b>matter</b> (ordinary <b>matter</b> composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible <b>matter.</b> Unlike the <b>matter</b> and dark <b>matter,</b> the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from <b>matter</b> and dark <b>matter</b> within the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and helium are {{estimated}} to make up approximately 99 per cent of all ordinary <b>matter</b> in the universe.

5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark <b>matter,</b> 4.6% regular <b>matter</b> and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in <b>matter</b> decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, <b>matter</b> made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E

5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells <b>matter</b> how to move; <b>matter</b> tells spacetime how to curve. What this means is addressed in the following three sections, which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of <b>matter</b> serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these <b>matter</b> properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} <b>matter</b> in which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the <b>matter.</b> This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas.

5|$|The core {{concept of}} general-relativistic {{model-building}} {{is that of}} a solution of Einstein's equations. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of <b>matter,</b> such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific <b>matter</b> fields defined on that manifold. <b>Matter</b> and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The <b>matter</b> must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever <b>matter</b> might be present.|$|E
