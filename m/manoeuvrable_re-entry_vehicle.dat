40|$|In this study, the {{atmospheric}} re-entry onto Earth and Mars is analysed concerning uncertainties. These uncertainties can {{arise in the}} modelling and the initial entry angle and velocity during the re-entry leading to hazards and malfunctions influencing the mission success. Therefore, the temporal evolution of uncertainties throughout the re-entry, descent and landing is examined using the Stochastic Liouville Equation. This equation yields probability density functions depending on {{the states of the}} system dynamics and the time. From this a most probable trajectory together with 1 -sigma and 3 -sigma error bars can be estimated giving an impression on the influence of uncertainties. Furthermore, the covariance matrices are deduced from the probability density functions generating landing dispersions at the end time of the re-entry. Beside ballistic trajectories also optimal trajectories for <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicles</b> are analysed. In this case, the <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> is controllable in its flight path angle and the trajectories are optimized concerning the descent time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper reports {{results of}} a joint study between ESA, DEIMOS Space S. L. and the University of Leicester on the {{robustness}} analysis of flight control laws for future hypersonic <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicles.</b> We apply a novel hybridised version of the deterministic global optimisation algorithm, DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT), to perform worst-case analysis of a nonlinear-dynamic inversion (NDI) flight control law for a highlydetailed simulation model of a hypersonic <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Nonlinear clearance criteria widely used in the European aerospace industry for the clearance of flight control laws for highly manoeuvrable aircraft are developed and applied {{in the context of}} the <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> flight control problem. The proposed approach is shown to have the potential to improve significantly both the reliability and efficiency of the flight clearance process for future <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Copyright ACA 200...|$|R

50|$|This <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{is unlike}} that of the Shaheen I in that it has four moving delta control fins at the rear and small solid/liquid-propellant side thrust motors, which are used to orient the <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> after the booster stage is {{depleted}} or before re-entry to improve accuracy by providing stabilization during the terminal phase. This {{can also be used}} to fly evasive manoeuvres, making it problematic for existing anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems to successfully intercept the missile. The Shaheen II warhead may change its trajectory several times during re-entry and during the terminal phase, effectively preventing ABM radar systems from pre-calculating intercept points. The <b>re-entry</b> <b>vehicle</b> is also stated to utilise a GPS satellite guidance system to provide updates on its position, further improving its accuracy and reducing the CEP.|$|R
