She would later say {{that although he}} was the [...] "hole in my heart" [...] and [...] "loss in my scar", {{the memory of her}} father has motivated her each day since. Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well, Obama later telling Katie Couric that the loss <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm. This was seen as a turning point for Michelle.|$|E

6000|$|Arter {{that she}} treated {{me as if}} I was the dirt beneath ’er feet. She never spoke to me, but used to speak against me to other people. She was always talking {{to them about the}} [...] "sleeping-sickness" [...] and things o’ that kind. She said night-watchmen always <b>made</b> <b>’er</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it somehow, but she didn’t know why, and she couldn’t tell you if you was to ask her. The only thing I was thankful for was that I wasn’t ’er husband.

6000|$|Anne saw {{the misery}} of such feelings. The husband had not been what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part <b>of</b> mankind which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> worse <b>of</b> the world than she hoped it deserved. It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon added in a {{different}} tone-- ...|$|R

60|$|Perhaps her ease of manner {{was due to}} {{something}} more than the simplicity of her nature. The circumstances of her life <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> everything she did as work demanded from her, in which affectation had nothing to do; and she had begun her work before self-consciousness was born.|$|E
60|$|When next we {{assembled}} ourselves together, it {{was after}} milking, and the cares of the day were done with. We foregathered in the balsam-fragrant aisles of the fir wood, and ate early August apples {{to such an extent}} that the Story Girl said we <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the Irishman's pig.|$|E
60|$|She crept {{closer to}} him and trembled as if with cold. Her dread that the whole story, with random additions, would become known to him, caused her manner to be so {{agitated}} that Knight was alarmed and perplexed into stillness. The actual innocence which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> so fearfully <b>of</b> what, as the world goes, was not a great matter, magnified her apparent guilt. It may have said to Knight that {{a woman who was}} so flurried in the preliminaries must have a dreadful sequel to her tale.|$|R
2500|$|Carter {{travelled}} throughout Northern California {{and into}} Nevada, sending back her impressions of San Francisco, Carson City, Nevada City, and Marysville. Of San Francisco, {{she said it}} <b>made</b> <b>her</b> sad to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> how little sun the people saw there, and was dismayed at the divisions within the city's black community, so small as to be [...] "a mite on a mountain". The five weeks she spent in Carson City, on the other hand, were [...] "invigorating", and [...] "the black people there were doing well, and had pleasant homes." ...|$|R
5000|$|To a Wild Rose, {{one of the}} European-trained MacDowell's most {{well-known}} and loved pieces, {{is part of the}} larger Woodland Sketches, finished in 1896 for solo piano. The composer incorporated certain Native American themes into it. Alan Levy, the critic and biographer, wrote: Marian recalled how her husband would regularly write a few measures during breakfast — [...] "like exercise" [...] — before going off to the cabin. Normally, MacDowell discarded such fragments, and this particular morning he crumpled the paper and tossed it at the fireplace. He happened to miss the target, however, and rather than summarily throwing it away, Marian later picked up the paper, uncrumpled it, and looked it over. She played it at the piano and decided to keep it. When Edward later returned from the cabin she showed it to him and said: [...] "This is a charming little melody." [...] Edward looked at it anew and agreed, [...] "It is not bad — very simple. It makes me <b>think</b> <b>of</b> wild roses near the cabin."However, Marian's version of the story is slightly different. She wrote that the fragment <b>made</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>think</b> <b>of</b> their [...] "log cabin" [...] — as opposed to [...] "cabin" [...] — which was not built until 1898, two years after the Sketches were published.|$|R
60|$|But {{the rider}} {{did not appear}} to want to see the stallion. He gazed up at Lucy, and she saw {{something}} in his eyes that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a child. She left him, had no trouble in watering the horses, and haltered Wildfire among the willows on a patch of grass. Then she returned.|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie, as {{she went}} to bed, told herself {{that she might have}} a husband if she pleased; but then, which should it be? Mr Rubb's manners were very much against him; but of Mr Maguire's eye she had caught a gleam as he turned from her on the doorsteps, which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that {{alliance}} with dismay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then!" [...] He rose, {{leaving his}} supper untasted, {{and went into}} the sitting-room, where she {{presently}} found him, with that everlasting confusion of papers before him on the desk. That <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the paper in her work-basket, and she decided not to make the careworn, distracted man ask her for it, after all. She brought it to him.|$|E
60|$|She was immensely {{tempted to}} give way to her natural trust in him, revived by the deep and now melancholy tones of his voice, and to tell him of her love, and of what had changed it. But {{although}} it seemed likely that she would soon control her anger with him, the certainty that he did not love her, confirmed by every word of his proposal, forbade any freedom of speech. To hear him speak and to feel herself unable to reply, or constrained in her replies, was so painful that she longed for the time when she should be alone. A more pliant woman would have taken this chance of an explanation, whatever risks attached to it; but to one of Mary's firm and resolute temperament there was degradation in the idea of self-abandonment; let the waves of emotion rise ever so high, she could not shut her eyes to what she conceived to be the truth. Her silence puzzled Ralph. He searched his memory for words or deeds that might have <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> badly <b>of</b> him. In his present mood instances came but too quickly, and on top of them this culminating proof of his baseness--that he had asked her to marry him when his reasons for such a proposal were selfish and half-hearted.|$|R
60|$|Having {{thanked the}} old woman with {{tears in her eyes}} for her hospitality, and for the good news she had given her, the Princess set out on her journey and rested neither night nor day, so great was her longing to see her husband again. On and on she walked until her last pair of shoes fell in pieces. So she threw them away and went on with bare feet, not heeding the bogs nor the thorns that wounded her, nor the stones that bruised her. At last she reached a {{beautiful}} green meadow {{on the edge of a}} wood. Her heart was cheered by the sight of the flowers and the soft cool grass, and she sat down and rested for a little. But hearing the birds chirping to their mates among the trees <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> with longing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband, and she wept bitterly, and taking her child in her arms, and her bundle of chicken bones on her shoulder, she entered the wood.|$|R
60|$|She {{set to work}} on her housewifery cares; {{but when}} these were despatched, {{it was hard to}} begin {{anything}} else on such a day of suspense, when she was living on reports from the sick room. The delirium had returned, more violent than ever; and as she sat at her open window she often heard the disconnected words. She could do nothing but listen--she could neither read nor draw, and even letter-writing failed her to-day, for it seemed cruel to send a letter to his sister, and if Philip was not under a delusion, it was still worse to write to Hollywell; it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> shudder to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the misery she might have inflicted in the former letters, where she had not spared the detail of her worst fears and conjectures, and by no means softened the account, as she had done to his sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't lag, boys. You've {{got nothing}} to change into," [...] said Betty, pulling them along, and looking with uneasy emotion at the earth {{displayed}} so luridly, with sudden sparks of light from greenhouses in gardens, {{with a sort of}} yellow and black mutability, against this blazing sunset, this astonishing agitation and vitality of colour, which stirred Betty Flanders and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> responsibility and danger. She gripped Archer's hand. On she plodded up the hill.|$|E
6000|$|... "We should indeed!" [...] said Kate Croy. It {{was talk}} of a kind she loathed, but if Marian chose to be vulgar what was one to do? It <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the Miss Condrips with renewed aversion. [...] "I {{like the way you}} arrange things--I like what you take for granted. If it's so easy for us to marry men who want us to scatter gold, I wonder we any of us do {{anything}} else. I don't see so many of them about, nor what interest I might ever have for them. You live, my dear," [...] she presently added, [...] "in a world of vain thoughts." ...|$|E
60|$|Anne watched these romantic {{proceedings}} {{from her}} window with much interest, {{and when she}} saw how triumphantly other handsome girls of the neighbourhood walked by on the gorgeous arms of Lieutenant Knockheelmann, Cornet Flitzenhart, and Captain Klaspenkissen, of the thrilling York Hussars, who swore the most picturesque foreign oaths, and had a wonderful sort of estate or property called the Vaterland in their country across the sea, she {{was filled with a}} sense of her own loneliness. It <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> things which she tried to forget, and to look into a little drawer at something soft and brown that lay in a curl there, wrapped in paper. At last she could bear it no longer, and went downstairs.|$|E
60|$|Yet, {{poor little}} Charlotte Arnold learnt that the kitchen could be dreary, when Mrs. Beckett had been summoned to nurse Lord Fitzjocelyn, and she {{remained}} in sole charge, under Mrs. Martha's occasional supervision. She found herself, her household cares over all too soon, {{on a cold}} light March afternoon, with the clock ticking loud enough for midnight, the smoke-jack indulging in supernatural groans, and the whole lonely house full of undefined terrors, with an unlimited space of the like solitude before her. She would even have been glad {{to be sure of}} an evening of Mrs. Martha's good advice, and of darning stockings! She sat down by the round table to Mr. James's wristbands; but every creak or crack of the furniture <b>made</b> <b>her</b> start, and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> death-watches. She might have learnt to contemn superstition, but that did not prevent it from affecting her nerves.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you want}} me to come for?" [...] he asked, all {{attentive}} and motionless. The same impression, the old impression, was with him again; the sense that if she was sincere it was sincerity of execution, if she was genuine it was the genuineness of doing it well. She did it so well now that this very fact was charming and touching. In claiming from him at the theatre this hour of the afternoon she had wanted honestly (the more as she had not seen him at home for several days) to go over with him once again, {{on the eve of the}} great night--it would be for her second creation the critics would lie so in wait; the first success might have been a fluke--some of her recurrent doubts: knowing from experience of what good counsel he often was, how he could give a worrying question its [...] "settler" [...] at the last. Then she had heard from Dashwood of the change in his situation, and that had really from one moment to the other <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> sympathetically <b>of</b> his preoccupations--led her open-handedly to drop her own. She was sorry to lose him and eager to let him know how good a friend she was conscious he had been to her. But the expression of this was already, at the end of a minute, a strange bedevilment: she began to listen to herself, to speak dramatically, to represent. She uttered the things she felt as if they were snatches of old play-books, and really felt them the more because they sounded so well. This, however, didn't prevent their really being as good feelings as those of anybody else, and at the moment her friend, to still a rising emotion--which he knew he shouldn't still--articulated the challenge I have just recorded, she had for his sensibility, at any rate, the truth of gentleness and generosity.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had made}} {{everything}} comfortable for the artist; {{there was no}} further pretext for staying. So {{she said she would}} go, now, and asked him to summon the servants in case he should need anything. She went away unhappy; and she left unhappiness behind her; for she carried away all the sunshine. The time dragged heavily for both, now. He couldn't paint for thinking of her; she couldn't design or millinerize with any heart, for thinking of him. Never before had painting seemed so empty to him, never before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her. She had gone without repeating that dinner-invitation--an almost unendurable disappointment to him. On her part-well, she was suffering, too; for she had found she couldn't invite him. It was not hard yesterday, but it was impossible to-day. A thousand innocent privileges seemed to have been filched from her unawares in the past twenty-four hours. To-day she felt strangely hampered, restrained of her liberty. To-day she couldn't propose to herself to do anything or say anything concerning this young man without being instantly paralyzed into non-action by the fear that he might [...] "suspect." [...] Invite him to dinner to-day? It <b>made</b> <b>her</b> shiver to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Willoughby, he, whom {{only half}} an hour ago she had abhorred as the most {{worthless}} of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him as now separated for ever from her family, with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge. But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could feel his influence less.|$|E
60|$|The fixity of {{her mood}} {{was broken by}} the action of walking. The {{shooting}} motor cars, more like spiders in the moon than terrestrial objects, the thundering drays, the jingling hansoms, and little black broughams, <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the world she lived in. Somewhere up there above the pinnacles where the smoke rose in a pointed hill, her children were now asking for her, and getting a soothing reply. As for the mass of streets, squares, and public buildings which parted them, she only felt at this moment how little London had done to make her love it, although thirty of her forty years had been spent in a street. She knew how to read the people who were passing her; there were the rich who were running to and from each others' houses at this hour; there were the bigoted workers driving in a straight line to their offices; there were the poor who were unhappy and rightly malignant. Already, though there was sunlight in the haze, tattered old men and women were nodding off to sleep upon the seats. When one gave up seeing the beauty that clothed things, this was the skeleton beneath.|$|E
60|$|And Jane Withersteen {{suddenly}} {{suffered a}} paralyzing affront to her consciousness of reverence by some strange, irresistible twist of thought wherein she saw this Bishop as a man. And the {{train of thought}} hurdled the rising, crying protests of that other self whose poise she had lost. It was not her Bishop who eyed her in curious measurement. It {{was a man who}} tramped into her presence without removing his hat, who had no greeting for her, who had no semblance of courtesy. In looks, as in action, he <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a bull stamping cross-grained into a corral. She had heard of Bishop Dyer forgetting the minister in the fury of a common man, and now she was to feel it. The glance by which she measured him in turn momentarily veiled the divine in the ordinary. He looked a rancher; he was booted, spurred, and covered with dust; he carried a gun at his hip, and she remembered that he had been known to use it. But during the long moment while he watched her there was nothing commonplace in the slow-gathering might of his wrath.|$|E
6000|$|Ida {{turned and}} closed the shutters; {{the sight of the}} tempest {{affected}} her strained nerves almost beyond bearing. She began to walk up and down the big room, flitting like a ghost from end to end and back again, and again back. What could she do? What should she do? Her fate was upon her: she could no longer resist the inevitable--she must marry him. And yet her whole soul revolted from the act with an overwhelming fierceness which astonished even herself. She had known two girls who had married people whom they did not like, being at the time, or pretending to be, attached to somebody else, and she had observed that they accommodated themselves to their fate with considerable ease. But it was not so with her; she was fashioned of another clay, and it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> faint to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what was before her. And yet the prospect was one on which she could expect little sympathy. Her own father, although personally he disliked the man whom she must marry, was clearly filled with amazement that she should prefer Colonel Quaritch, middle-aged, poor, and plain, to Edward Cossey--handsome, young, and rich as Croesus. He could not comprehend or measure the extraordinary gulf which her love dug between the two. If, therefore, this was so with her own father, how would it be {{with the rest of the}} world? ...|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{thought so}} indeed; only where was home?--that puzzled her. However, she trotted {{along by the}} side of her companion, and {{presently}} came to what might have been an enormous snow-ball, but there was a hole in it. Yes, it was hollow; and as <b>her</b> companion <b>made</b> for the opening, she saw more little stout figures rolled up in furs inside. Then she perceived that it was a house built up of blocks of snow, arranged so as to make the shape of a beehive, all frozen together, and with a window of ice. It <b>made</b> <b>her</b> shiver to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> going in, but she thought the white bear might come after her, and in she went. Even her little head had to bend under the low doorway, and behold, it was the very closest, stuffiest, if not the hottest place she had ever been in! There was a kind of lamp burning in the hut; that is, a wick was floating in some oil, but there was no glass, such as Lucy had been apt to think the chief part of a lamp, and all round it squatted upon skins these queer little stumpy figures dressed so much alike that there was no knowing the men from the women, except that the women had much bigger boots, and used them instead of pockets, and they had their babies in bags of skin upon their backs.|$|R
6000|$|Near {{the middle}} of the field was two women working together, raking as {{steadily}} as if they had been brought up to it. One of these was young, and even handsomer than Miss Dick, which was the name of the bar lady. To look at <b>her</b> <b>made</b> me <b>think</b> <b>of</b> what I had read of Queen Marie Antoinette and her court ladies playing the part of milkmaids. Her straw hat was trimmed with delicate flowers, and her white muslin dress and pale blue ribbons <b>made</b> <b>her</b> the prettiest picture I ever saw out-of-doors. I could not help asking Mrs. Locky who she was, and she told me that she was the chambermaid at the inn, and the other was the cook. When I heard this I didn't make any answer, but just walked off a little way and began raking and thinking. I have often wondered why it is that English servants are so different from those we have, or, to put it in a strictly confidential way between you and me, madam, why the chambermaid at the [...] "Bordley Arms," [...] as she is, is so different from me, as I used to be when I first lived with you. Now that young chambermaid with the pretty hat is, as far as appearances go, as good a woman as I am, and if Jone was a bachelor and intended to marry <b>her</b> I would <b>think</b> it was as good a match as if he married me. But the difference between us two is that when I got to be the kind of woman I am I wasn't willing to be a servant, and if I had always been the kind of young woman that chambermaid is I never would have been a servant.|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{answered}} {{this question}} and Mary Jane led the table {{back to the}} legitimate opera. One of her pupils {{had given her a}} pass for Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she said, but it <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> poor Georgina Burns. Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin--Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia? Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.|$|E
60|$|She slept, but on {{a spring}} as it were, lest the fire should fall. She {{replenished}} it with boughs, tucked in the half-burnt logs, {{and went to sleep}} again. Then {{it seemed to her that}} some invisible hand was pouring a thin spirit on the flames that made them leap and crackle and spread north and south until they filled the heavens. Her eyes were open and the snowstorm overpast, leaving the sky clear, and all the westward heaven alight with the trailing, crackling, leaping curtains of the Aurora, brighter than she had ever seen them before. Quite clearly visible beyond the smoulder of the fire, a wintry waste of rock and snow, boulder beyond boulder, passed into a dun obscurity. The mountain to the right of them lay long and white and stiff, a shrouded death. All earth was dead and waste and nothing, and the sky alive and coldly marvellous, signalling and astir. She watched the changing, shifting colours, and they <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the gathering banners of inhuman hosts, the stir and marshalling of icy giants for ends stupendous and indifferent to all the trivial impertinence of man's existence....|$|E
6000|$|Eventually, however, Avonlea school {{slipped back}} into its old groove and took up its old interests. To be sure, the concert left traces. Ruby Gillis and Emma White, who had quarreled over a point of {{precedence}} in their platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising friendship of three years was broken up. Josie Pye and Julia Bell did not [...] "speak" [...] for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright that Julia Bell's bow when she got up to recite <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a chicken jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia. None of the Sloanes would have any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared that the Sloanes {{had too much to}} do in the program, and the Sloanes had retorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly. Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson, because Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on airs about her recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was [...] "licked"; consequently Moody Spurgeon's sister, Ella May, would not [...] "speak" [...] to Anne Shirley {{all the rest of the}} winter. With the exception of these trifling frictions, work in Miss Stacy's little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Jess {{was rapidly}} {{changing}} {{her clothes and}} removing the traces of her struggle with the elements. But of that other struggle she had gone through she could not remove the traces. They and the love that arose out of it would endure {{as long as she}} endured. It was her former self that had been cast off in it and which now lay behind her, an empty and unmeaning thing like the shapeless heap of garments. It was all very strange. So John had gone to look for her and had not found her. She was glad that he had gone. It <b>made</b> <b>her</b> happy to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him searching and calling in the wet and the night. She was only a woman, and it was natural that she should feel thus. By-and-by he would come back and find her clothed and in her right mind and ready to greet him. She was glad that he had not seen her wet and dishevelled. A girl looks so unpleasant like that. It might have set him against her. Men like women to look nice and clean and pretty. That gave her an idea. She turned to her glass and, holding the light above her head, studied her own face attentively. She was a woman with as little vanity in her composition as it is possible for a woman to have, and till now she had not given her personal looks much consideration. They had not been of great importance to her in the Wakkerstroom district of the Transvaal. But to-night {{all of a sudden they}} became very important; and so she stood and looked at her own wonderful eyes, at the masses of curling brown hair still damp and shining from the rain, at the curious pallid face and clear-cut determined mouth.|$|R
6000|$|Maggie, however, {{was seeing}} for herself--it was another matter, [...] "The {{thing was that}} he <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be so}} possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|Maggie stared--she {{had meant}} her father. But her vision seemed to spread. [...] "They both <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>think.</b> She wouldn't have thought without them." ...|$|R
