25|$|Even if {{climate and}} {{vineyard}} management has been ideal, other factors may prevent full and even ripeness. Among the clusters of a grapevine, individual berries may not all ripen {{at the same}} pace. This problem, commonly known as <b>millerandage,</b> could occur because of poor weather during the flowering period of the grape but can also be caused by soil deficient in various nutrients such as boron, an attack of various grapevine ailments such as the grapevine fanleaf virus or {{a number of other}} factors that may contribute to incomplete plant fertilization.|$|E
25|$|Pedro Ximénez is a {{mid to late}} {{ripening}} grape {{variety that}} also tends to bud at {{the midpoint of the}} budding period of the vine growing season. The vine can be very vigorous and productive, producing large clusters of berries of irregular sizes (occasionally the result of <b>millerandage).</b> Despite having thin skinned berries, Pedro Ximénez is highly susceptible to the viticultural hazard of botrytis bunch rot as well as downy mildew, esca and eutypa dieback. The vine has some resistance to the fungal disease powdery mildew but is also very prone to damage caused by termite infection.|$|E
25|$|Torrontés {{produces}} some of {{the most}} distinctive white wines in Argentina, characterized by floral Muscat-like aromas and a spicy note. The grape requires careful handling during the winemaking process with temperature control during fermentation and a sensitivity to certain strains of yeast. The grape is most widely planted in the northern provinces of La Rioja and Salta, particularly the Calchaquí Valleys, but has spread to Mendoza. In response to international demand, plantings of Chardonnay have steadily increased. The University of California, Davis produced a special clone of the variety (known as the Mendoza clone) that, despite it propensity to develop <b>millerandage,</b> is still widely used in Argentina and Australia. Argentine Chardonnay has shown to thrive in high altitude plantings and is being increasing planted in the Tupungato region on vineyard sites located at altitudes around nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 meters).|$|E
2500|$|The {{stage of}} fruit set follows {{flowering}} almost immediately, when the fertilized flower begins {{to develop a}} seed and grape berry to protect the seed. In the Northern Hemisphere, this normally takes place in May and in the Southern Hemisphere in November. This stage is very critical for wine production since it determines the potential crop yield. Not every flower on the vine gets fertilized, with the unfertilized flowers eventually falling off the vine. The percentage of fertilized flowers averages around 30 but can get as high as 60 or be much lower. Climate {{and the health of}} the vine play an important role with low humidity, high temperatures and water stress having the potential of severely reducing the amount flowers that get fertilized. Coulure occurs when there is an imbalance of carbohydrate levels in the vine tissues and some berries fail to set or simply fall off the bunch. Varieties like Grenache and Malbec are prone to this abnormal fruit set. <b>Millerandage</b> occurs when some fertilized flowers do not form seeds but only small berry clusters. Grape berry size depends on the number of seeds so berries with no seeds will be significantly smaller than berries containing seeds. On one cluster there may be berries of various sizes which can create problems during winemaking due to the varying [...] "skin to pulp" [...] ratio among the grapes. This can be caused by vine disease, such as fanleaf, or by a boron deficiency in the vine. Gewürztraminer and the Chardonnay clones IA and Mendoza are both prone to <b>millerandage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Harvesting time {{is crucial}} to winemaking, with the grape rapidly losing acidity {{as soon as it}} ripens. Some viticultural hazards include the risk of damage from springtime frost, as Chardonnay is an early-budding vine – usually a week after Pinot noir. To combat the threat of frost, a method {{developed}} in Burgundy involves aggressive pruning just prior to budburst. This [...] "shocks" [...] the vine and delays budburst up to two weeks, which is often long enough for warmer weather to arrive. <b>Millerandage</b> and coulure can also pose problems, along with powdery mildew attacking the thin skin of the grapes. Because of Chardonnay's early ripening, it can thrive in wine regions with short growing seasons, and in regions such as Burgundy, can be harvested before autumn rain sets in and brings the threat of rot.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2006, 34 clonal {{varieties}} of Chardonnay {{could be found}} in vineyards throughout France, most of which were developed at the University of Burgundy in Dijon. The so-called [...] "Dijon clones" [...] are bred for their adaptive attributes, with vineyard owners planting the clonal variety best suited to their terroir and which will produce the characteristics that they are seeking in the wine. Examples include the lower-yielding clones 'Dijon-76', '95' and '96' that produce more flavor-concentrated clusters. 'Dijon-77' and '809' produce more aromatic wines with a [...] "grapey" [...] perfume, while 'Dijon-75', '78', '121', '124', '125' and '277' are more vigorous and higher-yielding clones. New World varieties include the 'Mendoza' clone, which produced some of the early California Chardonnays. The 'Mendoza' clone is prone to develop <b>millerandage,</b> also known as [...] "hens and chicks", where the berries develop unevenly. In places such as Oregon, the use of newer Dijon clones has had some success in those regions of the Willamette Valley with climates similar to that of Burgundy.|$|E
50|$|While <b>millerandage</b> {{will always}} have an {{economic}} impact in reduced harvest yields, it may not always {{have a negative impact}} on the resulting quality of the wine. In some areas, such as the New World wine regions of Australia, California and New Zealand, the presence of <b>millerandage</b> in the a vineyard can be seen as a positive quality for a vintage due to the reduced average berry-size. Some growers will even use chemical sprays to deliberately encourage <b>millerandage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Coulure is a {{distinct}} phenomena unrelated to another viticultural hazard, <b>millerandage,</b> where the flowers are pollinated but the resulting berries develop with seeds and remain small. Like coulure, <b>millerandage</b> is often caused by inclement weather during the flowering and fruit set period and cause reduced yields.|$|E

For some varieties that are prone to uneven ripeness within a cluster, such as Sangiovese, Zinfandel and Gewürztraminer, the development of <b>millerandage</b> may be unfavorable due to [...] "green flavors" [...] from the potentially unripe grapes hidden within the cluster. For other varieties, such as Pinot noir or the Mendoza clone of Chardonnay, wine quality could potentially be improved due to the reduced overall berry size and higher skin to juice ratio.|$|E
50|$|Uva Rara is a mid to late-ripening grape variety.

50|$|Uva Tosca is a mid to late-ripening grape vine {{that is very}} {{susceptible}} to the viticultural hazards of powdery mildew and <b>millerandage.</b> Uva Tosca seems to thrive at higher altitude plantings, {{being one of the}} few red Italian grape varieties that can fully ripen at elevations between 700 m to 900 m above sea levels.|$|E
50|$|The {{root cause}} of <b>millerandage</b> is the poor {{fertilization}} of grape flowers during the growing season. While this is most often attributed to bad weather, other factors such as nutritional deficiencies (particularly of the mineral boron which is needed to synthesis the growth hormone auxin and facilitate the movement of sugars in the vine) or viral infections can play a role.|$|E
50|$|<b>Millerandage</b> (or shot berries, hens and chicks and {{pumpkins}} and peas) is {{a potential}} viticultural hazard problem in which grape bunches contain berries that differ greatly in size and, most importantly, maturity. Its most common cause is cold, rainy or otherwise bad weather during the flowering stage of the vines though other factors, such as boron deficiency or fanleaf degeneration, may also play a role.|$|E
5000|$|Muscat bleu is {{an early}} {{ripening}} variety that buds midway through the budding period of the growing season. The vine produces large, loose clusters of large size berries that give off a sweet [...] "grapey", muscat-like aroma that can attract wasps to the vineyard. Muscat bleu has good resistance to fungal infections such as downy mildew but is susceptible to the viticultural hazards of coulure and <b>millerandage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Œillade noire is a mid-ripening grape {{variety that}} has a {{tendency}} to produce high yields of large berries and clusters. Growers working with the variety will often keep the vine in check with winter pruning and short cordons. In southern France it has been traditionally planted in higher elevation vineyards where varieties like Cinsault tend not to ripen well. The vine is susceptible to a number of viticultural hazards including coulure, <b>millerandage,</b> botrytis bunch rot and leafhoppers.|$|E
50|$|Plassa is a {{mid to late}} {{ripening}} {{variety that}} can be very vigorous producing large foliage which may require canopy management to keep in check. The grapes gets it name, Scarlattino, from the bright red color that the plant stems develop during the growing season. While Plassa has good resistance to most fungal diseases, such as downy and powdery mildew, due to its very thick skins it is susceptible to the viticultural hazard of <b>millerandage</b> and to infection from European grapevine moths.|$|E

50|$|Grignolino {{is highly}} prone to mutation, {{creating}} {{a significant amount}} of clonal variation. These different clones of Grignolino can impart different aromas and flavor characteristics ranging from green herbal, leafy notes and vegetable stock to raspberry and fruit. The grape is also highly reflective of its terroir and the different types of vineyard soils that it may be planted in. Grignolino is also prone to <b>millerandage,</b> with clusters (or even grapes within a single cluster) at different stages of ripening. The severity of the millderandage varies from year to year and can dramatically affect the quality and yield totals of any given vintage.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} hazards that a {{viticulturist}} {{needs to be}} aware of when growing vines. These hazards can have an adverse effect on the wine produced from the grape or kill the vine itself. When the vine is flowering it is very susceptible to weather hazards such as strong winds and hail. Cold temperatures during this period can also bring the onset of <b>millerandage</b> which produces clusters with no seeds and varying sizes. Too much heat can have the opposite reaction and produce Coulure that causes grape clusters to either drop to the ground or not fully develop.|$|E
5000|$|Cabernet blanc {{tends to}} produce loose {{clusters}} of small, thick-skinned grape berries. The vine {{is a very}} vigorous, highly disease and frost resistant variety. It has particularly strong resistance to fungal infections caused by powdery and downy mildew as well as botrytis bunch rot. It is, however, susceptible to the viticultural hazard of <b>millerandage</b> where the grape flowers do not get properly fertilized resulting in bunches having a mix of small, seedless berries and normal size berries. These small [...] "shot berries" [...] often add to the levels of sugar and phenolic extract of the wine and may make it seem [...] "unbalanced".|$|E
50|$|Băbească neagră is a late-ripening grape {{variety that}} is also a mid to late budding vine which {{contributes}} to the grape's winter hardiness and resistance to the viticultural hazards of early spring frost. During the cold Eastern European winters, Băbească neagră is able to withstand temperatures as low as -18 C. However the very loose, medium-sized bunches of thin-skinned berries are very susceptible to the hazards of botrytis bunch rot, downy and powdery mildew as well as drought during the growing season. If yields are not kept in check by winter pruning and green harvesting, the vine can be very vigorous and prone to developing <b>millerandage.</b>|$|E

50|$|For grapevines, {{flowering}} occurs usually 8 {{weeks after}} the beginning of bud break when the mean daily temperatures hit around 20 C. Usually flowering begins {{at the base of}} the inflorescence (cluster of flowers) and moves it way to the top.

Ideally the temperature and weather condition for this period should be warm, sunny and dry to insure optimal flowering. For some varieties, such as Zinfandel and Merlot, flowering may be more staggered which poses a greater risk for inclemental weather disrupting the process and encouraging <b>millerandage.</b> Some growers may try to encourage more synchronized flowering with the use of chemical treatments, such as cyanamide.|$|E
50|$|Maratheftiko is {{an ancient}} grape variety {{indigenous}} to Cyprus. It is also known locally as Vambakadha (Βαμβακάδα), Vambakina (Βαμβακίνα), Pampakia (Παμπακιά), Mavrospourtiko (Μαυροσπούρτικο), Aloupostaphylo (Αλουποστάφυλο). It is grown in sparse quantities around the island but mostly in the Pitsilia region. In the 1980s, with the revival of small boutique wineries in Cyprus this variety was rediscovered and its cultivation is slowly on the increase again, as it offers a distinctive character to local wines. Keo, the largest winery on the island {{has been one of}} the companies to encourage its growth.

40|$|The rapid {{production}} of small fruiting grapevines under controlled environmental conditions is an invaluable tool for viticulture research, particularly studies involving flowering, fruit set, and berry development. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine an optimal growth strategy to produce experimental grapevine plants with adequate and consistent reproductive performance and to fully describe the approach to allow other researchers to produce consistent material from controlled environments year-round. Three different nutrient regimes were used to grow Shiraz (Vitis vinifera L.) plants from one-year-old cuttings in perlite:vermiculite and under controlled environmental conditions. Percentage fruit set, Coulure index, and <b>Millerandage</b> index were determined. The growth strategy produced a fruit set percentage > 50 % (in Shiraz) and optimum leaf elemental concentrations. These modifications to the Mullins and Rajasekaran (1981) method, including automated irrigation, improve the assessment and manipulation of grapevine reproductive performance and vine physiology in controlled conditions and highlight the importance of knowing how growth medium contributes to the nutrient status and hence growth of experimental grapevine plants.

40|$|Version of Record online: 12 NOV 2015 Background and Aims: Reproductive {{capacity}} among grapevine cultivars varies considerably and impacts yield. Bioactive amines {{are reported}} {{to be involved in}} many aspects of plant reproductive physiology. We aimed to examine the association between the reproductive performance of cultivars and the concentration of amines in the reproductive organs. Methods and Results: The reproductive performance of Shiraz, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon was assessed by determining fruitset, coulure index, <b>millerandage</b> index, pollen tube growth and stigma receptivity. Endogenous concentration of amines in flowers and berries was measured. Poor reproductive performance exhibited by Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot compared with that of Shiraz was correlated with poor pollen viability. Amine profiles in the flowers and berries varied significantly among cultivars. A significantly higher concentration of diaminopropane was found in Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and correlated with a higher proportion of underdeveloped berries. An aromatic amine phenylethylamine was found to be the major free amine in the flowers of Merlot, a cultivar susceptible to poor fruitset. Conclusion: Variable reproductive performance exhibited by grapevine cultivars is related to differences in pollen viability and amine concentration in the reproductive organs. Significance of the Study: A better understanding of the association between reproductive performance and amines in the reproductive organs of grapevines has been achieved. T. Baby, M. Gilliham, S.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} the Barossa Valley, South Australia, to {{examine the effect of}} rootstocks on reproductive performance of Shiraz (Vitis vinifera L.) under water stress. Vines were grown on own roots or grafted to 110 R, 1103 P, 99 R, Ramsey, Schwarzmann, or 140 Ru. Vines either were unirrigated or irrigation was applied at 56 to 128 mm/ha across three seasons. Water stress (Psi(pd) < 0. 8 MPa) was apparent in the unirrigated vines from veraison onward. The absence of irrigation strongly influenced vine growth and performance. Pruning weight, cane weight, and cane number were all reduced as a consequence of zero irrigation. Yields were reduced in unirrigated treatments due to a reduction in cluster number, cluster weight, and berry weight rather than fruit set or berry number. Unirrigated Ramsey was the only rootstock able to maintain yield comparable with irrigated rootstocks. Unirrigated own roots performed well in the first season but not {{in the second and third}} seasons when water stress had a negative effect on yield. <b>Millerandage,</b> coulure, and seedless berry numbers were the main reproductive parameters found to have a negative impact on yield and both own-rooted and grafted vines were as susceptible to these parameters.
