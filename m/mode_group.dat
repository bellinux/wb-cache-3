50|$|The mandrel {{diameter}} {{and number of}} turns are chosen to eliminate certain modes in a reproducible way. It is empirically observed that more than 5 full 360 degree wraps creates little additional loss, so 3 to 5 turns are commonly specified. The {{mandrel diameter}} affects how far into the mode volume the modal unbinding occurs. Experimentally, one plots the transmitted power from a wrapped fibre into which a uniform modal power distribution has been excited, {{as a function of}} mandrel diameter, maintaining a constant number of turns. This reveals step-like reductions in transmitted power as the diameter decreases, where each step is {{the point at which the}} mandrel is beginning to affect the next-lower <b>mode</b> <b>group.</b> For best measurement reproducibility, one would select a diameter that is not near such a transition, although this may not be possible if measurements must be performed over a range of wavelengths.

50|$|In {{the absence}} of strong mode-mixing, high order mode {{filtering}} is the primary remaining mechanism for potential change of an input mode power distribution. If a well-aligned laser is the optical source, the mode power distribution is highly concentrated in the lowest order modes, and remains essentially unchanged with distance {{due to the lack}} of mode-mixing. If an optical source that overfills the fibre is used, only the highest order guided <b>mode</b> <b>group</b> experiences excess attenuation, and the mode power distribution becomes slightly filtered as a result. (Mandrel wrapping is a viable method to artificially create this state.) Such mode power distributions are stationary; neither changes with fibre length, but equilibrium does not exist in either case because the distributions remain dependent on the input power distribution.|$|E

MGDM has been proposed {{as a way of}} creating parallel, independent communication chan-nels over multimode fiber (MMF) links using different groups of modes. When the effect of dispersion can be neglected, the output electrical signals of an MGDM link are related to the input ones via a real-valued transmission matrix. The transmission matrix is vulnerable to changes in the modal spectrum of the propagating mode groups {{as well as to the}} coupling of light at the input and output of the MMF.
