40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} behavioral and neural effects of <b>motor,</b> mental, <b>and</b> combined <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> mental training on a finger tapping task. The motor or mental training groups trained on a finger-sequence {{for a total}} of 72 [*]min over 6 weeks. The <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> mental training group received 72 [*]min <b>motor</b> training <b>and</b> in addition 72 [*]min mental training. Results showed that all groups increased their tapping performance significantly on the trained sequence. After training functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was collected and indicated training specific increases in ventral pre-motor cortex following <b>motor</b> training, <b>and</b> in fusiform gyrus following mental training. Combined <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> mental training activated both the <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> the visual regions. In addition, <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> mental training showed a significant increase in tapping performance on an untrained sequence (transfer). fMRI scanning indicated that the transfer effect involved the cerebellum. Conclusions were that combined <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> mental training recruited both <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> visual systems, <b>and</b> that combined <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> mental training improves motor flexibility via connections from both <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> cognitive systems to the cerebellum...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This review aims {{to give an}} {{overview}} of studies providing evidence for a relationship between <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> cognitive skills in typically developing children. Design: A systematic review. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and PsychINFO were searched for relevant articles. A total of 21 articles were included in this study. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. <b>Motor</b> <b>and</b> cognitive skills were divided into six categories. Results: There was either no correlation in the literature, or insufficient evidence for or against many correlations between <b>motor</b> skills <b>and</b> cognitive skills. However, weak-to-strong evidence was found for some correlations between underlying categories of <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> cognitive skills, including complex <b>motor</b> skills <b>and</b> higher order cognitive skills. Furthermore, a stronger relationship between underlying categories of <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> cognitive skills was found in pre-pubertal children compared to pubertal children (older than 13 years). Conclusions: Weak-to-strong relations were found between some <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> cognitive skills. The results suggest that complex motor intervention programs {{can be used to}} stimulate both <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> higher order cognitive skills in pre-pubertal children.

40|$|Hereditary <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> sensory {{neuropathy}} type V is a {{very rare}} disease in which hereditary spastic paraplegia is associated with peripheral <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> sensory neuropathy.

Hereditary <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> sensory neuropathy type V is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait usually showing incomplete penetrance. So far, no molecular data {{are available in the}} literature about this disease. In our study we present clinical and molecular data from a large Italian family displaying hereditary <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> sensory neuropathy type V. Taking into account the clinical features in this family, we have performed a linkage analysis for markers strictly associated with all the known loci for autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia <b>and</b> hereditary <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> sensory neuropathy type II, and have found no linkage to these loci.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of neural <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> sensory {{systems in the}} processing of language has so far mainly been studied in native (L 1) speakers. In an fMRI experiment, we investigated whether non-native (12) semantic representations are rich enough to allow for activation in <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> somatosensory brain areas. German learners of Dutch and a control group of Dutch native speakers made lexical decisions about visually presented Dutch <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> non-motor verbs. Region-of-interest (ROI) and whole-brain analyses indicated that 12 speakers, like L 1 speakers, showed significantly increased activation for simple motor compared to non-motor verbs in <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> somatosensory regions. This effect was not restricted to Dutch-German cognate verbs, but was also present for non-cognate verbs.

40|$|Abstract The heat {{generated}} at the <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> inverter inside the electric compressor of inverter built-in type is mainly cooled by refrigerant and generally, {{there is not}} a thermal problem. However, the close relation of heat transfer from the <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> inverter parts to the compression part affects on compressor efficiency. Also, according to the surrounding environment and system operation condition, the increased temperature of the <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> inverter can affect the power density of the <b>motor</b> system, <b>and</b> especially, the inverter may be prevented to operate by the temperature limits. In this study, we performed thermo-flow analysis of electric compressor <b>motor</b> system, <b>and</b> investigated the heat dissipation enhancement of the <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> inverter. The <b>motor</b> part in the operation region of the electric compressor was generally maintained at low temperature and the inverter part at high compressor speed was lower temperature than the temperature limit of 85 â„ƒ. However, the case of the inverter at low speed harsh condition was in excess of 10 â„ƒ. Therefore, in order to solve the thermal problem, the heat reduction technology of the <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> inverter is essential as well as the improvement of flow path i...|$|R

5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxideâ€“nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosiumâ€“cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> wind turbine generators.|$|E
