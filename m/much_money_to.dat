5|$|While Argentina's {{finances}} {{were extremely}} strained {{at this juncture}} following the economic crisis in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested almost twice as <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision {{had been made to}} abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the Perónist era.|$|E
5|$|In 1030, the Rus' {{raided the}} region of Shirvan; the ruler of Ganja then paid them <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> help {{suppress}} a revolt in Beylagan. Afterwards, the Rus' returned home. According to one source, in November 1031 the Rus' returned, but were defeated near Baku and expelled. The year of 1032 saw another Rus' raid into Shirvan; {{they were joined by}} the Alans and Sarir. Local Muslims defeated the Rus' in 1033. It is unclear to which Rus' grouping these raiders belonged. Omeljan Pritsak suggests that they operated out of a base near the Terek estuary and had their principal home in Tmutarakan. Pritsak also speculated that the Rus', operating from the Caspian basin, shortly thereafter lent support to the Oghuz in a power struggle in Khwarezm.|$|E
5|$|Introducing {{more taxes}} {{proved to be}} hugely unpopular among both Democrats and Republicans, {{and the people of}} the state simply did not have that <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> give. Bond issues {{generated}} controversy and were the source of scandals in the administration. All of the old railroad and infrastructure bonds, including the controversial Holford bonds which had already been declared illegal by the Arkansas Supreme Court, were gathered into a funding act and passed by the legislature. Many bonds were issued for roads and railroads that were never built, or were constructed and then torn up and rebuilt in another direction. Some projects even received the same amount of funding from different bonds, such as embankments built for railroads where roads were funded to be built by a different bond. One of the most controversial bonds involved the purchase of slate for a state penitentiary roof, which was diverted for the construction of a mansion of a Republican official J.L. Hodges, who eventually served jail time for the incident. Promissory notes, or scrip, were issued to raise money. The money was used for construction projects, and invested in public infrastructure. Article VI, Sec 10 of the new constitution stated that the credit of the state could not be loaned without the consent of the voters, making these promissory notes illegal. Their introduction also caused actual currency to go out of circulation.|$|E

25|$|Fur {{commerce}} made {{a permanent}} {{residence in the}} country worthwhile. Good relations with the aboriginal providers were necessary. For some fishermen however, a seasonal presence was sufficient. Commercial companies were founded that tried to further {{the interest of the}} Crown in colonizing the territory. They demanded that France grant a monopoly to one single company. In return, this company would also take over the colonization of the French American territory. Thus, it would not cost the king <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> build the colony. On the other hand, other merchants wanted commerce to stay unregulated.

25|$|In 2007, Congress {{took up the}} reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which {{provides}} health care for about 6 million children and 670,000 adults from families who earn too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> qualify for Medicare {{but not enough to}} afford health insurance. Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. Such children and their families are often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} McCune's {{religious}} beliefs {{is open to}} dispute. Mormon missionary Stuart Martin wrote in 1920 that McCune was not a Mormon, but had many Mormon friends and had given <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the church. Judge Orlando Powers, Associate Justice of the Utah Supreme Court, said in 1906 that he understood that McCune was not a Mormon. Frank J. Cannon, too, claimed McCune was not a Mormon,and B. H. Roberts, LDS Church historian {{and member of the}} First Council of the Seventy, said in 1930 that McCune was not a church member. Historian Orvin Malmquist, however, says that church records show he was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of eight in 1857, and that his marriage to Elizabeth Claridge in a Mormon temple in 1872 could not have occurred without his being a church member. It is not in dispute that he was baptized by proxy in 1969.|$|E

500|$|Handicapper Brandon Lang told ESPN that it {{is fairly}} easy for a crooked sports {{official}} to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a [...] "rogue official". According to Lang, an official can directly influence {{the outcome of a}} game 75 percent of the time if he has money on the game. For instance, Lang said that a crooked NBA referee can fix the total score by calling enough fouls to get both teams in the bonus. When a game is being fixed, Lang said, the officials should be the prime suspects because the players are making too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> risk their future.

500|$|Peyton {{explained}} the writing by saying [...] "it always {{comes out of}} an emotional place." [...] One of the writers was Karen Walton, who had previously written the Canadian werewolf film Ginger Snaps. [...] The producers chose the type of animation due to Peyton's personal interest in it, although he later claimed that a day's work could lead to seconds' worth of material. [...] A factory was needed with 8 to 10 teams, {{with some of the}} animators having previously worked on the Tim Burton film Corpse Bride. [...] The characters were made out of plastic and foam. [...] Additionally, some animation was done through computers. [...] Each character's figure had a number of add-on lips to express various sounds, and their eyes and eyebrows were also adjusted frequently during production. [...] The figures could also be fastened into a surface, moved and fastened in again to portray movement. [...] Peyton remarked that [...] "The hardest thing is timing and pacing." [...] Still, he also liked to emphasize that the series did not cost too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> produce.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{interpreted}} as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy {{said it did}} so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the New York Post, wrote that by depicting future humans as [...] "a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", WALL-E was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a [...] "fascinating" [...] and occasionally [...] "brilliant" [...] production).|$|E
500|$|While playing {{shows in}} England in 1969, the band {{discovered}} {{they were being}} mistaken for another English group named Earth. They decided to change their name again. A cinema {{across the street from}} the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film Black Sabbath starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was [...] "strange that people spend so <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> see scary movies." [...] Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called [...] "Black Sabbath", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed. Making use of the musical tritone, also known as [...] "the Devil's Interval", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track [...] "probably the most evil song ever written". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.|$|E

500|$|In the {{run up to}} the Democratic National Convention, set {{to begin}} at the Chicago Coliseum on July 7, 1896, no {{candidate}} {{was seen as an}} overwhelming favorite for the presidential nomination. [...] The leading candidates were former Missouri congressman Richard P. Bland and former Iowa governor Horace Boies. [...] "Silver Dick" [...] Bland was seen as the elder statesman of the silver movement; he had originated the Bland-Allison Act of 1878, while Boies' victories for governor in a normally Republican state made him attractive as a candidate who might compete with McKinley in the crucial Midwest. [...] Both had openly declared their candidacies, and were the only Democrats to have organizations seeking to obtain pledged delegates. [...] Neither candidate had <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> spend on his campaign. [...] In addition to the frontrunners, other silver men were spoken of as candidates. [...] These included Vice President [...] Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, Senator Joseph C. Blackburn of Kentucky, Indiana Governor Claude Matthews, and Bryan. [...] Illinois Governor Altgeld, a leader of the silver movement, was ineligible because he was not a natural-born U.S. citizen as required for the presidency in the Constitution. [...] When Senator Teller walked out of the Republican convention in protest over the currency plank, he immediately became another possible candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. [...] However, he was deemed unlikely to succeed, as many Democrats feared that if elected, he might fill some patronage jobs with Republicans. [...] President Cleveland spent the week of the convention fishing, and had no comment about the events there; political scientist Richard Bensel attributes Cleveland's political inaction to the President's loss of influence in his party.|$|E
