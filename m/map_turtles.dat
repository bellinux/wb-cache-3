50|$|Throughout the pet trade, Mississippi, common, and Ouachita <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> were bred and hatched {{out by the}} {{thousands}} in the 1970s. Various other turtles were available, but as the salmonellosis Four-inch Law was established, <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> and others slowly decreased in popularity. Today, these same three still hold the title for most common among the pet trade. Other species being captive-bred more often include the Texas map turtle, Cagle's map turtle, and the black-knobbed map turtle. Some harder-to-find <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> include the yellow-blotched map turtle and the Pearl River map turtle.|$|E
50|$|Owning Barbour's <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> {{is illegal}} in Georgia, Michigan, and Alabama. The limit is two turtles per person in Florida. Like all <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{they are under}} the {{protection}} of the Salmonellosis Four-inch Regulation, disallowing these turtles to be sold if they are under the length of 4 in (10 cm).|$|E
50|$|Yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> are medium- to small-sized turtles, with males {{ranging from}} 3.5 to 4.5 in (9-11.5 cm) in {{carapace}} length as adults. Adult females are larger, about 5 to 7.5 in (13-19 cm) in carapace length. The yellow-blotched map turtle {{has the highest}} central keel of all <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Ouachita <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> or Sabine <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys ouachitensis) is {{a species}} of turtle endemic to the United States.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} in the Pascagoula River in the United States. It {{formerly}} included a population in the Pearl River, but in 2010, that population was described as a separate species, the Pearl River <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> Graptemys pearlensis. The Pascagoula <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> shares its range with the yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> G. flavimaculata.|$|R
50|$|Cagle's map turtle has {{intricate}} {{patterns on}} the carapace and plastron, as well as serrated edges on the posterior of the carapace, as is typical of all <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b> It is smaller than most <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> and very sexually dimorphic, with males reaching only 4 in carapace length while females can exceed 7 in in carapace length.|$|E
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{has been}} an option for conservation efforts, also. Captive breeding is plausible for increasing population sizes in captivity. However, it remains unclear if captive-bred black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> can be released into the wild and breed on their own. Black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> are popular in the pet trade, but became more common because of captive breeding.|$|E
50|$|Barbour's <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> mainly consume mollusks, insects, {{and small}} fish found in rivers.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys geographica), or common <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> is an aquatic turtle in {{the family}} Emydidae. It is endemic to North America. This turtle is kept as a pet.|$|R
50|$|The Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys pulchra) is {{a species}} of emydid turtle endemic to the {{southern}} United States. Differentiation from other turtle species includes a black stripe running {{down the center of}} its back with knobs extruding from it, but these projections wear down with age. T.H. Bean and L. Kumlen first collected the Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> in July 1876 from a lake near Montgomery, Alabama. Type locality for this species is Montgomery County, Alabama. Baur described and named the Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> in 1893. The genus Graptemys includes nine species of mostly aquatic turtles.|$|R
50|$|The false <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> was {{discovered}} locally in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Average life {{expectancy}} of <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> ranges from 15 to 100 years, depending on species.|$|E
50|$|This turtle is dormant around November {{through early}} April {{depending}} on local climactic factors. Northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> spend the winter under water {{and do not}} surface to breathe, especially when ice cover makes this impossible. Adults rest on the bottom or wedged underneath rocks or logs and often hibernate communally with other northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> where they may remain somewhat active. Hibernacula must be well oxygenated because, unlike some other turtle species such as painted turtles, <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> need to absorb oxygen from the water to survive the winter. They are avid baskers and bask in groups. They are diurnal. They are also very wary animals; at {{the slightest hint of}} danger, they slip into the water and hide.|$|E
50|$|Like most jurisdictions of the United States, Canada lists {{northern}} <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> as {{a species}} of special concern.|$|E

50|$|The false <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> {{lives in}} large streams of the Missouri and Mississippi River systems, ranging from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, through the Dakotas southward to southwestern Alabama, {{southern}} and western Mississippi, and Louisiana.

50|$|Yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> feed {{mostly on}} insects, but are {{opportunistic}} feeders, so also consume crustaceans, fish, and some fresh plant matter.|$|E
50|$|Graptemys is a genus of aquatic, {{freshwater}} turtles, known commonly as <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> {{or sometimes}} sawback turtles, which are endemic to North America.|$|E
50|$|Ouachita <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> feed {{mainly on}} small aquatic {{animals such as}} shrimp, insects, molluscs, and fish. They also consume algae and aquatic plants.|$|E
5000|$|The Bellows Bay portion {{is home to}} the spiny {{softshell}} <b>turtle</b> and the <b>map</b> <b>turtle.</b> This is the only known location on the Ottawa River for the {{spiny softshell}}, which is designated as [...] "Threatened" [...] under the Canadian Species At Risk Act, while the <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> is designated as [...] "Special Concern".|$|R

5000|$|Megacephalic {{females have}} {{exceptionally}} broad heads, and feed {{almost exclusively on}} mollusks. Megacephalic females include Barbour's, Escambia, Pascagoula, Pearl River, and Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{considered}} habitat specialists {{and may be}} replaced by a more tolerant species when their habitat is altered. Unfortunately the effects of human interference by way boating and recreation on shorelines are likely impeding the map turtle from re-establishing itself in natural areas. Thus, populations of Northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> have probably declined across their entire natural range but they remain widespread and may be abundant in some locations. This species has classified as least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5000|$|Microcephalic {{females are}} narrow headed, {{sympatric}} with a broader headed species, and consume few mollusks. Microcephalic species include yellow-blotched, black-knobbed, ringed, Ouachita, and Sabine <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|E

50|$|Until 2010, it was {{included}} in the Pascagoula <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (G. gibbonsi), which it resembles.|$|R
50|$|Two {{species of}} turtles are endemic as well: flatted muck <b>turtle</b> and Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys nigrinoda), {{formerly}} known as the black-knobbed sawback, is a small to medium-sized aquatic turtle with light gray skin. Some of the most distinguishing characteristics of the black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the Graptemys genus, are the protruding “spikes” on the turtle’s carapace. This species inhabits mainly the fall lines of rivers in the Mobile Bay drainage, in Alabama and Mississippi.|$|R
