5|$|As {{often the}} most {{abundant}} apex predator within its ecosystem, the blacktip reef shark {{plays a major role}} in structuring inshore ecological communities. Its diet is composed primarily of small teleost fishes, including <b>mullet,</b> groupers, grunters, jacks, mojarras, wrasses, surgeonfish, and smelt-whitings. Groups of blacktip reef sharks in the Indian Ocean have been observed herding schools of <b>mullet</b> against the shore for easier feeding. Squid, octopus, cuttlefish, shrimp, and mantis shrimp are also taken, as well as carrion and smaller sharks and rays, though this is rare. Off northern Australia, this species is known to consume sea snakes, including Acrochordus granulatus, Hydrelaps darwiniensis, Hydrophis spp. and Lapemis hardwickii. Sharks off Palmyra Atoll have been documented preying on seabird chicks that have fallen out of their nests into the water. Miscellaneous items that have been found inside the stomachs of this species include algae, turtle grass, coral, hydrozoa, bryozoa, rats, and stones.|$|E

5|$|The loss {{of teeth}} with age in Limusaurus {{is the most}} extreme case of tooth {{morphology}} changing with age among dinosaurs. In fact, Limusaurus {{is one of the}} only known jawed vertebrates where teeth are completely lost during ontogeny (the others are the red <b>mullet</b> and striped red <b>mullet,</b> several armored catfish, and the platypus). Its complicated pattern of losing teeth from both the front and the back is most {{similar to that of the}} avialan Jeholornis. The temporary halt in tooth replacement likely results from the replacement tooth buds regressing, as in the veiled chameleon. Combined with the retention of the developmental signal pathways necessary to induce tooth development in birds, the ontogenetic replacement of teeth by a beak in Limusaurus suggests that the development of beaks in other lineages of theropods, and indeed beaked animals in general, may be related to developmental changes that heterochronically alter the point at which tooth development halts.|$|E

5|$|A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds {{primarily}} on small, bony fishes, including pinfish, croakers, porgies, anchovies, spiny boxfish, and porcupinefish, {{as well as}} on octopus and other cephalopods. When competing for bait, their speed allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the Caribbean reef shark (C. perezi). This species may form large schools that are sometimes associated with anchovies and <b>mullet.</b> Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of philopatry: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Monogenoidea {{pathogenic}} {{activity can}} elicit various histological responses in fish. Species of Ligophorus are specific parasites of <b>mullets,</b> {{and its relationship}} with host fish {{may result in a}} moderate pathogenic action. In order to ascertain this relationship, estuarine <b>mullets</b> (Mugil liza) were collected in an estuary, reared in laboratory, for three weeks, and forwarded for histological and parasitological analyses. Ligophorus uruguayense (Monogenoidea) infestation in the gills of the <b>mullets</b> was identified. The severe infestation by only one species of Monogenoidea may result from the specificity of these parasites to <b>mullets.</b> <b>Mullets</b> submitted to histological analysis exhibited respiratory epithelium detachment; mild, moderate and severe hyperplasia of the respiratory epithelium; atrophy; and telangiectasia of the gills. This is the first study reporting that <b>mullets</b> highly infested by Monogenoidea can show mild (100 %) to severe (20 %) gill changes with a distinct frequency of occurrence. Because of the high prevalence of mild alterations observed, it is possible to accept that L. uruguayense is moderately pathogenic to M. liza, even during high prevalence and intensity of infestation, {{as a result of its}} specificity...|$|R

5|$|Tides cause {{seawater}} {{to enter}} {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as <b>mullet</b> (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.|$|E
5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), <b>mullet</b> (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} the trophic shift of young-of-the-year (YoY) thinlip grey <b>mullets</b> Liza ramada and golden grey <b>mullets</b> Liza aurata during their recruitment in a salt marsh located on the European Atlantic coast. Stable isotope signatures (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of the fishes followed a pattern, with enrichments in 13 C and 15 N to increasing length: δ 13 C in fishes 30 mm δ 13 C ranged from - 15. 8 to - 12. 7 ‰, closer to the level in salt marsh food resources. Large differences between the δ 15 N values of <b>mullets</b> and those of food sources (6. 0 ‰ on average) showed that YoY are secondary consumers, like older individuals, when feeding in the salt marsh. YoY <b>mullets</b> shift from browsing on pelagic prey to grazing on benthic resources from the salt marsh before reaching 30 mm in length. The results highlight the role of European salt marshes as nurseries for juvenile <b>mullets...</b>|$|R

5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, <b>mullet,</b> mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} slowly {{organized for}} the next day, as it drifted to the northeast. On July 17, the rate of organization and development of deep convection increased considerably, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny later that day. From the night of July 17 through July 18, Danny quickly developed deep convection and banding features in the favorable environment of the Gulf of Mexico, and reached hurricane status later on July 18. Located between two high pressure systems, Danny continued its unusual July track to the northeast, and crossed over southeastern Louisiana near the Mississippi River Delta. A small storm, Danny continued to strengthen after reaching the coastal waters off Mississippi {{on the night of}} July 18, and attained a peak of 80mph (130km/h) early on July 19.

5|$|The {{wildlife}} on Ford Island {{is likely}} {{very similar to}} that on Naval Station Pearl Harbor. Wildlife is sparse and dominated by invasive species such as the house mouse, mongoose, brown rat, black rat, house sparrow, Java sparrow and common mynah. An endangered owl, the endemic pueo (a subspecies of the short-eared owl), has been seen hunting on the island. Nearly all the plant life on the island is non-native, including edible cacti from California introduced in the late 1700s by Francisco de Paula Marín. The island's harbor was important to ancient Hawaiians for its ample supply of fish, including <b>mullet,</b> milkfish and Hawaiian anchovy.

5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, {{the common}} torpedo spends much time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, <b>mullet,</b> gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E
