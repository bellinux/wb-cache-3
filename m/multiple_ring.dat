50|$|In organic chemistry, the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) {{reaction}} is an organic chemical reaction between a diyne (2 alkyne functional groups {{arranged in a}} conjugated system) and an alkyne to form a reactive benzyne species, via a 4+2 cycloaddition reaction. This benzyne intermediate then reacts with a suitable trapping agent to form a substituted aromatic product. This {{reaction is}} a derivative of the established Diels-Alder reaction and proceeds via a similar 4+2 cycloaddition mechanism.

The stable and uniform dual wave length oscillation is obtained by the highly-nonlinear photonic crystal fiber(HN-PCF),which can generate the four-wave-mixing(FWM) effective.

40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to the design of a new negative liquid crystal (LC) lens with <b>multiple</b> <b>ring</b> electrodes in unequal widths. The number and widths of the <b>multiple</b> <b>ring</b> electrodes are designed to offer online tunability on focusing length by predetermined individual electrode voltages. This aims to render a smooth refraction index distribution that mimics well a divergent lens based on the theory of a gradient refraction index (GRIN) lens. Finally, the proposed negative LC lens is fabricated with the capability of realizing different focus lengths in a relatively large aperture of 5 mm and a thickness of 0. 7 mm. Experiments are conducted to verify expected light-diverging performance. The effective focus length (EFL) is measured based on interference patterns. It is shown that the proposed negative LC lens is able to realize light-divergent effects with an EFL as short as 357. 9 mm.

40|$|In this paper, a {{computer-based}} {{analysis is}} performed to study layout solutions aimed at increasing the breakdown voltage in Si-microstrip detectors. For optimum performance {{it is crucial}} to achieve maximum breakdown voltage for Si detectors operating at very high bias due to the extremely hostile radiation environment of next generation experiments such as LHC. The performance of Si-microstrip detectors can be improved by implementing floating field-limiting rings around the active detector area. A simulation study has been carried out to evaluate the distribution of breakdown voltage as a function of guard-ring spacing (GS). The purpose of this work is to find a criterion to optimize GS for <b>multiple</b> <b>ring</b> structures incorporating various physical and geometrical parameters as an aid to design optimization. Using this criterion the optimum spacing of guard rings for <b>multiple</b> <b>ring</b> structures was obtained. The proposed criterion is very robust and is insensitive to the number of guard rings, junction depth and radiation damage.

40|$|Novel {{compact design}} for 4 -channel SOI-based {{reconfigurable}} optical add/drop multiplexer using microring resonators is presented and analyzed. Microring resonators have two important attributes {{as a key}} new technology for future optical communications, namely functionality and compactness. Functionality refers {{to the fact that}} a wide range of desirable filter characteristics can be synthesized by coupling <b>multiple</b> <b>rings.</b> Compactness refers the fact that ring resonators with radii about 30 mu m can lead to large scale integration of devices with densities on the order of 10 (4) similar to 10 (5) devices per square centimeter. A 4 -channel reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexer comprises a grid-like array of ridge waveguides which perpendicularly cross through each other. SOI-based resonators consisted of <b>multiple</b> <b>rings</b> at each of the cross-grid nodes serve as the wavelength selective switch, and they can switch an optical signal between two ports by means of tuning refractive index of one of the rings. The thermo-optic coefficient of silicon is 1. 86 x 10 (- 4) /K. Thus a temperature rise of 27 K will increase the refractive index by 5 x 10 (- 3), which is enough to cause the switching of our designed microring resonators. The thermo-optic effect is used to suppress the resonator power transfer, rather than to promote loss. Thus, the input signal only suffers small attenuation and simultaneously low crosstalk can be achieved by using <b>multiple</b> <b>rings...</b>|$|R
