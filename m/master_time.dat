50|$|The Readiness Occupational Badge was {{introduced}} by the CSAF in February 2006 with an official wear date of 1 October 06.

The benzene ring signifies the molecular composition of the chemical benzene. It has six points for each atom of carbon and hydrogen, representing the basic elements of chemistry. These elements of design allude to their chemical-related functions and deeply rooted history in the U.S. Army AirCorps to today’s Air Force. There are three different types of the occupational badge, which consist of basic, senior, and <b>master.</b> <b>Time</b> in position and expertise in the career field is what distinguishes the difference between them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new perturbative {{formulation}} of non-equilibrium thermal field theory, based upon non-homogeneous free propagators and time-dependent vertices. The resulting time-dependent diagrammatic perturbation series {{are free of}} pinch singularities {{without the need for}} quasi-particle approximation or effective resummation of finite widths. After arriving at a physically meaningful definition of particle number densities, we derive <b>master</b> <b>time</b> evolution equations for statistical distribution functions, which are valid to all orders in perturbation theory and all orders in a gradient expansion. For a scalar model, we make a loopwise truncation of these evolution equations, whilst still capturing fast transient behaviour, which is found to be dominated by energy-violating processes, leading to non-Markovian evolution of memory effects. 1...|$|E
