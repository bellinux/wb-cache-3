25|$|By {{the end of}} the Augustan period Ovid, Rome's leading {{literary}} figure, {{proposed a}} radically new agenda focused on love between men and women: <b>making</b> <b>love</b> with a woman is more enjoyable, he says, because unlike the forms of same-sex behavior permissible within Roman culture, the pleasure is mutual. Ovid does include mythological treatments of homoeroticism in the Metamorphoses, but Thomas Habinek has pointed out that the significance of Ovid's rupture of human erotics into categorical preferences has been obscured in the history of sexuality by a later heterosexual bias in Western culture.|$|E
