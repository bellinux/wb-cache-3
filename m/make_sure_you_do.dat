May God forsake the one who follows them, and purify the earth of their likes. He also stated that, [...] Ibn Taymiyya is a servant whom God has forsaken, led astray, made blind and deaf, and degraded. Such is the explicit verdict of the leading scholars who have exposed the rottenness of his ways and the errors of his statements.|$|E

Here {{is an example of}} DHE staining on mouse aorta. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") ### Procedure 1. Open image in Image J. - Go to Image→Color→Split Channel. You will get three images in gray scale showing signals in red (image 1), green (image 2) or blue channel. I don’t have anything in blue channel, so just ignore the split result in blue channel. As you will see, I do have auto-fluorescent signal in the red channel, which was not showing obviously in the overlay. This is why I do not recommend only capture DHE signal and use the “measure” function, which will count both DHE signal and auto-fluorescent signal. (There is an exception. If you have super strong signal, you could use very low exposure time to avoid capturing the auto-fluorescent signal.) ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") Image 1 ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") Image 2 3. Go to Process→Image Calculator. Subtract the image green (image 2) from image red (image 1). 4. If the intensities of auto florescence are similar in these two channels, you will get rid off the auto fluorescence in red channel in the result (a new image will pop up, image 3). If you still have auto fluoresce in the result, just simply do the subtraction again. <b>Make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> everything the same for images in all groups. ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") Image 3 5. Now we are ready to count the intensively of DHE signal. Click the result image (image 3), Go to Analyze → Measure, you will get integrated intensity for DHE signal. 6. You may notice, when you take images, the amount of blood vessel in each image may be different. For normalization, I count the area of auto fluorescence to represent the sample size in the image using image 2. Click image 2, go to Process→ Binary→ Make Binary (image 4). The binary step takes out the intensity variation of auto fluorescence in each image. Now, click image 4, Go to Analyze → Measure. Use the integrated intensity (represents area of auto fluorescence) for normalization. ![Figure 5]([URL] "Figure 5 ") Image 4 7.

500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to <b>do</b> as <b>you</b> want, but <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is the right thing".

60|$|Write down then, frankly, {{what you}} are, or, at least, {{what you think}} yourself, not {{dwelling}} upon those inevitable faults which I have just told you are of little consequence, and which the action of a right life will shake or smooth away; but that you may determine {{to the best of}} your intelligence what you are good for and can be made into. You will find that the mere resolve not to be useless, and the honest desire to help other people, will, in the quickest and delicatest ways, improve yourself. Thus, from the beginning, consider all your accomplishments as means of assistance to others; read attentively, in this volume, paragraphs 74, 75, 19, and 79, {3} and you will understand what I mean, with respect to languages and music. In music especially you will soon find what personal benefit there is in being serviceable: it is probable that, however limited your powers, you have voice and ear enough to sustain a note of moderate compass in a concerted piece;--that, then, is the first thing to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do.</b> Get your voice disciplined and clear, and think only of accuracy; never of effect or expression: if you have any soul worth expressing, it will show itself in your singing; but most likely there are very few feelings in you, at present, needing any particular expression; and the one thing <b>you</b> have to <b>do</b> is to make a clear-voiced little instrument of yourself, which other people can entirely depend upon for the note wanted. So, in drawing, as soon as you can set down the right shape of anything, and thereby explain its character to another person, or make the look of it clear and interesting to a child, you will begin to enjoy the art vividly for its own sake, and all your habits of mind and powers of memory will gain precision: but if you only try to make showy drawings for praise, or pretty ones for amusement, your drawing will have little of real interest for you, and no educational power whatever.|$|R
