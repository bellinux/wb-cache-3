The paradox arises from the fact that this information, which colors our spontaneous view of the situation, is not incorporated in the usual treatments of the inductive situation.|$|E
60|$|Now {{here comes}} in the whole {{collapse}} and huge blunder of our age. We have mixed up two different things, two opposite things. Progress should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are always changing the world to suit the vision. Progress does <b>mean</b> (just now) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are always changing the vision. It should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are slow but sure in bringing justice and mercy among men: it does <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are very swift in doubting the desirability of justice and mercy: a wild page from any Prussian sophist makes men doubt it. Progress should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are always walking towards the New Jerusalem. It does <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the New Jerusalem is always walking away from us. We are not altering the real to suit the ideal. We are altering the ideal: it is easier.|$|R

25|$|This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> stop {{generating}} reflected/transmitted rays {{when the}} computed intensity becomes {{less than a}} certain threshold. You must always set a certain maximum depth or else the program would generate {{an infinite number of}} rays. But it is not always necessary to go to the maximum depth if the surfaces are not highly reflective. To test for this the ray tracer must compute and keep the product of the global and reflection coefficients as the rays are traced.|$|E
25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would have never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E
25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different {{from what it was}} in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E

25|$|In a {{language}} with lazy evaluation, like Haskell, a list is evaluated {{only to the}} degree that its elements are requested: for example, if one asks for the first element of a list, only the first element will be computed. With respect to usage of the list monad for non-deterministic computation that <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can non-deterministically generate a lazy list of all results of the computation and ask for the first of them, and only as much work will be performed as is needed to get that first result. The process roughly corresponds to backtracking: a path of computation is chosen, and then if it fails at some point (if it evaluates mzero), then it backtracks to the last branching point, and follows the next path, and so on. If the second element is then requested, it again does just enough work to get the second solution, and so on. So the list monad is a simple way to implement a backtracking algorithm in a lazy language.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly, gauge {{symmetry}} {{can give}} a deeper explanation {{for the existence of}} interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which {{it turns out that the}} mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(x), where an angle θnbsp&=nbsp&0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θnbsp&=nbsp&90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.|$|E

500|$|On August 27, 2008, a prequel {{comic book}} (leading {{right up to}} the moment in the pilot where Olivia 'first' meets Walter) written by Zack Whedon was {{released}} by DC Comics under its WildStorm imprint. This was to be the first issue of a monthly 6-issue limited series but the others were delayed until January 2009, when monthly publication resumed, with the sixth and final issue scheduled for release on June 17. The Vice President of WildStorm, Hank Kanalz, explained the publication hiatus: [...] "The writers of the show want to make sure the comic book is integrated into the mythology of the Fringe world, so we have decided to refocus the direction of the comic book. Unfortunately, this <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will have some delays, but will be back in January." ...|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} in modern society, control-related and {{prescriptive}} technologies are dominant. [...] "When work is organized as {{a sequence of}} separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," [...] she writes. [...] "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance." [...] For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also {{come to believe that}} there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. [...] "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept {{that there is only one}} way of doing 'it'." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Nomura, [...] "death {{should be}} {{something}} sudden and unexpected, and Aerith's death seemed more natural and realistic." [...] He said: [...] "When I reflect on Final Fantasy VII, {{the fact that}} fans were so offended by her sudden death probably <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were successful with her character. If fans had simply accepted her death, that would have meant she wasn't an effective character." [...] From the original release of the game, rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back, but this was scrapped in development. Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true; [...] "the world was expecting us {{to bring her back}} to life, as this is the classic convention." [...] A lengthy petition asking for Aerith's revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase, but he dismissed it, pointing out that [...] "there are many meanings in Aerith's death and [...] could never happen." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know ... we have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E
