500|$|The siege {{settled down}} into a routine of {{bombardment}} and counter-bombardment. This proved increasingly trying for the defenders, who were running short of manpower, ammunition and supplies. Captain Joseph Bennett, an engineer whom Leake had brought with him, helped to bolster the fortifications but earned the wrath of some in the garrison, who felt that Gibraltar should be abandoned. He wrote to a friend on 6 December {{to tell him that}} [...] "many officers had a design to quit the place and blow up the works but I always opposed them, and mentioned the garrison could be kept with the number of 900 men we had, and no more, as I believe you will have an [...] of. Some was for cuting (sic) <b>my</b> <b>Throat</b> <b>and</b> others for cuting (sic) off my Ears [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|Maria was in poor health, and {{the couple}} moved to Philadelphia shortly after their marriage, {{thinking}} that her lungs could heal there. In Philadelphia, he became {{a contributing editor for}} the Pennsylvania Freeman, an abolitionist newspaper. In the spring of 1845, the Lowells returned to Cambridge to make their home at Elmwood. They had four children, though only one (Mabel, born 1847) survived past infancy. Blanche was born December 31, 1845, but lived only fifteen months; Rose, born in 1849, survived only a few months as well; their only son Walter was born in 1850 but died in 1852. Lowell was very affected by the loss of almost all of his children. His grief over the death of his first daughter in particular was expressed in his poem [...] "" [...] (1847). He again considered suicide, writing to a friend that he thought [...] "of my razors and <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> that I am a fool and a coward not to end it all at once".|$|E

2500|$|By this point, he and {{his wife}} had moved from San Francisco to Palo Alto to be closer to the Palo Alto Clinic, where both were {{receiving}} treatment. Then, in 1959, Patchen noted in the letter quoted above that another surgery at the Presbyterian Medical Center of San Francisco ended in disaster. He wrote, [...] "During [...] surgical procedure for <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> while under complete anesthesia, I suffered another slipped disc." [...] Though he was heavily sedated during the procedure, Patchen suspected that he had been dropped at some point during the procedure (though he couldn't prove it). Tragically, the mishap left him in considerably more pain and disabled for the rest of his life. In 1963, he sued his surgeon for medical malpractice and lost.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{months after}} his father's death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. Maria sought {{consolation}} in her faith and in April was admitted {{as a member of}} the First Reformed Dutch Church. Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year. What he thought of all the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing Redburn: [...] "I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time," [...] the narrator remarks, adding, [...] "I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt... and we removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises up in <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> almost strangles me." [...] According to Arvin's influential suggestion, with Melville, one has to reckon with the [...] "tormented psychology, of the decayed patrician." ...|$|E
60|$|The words left me boldly enough, {{but there}} was a lump in <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> my heart was sick.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{you think}} me a spy," [...] I broke out, and speech stuck in <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> I stood <b>and</b> looked murder {{at the old}} lady for a space, then bowed and turned away.|$|R
60|$|I came to {{a sitting}} posture in an instant, with my kidneys in <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> my hair on end.|$|E
60|$|Then {{something}} {{seemed to}} grip <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> I knew that I had died--for the world floated away from beneath me.|$|E

60|$|So {{he took me}} {{into the}} hut, which was a fine one, very well lighted by a fire in its centre, and gave me Kafir beer to drink, that I {{swallowed}} gratefully, for <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> was dry <b>and</b> still felt {{as though it had}} been scraped.|$|R
6000|$|I {{ought to}} make a large [...] "?" [...] here, but I had better take the {{opportunity}} of telling you I have got rid of <b>my</b> haunting sore <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> conduct myself in a manner not to catch another.|$|R

60|$|He sprang at me, and, though I put up {{the best}} fight that I could in my injured state, got his hands about <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> began to choke me. Scowl ran to help me, but his wound--for he was hurt--or his utter {{exhaustion}} took effect on him. Or perhaps it was excitement. At any rate, he fell down in a fit. I thought that all was over, when again I heard Umbelazi's voice, and felt Saduko's grip loosen at <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> sat up.|$|E

60|$|Our lunch was, as {{the others}} had been, luxurious; but <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> was dry, <b>and</b> I could not eat.

60|$|I never {{finished}} the sentence. I became suddenly conscious of two glaring eyes looking at me, like pieces of live coal, from a crumpled {{heap on the}} ground.

60|$|It {{was high}} time, for I now {{began to be}} {{tortured}} with thirst.

The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that {{changed the nature of}} my thoughts.|$|R
