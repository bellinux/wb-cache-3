50|$|With the {{increase}} of social networking platforms and users, social networking {{has become a major}} and focal part to music <b>marketing</b> adopting the <b>pull</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy. <b>Pull</b> <b>marketing</b> shifts the emphasis and attention onto the customer, trying to market in the correct places by knowing who the target audience is.Consumers are increasingly customizing to better suit their individual needs. Rather than relying on music companies or a DJ to pre-determine the mix of songs on a CD, an increasing number of music listeners are downloading individual tracks and assembling their own sequence of songs. This process is also being replicated with the creation of playlists through platforms such as iTunes, Spotify and Last FM. Fan-built playlists and mixes are taking over the way people get their music. Playlists are inevitably becoming a <b>pull</b> <b>marketing</b> resource that marketing alliances must embrace, due to their ability to be shared via Peer to peer networks.

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of an emerging technology life cycle, there is a discovery or invention that shows promise in addressing a social need or delivering a new technological capability. Emergence and early growth accelerate from this outset to maximum growth at inflection, which is shaped by the interplay of two forces: technology push (also called supply push) and <b>market</b> <b>pull</b> (also called demand pull). With technology push, producers devise and introduce new technology to the market, showcasing their ‘better mousetrap’, making a new solution available before demand is created. With <b>market</b> <b>pull,</b> consumers express unfulfilled wants and needs, urging for a better way of doing things, creating economic incentive for suppliers to provide a new solution.|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} {{influential}} buyers may create a strong enough <b>market</b> <b>pull</b> to accelerate market introduction of an innovative energy efficient fast copier. Procurement of innovative technologies {{is well known}} in the industrial sector. Usually there are very few players involved: one buyer and few manufacturers, and the aim is mainly to increase performance and reduce costs. For several years, co-operative procurement has been used in some countries – e. g. by Nutek in Sweden and by a consortium of utilities SERP (Super Efficient Refrigerator Program) in the U. S. in the “Golden Carrot ” Program – as a Market-Pull measure with the aim to accelerate innovation in energy efficiency of equipment and appliances. What has hardly ever been done is a cooperative procurement at a multinational level. Going international can strengthen the <b>market</b> <b>pull</b> signal (more buyers) in traditional market segments (appliances and equipment), and open new domains for technology procurement activities in international market segments, such as office equipment and consumer electronics. International coordination is an important factor for a strong market-pull. The challenge of the copier procurement project is an accelerated market introduction of innovative copiers with very low standby-mode and short recovery time in the medium speed market segment. If strong <b>market</b> <b>pull</b> helps to advance market introduction by two years, annual energy savings are estimated to be in the order of 10...|$|E

We present the case of an environment-related product innovation in a large multinational company that emerged as the outcome of a complex interaction process in which numerous external and internal actors negotiated to safeguard their own interests. This negotiation perspective challenges conventional economic views of innovations, in which new products and processes are regarded as exogenous variables, the outcomes of deliberately planned research, or the combination of technology (pushing) and <b>market</b> (<b>pulling)</b> inducements. Instead, innovation may be a non-linear, unpredictable process that involves multiple actors with divergent interests and that leads to outcomes that are collectively acceptable but not necessarily (sub) optimal...|$|R

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how organizations become reoriented towards more environmentally apt strategies suffers from previously fragmented conceptual approaches and insufficient attention in research to the process and content of such ecological reorientations. This paper develops an orientational framework that systematizes different conceptualizations in the organizational, strategy and marketing literature and adds an ecological orientation. The framework is applied to an exploratory case study of an attempted reorientation towards a greener strategy in a household appliance firm. The minor ecological reorientation that occurred {{was found to be}} primarily driven by legislation rather than <b>market</b> <b>pull</b> owing to the dominant production orientation of the firm. Thus it is suggested here that the relative effectiveness of legislative push or <b>market</b> <b>pull</b> in achieving ecological reorientation varies according to the initial orientation of the firms.
