5|$|Eleven {{male athletes}} competed {{in track and}} field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4×400 <b>meters</b> relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4×400 <b>meters</b> relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an {{individual}} event and the 4×400 <b>meters</b> relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 <b>meters,</b> 40 <b>meters,</b> 200 <b>meters,</b> triple jump, 110 <b>meters</b> hurdles, and high jump).

5|$|The city is {{difficult}} to excavate, as it is buried deep under the later layers of habitation. A defensive system against floods, composed of a circular embankment was unearthed, {{in addition to a}} circular 6.7m thick internal rampart to protect the city from enemies. An area of 300 <b>meters</b> long filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters, separated the outer embankment from the inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 <b>meters,</b> and was strengthened by defensive towers. Other findings include one of the city gates, a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate, in addition to residential houses. Mari had a central mound, however no temple or palaces have been unearthed, although a large building that seems to have been an administrative one was unearthed which had stone foundations and dimensions of (32 <b>meters</b> X 25 <b>meters),</b> with rooms up to 12 <b>meters</b> long and 6 <b>meters</b> wide.
