5|$|MS 9W {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MS 9 {{to the north}} of Bruce in Calhoun County. The route heads northwest on a two-lane undivided road through a mix of woods and farmlands with a few homes. The road turns to the north and reaches the community of Banner, where the road crosses two County Roads: CR 275 and CR 267. MS 9W enters a dense forest as it curves northwest again and heads into more agricultural fields, coming to a junction with CR 284. After crossing into Lafayette County, the route reaches the community of Paris and intersects the eastern terminus of MS 315 as well as CR 428. After this intersection, MS 9W passes through several <b>more</b> <b>miles</b> of forests, intersecting CR 371 before reaching its terminus at MS 7 to the south of Oxford. MS 9W is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.|$|E

25|$|The {{delay of}} {{hostilities}} {{for ten years}} allowed the free economy of the northern states to continue to industrialize. The southern states, largely based on slave labor and cash crop production, lacked the ability to industrialize heavily. By 1860, the northern states had added many <b>more</b> <b>miles</b> of railroad, steel production, modern factories, and population to the advantages already possessed in 1850. The North was better able to supply, equip, and man its armed forces, which would prove decisive in the later stages of the war.|$|E

On April 1, 1976, the PFW became part of Conrail. Conrail downgraded the line, preferring other parallel lines. On June 2, 1994, the Norfolk Southern Railway bought 18 miles (29km) from Gary to Valparaiso, which {{had been out of}} service since 1991, for $1.4 million.

25|$|Anti-hunting campaigners long urged hunts {{to retain}} their {{tradition}} and equestrian sport by drag hunting, following an artificial scent. Drag hunting involves hunting a scent that has been laid (dragged) over a course with a defined beginning and end, before the day's hunting. The scent, usually a combination of aniseed oils and possibly animal meats or fox urine, is dragged along the terrain for distances usually of 10 or <b>more</b> <b>miles.</b> However, drag hunting is disliked by some advocates of quarry hunting because the trail is pre-determined, thereby eliminating the uncertainty present in the live quarry hunt and {{because they tend to}} be faster. Supporters contend that while drag hunts can be fast, this need not be the case if the scent line is broken up so that the hounds have to search an area to pick up the line.|$|E
25|$|Competitions {{are held}} {{at a number of}} events on the River Thames between April and October. Events are competed at four status levels from Novice to Senior, {{allowing}} the opportunity to compete for anyone from complete beginners and Olympic rowing champions. There are two types of skiff race, long distance and regattas. In long distance processional events, crews set off at time intervals over a course of two or <b>more</b> <b>miles.</b> At regattas, skiff races are non-processional sprint races held over a distance of up to 800 yards with heats and finals. Regatta races usually have one skiff against another, although three lane racing may also occur. There are a number of Trophy competitions. The Ormiston Trophy is awarded to the Club that wins the highest number of events each season overall while the Inter-Club competition is a separate event for top scullers in each club.|$|E

25|$|As the Interstate {{continues}} through the rural area between Wilson and Goldsboro {{it has an}} interchange with County Road 1643 (Alton Road) near mile marker 13. The highway continues north for about eight <b>more</b> <b>miles</b> before having another interchange with US301. Shortly after the US 301 interchange I-795 and US264 merge onto one highway heading west. The four lane highway runs along the southern parts of Wilson which is very rural. The joint highway has an interchange with Downing Street (exit 42) west of the Downing Village neighborhood. As it continues west it crosses over Mill branch before having an interchange with NC 42 (exit 40) south of the Planters Trail neighborhood in the very rural south west area of Wilson. The road turns to the northwest to meet I-95 just a mile to the west. Interstate 795 ends at Interstate 95 at a four leaf clover interchange.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} October 24, 1937 radio show, where Jack proudly {{announced}} {{the purchase of}} his car, a running joke was that Benny drove an old Maxwell automobile, a brand that {{went out of business}} in 1925. Although some details such as the car's body style and its exact model year would vary over the years, what remained constant was that Benny's old car was so worn out that it would barely run, but the miserly Benny insisted he could get a few <b>more</b> <b>miles</b> out of it. Many of the sound effects for the car’s clattering engine came from an actual old motor which the sound effects shop had salvaged from a Los Angeles junkyard. When a sound effects man missed a cue for the automobile engine, Mel Blanc quickly improvised a vocal imitation of a sputtering car engine starting up noisily that was so funny it became a regular feature of the show.|$|E
