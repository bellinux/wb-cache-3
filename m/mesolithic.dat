5|$|Evidence of {{the early}} {{occupation}} of Ditton is scant. A <b>Mesolithic</b> tranchet axe, a sharpening flake, three microliths and 36 blades were found at Ditton, but the exact site of the find is now unknown. <b>Mesolithic</b> flint implements, Iron Age pottery and pit dwellings have also {{been reported in the}} Holt Hill area of Ditton.|$|E
5|$|Settlement of the Coatbridge area {{dates back}} 3000 {{years to the}} <b>Mesolithic</b> Age.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in Ireland for over 9,000 years. The {{different}} eras are termed <b>mesolithic,</b> neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|Portland {{has been}} {{inhabited}} {{since at least}} the <b>Mesolithic</b> period (the Middle Stone Age)—there is archaeological evidence of <b>Mesolithic</b> inhabitants at the Culverwell <b>Mesolithic</b> Site, near Portland Bill, and of habitation since then. The Romans occupied Portland, reputedly calling it Vindelis. The Vikings first raid on England occurred in Portland in 789 AD, as recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. Three lost Viking ships from Hordaland (the district around Hardanger fjord in west Norway) landed at Portland Bill. The king's reeve tried to collect taxes from them, but they killed him and sailed on. In 1539 King Henry VIII ordered the construction of Portland Castle for defence against attacks by the French; the castle cost £4,964. It {{is one of the best}} preserved castles from this period, and is opened to the public by the custodians English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Beginning {{in the fifth}} {{millennium}} BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding <b>Mesolithic</b> period. Archaeologists {{have been unable to}} prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental Europe or because the indigenous <b>Mesolithic</b> Britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies. Either way, it certainly emerged through contact with continental Europe, probably as a result of centuries of interaction between <b>Mesolithic</b> people living in southeast Britain and Linear Pottery culture (LBK) communities in northeastern France. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} the presence of man in these upper areas of Glamorgan was discovered in 1963 at Craig y Llyn. A small chipped stone tool found at the site, recorded as possibly being of 'Creswellian' type or at least from the early <b>Mesolithic</b> period, places human activity on the plateau above the valleys. Many other <b>Mesolithic</b> items have been discovered in the Rhondda, predominantly in the upper areas around Blaenrhondda, Blaencwm and Maerdy, mainly stone age items relating to hunting, fishing and foraging which suggests seasonal nomadic activity. Though no definite <b>Mesolithic</b> settlements have been located in the area, the concentration of finds at the Craig y Llyn escarpment suggests the presence of a temporary campsite in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{upon which}} the settlement of Uxbridge was established is largely unchanged from the <b>Mesolithic</b> era. Much of it was covered by oak and elm trees, which were gradually cleared by early settlers. An archaeological excavation by the Museum of London in the 1990s found evidence of flint items shaped by <b>Mesolithic</b> hunters, as well as various animal bones and traces of charcoal from the remains of campfires.|$|E
5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} little {{to suggest that}} culture in Scotland caught up with developing societies to the south {{during this period of}} improved climatic conditions. Some finds nonetheless indicate the presence of relatively large and well-organised hunter-gatherer societies. No <b>Mesolithic</b> burial sites have been uncovered in Scotland to date. Substantial finds at the village of Dunragit were announced in 2014 including arrowheads, urns and bead necklaces from the <b>Mesolithic.</b> Initial press reports provided no firm dates for these artefacts.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} of human habitation around Ashford since the Iron Age, with a barrow {{on what is}} now Barrow Hill dating back to 1500 BC. Two axes from the Lower Paleolithic period have been found near Ashford. During {{the construction of the}} Park Farm estate in the late 1990s, excavation in the area revealed tools from the Upper Palaeolithic and <b>Mesolithic</b> period dating back to the 7th century BC. A number of other <b>Mesolithic</b> tools were discovered during construction of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link through Ashford.|$|E
5|$|When {{the last}} glacial period ended, the hunter gatherers of the Palaeolithic period {{followed}} the animal herds {{across the land}} between continental Europe and Britain. Then, as conditions continued to improve and vegetation became more able to support a greater diversity of animals, the annual range of seasonal movement by <b>Mesolithic</b> communities decreased, and people became more fixed to particular localities. Until about 6,000BC, <b>Mesolithic</b> people appear to have exploited their environment as they found it. As communities came {{to rely on a}} smaller territorial range and as population levels increased, attempts began to be made to modify or control the natural world. In the Great Wold Valley, pollen samples of <b>Mesolithic</b> date indicate that the forest cover in the area was being disturbed and altered by man, and that open grasslands were being created.|$|E
5|$|According to K. Indrapala, {{cultural}} diffusion, {{rather than}} migration of people, spread the Prakrit and Tamil languages from peninsular India into an existing <b>mesolithic</b> population, centuries before the common era. Tamil Brahmi and Tamil-Prakrit scripts {{were used to}} write the Tamil language during this period on the island.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than it is today, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. <b>Mesolithic</b> {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the <b>Mesolithic</b> period, about 8240 BCE.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, and up until about 12,000 years ago, most of Ireland was {{periodically}} covered in ice. Sea levels were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, formed part of continental Europe. By 16,000 BC, rising sea levels due to ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6000 BC, Great Britain itself became separated from continental Europe. The earliest evidence of human presence in Ireland is dated at 10,500 BC, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone {{found in a}} cave in County Clare. It is not until about 8000 BC, however, that more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for <b>Mesolithic</b> communities around the island. These <b>Mesolithic</b> communities lived as hunter-gatherers across the island until about 4000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of early}} humans hunting four-horned {{antelope}} during the <b>Mesolithic</b> period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago) {{have been found}} in the Kurnool caves of southern India and similar evidence has been found from the Chalcolithic period (3,000 years ago) in Orissa, eastern India.|$|E
5|$|Lundy has {{evidence}} of visitation or occupation from the Neolithic period onward, with <b>Mesolithic</b> flintwork, Bronze Age burial mounds, four inscribed gravestones {{from the early}} medieval period, and an early medieval monastery (possibly dedicated to St Elen or St Helen).|$|E
5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{studies have}} shown that organic {{material}} began to accumulate on the Blackdown Hills in the <b>Mesolithic</b> and Neolithic periods with areas of open meadow, grass land with small woodland components being identified. There are several Bronze Age burial sites including Robin Hood's Butts near Otterford.|$|E
5|$|Pitchstone {{deposits}} on {{the island}} were used locally for making various items in the <b>Mesolithic</b> era. In the Neolithic and the Early Bronze Age pitchstone from the Isle of Arran or items made from it were transported around Britain.|$|E
5|$|Remains of the nilgai {{dating back}} to the Pleistocene have been {{discovered}} from the Kurnool caves in southern India. Evidence suggests that they were hunted by humans during the <b>Mesolithic</b> period (5,000 to 8,000 years ago).|$|E
5|$|The Early Neolithic was {{a revolutionary}} period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a {{widespread}} change in lifestyle as the communities {{living in the}} British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding <b>Mesolithic</b> period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this {{can be attributed to}} an influx of migrants or to indigenous <b>Mesolithic</b> Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.|$|E
5|$|The Stone Age in {{territory}} of today's Poland {{is divided into}} the Paleolithic, <b>Mesolithic</b> and Neolithic eras. The Paleolithic extended from about 500,000 BCE to 8000 BCE. The Paleolithic is subdivided into periods, the Lower Paleolithic, 500,000 to 350,000 BCE, the Middle Paleolithic, 350,000 to 40,000 BCE, the Upper Paleolithic, 40,000 to 10,000 BCE, and the Final Paleolithic, 10,000 to 8000 BCE. The <b>Mesolithic</b> lasted from 8000 to 5500 BCE, and the Neolithic from 5500 to 2300 BCE. The Neolithic is subdivided into the Neolithic proper, 5500 to 2900 BCE, and the Copper Age, 2900 to 2300 BCE.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} sign {{of human}} activity on the island are prehistoric vertebrae of red deer discovered in Five Johns' Cave during an exploration in 1975. Worked flints from the <b>Mesolithic</b> and scrapers from the Neolithic were uncovered {{as part of the}} Priory excavations carried out between 1977 and 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{very limited}} archaeological record {{provides}} scant evidence of <b>Mesolithic</b> life in Orkney, but the later assemblage of houses and monumental Neolithic {{structures in the}} archipelago is without parallel in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After 4500 BCE the Ertebølle {{culture of}} northwestern origin entered a ceramic phase {{with its own}} forms of pottery (characteristic pointed bottoms). They lived by the Baltic Sea shores and were {{specialized}} in utilizing {{the resources of the}} sea, thus still representing the <b>Mesolithic</b> ways of life. At their settlement in Dąbki near Koszalin Stroke-ornamented pottery was found, obtained probably through trade with the Danubian people.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} between 1953 and 1955 by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield from the Ministry of Works {{found evidence of}} extensive human occupation of the area. Consecutive habitation, spanning thousands of years from the Upper Palaeolithic, <b>Mesolithic,</b> and Neolithic periods (Old, Middle, and New Stone Age), to the Bronze and Iron Ages had left numerous artefacts behind. Discoveries have included stone knives, flint blades, {{and the head of}} a mace, along with buildings and graves.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Warren Hill would have {{overlooked}} a large river valley that was to become the English Channel. Once the sea had inundated the surrounding valley, <b>Mesolithic</b> hunter gatherers exploited the site. Pollen analysis of peat from the Solent bed suggest a lightly wooded headland free of close-knit undergrowth during this period, an ideal habitat for game.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2003, five flint {{artefacts}} {{were discovered}} near the Shimna River. A flake, two blades and a concave scraper {{were found in}} two locations in Tollymore Forest. The flake, scraper {{and one of the}} blades were identified as prehistoric. The second blade was identified as Late <b>Mesolithic</b> or Early Neolithic. A Bronze Age barbed and tanged arrowhead was found in a nearby field.|$|E
5|$|Chipped {{stone tools}} found at Zemun {{show that the}} area around Belgrade was {{inhabited}} by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and <b>Mesolithic</b> eras. Some of these tools belong to the Mousterian industry, which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} {{involved}} is a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the <b>Mesolithic</b> until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. These events may have begun at different times {{in different parts of}} the country. A number of the sites span very long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E
5|$|Jeita IV (Mugharet-el-Mal) is a rock {{shelter in}} the cliff {{upstream}} from the grotto. It once contained a large quantity of Paleolithic material which has been looted and was deemed unfit for excavation by Sami Karkaby, Director of the Caverns in 1965. Study of the lithic remains at this shelter were hoped to shed further light on the Paleolithic or <b>Mesolithic</b> communities that inhabited the different sites at different times.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{settlement}} {{appears to}} have begun in the <b>Mesolithic</b> era, with Star Carr in North Yorkshire generally considered the most significant monument of this era. The Star Carr site includes Britain's oldest known house, from around 9000 BC, and the earliest evidence of carpentry {{in the form of}} a carved tree trunk from 11000 BC.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is a {{historic}} county in the south west of England. There is evidence of human occupation since prehistoric times with hand axes and flint points from the Palaeolithic and <b>Mesolithic</b> eras, {{and a range of}} burial mounds, hill forts and other artefacts dating from the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages. The oldest dated human road work in Great Britain is the Sweet Track, constructed across the Somerset Levels with wooden planks in the 39th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 727 AD but the town probably has an earlier Celtic or Roman origin. Archaeological findings {{provide evidence of}} human settlement during the <b>Mesolithic,</b> the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. A large number of wood piles dating from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were discovered around St. Quirin chapel, suggesting a Roman settlement. At that time Sélestat might have already been a port on the river Ill.|$|E
5|$|The Hebrides were {{originally}} {{settled in the}} <b>Mesolithic</b> era and have a diversity of prehistoric sites. A flint arrowhead found in a field near Bridgend, Islay has been dated to 10,800BC. This find may indicate {{the presence of a}} summer hunting party rather than permanent settlement. Burnt hazelnut shells and microscopic charcoal found at Farm Fields, Kinloch on Rùm indicate a settlement of some kind and this is amongst the oldest evidence of occupation in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mesolithic</b> {{lasted from}} 9000 BCE (rapid climate warming) to 5500 BCE (arrival of first farmers from the Danube River area). It {{was the last}} period when the food {{production}} economy was entirely opportunistic, based on assimilation {{of plant and animal}} material found in nature, that is gathering and hunting. Because of warmer temperatures, complex forest ecosystems and wetlands developed and this natural diversity necessitated new hunting and fishing strategies. As new populations entered Poland from the west, hunters and fishermen working individually or in small groups had to pursue single large and small animals using traps, javelins, bows and arrows, boats and fishing equipment, and utilizing dogs. Women engaged in gathering of such products as roots, herbs, nuts, bird eggs, mollusks, fruit or honey, which possibly was even more important than hunting. <b>Mesolithic</b> human settlements became quite numerous {{and by the end of}} this period the economy of harvesting nature became very highly developed. Tools and devices were made of materials such as stone (flint strip mines have been found at the northern edge of Świętokrzyskie Mountains), bone, wood, horn, or plant material for rope and baskets, and included such fine utensils as fishing hooks and sewing needles. Animal figurines were made of amber. At least during the later <b>Mesolithic,</b> the dead were placed in graves and outfitted with familiar objects of their surroundings. One such well preserved grave of an apparent tool-maker, together with his tools and other items, was found in Janisławice near Skierniewice and dated 5500 BCE.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset Levels—specifically dry {{points at}} Glastonbury and Brent Knoll— {{also have a}} long history of settlement, and are known to have been settled by <b>Mesolithic</b> hunters. Travel in the area was {{facilitated}} by the construction of one of the world's oldest known engineered roadways, the Sweet Track, which dates from 3807 BC or 3806 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{hills in}} the {{locality}} such as Bathampton Down saw human activity from the <b>Mesolithic</b> period. Several Bronze Age round barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th century. Solsbury Hill overlooking the current city was an Iron Age hill fort, and the adjacent Bathampton Camp {{may also have}} been one. A long barrow site believed to be from the Beaker people was flattened to make way for RAF Charmy Down.|$|E
