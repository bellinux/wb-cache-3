It combines a truly groundbreaking piece of conservation, remarkable engineering and fascinating social history plus a visually stunning ship {{above and below}} the water line. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the SS Great Britain is accessible and highly engaging for people of all ages.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Roger Bushell {{selected}} {{inmates and}} began planning an escape, at first focused on digging a tunnel. Already experienced from earlier escapes, Bushell became the nominal {{leader of this}} endeavour. The group expanded and accepted Marcinkus into their ranks—his fluent command of several languages, <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> German, was seen as valuable.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{functions}} of the queen ant sounds are to recruit workers, smell nestmates, and facilitate oral exchanges of food and pheromones. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> however, {{is the fact that}} distress noises made by the queen causes workers to raise their guard and bolster her protection.|$|E
50|$|Plotting this, {{one finds}} that the longest {{wavelengths}} are the <b>most</b> unstable. As <b>importantly,</b> one can note that the viscosity of the fluid thread does not influence which wavelengths will be stable. Viscosity only acts to decrease how rapidly a given perturbation will grow or decay with time.|$|R
40|$|Around {{the world}} Indigenous Peoples are {{struggling}} to rebuild their 2 ̆ 7 nations 2 ̆ 7 and improve the socioeconomic circumstances of their people. As a group they constitute an emerging market of more than 500 hundred million people. Participation {{in the global economy}} through entrepreneurship is widely accepted as the key to success by <b>most</b> Indigenous people. <b>Importantly,</b> <b>most</b> want this participation to be 2 ̆ 7 on their own terms 2 ̆ 7 terms in which traditional lands, history, culture and values play an important role. Using regulation theory, we explore the feasibility of the emerging Indigenous approach to development and conclude that is theoretically sound.

25|$|<b>Importantly,</b> <b>most</b> parents {{apply for}} Social Security numbers for their {{dependent}} children {{in order to}} include them on their income tax returns as a dependent. Everyone filing a tax return, as taxpayer or spouse, must have a Social Security Number or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) since the IRS is unable to process returns or post payments for anyone without an SSN or TIN.|$|R
5|$|A {{decorative}} pattern, {{designed in}} 1917 by Matrena Markevich, is {{displayed on the}} hoist of the flag (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> in the traditional 'rushnyk', a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other more mundane social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a rushnyk.|$|E
5|$|After leaving politics, Rutherford {{continued}} his law practice and {{his involvement with}} a wide range of community groups. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> he became chancellor of the University of Alberta, whose earlier founding had been a personal project. He died of a heart attack June 11, 1941. A University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and Jasper National Park's Mount Rutherford are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, Rutherford House, was opened as a museum in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. Boron can form intermetallic compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> with the coinage metals.|$|E
30|$|In {{the setting}} of OD, MRI imaging will {{characteristically}} exhibit a lesion with hyperintense changes on T 2 -weighted sequences accompanied by hypointense changes on T 1 -weighted sequences. Contrast enhancement is <b>most</b> frequently absent. <b>Importantly,</b> a normal MRI imaging does {{not rule out the}} diagnosis of OD as the aforementioned findings lag behind the clinical onset of the disease [118, 122, 123].|$|R

5000|$|Soon after Confederation, {{the urban}} {{population}} grew — and more <b>importantly,</b> <b>most</b> city dwellers gained the franchise after property ownership {{was no longer}} required to gain the vote. Rural constituencies therefore became geographically larger through the 20th century and generally encompassed one or more counties each, and the word [...] "riding" [...] was then {{used to refer to}} any electoral division.|$|R
5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may develop {{as a result of}} not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E
5|$|France's {{defeat in}} Indochina, {{coupled with the}} German {{destruction}} of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, {{as well as with}} its NATO allies, <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from which many of the troops who fought at Điện Biên Phủ had been recruited.|$|E
3000|$|Overall, {{the results}} suggest that {{respondents}} interviewed in France are characterized by lower levels of trust in Malian institutions than their non-migrant counterparts: the coefficient of the migration variable is negative in six out of seven regressions (see columns (1) to (7)) and significantly different from zero in five out of seven regressions.

30|$|Early {{recognition}} {{and treatment of}} vision-threatening ocular opportunistic infection and IRU can lead to maintenance/improvement of visual acuity in <b>most</b> patients. <b>Importantly,</b> our study included patients spanning the pre- and post-HAART era with a regular ocular and systemic follow-up using a standard protocol at both the tertiary care eye center and the AIDS care center. Although {{there are a few}} limitations as in any long-duration study due to changes in the disease pattern, which have also been studied, our study has shown that the occurrence and frequency of various ocular opportunistic infections in developing nations such as India has significant variations from those reported in Western literature and need to be managed accordingly.|$|R
40|$|Employability {{skills have}} become {{increasingly}} important in a competitive job market in a globalised world of advanced technology. Our study examines employability skills of accountants as indicated in job advertisements in Australia and New Zealand, as they provide {{a window into the}} skills that are most valued by employers. The results show that of the 31 identified skills, 13 were <b>most</b> cited. <b>Importantly,</b> the <b>most</b> sought after skills included the ability to collaborate with colleagues, present, discuss and defend views, and having a positive attitude. Overall, a team player with a positive attitude and good communication skills appeared to be the most valued behavioural skill as perceived by employers. This probably reflects a change in the work of accountants, from being ‘backroom number crunchers’ to engaged business professionals...|$|R
5|$|Gogel's General Taxation Plan {{was finally}} enacted in June 1805; a first government-approved attempt at {{unification}} of the Dutch spelling was made; an embryonic Department of Agriculture and Department of Hydraulics were formed, to foreshadow the later government departments; even a Pharmacopeia Batavia started {{the regulation of}} drugs; and the School Law of 1806 organized a national system of public elementary education. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly</b> perhaps, the local-government law of July 1805 founded the first Dutch system of public administration.|$|E
5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, was never able to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>importantly</b> the operas {{themselves}} {{are now beginning}} to be revived and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, Les Huguenots, they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator's lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.|$|E
50|$|Before the UVIS system, {{handheld}} mirrors were is use. While handheld mirrors {{are among}} the least expensive and oldest technologies, they have limited applications and place security personnel {{in close proximity to}} potential danger.Additionally, performing a thorough inspection of the vehicle’s undercarriage using handheld mirrors is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, taking up to several minutes per vehicle. More <b>importantly,</b> <b>most</b> mirrors provide a limited view of the undercarriage, failing to show screeners key areas toward the middle of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Long Arrow (Chang-Jian or Changjian, 长箭, often {{abbreviated}} as CJ) is a fixed wing, jet powered UAV {{developed by}} NUAA developed in 2006. During {{the development of}} Long Arrow UAV, computer aided design was widely used. More <b>importantly,</b> <b>most</b> of the computer programs were indigenously developed by NUAA. The engine inlet of Long Arrow was completely designed via CAD, which reduced cost and time.The engine inlet is constructed fiber glass plastic that helped reduced radar cross section and thus improved stealth.|$|R
40|$|D ow nloaded from 1 Abstract 27 The TonB system couples cytoplasmic {{membrane}} protonmotive force to TonB-gated outer 28 membrane transporters for active transport of nutrients into the periplasm. In Escherichia coli, 29 {{cytoplasmic membrane}} proteins ExbB and ExbD promote conformational changes in TonB, 30 which transmits this {{energy to the}} transporters. The only known energy-dependent interaction 31 occurs between periplasmic domains of TonB and ExbD. This study identified sites of in vivo 32 homodimeric interactions within ExbD periplasmic domain residues 92 - 121. ExbD was active as 33 a homodimer but not through all cys substitution sites, suggesting the existence of 34 conformationally dynamic regions in the ExbD periplasmic domain. A subset of homodimeric 35 interactions could not be modeled on the NMR structure without significant distortion. <b>Most</b> 36 <b>importantly,</b> the majority of ExbD cys substitutions that mediated homodimer formation also 3...|$|R
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the High Speed Photometer was {{replaced}} with the COSTAR corrective optics package, and WFPC {{was replaced}} with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with added coprocessors, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E
5|$|The Analytical Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public {{as well as to}} simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E
50|$|Darryl Norman Johnson (born 1938) is {{a retired}} American statesman and career Foreign Service Officer who held many {{positions}} in American government around the world. <b>Most</b> recently and <b>importantly</b> he was the United States Ambassador to Thailand from 2001-2004. Additionally, he was acting US Ambassador to the Philippines for several months in 2005. He now lives near Seattle, WA. In retirement he was a lecturer at his undergraduate alma mater, the University of Washington, where he taught in its Jackson School of International Studies.|$|R

It was the first commercial radio station to broadcast on the FM band in Adelaide. Initially SA-FM was somewhat of a fringe operation, hampered largely {{by the fact that}} many houses, and more <b>importantly</b> <b>most</b> contemporary cars, did not have the ability to receive FM radio broadcasts.|$|R
30|$|Acute {{mesenteric}} ischemia (AMI) is a dreaded complication in {{critically ill}} patients and remains a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in <b>most</b> cases. <b>Importantly,</b> AMI encompasses two different pathophysiological entities. Occlusive AMI {{is caused by}} the occlusion of large mesenteric arteries or veins due to arterial embolism or a local thrombotic process. AMI may also occur despite preserved patency of large mesenteric vessels, the so-called non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) [1]. NOMI is a common complication in critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure and thereby accounts for a major cause of death {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) [2, 3]. In a large multicenter study of 780 ICU patients with AMI, the overall mortality rate was 58 % [4]. Nonetheless, surgical treatment within 24  h of diagnosis of AMI was identified as an independent predictor of survival, emphasizing the importance of early and reliable diagnosis.|$|R
5|$|The British {{agreed to}} depart from their forts around the Great Lakes, and the United States-Canada {{boundary}} had to be re-adjusted. Numerous pre-Revolutionary debts were liquidated, and the British opened their West Indies colonies to American trade. <b>Most</b> <b>importantly,</b> the treaty delayed war with Great Britain and instead brought a decade of prosperous trade. The treaty angered the French and became a central issue in many political debates. Relations with France deteriorated after the treaty was signed, leaving succeeding president John Adams {{with the prospect of}} war.|$|E
5|$|The Condemnations at {{the medieval}} University of Paris were enacted to {{restrict}} certain teachings as being heretical. These included {{a number of}} medieval theological teachings, but <b>most</b> <b>importantly</b> the physical treatises of Aristotle. The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris. The Condemnations of 1277 are traditionally linked to an investigation requested by Pope John XXI, although whether he actually supported drawing {{up a list of}} condemnations is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps <b>most</b> <b>importantly,</b> a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E
30|$|Novel {{compounds}} have to {{be identified}} and tailored in combination to specific CFTR mutations, to different tissues, or even to the individual patient. Immortalized cell lines overexpressing mutant CFTR are typically used to screen candidate molecules but {{have proven to be}} poor predictors of clinical efficacy. The complexity of CFTR maturation and turnover requires the use of cellular models that closely recapitulate the specific properties of the clinically <b>most</b> affected organs. <b>Importantly,</b> current screening efforts based on primary airway cells or intestinal organoids cannot specifically target single rare CFTR mutations or mimic multiple cell types.|$|R
50|$|By 1820, Henning {{was ready}} to sell his work and {{it was obvious that}} he had not copied the remains of the friezes, but recreated them. In the case of the Parthenon frieze he had used {{drawings}} taken by William Pars in 1765, the drawings commissioned from Feodor Ivanowitsch by Lord Elgin before they were moved to England and importantly drawings made by Jacques Carrey. The last drawings were not the <b>most</b> detailed, but <b>importantly</b> they were made thirteen years before the explosion that had damaged the Parthenon in 1687.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} real {{exchange}} rate {{response to a}} government-spending shock in a two- country model with productive government purchases and non-Ricardian households. In this economy, the real exchange rate depreciates following an increase in domestic public spending, consistently with <b>most</b> empirical evidence. <b>Importantly,</b> and consistently with empirical evidence, the depreciation occurs both on impact and in the transition. The transmission mechanism works through an increase in domestic private-sector productivity, spurred by government purchases, which reduces real marginal costs at home allowing for accommodating monetary policy response...|$|R
