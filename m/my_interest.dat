Rob Harvilla of Village Voice wrote that the track offered [...] "nothing terribly earth-shattering" [...] and thought that [...] "the {{contrast}} between Thom's dolphin-soothing calm and lyrics like 'I've seen hell upon this earth/The next one will be chemical/But they will never learn' might just ruin your lunch."

500|$|The new Star Trek {{series was}} {{announced}} on October 10, 1986 {{by the head}} of Paramount Television Group, Mel Harris. He announced that the creator of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, was to be executive producer and lead the creation of the new series. It was the second attempt at creating a new live action television series based on Star Trek for Paramount; production on the previous attempt in 1977, called , was redirected to [...] when the decision was made not to proceed with the Paramount network it had been slated to be the flagship for, and interest in a new movie was piqued after the release of Star Wars. Paramount had pitched ideas to Roddenberry earlier in 1986 as it was the twentieth anniversary of the original series, but Roddenberry turned them down and initially didn't want to do a new series. He later said, [...] "It was only when the Paramount people agreed with me and said a sequel was probably impossible anyway that <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> was piqued." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{generally}} received positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V.

Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the [...] "fun" [...] {{scenes in the}} parallel universe, and stated he would not mind watching an entire show about their Fringe Division. IGN's Ramsey Isler called the victims' method of death in [...] "Immortality" [...] "one of the nastiest in recent memory," [...] and rated the episode 8.5/10. He concluded that he was [...] "quite surprised by this episode. The storyline with the Dr. Silva [...] and his beetles didn't hold <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> at all, but everything else in this installment was fascinating material that expanded the mythos of the series far more than I could have imagined." [...] Den of Geek's Billy Grifter wrote, [...] "What this show is now quite good at is lulling us into {{a false sense of}} security, before pulling away the rug rather smartly. If you follow the show, like me, you probably got a slightly déjà vu feeling to the plot, as it rode the previously saddle worn concept of a scientist who has lost the perspective to realise that he's killing people for science." ...|$|E

500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different from what I would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> in serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it three-and-a-half stars out of {{four and}} called it [...] "an {{astonishing}} achievement in imaginative filmmaking" [...] and said [...] "Lucas tells a good story." [...] Ebert also wrote that [...] "If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable" [...] {{because it is the}} opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than Star Trek films, filmmakers could [...] "ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes. In an Entertainment Weekly review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a [...] "C-", calling it [...] "haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile". ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote:Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, The Phantom Menace is still among the best [...] "bang for a buck" [...] fun that can be had in a movie theater. It isn't as fresh as the original Star Wars nor does it have the thematic richness and narrative complexity of The Empire Strikes Back, but it is a distinct improvement over Return of the Jedi. In fact, after Return of the Jedi, I didn't have a burning desire to return to this galaxy 'far, far away', but, with The Phantom Menace, Lucas has revived <b>my</b> <b>interest.</b> Now, it's with genuine regret that I realize the next segment of the series is three long years away.|$|E
500|$|Daavettila {{graduated}} from Michigan Tech in 2008 and tried {{out for the}} Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He appeared in two games for the Generals {{at the end of}} the season (for only about three shifts), and did not register a point. Daavettila had not originally planned to pursue a professional hockey career, but said [...] "When I got one skate with Flint, it kind of sparked <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> and I decided to give it a try". During the off-season, Daavettila worked for a structural engineering firm in Saginaw, Michigan. He used vacation time at the start of the next hockey season later in 2008 to try out for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Muskegon Lumberjacks (IHL), though he was rejected by both teams. Tryouts with two more IHL teams, the Kalamazoo Wings and the Bloomington PrairieThunder, did not result in a contract either. Daavettila assumed his hockey career was over and went back to his engineering job, but he continued to skate a couple times a week. He had left an impression on Kalamazoo coach Nick Bootland, however, who called Daavettila back in March 2009 after his team was depleted by injuries. [...] "You could see he had a skill set," [...] said Bootland. [...] "But I thought the way he held on to the puck, he was going to get himself killed. ... You kept thinking he was going to make a mistake. Then he'd pop a guy for a breakaway." ...|$|E
50|$|Since my {{projects}} {{depend on}} <b>my</b> <b>interests</b> and desires, and since <b>my</b> <b>interests</b> and desires don't seem to generate agent-neutral reasons, then the reasons in question must be agent-relative.

This appears both {{to account for the}} fact that there are moral requirements and the fact that we are sometimes allowed to promote our own projects.|$|R

500|$|A {{total of}} 775 people {{attended}} the event. Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett rated the entire event a 6 out of 10, which {{was lower than}} the 8 out of 10 given to the 2006 Lockdown event by Chris Sokol. A rating was not given to TNA's previous event Destination X, but Clevett gave a rating of 7 out of 10 in his review of TNA's Against All Odds. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania 21 PPV event held on April4, Lockdown was rated lower, Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk gave WrestleMania a 7 out of 10. Regarding the overall event, Clevett felt the all cage match format was [...] "too {{much of a good}} thing". He went on to state {{that by the end of}} the event he [...] "was tired of seeing the cage", but that Styles and Abyss [...] "quickly brought <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> back with a brutal and fun bout that ended off the show on a positive note". When speaking of the TNA X Division Championship match, Clevett wrote that he felt it [...] "was technically a very good match", but he [...] "expected more considering the talent involved". However, he felt that the psychological aspect was [...] "excellent" [...] regarding the two former Triple X partners' counters of each other's moves. Clevett gave the highest match rating of 8.5 out of 10 to the main event, while he gave the lowest rating of 2 out of 10 to the Prince of Darkness match. He gave the Lethal Lockdown match a 5 out of 10, while he gave the X Division Title match an 8 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born <b>my</b> <b>interest</b> for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course" [...] and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|E
