500|$|It was {{the kind}} of jump in which, even when {{arriving}} [...] in the landing position and not knowing at all what lies ahead, I remember that <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> trembling. That's how terrified I was. ... Overcoming your own fears is the best feeling. The nature of the sport is that one has to challenge themselves. That's why this jump has remained a highlight of my career.|$|E
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigators}} {{began to}} use force on me, a sick 65-year-old man. I was made to lie face down and beaten on the soles of my feet and my spine with a rubber strap ... For the next few days, when those parts of <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that {{it felt as if}} boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When I lay down on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} the boot {{is on the other}} <b>leg.</b> <b>My</b> head <b>is</b> {{exceedingly}} painful and <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> very stiff. For a young man of your build you have a most surprising muscle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A prisoner!" [...] whined the half-breed. [...] "Ain't I {{suffered}} enough already? <b>My</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> somethin' fearful!" [...] and {{he groaned}} again.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no! I'm {{all right}} now. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> cramped--that's all. They'll limber up in a minute. The seats were {{too low for}} a man of my height. I should have stayed in the other carriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't wear those striped stockings," [...] said Faith stubbornly. [...] "The feel {{of them is}} {{even worse}} than the looks. They make me feel as if <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> as big as barrels and they're so SCRATCHY." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{lay there}} for some moments slowly recovering, eyes on the far distant escarpments, now darkly red and {{repellent}} to me. When I got up <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> still shaky and I had the strange, weak sensation of a long bed-ridden invalid. Three attempts were necessary before I could trust myself on the narrow strip of shelf. But once around it with the peril passed, I braced up and soon reached the turn in the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reason?" [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "Good gracious, no. What reason should I have? <b>My</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> a trifle stiff to-day for stiles, but still—" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{away from}} me," [...] I cried, half choking. [...] "O please go away, you--you Thug! How dare {{you think that}} when <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> asleep?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Help us now," [...] {{said the}} Bull. [...] "The tides {{of the day}} <b>are</b> running down. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> very stiff. Sing, if you never sang before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot climb it, for <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> {{never made}} for climbing," [...] said Spotty mournfully {{as he looked}} at his funny little black feet. [...] "Oh, dear, I wish that I could climb like Happy Jack Squirrel!" [...] Just then a thought popped into his head and chased away the little frown that had crept into Spotty's face. [...] "Perhaps Happy Jack {{sometimes}} wishes that he could swim as I can, so I guess we are even. I can't climb, but he can't swim. How foolish it is to wish for things never meant for you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|What a silky smooth hellion she was; and so {{composed}} and serene, {{when the}} cords all down <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> hurting in sympathy with that man's pain. Conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches, we tramped along echoing corridors, and down stone stairways dank and dripping, and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night --a chill, uncanny journey {{and a long}} one, and not made the shorter or the cheerier by the sorceress's talk, which was about this sufferer and his crime. He had been accused by an anonymous informer, of having killed a stag in the royal preserves. I said: ...|$|E
60|$|When I stood panting on the bank, I {{found that}} the fish was still on and still {{inclined}} to descend, but I found that I could not follow, for <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> heavy as lead--the boots being full of water. To take the latter off in a hurry and empty them was impossible. To think of losing the fish after all was maddening. Suddenly a happy thought struck me. Handing the rod to the boy I lay down on my back, cocked my legs in the air, and the water ran like a deluge out {{at the back of}} my neck! Much relieved, I resumed the rod, but now I {{found that the}} fish had taken to sulking.|$|E
5000|$|... "I've {{never felt}} like this before. My will is strong La tête est bonne, <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> good, but I'm not making progress. My stomach is in a bad state." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>is</b> short, but I slog along slack at {{the knees}} an' don't worry my muscles none, an' I can sure walk every piker here off the ice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--I fancy {{there is}} {{something}} amiss. I can't move my arms; and I catch <b>my</b> breath. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> all right if I could {{get away from this}} accursed brute." ...|$|R
60|$|I do not {{say that}} he {{understood}} me, even though I realize that an Airedale is a mighty intelligent dog; but I do swear {{that he seemed to}} understand me, for he wheeled about, barking joyously and trotted off toward the west; and when I didn't follow him, he ran back to me barking furiously, and at last taking hold of the calf of my leg in an effort to pull me along in the direction he wished me to go. Now, as <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> naked and Nobs' jaws are much more powerful than he realizes, I gave in and followed him, for I knew that I might as well go west as east, as far as any knowledge I had of the correct direction went.|$|E
60|$|The {{effort was}} rewarded. I hooked a fish {{and made for}} the bank as fast as possible. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> like solid pillars, or {{enormous}} sausages, by reason of the long boots being full to bursting with water. To walk was difficult; to run, {{in the event of}} the fish requiring me to do so, impossible. I therefore lay down on the bank and tossed both legs in the air to let the water run out--holding on to the fish the while. The water did run out--it did more; it ran right along my backbone to the nape of my neck; completing the saturation which the rain had hitherto failed to accomplish. But I had hooked a fish and heeded it not.|$|E
60|$|After I {{had begun}} the morning on this {{delightful}} liquor, she having an infinity of things to arrange, I was permitted, nay requested, to make a bowl of chocolate for myself. My boots and gaiters were hung up to dry, and, seeing me trying to write my journal on my knee, the eldest daughter let down a hinged table in the chimney-corner for my convenience. Here I wrote, drank my chocolate, and finally ate an omelette before I left. The table was thick with dust; for, as they explained, it was not used except in winter weather. I had a clear look up the vent, through brown agglomerations of soot and blue vapour, to the sky; and whenever a handful of twigs was thrown on to the fire, <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> scorched by the blaze.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Take a seat. And {{would you}} please to shut the street door first? I can't very well do it myself; because my back's so bad, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> so queer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis mighty fine lace to be thus hidden away," [...] commented {{an elderly}} harridan. [...] "Now, {{would you believe}} it, my fine madam, but <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> bare {{underneath}} <b>my</b> kirtle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I? <b>My</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> hurting me a bit. Ireland {{is a great}} country, but its by-roads are not {{the best}} in the world, and this jolting shakes me up a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Uncle, you {{can imagine}} our dismay. We both screamed, for we thought our time had come, for sure. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> so weak that Beth had to drag me away {{and her face was}} white as a sheet and full of terror. Somehow we managed to stagger into the street, where a dozen men caught us and hurried us away. I hardly thought we were in a safe place when the big workman cried: 'There, young ladies; that will do. Your {{expression}} was simply immense and if this doesn't {{turn out to be the}} best film of the year, I'll miss my guess! Your terror-stricken features will make a regular hit, for the terror wasn't assumed, you know. Thank you very much for happening along just then.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have," [...] said I, sitting up,--I {{could not}} stand, for <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> tied, and my arms fixed {{in a neat}} pair of steel handcuffs. [...] "I have," [...] said I, [...] "unbelieving dogs! I have. Do you think to pervert a Christian gentleman from his faith and honor? Ruffian blackamoors! do your worst; heap tortures on this body, they cannot last long. Tear me to pieces: after you have torn me into {{a certain number of}} pieces, I shall not feel it; and if I did, if each torture could last a life, if each limb were to feel the agonies of a whole body, what then? I would bear all--all--all--all--all--ALL!" [...] My breast heaved--my form dilated--my eye flashed as I spoke these words. [...] "Tyrants!" [...] said I, [...] "dulce et decorum est pro patria mori." [...] Having thus {{clinched}} the argument, I was silent.|$|E
60|$|He {{had before}} served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing, {{although}} {{at the same}} time she was heartily vexed, and would have immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede. Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous figure. I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was become of me; for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> not scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf, at my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Percy said, [...] "I am warm enough, in the body; but <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> in agony, {{from the}} cold. These gloves are helping us on, though, {{at a great}} rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{the little}} villains started around the {{mountain}} I follered, {{as the boy}} an' me had agreed on; but after a two-hour's tramp I fell into a hole, an' reckon <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> broke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Could I {{lie on your}} sofa, please, Cis? My head aches, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>are</b> SO tired," [...] {{said little}} Button, when her tap had been {{answered}} by a sharp [...] "What do you want, child?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, it {{was always}} this colour. And I used to leave bits of my frock on thorns here and there. It was pretty thin, I can tell you. There wasn’t much at that time between my skin and {{the blue of the}} sky. <b>My</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> as sunburnt as my face; but really I didn’t tan very much. I had plenty of {{freckles}} though. There were no looking-glasses in the Presbytery but uncle had a piece not bigger than my two hands for his shaving. One Sunday I crept into his room and had a peep at myself. And wasn’t I startled to see my own eyes looking at me! But it was fascinating, too. I was about eleven years old then, and I was very friendly with the goats, and I was as shrill as a cicada and as slender as a match. Heavens! When I overhear myself speaking sometimes, or look at my limbs, it doesn’t seem to be possible. And yet it is the same one. I do remember every single goat. They were very clever. Goats are no trouble really; they don’t scatter much. Mine never did even if I had to hide myself out of their sight for ever so long.” ...|$|E
60|$|Slept at Apollo's. Next morning went {{a little}} way in canoes and walked six miles to Toma's place; meeting held, speech as usual, present of yams, pig, &c. Walked back the six miles, started in double canoe for Gaicha, {{the other side of}} the bay: wind cold, some {{difficulty}} in getting ashore. Walked by the bad path to Apollo's and slept there again; Frenchman came in during the evening. Next day, Friday, meeting in the chapel. Walked twenty miles back to We, where I am now writing. Went the twenty miles with no socks; feet sore and shoes worn to pieces, cutting off leather as I came along. Nothing but broken bottles equals jagged coral. Paths went so that you never take three steps in the same direction, and every minute trip against logs, coral hidden by long leaves, arid weeds trailing over the path. Often for half a mile you jump from one bit of coral to another. No shoes can stand it, and I was tired, I assure you. Indeed, for the last two days, if I stopped for a minute to drink a nut, <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> so stiff that they did not get into play for five minutes or so.|$|E
60|$|Methinks I can see now, as I write, {{the long}} file of woodsmen with their {{swinging}} stride, planting one foot before the other, {{even as the}} Indian himself threaded the wilderness. Though <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>were</b> short, I had both sinew and training, and now I was {{at one end of}} the line and now at the other. And often with a laugh some giant would hand his gun to a neighbor, swing me to his shoulder, and so give me a lift for a weary mile or two; and perchance whisper to me to put down my hand into the wallet of his shirt, where I would find a choice morsel which he had saved for his supper. Sometimes I trotted beside the Colonel himself, listening as he talked to this man or that, and thus I got the gravest notion of the daring of this undertaking, and of the dangers ahead of us. This north country was infested with Indians, allies of the English and friends of the French their subjects; and the fact was never for an instant absent from our minds that our little band might at any moment run into a thousand warriors, be overpowered and massacred; or, worst of all, that our coming might have been heralded to Kaskaskia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{take the}} ramrod {{of one of}} my pistols, put it through the bandage, and then twist it. You need not be afraid of hurting me; <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> quite numbed, at present. That is right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seventy-six, if I'm a day. My time can't <b>be</b> long, and <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> <b>is</b> weak, they be. Yes, the Bible says a man's time {{is limited}} pretty much to threescore-and-ten--and I'll never stand out ag'in the Bible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much, I think. I--I am not sure. I {{feel as if}} I {{had been}} much shaken, and <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> <b>is</b> painful. I hope," [...] he added, feeling the limb with both hands, [...] "that it is not--" ...|$|R
