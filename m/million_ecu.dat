5000|$|The VaMP {{driverless car}} {{was one of}} the first truly {{autonomous}} cars [...] along with its twin vehicle, the VITA-2. They were able to drive in heavy traffic for long distances without human intervention, using computer vision to recognize rapidly moving obstacles such as other cars, and automatically avoid and pass them.The VaMP was constructed by the team of Ernst Dickmanns at the Bundeswehr University of Munich and Mercedes-Benz in the 1990s as part of the 800 <b>million</b> <b>ECU</b> EUREKA Prometheus Project on autonomous vehicles (1987-1995). It was a 500 SEL Mercedes re-engineered such that it was possible to control steering wheel, throttle, and brakes through computer commands based on real-time evaluation of image sequences. Software was written that translated sensory data into appropriate driving commands. Due to the limited computing power of the time period, sophisticated computer vision strategies were necessary to react in real time. The Dickmanns team solved the problem through an innovative approach to dynamic computer vision. Attention control including artificial saccadic movements of the platform carrying the cameras allowed the system to focus its attention on the most relevant details of the visual input. Four cameras with two different focal lengths for each hemisphere were used in parallel for this purpose. Kalman filters were extended to handle perspective imaging and to achieve robust autonomous driving even in the presence of noise and uncertainty. Sixty transputers, a type of parallel computers, were used to deal with the enormous (by 1990s standards) computational demands.|$|E

40|$|In {{the paper}} a budget {{detection}} and allocation proposal {{aimed at reducing}} the annual number of road fatalities by 40 % in the Italian main road network is reported. Road safety measures are divided into two categories: measures for road infrastructure improvements and measures for the control and the repression of infractions. The cost, expressed as equivalent annual cost, and the effectiveness, {{expressed in terms of}} reduction of fatalities (1, 1 <b>million</b> <b>ECU</b> per fatal injury) and of casualties (0, 025 <b>million</b> <b>ECU</b> per casualty) have been evaluated and compared. The effects due to the interaction between several measures have been assessed too, in order to gain information {{to be used in the}} choice of different strategies aimed at improving road safety. The cost of all the road infrastructure improvements and all the measures for the control and the repression of infractions is about 3600 <b>million</b> <b>ECU</b> per year and the reduction of fatal injury is between 49 and 54 % (the reduction of casualties is between 41 and 45 %).

The methodology features land availability and land suitability criteria for evaluating biomass productivity potential, biomass energy plantation species and site selection, and plantation management strategy. An exploratory survey of Sicily's candidate biomass feedstocks which identifies yields and costs of both agricultural residues and dedicated biomass energy crops is featured. A technical and economic comparison of two biomass-conversion technologies for generating electric power, non-catalytic biomass gasification coupled with a combined-cycle gas turbine and catalytic biomass gasification coupled with a molten-carbonate fuel cell, is presented. Recommendations for developing an economically-viable biomass industry in Sicily are also included. Analytical results indicate that of Sicily's 236 x 106 GJ total annual energy requirement, approximately 50 % or 120 x 106 GJ could be supplied with biomass resources, including all of the 13 300 x 106 kWh of electricity through an installed capacity of 2000 MW of electricity.

30|$|International {{science and}} {{technology}} cooperation between the EU, its member states and the post-socialist Eastern European and Central Asian countries began soon {{after the collapse of}} the hegemonic communist system in early 1990 s. At community level, the European Commission pursued and supported collaborative trans-European R&D efforts whose main aims were to safeguard and strengthen the S&T potential in the EECA partner countries by orienting research towards new socioeconomic needs of the transition countries, to prevent proliferation of military-relevant knowledge and to generate and disseminate new scientific and technological knowledge by encouraging enterprises and research institutes from the East and West to carry out joint research projects and to organise technology transfer under the European FPs for RTD. In FP 4, which lasted from 1994 to 1998, the PECO and COPERNICUS schemes were the EC's main mechanism for stimulating S&T cooperation between researchers from the EU and researchers from the Central European Candidate Countries as well as from the New Independent States of the Former Soviet Union (NIS).

40|$|Economic {{policies}} are often suggested as mechanisms for promoting rainforest conservation in developing countries. To help decide whether international resources {{should be used}} to protect specific rainforcsts, the calculation of a "rainforest supply price" (RSP) is proposed. If protection is warranted, then empirical analyses explore the conditions under which selected policies within developing countries might be effective in protecting rainforests. Korup National Park in Cameroon contains the oldest rainforest in Africa and - as a haven for important endangered species- it is the subject of active international conservation efforts. A cost-bencfit analysis of a conservation project to protect Korup from increased land-use pressures suggests that it is not in Cameroon's interest unless a 5. 4 <b>million</b> <b>ECU</b> inducement is transferred to Cameroon. Given the protection afforded, the transfer is equivalent to a RSP of 1060 ECU per km 2 per year. Evaluations of six other tropical rainforest projects suggests that international donors made transfers having values ranging from 15 to 1575 ECU per km 2 per year. It is thus concluded that the inducements required are within a range which conservation interests are apparently willing to mobilise. To target inducements the provision of incentives in a "buffer zone" around a park is often believed to promote conservation. This is based on the hypothesis that increased incomes will draw individuals out of the park and will give them something better to do than exploit the park. A survey of 341 households around Korup was analysed in detail to test this hypothesis. Evidence suggests that economic development in the buffer zone would increase pressures on the park because: a) higher incomes would reduce emigration from the region and would thus cause greater population pressure on the Park; and, b) hunting effort increases as non-hunting income increases...|$|E

Edward pillaged and raided the countryside but could not bring the French to a decisive battle, so he eventually agreed to reduce his terms.

40|$|To protect {{occupants}} of vehicles that leave {{the road from}} serious injuries, safe roadsides and medians are important. This report describes the way to make safe roadsides by means of obstacle-free zones, slopes, frangible poles, crash cushions and safety barriers. The research performed here aims to define criteria for places where safety devices are necessary. The research {{was carried out by}} means of a literature study including the national European standards. Furthermore, results from a questionnaire which was send to European institutes and ministries are described. This questionnaire contained for instance questions about national standards and/or criteria for use of safety barriers, and about accident data on motorways and express roads where safety barriers were involved. Data from European countries, but also from the United States were analysed to prepare a proposal for standards and strategies for EU-countries. The first issue of the report deals with the desirable width for the obstacle-free zone. Figures are presented about the only European research carried out in the Netherlands in the 1980 's. Figures for motorways, single-lane highways and local single-lanes are given. Based on the questionnaires, distances of obstacle-free zones from other European countries are mentioned. The second issue is a shoulder with safe slopes. Figures from the United States and European countries are discussed. The figures from the Netherlands are based on mathematical simulations and twelve full-scale tests on slopes with two gradients. If fixed objects are made to yield, the third issue, they can be placed in an obstacle-free zone without safety barriers. Different solutions are mentioned, such as slip base, plastic hinges, fracture elements or a combination of these. The fourth issue deals with crash cushions. If solitary rigid obstacles along a shoulder cannot be removed, they can be shielded with a crash cushion. Crash cushions are applied on motorways in mainly two different situations: in pointed areas at exits (often {{at the beginning of a}} safety barrier) and on shoulders to shield single objects. If crash cushions have been hit head-on, the vehicle usually remains within the shoulder so that it forms no danger for other traffic. In the case of a side impact, most types of crash cushions function like a safety barrier. Several European countries have their own, different types of crash cushions. In the concept of a safe road side (shoulders and medians), protection with safety barriers is the least safe solution (the last issue). An effectively functioning safety barrier prevents a vehicle from leaving the roadway and striking a fixed object or terrain feature that is considered more hazardous than the barrier itself. But a collision with a safety barrier is never free from the risk of injuries for the {{occupants of}} the colliding vehicle, nor is it for other road users. Requirements, CEN standards, containment levels, differences between steel and concrete barriers, and Dutch experiences with mathematical simulations are described. Proposals for motorway standards and strategies for EU countries are discussed. There are safety reasons for favouring wide obstacle-free zones. Based on information from many European countries a minimum width of 9 metres is recommended. Also is recommended to carry out accident investigations in different European countries to collect more data in order to take a more well-founded decision for the European situation. Slopes may be a part of an obstacle-free zone if vehicular manoeuvres are possible. This is the case with a gradient of at least 1 : 5 for high slopes (> 5 m) and 1 : 6 for lower slopes (< 2 m). Only fixed roadside objects can be located within an obstacle-free zone, if their support poles are frangible. If solitary rigid obstacles can not be relocated, protecting them with a crash cushion is the solution. In the report a decision model is described for determining the choice for shoulders and the median: obstacle-free or safety barriers. If a decision is made for a low containment level, steel barriers are in favour if only the installation costs are calculated. Taking into account other aspects, it depends on the local circumstances which type of barrier is to be preferred. Differences between countries are too great for a general statement. Also for express roads and single carriageways recommendations are given for the width of obstacle-free zones and the necessity for safety barriers. The single carriageway roads are in fact at the heart of the problem of obstacle accidents in Europe. There are many of such accidents because there are so many old roads. Unfortunately, accidents with "natural" obstacles such as trees, are widely spread so that dealing with them cannot be targeted at concentrations of dangerous locations. Apart from the erection of safety barriers, the driving speeds will have to be drastically reduced to increase the safety of such roads. Subsequently, this means that the road's function will be changed. A procedure has been described for identifying the locations and establishing priorities for those most requiring the placing of safety barriers. As a cost-benefit analysis, the "one <b>million</b> <b>ECU</b> test" of the European Commission can be applied. A strategy developed in America to deal with these problems, appears to be applicable also in Europe. It concerns for instance better accident monitoring, research, more attention (education, spreading information, good management), and greater budgets. (A...|$|E

These were entered in another agreement to be effected only after the transfer of territory by November 1361 but both sides prevaricated over their commitments for the following nine years. Hostages from the Valois family were held in London while John returned to France to raise his ransom. Edward had restored the lands of the former Angevin Empire holding Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine and the coastline from Flanders to Spain. When the hostages escaped back to France, John was horrified that his word had been broken and returned to England, where he eventually died.|$|R
50|$|The First Treaty of London {{was signed}} in 1358 and {{essentially}} was an agreement setting the ransom for John at four <b>million</b> <b>écus.</b> The first instalment was to be paid by 1 November 1358, however the French defaulted on the agreement. The Second Treaty of London was signed on 12 March 1359 {{and this time the}} treaty allowed for hostages to be held in place of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. Also, {{under the terms of the}} treaty England gained possession of Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine and all the coastline from Flanders to Spain, thus restoring the former Angevin Empire. The hostages were held in honourable captivity which under the chivalric code meant they were given free rein to move about. In 1362 John's son, Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped his parole and refused to return. When John found out, ashamed at the actions of his son he felt duty-bound to return to captivity. He left Paris and gave himself up to the Captain of Calais, who returned him to his honourable captivity in England. He spent the rest of his reign there and died in London on 8 April 1364. John's funeral, in England, was a great chivalrous affair and he was honoured as a great man by the Plantagenets.|$|R
25|$|In 1356 Edward, Prince of Wales, resumed the {{war with}} one of the most {{destructive}} chevauchées of the conflict. Starting from Bordeaux he laid waste to the lands of Armagnac before turning eastward into Languedoc. Toulouse prepared for a siege, but the Prince's army was not equipped for one, so he bypassed the city and continued south, pillaging and burning. Unlike large cities such as Toulouse, the rural French villages were not organised to provide a defence, making them much more attractive targets. In a second great chevauchée the Prince burned the suburbs of Bourges without capturing the city, before marching west along the Loire River to Poitiers where the Battle of Poitiers resulted in a decisive English victory and the capture of John II of France. The Second Treaty of London was signed, which promised a four <b>million</b> <b>écus</b> ransom. It was guaranteed by the Valois family hostages being held in London, while John returned to France to raise his ransom. Edward gained possession of Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine and the coastline from Flanders to Spain, restoring the lands of the former Angevin Empire. The hostages quickly escaped back to France. John, horrified that his word had been broken, returned to England and died there. Edward invaded France in an attempt to take advantage of the popular rebellion of the Jacquerie, hoping to seize the throne. Although no French army stood against him, he was unable to take Paris or Rheims. In the subsequent Treaty of Brétigny he renounced his claim to the French crown, but greatly expanded his territory in Aquitaine and confirmed his conquest of Calais.|$|R
