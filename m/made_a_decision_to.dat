5|$|The Czech {{government}} had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> introduce a central registry for all misdemeanors in October 2014, planning {{to have the}} system working within two years.

5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E

He was defeated in his 1893 re-election bid, in which he finished seventh of nine candidates.

During his first term on the council, {{he was involved in}} an altercation in which the dominion government had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> Dominion Land Office from Edmonton to Strathcona, at the time a separate town, south of the North Saskatchewan River.

Led by mayor Matthew McCauley, Cameron was {{part of a group of}} prominent citizens that headed the resistance, eventually leading to the dominion reversing its decision.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go forward with replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the running game, which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight end Mark Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three of the Giants linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E
