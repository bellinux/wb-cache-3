500|$|International Hat Company, {{formerly}} {{named the}} International Harvest Hat Company, was a St. Louis, Missouri-based manufacturer of commercial hats and <b>military</b> <b>helmets.</b> [...] The company {{was one of}} the largest hat manufacturers in the United States and, at one time, the largest manufacturer of harvest hats in the world. [...] It is best remembered for its design and mass production of tropical shaped, pressed fiber military sun helmets for soldiers of the United States Army, Marines, and Navy during and after World War II. [...] Additionally, the American owned company was a major producer of harvest hats, straw hats, fiber sun hats, enameled dress hats, baseball caps, and earmuffs throughout most of the 20th century. [...] However, it is the International Hat military sun helmets that have become the most notable collector's items.|$|E
500|$|Pellegrino managed International Hat into {{a company}} of over 1,500 {{employees}} with six domestic factories. [...] During the 1950s and 1960s, International Hat expanded from its factory in St. Louis to include five other factories located in Southeast Missouri. [...] A number of these locations became one factory towns. [...] Additionally, a sixth plant was opened in Texas. [...] Reflecting this period of expansion into foreign markets, the company headquarters was also moved from St. Louis to New York City. [...] During this era, the company continued producing <b>military</b> <b>helmets</b> and straw hats. [...] However, the company expanded its products lines into plastic hats and helmets, as an early entrant into this new consumer market. [...] As press fiber waned, plastic allowed for more automated production and lighter materials, without the ventilation issues of pressed fiber trapping heat. [...] Throughout the 1960s, the company began shifting into the baseball cap market. [...] In 1967, International Hat began its first consumer focused advertising campaign, to expand its reach in the retail sector, with advertising agency Stemmler, Bartram, Fisher & Payne. [...] In the 1970s, the company expanded into the winter apparel market, selling earmuffs manufactured by VIP Industries.|$|E

50|$|The Bugs-Elmer {{partnership}} was {{so familiar}} to audiences {{that in a}} late 1950s cartoon, Bugs' Bonnets, a character study is made {{of what happens to}} {{the relationship between the two}} when they each accidentally don a different selection of hats (Native American wig, pilgrim hat, <b>military</b> <b>helmets,</b> bridal veil and top hat, to name a few). The result is comic mayhem; a steady game of one-upmanship that ultimately leads to matrimony.|$|E
50|$|When the United States entered World War II, Hawley Products Company and the International Hat Company were {{commissioned}} to produce {{tens of thousands}} of military sun helmets for the war effort. George Tilles Jr., the President of International Hat turned to General Fibre Company's President L.T. Apple to supply all the fiber materials for the production of International Hat's pressed fiber <b>military</b> <b>helmets.</b> Over 100,000 pressed fiber helmets were supplied to soldiers of the United States Marine Corps and Navy. From World War II to the Gulf War, these pressed fiber pith helmets are noted for the historic length of their combat usage in the United States, outlasting combat usage of the M1 steel helmet by approximately ten years. The pressed fiber helmet thus has the longest duration of combat usage of any helmet {{in the history of the}} United States military. The helmets were produced through the Vietnam War. However, later models of International Hat <b>military</b> <b>helmets</b> were made of plastic, after General Fibre converted to plastic injection molding.|$|E

5000|$|EyeGuide or [...] "EG" [...] {{for short}} was {{developed}} so users {{can take the}} core EyeGuide technology and integrate it into other products such as football and <b>military</b> <b>helmets,</b> glasses, video game accessories, and medical equipment. In a first-person shooter game, for example, as the player's head moves, the avatar would move correspondingly on the screen—up, down, or side to side. As the player looks at a target, the avatar would focus in precisely on that target, resulting in faster, more natural, immersive game play. It is an intended stepping stone for augmented reality applications visualized and controlled directly via the eyes.|$|E

The style of helmet displayed {{varies according to}} rank and social status, and these styles developed over time, {{in step with the}} development of actual <b>military</b> <b>helmets.</b> In some traditions, especially German and Nordic heraldry, two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single achievement of arms, each representing a fief to which the bearer has a right. For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the many activities that WHRC is involved the organization {{was instrumental in the}} endorsement of X-Ray Fluorescence technology into the world of collecting steel helmets. The process pioneered by David May of Florida helps point to authentic versus counterfeit <b>military</b> <b>helmets.</b> it is estimated that nearly one out of every five collectable helmets sold were reproductions sold as authentic. Bringing the light of science upon this dark practice, it is hoped, will clear the false and fraudulent pieces from the archives of the world and bring relative confidence that what is being offered by enthusiasts and museums alike are real and authentic.|$|E
