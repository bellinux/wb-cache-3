25|$|Could I {{forget that}} the event in St. Peter's Square {{took place on the}} day and at the hour when the first {{appearance}} of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything that happened to <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, {{which turned out to be}} stronger than the deadly bullet.|$|E
500|$|Koubek did {{not like}} mixing older, smaller {{buildings}} with his designs. [...] "There {{is no place for}} big buildings next to little buildings," [...] he told The Washington Post in 1979. He was also critical of Federalist architecture. He once scathingly noted, [...] "I think that on Georgetown architecture I'd rather not comment at all. You may quote <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that.</b> [...] I wish you would." ...|$|E
500|$|Judge Roth ordered Taylor {{to choose}} a method of execution. Taylor chose to be {{executed}} by firing squad to make the process more difficult for Utah state officials. In {{an interview with the}} Deseret News, he stated: [...] "I didn't commit the murder, and I'm not going to submit to letting them kill <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> table." [...] Regarding the option of lethal injection, Taylor said, [...] "I don't want to go flipping around like a fish out of water on that table." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{build-up}} to {{the return}} match, Blackburn captain Gary Flitcroft made public that Souness had commented {{in the dressing}} room after the first game that Blackburn should have won the game and that it was like watching [...] "men against boys." [...] Flitcroft also added his own opinion that, regarding Celtic, [...] "there wasn't one of their players that impressed <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> showing." [...] In a press conference the day before the second game, Souness stated that if Celtic scored one goal then Blackburn would score three.|$|E
500|$|In a small essay, [...] "Shmendrick, My Mephistopheles", one of {{the last}} {{passages}} he wrote, Adler describes the last time he saw Shmendrick played, at a memorial for Goldfaden in 1912. Lamenting the choice of play for the memorial—"Goldfaden has written better things"—he nonetheless acknowledges, [...] "that same bitter Shmendrick was our livelihood... I gritted my teeth. I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was before <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater... I thank you for the happiness you gave us... I thank you Shmendrick—my beloved—my own." ...|$|E
500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts. The album also reached number 50 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tamb' Itam tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> {{evening the}} aspect of the heavens was angry and frightful. I may well believe it, for I know <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> very day a cyclone passed within sixty miles of the coast, though there was hardly more than a languid stir of air in the place.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bender, quietly confident, {{took his}} time to reply. [...] "Well, if you had seen <b>me</b> up <b>on</b> <b>that</b> chair you'd have thought I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I've sacrificed {{the best}} of my {{possessions}} and destroyed the confidence of folks who, to serve their ends, would have helped <b>me</b> <b>on.</b> Isn't <b>that</b> a serious thing?" ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{speaking}} on February 20, 2016, to {{a committee of}} the Kansas 2nd Congressional District delegates, regarding their challenges of the proof-of-citizenship voting law he championed in 2011, Kobach said, [...] "The ACLU and their fellow communist friends, the League of Women Voters — you can quote <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> sued".|$|E
2500|$|Pierce's nickname, The Truth, was {{bestowed}} on him by Shaquille O'Neal after a 112–107 Lakers' {{victory over the}} Celtics on March 13, 2001, in which Pierce scored 42 points on 13 of 19 shooting. O'Neal pulled Boston Herald reporter Steve Bulpett over and gestured toward his notepad. [...] "Take this down", said O'Neal. [...] "My name is Shaquille O'Neal and Paul Pierce is the motherfucking truth. Quote <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> and don't take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn't know he could play like this. Paul Pierce is The Truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eisner {{negotiated}} {{an agreement}} with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright The Spirit, but, [...] "Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold— and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership— Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership". This would include the eventual backup features [...] "Mr. Mystic" [...] and [...] "Lady Luck".|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{occurs to}} <b>me</b> <b>on</b> {{reflection}} <b>that</b> after all you wouldn't {{have agreed to}} it. A something, I don't know what, which is lacking in your nature, would have made you reject the scheme.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you're so mighty thin-skinned {{what are}} you doing here? Why don't you British dukes stop right back in your own country where folks touch their hats to you? Let <b>me</b> <b>on</b> to <b>that</b> lever." ...|$|R

2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests <b>me</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
