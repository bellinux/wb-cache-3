40|$|In this report, we derive optimal {{admission}} {{policies for}} integrated voice and data traffic in packet radio networks employing code-division multiple-access (CDMA) with direct- sequence spread-spectrum (DS/SS) signaling. The network performance {{is measured in}} terms of the average blocking probability of voice calls and the average delay and packet loss probability of data messages. Our admission scheme determines the number of newly arrived voice users that are accepted in the network so that the long-term blocking probability of voice calls is minimized in longer-term. In addition, new data arrivals are rejected, if the mean delay or the packet loss probability of data exceeds a desirable prespecified level. A semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) is used to model the system operation. Then a value-iteration algorithm is used to derive the optimal admission control. Two models for the other-user interference of the CDMA system are considered: one based on thresholds and another based on the graceful degradation of the CDMA system performance, and their performance is compared. These admission policies can be employed by either terrestrial or satellite CDMA networks and are currently being extended to networks of LEO satellites and multi-rate <b>multi-media</b> CDMA <b>communications...</b>|$|R

40|$|Many {{advertisers}} {{adopt the}} integrated marketing communications per-spective {{that emphasizes the}} importance of synergy in planning multi-media activities. However, the role of synergy in multimedia communica-tions is not well understood. Thus, the authors investigate the theoretical and empirical effects of synergy by extending a commonly used dynamic advertising model to multimedia environments. They illustrate how adver-tisers can estimate and infer the effectiveness of and synergy among <b>multi-media</b> <b>communications</b> by applying Kalman filtering methodology. Using market data on Dockers brand advertising, the authors first calibrate the extended model to establish the presence of synergy between television and print advertisements in consumer markets. Second, they derive the-oretical propositions to understand the impact of synergy on media budget, media mix, and advertising carryover. One of the propositions reveals that as synergy increases, advertisers should not only increase the media budget but also allocate more funds to the less effective activ-ity. The authors also discuss the implications for advertising overspend-ing. Finally, the authors generalize the model to include multiple media, differential carryover, and asymmetrical synergy, and they identify topics for further research...|$|E

40|$|The global picture {{archiving}} {{and communications}} systems (PACS) and telemedicine applications can provide time efficient treatments for patients and can {{save time and}} {{cost of health care}} services. Global multimedia communications networks are essential for supporting global PACS and telemedicine applications. However, global PACS internetwork environments are expensive to implement. Thus, the general internetworking designs for backbone networks are investigated. The differences between global <b>multi-media</b> <b>communications</b> networks and the traditional data communications networks are presented. The communications requirements for time-sensitive voice and video communications services and for error-sensitive data and image communications services are considered in the global backbone network designs for global PACS. The impacts of constant-bit-rate services, variable-bit-rate services, effective end-user bit rates, aggregate network bit rates, and the high-bandwidth and large end-to-end delay factors are investigated for the designs of global backbone networks. Based on considerations of the factors listed above, a national backbone network for global PACS in the United States is designed and proposed. The design is simulated using COMNET II. 5, and the simulation results, which meet the two-second PACS medical image transfer requirement of global PACS, are presented...|$|E

In this article, we propose a shore-to-ship maritime medicine system in an attempt to provide interactive medical service between doctors on hospital and patients on ship. Our maritime medicine system contains (i) blood pressure and body temperature measurement value with very few bits;(ii) medical signals measured by the electrocardiogram device; the data transmission rate is about 9 kbps;(iii) the mobile doctor's advice, data transmission rate is about 1 kbps to show patients ’ medication andrelated matters of attention; the request of transmission bit error rate for these data media is 710;(iv) the approximate 10 kbps audio signal, the request of transmission bit error rate is 310 ；and (v) the 600 kbps with CCD sensor video signal, the request of transmission bit error rate for these media is 410. Data signal is stricter in restriction than general wireless audio & video signal, and it is integrated onto the maritime medical platform. By the help of the multi-code CDMA spread spectrum satellite mobile communication system to make immediate transmission, concurrently we are providing the downlink power control strategy applied in this maritime medical system, making it possible for transmission media in this system to meet the demand of service quality, and achieve the purpose of the maximum resource utilization. We also apply mathematics model analysis to measure power and capacity performance of multi-code CDMA spread spectrum Ka band LEO satellite mobile communications system, and complete related medical signal transmission and simulation tests.

This quantity is essential for the design and performance evaluation of protocols for admission control, dynamic code allocation of multiple-access spread-spectrum packet radio networks; specific applications include networks of LEO satellites and multi-rate <b>multi-media</b> <b>communications</b> using CDMA (code-division multiple- access) techniques. The evaluations are carried out for DS/SS networks employing BPSK modulation with coherent demodulation and convolutional codes with Viterbi decoding. systems with geographically dispersed receivers and systems with colocated receivers are considered. First the exact multireception probabilities for synchronous uncoded systems are evaluated at the bit level; these results are essential for checking the accuracy of the other approximations used here. Our results establish that the Independent Receiver Operation Assumption (IROA) yields very good approximations whose accuracy increases as the number of chips per bit N increases. The IROA accuracy is not as satisfactory for colocated receivers when Eb/No is small; for this case we develop an approximation based on the Guassian multivariate distribution, which is ore accurate than the IROA. Extensive comparisons of the exact expressions with the Guassian and the IROA approximations are conducted. For convolutional code systems, we derive the multireception packet probabilities following a new approach, the Joint First Error Event Approximation (JFEEA), which is based on the lower bound of the probabilities of all-correct packet receptions and the moments of random variables. We compare this approximation with the IROA and observe good agreement between the two...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Presenteeism is {{a growing}} problem in {{developed}} countries mostly due to an aging workforce. The economic costs related to presenteeism exceed those of absenteeism and employer health costs. Employers are implementing workplace health promotion and wellness programs to improve health among workers and reduce presenteeism. How best to design, integrate and deliver these programs are unknown. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to use an intervention mapping approach to develop a workplace health promotion and wellness program aimed at reducing presenteeism. Methods We partnered with a large international financial services company and used a qualitative synthesis based on an intervention mapping methodology. Evidence from systematic reviews and key articles on reducing presenteeism and implementing health promotion programs was combined with theoretical models for changing behavior and stakeholder experience. This was then systematically operationalized into a program using discussion groups and consensus among experts and stakeholders. Results The top health problem impacting our workplace partner was mental health. Depression and stress were the first and second highest cause of productivity loss respectively. A multi-pronged program with detailed action steps was developed and directed at key stakeholders and health conditions. For mental health, regular sharing focus groups, social networking, monthly personal stories from leadership using webinars and <b>multi-media</b> <b>communications,</b> expert-led workshops, lunch and learn sessions and manager and employee training were part of a comprehensive program. Comprehensive, specific and multi-pronged strategies were developed and aimed at encouraging healthy behaviours that impact presenteeism such as regular exercise, proper nutrition, adequate sleep, smoking cessation, socialization and work-life balance. Limitations of the intervention mapping process included high resource and time requirements, the lack of external input and viewpoints skewed towards middle and upper management, and using secondary workplace data of unknown validity and reliability. Conclusions In general, intervention mapping was a useful method to develop a workplace health promotion and wellness program aimed at reducing presenteeism. The methodology provided a step-by-step process to unravel a complex problem. The process compelled participants to think critically, collaboratively and in nontraditional ways...|$|E
