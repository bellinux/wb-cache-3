50|$|The {{dividing}} line between what constitutes a long <b>shot</b> and <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> is not definite, nor is the line between <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> and close-up. In some standard texts and professional references, a full-length view of a human subject is called a medium shot; in this terminology, {{a shot of the}} person from the knees up or the waist up is a close-up shot. In other texts, these partial views are called <b>medium</b> <b>shots.</b> In principal, the <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> is what can be seen with the human eye in a single quick glance and convey all the action taking place in that field of view.|$|R

50|$|This film is {{interesting}} because it contains the first example, of several, now common, cinematic techniques: camera angle, long <b>shot,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> close-up, and forced perspective.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> are favored in {{sequences}} where dialogues or a {{small group}} of people are acting, as they give the viewer a partial view of the background and also show the subjects' facial expressions in the context of their body language. <b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> are also used when the subject in the shot is delivering information, such as news presenters. It is also used in interviews. It is the most common shot in movies, and it usually follows the first establishing shots of a new scene or location.|$|R
50|$|<b>Medium</b> <b>shots</b> {{are divided}} into singles (a waist-high shot of one actor), group shots, over-the {{shoulders}} or two-shots (featuring two people). A <b>medium</b> wide <b>shot,</b> or American shot, shows {{a bit more of}} the background but is still close enough for facial expressions to be seen, although these facial expressions would be better seen in a waist-high shot.|$|R

50|$|As {{is typical}} for Méliès's work, {{most of the}} action is filmed in long <b>shots.</b> Unusually, a <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> also occurs, to clarify the action—probably, in this case, to show the janitor's astonishment more clearly.|$|R

50|$|Then, {{there is}} the <b>medium</b> long <b>shot</b> which makes the subject and the setting have equal {{importance}} and has the two about 50/50 in the frame. Then is the <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> which emphasizes the character and is about a knees to waist up type <b>shot.</b> Then the <b>medium</b> close up is a shot that has the waist to the chest and up. The next closest shot is the close up which has the shoulders and up or maybe a little tighter on the head.|$|R
500|$|Like all Hawks' comedies, {{the film}} {{is known for its}} fast pace (despite being filmed {{primarily}} in long <b>medium</b> <b>shots,</b> with little cross-cutting). Hawks told Peter Bogdanovich, [...] "You get more pace if you pace the actors quickly within the frame rather than cross cutting fast".|$|R
50|$|Mariano Rajoy's {{speech on}} the {{occasion}} of Fiesta Nacional de España was criticized by the Left because it seemed too similar to the King's Christmas speech.

50|$|Cuts {{serve as}} {{transitions}} between camera angles, {{such a wide}} establishing <b>shot</b> and a <b>medium</b> <b>shot.</b> Footage of a moving character may be captured from multiple angles rather than a tracking shot, either for aesthetic reasons or to lessen the risk of damaging a camera while in motion.|$|R
30|$|The {{production}} process of sports videos also has certain rules {{that can be}} used to analyze video content. Ekin et al. studied the scenes of sports videos. They first divided the shots into distant <b>shots,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shots,</b> close-ups shots, and off-site shots based on the main color distribution of the video images. For the semantic understanding of video content, many researchers start from the wonderful event detection of video and expand the semantic analysis of video content [3].|$|R
50|$|The 30 degree {{change of}} {{perspective}} makes the shots different {{enough to avoid}} a jump cut. Too much movement around the subject may violate the 180-degree rule. Following this rule may soften the effect of changing shot distance, such as changing from a <b>medium</b> <b>shot</b> to a close-up or extreme close-up.|$|R

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} February 2006, {{under the supervision}} of the 3D cinematographer Peter Anderson; two shows were filmed in Mexico City to capture <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> during a practice run for the crew to learn the choreography of U2's performances. The crew captured additional <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> using two camera setups at the two São Paulo concerts, and captured overhead footage of drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. using a single camera setup at the show in Santiago. During preparations for the Buenos Aires concerts, U2 performed a 10-song set without an audience, so that the crew could capture close-up footage using a wide-angle lens; doing so in-concert would have interfered with the show. Owens dubbed the session the [...] "phantom shoot". During the Buenos Aires shows, all nine camera setups were used, capturing shots of U2 from the B-stages. The Buenos Aires shoot was the largest of the project, requiring a crew of 140people.|$|R

40|$|The {{world cup}} of men’s {{handball}} team championships was analysed {{using data from}} all matches {{in order to determine}} tactical differences at the elite level. The first aim {{of this study was to}} conduct a technical analysis of current handball and to determine factors related to success in this sport discipline. The second aim was to compare the data of first eight teams with other next teams. An analysis of the performance of the participating teams’ video tapes and CD’s, in the collection of matches, was completed on all the teams taking part in the World Cup Handball Championship 2013. This technical analysis also used cumulative statistics from the International Handball Federation. There were 24 teams in this competition, these were classified participating 2013 into three groups according to the final classification of the winning teams. Variables were identified relating to results of matches (win or lose), and data collection of games was completed by selecting certain codes for each variable of the study variables. The variables included:- Total shots, Total successful shots, Breakthroughs, Breakthroughs successful, Fast break successful, Fast breaks, Red C, Yellow C, 2 Min, Steal, Blocked, Assist, Tech. Faults, 6 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> 6 <b>M</b> successful <b>shots,</b> Wing shots, Wing successful <b>shots,</b> 9 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> 9 <b>M</b> successful <b>shots,</b> 7 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> 7 <b>M</b> successful <b>shots.</b> The technical variables used to compare the teams included: the average number of shots, the efficiency of shots, the efficiency of breakthroughs, fast break goals per team, the efficiency of fast breaks, the average number of 7 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> the efficiency of 7 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> the average number of 6 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> the efficiency of 6 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> the average number of 9 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> the efficiency of 9 <b>M</b> <b>shots,</b> the average number of wing shots, the efficiency of wing shots, offence (The average number of tech faults, the efficiency of tech faults, the average number of assist, the efficiency of assist), defense (The average number of blocked, the efficiency of the average number of steals, the efficiency of steals), and penalties (2 M, yellow card, red card). This technical analysis used cumulative statistics from the International Handball Federation. ANOVA revealed significant differences between the first eight teams in the World cup championships 2013 and their counterparts in the other two groups (group two, teams from 9 - 16 and group three, teams from 17 - 24) in terms of several technical variables. The results showed that the above various affected the ranking in favor of the world cup teams in significant international teams...|$|R
50|$|A {{close-up}} or closeup in filmmaking, television production, still {{photography and}} {{the comic strip}} medium {{is a type of}} shot, which tightly frames a person or an object. Close-ups are one of the standard shots used regularly with <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> and long shots (cinematic techniques). Close-ups display the most detail, but they do not include the broader scene. Moving in to a close-up or away from a close-up is a common type of zooming.|$|R

After receiving Méliès's work, Pathé authorized the filmmaker Ferdinand Zecca to edit it. Zecca cut the film down to half the length Méliès intended, and is also probably responsible for adding the cross-cutting effects and <b>medium</b> <b>shots</b> seen in the film, as these devices are highly unusual in Méliès's style.|$|R

Based on Bayesian Belief Network (BBN), it may bridge this gap between the low-level features describing image/video structure and the high-level knowledge. We apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify and track the ball, the shooter, and the basket as the lowlevel features. Based on these features, our BBN framework can identify four categories of shot event such as short <b>shot,</b> <b>medium</b> <b>shot,</b> long shot, free throw, and the scoring event. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our system may interpret the video shots in terms of four different shot events and one scoring event effectively. 1...|$|R
