25|$|Marchand {{evacuated}} {{his headquarters}} at Salamanca and retired north to Toro where François Étienne de Kellermann joined {{him with a}} dragoon division and some infantry. With Kellermann in overall command, the French recovered Salamanca. Dropping off Marchand and the VI Corps, Kellermann returned north to suppress new guerilla attacks. At this, Del Parque promptly advanced with superior forces, compelling Marchand to abandon Salamanca again. Learning that the main Spanish army had been smashed at the Battle of Ocana and fearing retribution, del Parque withdrew toward his <b>mountain</b> <b>refuge.</b> Meanwhile, Kellermann reappeared with his cavalry, joined Marchand, and launched a pursuit. The French cavalry found del Parque astride a river crossing at Alba de Tormes and mounted a devastating attack. On 28 November, Kellermann routed del Parque at the Battle of Alba de Tormes. Most of the fighting was over by the time Marchand's infantry arrived, though they managed to seize the vital bridge and town from the Spanish rear guard. For the loss of 300 to 600 men, the French inflicted 2,000 killed and wounded on del Parque's army. The French also captured 1,000 Spaniards, nine cannons, {{and most of the}} baggage train.|$|E
500|$|Lawton {{is home to}} many annual attractions, {{including}} the Prince of Peace Easter passion play held in the Holy City in the Wichita <b>Mountain</b> <b>Refuge</b> each year on Palm Sunday, continuing to Easter Eve. It continues {{to be one of}} the longest-running Easter passion plays in the nation and was the basis for the 1949 movie The Prince of Peace. The passion play was also featured in a documentary called Jesus Town, USA which focuses on a new actor portraying the role of Jesus after the former actor of 8 years retired from the role. [...] The documentary is light-hearted and amusing, but turns slightly serious when he announces to the camera that he had become a Buddhist. [...] He struggles with the decision to tell his fellow castmates and family about his rejection of the Christian church. [...] Many folks are upset about his decision, but he is allowed to continue in the role of Jesus despite his faith.|$|E

30|$|Since 1901, the {{majority}} of the mountainous area has been under federal ownership; first as a forest reserve, then, in 1935, as part of the Wichita <b>Mountains</b> Wildlife <b>Refuge,</b> which currently encompasses 23 884 ha. During the early twentieth century, refuge managers used severe grazing of grasslands to remove fuel in order to prevent wildfires (F. Rush, Wichita <b>Mountains</b> Wildlife <b>Refuge,</b> unpublished report). Surveys from the early 1900 s show that much of the area of the Wichita <b>Mountains</b> Wildlife <b>Refuge</b> was heavily grazed (F. Rose, Wichita <b>Mountains</b> Wildlife <b>Refuge,</b> unpublished report; Bruner 1931). In addition to bison and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus), domestic cattle and horse grazing occurred at the preserve until 1937 (McCoy 1985). Currently, major herbivores include American bison, Texas longhorns (Bos taurus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and Rocky Mountain elk. In addition, a limited area in the central valley of the refuge consists of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns with relatively sparse vegetation. In light of historic association of humans with fire, particularly in the midwestern USA (Guyette et al. 2002), it is highly likely that the fire regime experienced anthropogenic influences well before the establishment of the refuge.|$|R

5000|$|Almost all of {{the rock}} in the Picos is limestone, and glacial action has contributed to create an {{impressive}} area of alpine karst. The highest peak is Torre de Cerredo, with an altitude of 2,650 metres at [...] Many other peaks reach altitudes of over 2,600 m. The area is popular with mountaineers, climbers and mountain walkers.
