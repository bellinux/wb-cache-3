40|$|Recent marine sediments from <b>Makirina</b> bay are {{according}} to their organoleptic properties, treated as peloid or healing mud, already frequently used by local people and tourists as pomades. The application of peloids in balneotherapy is mainly intended for therapeutic treatment generally related to muscle-bone skin pathologies and purposes of wellness and relaxation. Recent studies point out {{that one of the}} main factors determining the final characteristics of peloids are grain size distribution, mineralogy, cation exchange capacity (CEC), elemental and microbiological composition of initial »geological material«. As reported by previous studies <b>Makirina</b> Bay peloid is represented mostly by sandy silt with relatively high CEC value (63. 82 meq/ 100 g). Peloid mineral composition is dominated by dolomite and quartz, followed by illite/muscovite, aragonite, halite, calcite, and pyrite. The average concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTE) in <b>Makirina</b> bay peloid determined in this research are: As (17. 6 mg/kg), Cr (92. 09 mg/kg), Cu (44. 5 mg/ kg), Mo (31. 8 mg/kg), Pb (28. 9 mg/kg) and Zn (69. 2 mg/kg) and are comparable to previous results. PTE contents in benthic algae Codium bursa (C. bursa) are: As (8. 8 mg/kg), Cr (15. 7 mg/kg), Cu (5. 6 mg/kg), Mo (0. 7 mg/kg), Pb (3. 6 mg/ kg) and Zn (16. 3 mg/kg). Calculated Transfer factors (TF) from surficial peloid (0 - 5 cm) to benthic algae C. bursa are < 1 for all analysed PTE, indicating no PTE transfer or bioaccumulation of PTE in C. bursa. Results of microbiological research correspond to previous studies and showed no coliforms and E. coli presence in <b>Makirina</b> bay peloid. Our studies have shown the adequate comparability of <b>Makirina</b> Bay peloid with peloids already successfully used in various spa centres around the world in purposes related to wellness and therapy, but additional researches (determination of Cr and Mo mobilities) are necessary before potential use of <b>Makirina</b> bay peloid...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{dissertation}} is to estimate the pollution status of <b>Makirina</b> Bay, situated in Northern Dalmatia. Within the research framework, a detailed analysis of recent marine sediments (peloid), seawater and marine biota (flora and fauna) of <b>Makirina</b> Bay has been carried out. Grain size distribution, mineral, elemental and microbiological composition of peloid have been determined, as well as its organic carbon content, PTE (Potentially Toxic Elements) and REE (Rare Earth Elements) mobility. PTE and REE concentrations were also identified in seawater and biota of <b>Makirina</b> Bay. The concentrations of most PTE in the peloid do not exceed the PEL (Probable Effect Level) value and permissible levels for soils in Slovenia and Croatia. Moreover, the contents are comparable to their respective concentrations in peloids already used in various wellness centers around the world. The results of the sequential extraction method showed that PTE in recent marine sediment are bound to different factions. The major proportion of most PTE is bound to the residual. The PTE in residual are retained within the crystal lattices of minerals, and thus the PTE bound to this component are regarded as stable and are not susceptible to remobilization in normal environmental conditions. Among non-residual fractions, the oxidative fraction is the most important, wherein the PTE are associated with organic matter and/or sulfides. The calculated RAC (Risk Assessment Code) value indicated that the PTE (except Cd and Mo) pose a low to medium risk to the aquatic environment. The sequential extraction method results coincide partly with the findings gained with the BSAF (Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factor) calculation. Distribution of the PTE in seawater is similar to the PTE distribution in recent marine sediment. According to the comparison, only the Cr concentrations stand out. The concentrations of Cr are among the highest in recent marine sediment, while in seawater below detection limit. For some PTE concentrations in recent marine sediments and seawater the impact of anthropogenic activity cannot be completely excluded. Therefore, an environmental policy is advisable for the <b>Makirina</b> Bay and its surroundings...|$|E

40|$|<b>Makirina</b> Cove {{was formed}} by the Holocene sea-level rise which caused a marine ingression into the {{depression}} formed within Albian–Cenomanian dolomites at approximately 4. 5 ka B. P. At present, <b>Makirina</b> Cove represents an restricted, stressed, shallow-marine (< 2 m) ecosystem characterized by varying seawater temperatures (0 – 35 °C) as well as fluctuating salinities (up to 41 ‰) affected by seasonally enhanced evaporation, continuous freshwater supply through on-shore and submarine springs associated with the coastal karst area and surface run-off episodes. These environmental conditions have been conducive to high primary production of organic matter resulting {{in the formation of}} organic-rich deposits which contain up to 5 wt. % of organic carbon. Up to the present times, 3. 5 m of sediments have been deposited indicating a relatively high sedimentation rate estimated at 0. 75 m/ 1. 0 ka in the northern central part of the Cove. The sediments are being deposited mostly as poorly sorted clayey–sandy silts. The distribution and concentration of most of the chemical elements is dependant on the mineralogical composition and granulometric features of the <b>Makirina</b> sediments, which show values more or less similar to those from the Central Adriatic. Accordingly, there is a positive correlation with Al and K concentrations increasing off-shore and with the depth being associated with increasing concentrations of clay minerals within the clay fraction. The same holds true for concentrations of some trace elements, especially Mo and Se which is consistent with the distribution pattern of sulphides. Selenium is preferentially enriched in authigenic pyrite and it is probably the major source of Se in the <b>Makirina</b> Cove sediments. The concentrations of Ca, Mg and Sr decrease off-shore and they are linked to the composition of the surrounding carbonate rocks. The saturation indices show that the water is supersaturated with respect to carbonates enabling the precipitation of authigenic amorphous or crystalline carbonate phases from the pore water in the upper segment of the sediment column. According to the oxygen isotopic (δ 18 O) composition, molluscs precipitated their carbonate shells mostly during warmer periods (May to November) at or near isotopic equilibrium with their ambient waters. The carbon isotopic δ 13 C composition of mollusc carbonate shells is environmentally affected due to oxidation and decomposition of organic matter as well as influxes of fresh water into the Cove, indicating their formation out of the predicted isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric CO 2. Palynological and organic carbon isotopic (δ 13 C) composition shows that the sedimentary organic matter (SOM) is 70 – 90 % lipid- and hydrogen-rich and on average 2 / 3 marine derived (mainly phytoplankton, bacteria and marine macrophytes) and 1 / 3 terrestrially derived (mainly woody tissue). The variations in composition of SOM have been noted {{as a function of the}} distance from the shore. The type and the preservation state of SOM and pyrite as well as the measurements of Eh, pH, total alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and the enrichment of redox-sensitive trace elements, indicate oxygen-depleted depositional conditions and that the sediment is highly reductive even in the uppermost segment at the sediment/water interface. According to the results obtained from the applied methods, the features of <b>Makirina</b> sediments strongly reflect the given depositional conditions within this restricted, stressed, shallow-marine environment where these organic-rich sediments originate, and may therefore serve as a calibration standard in further investigations...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the concentrations of several potentially toxic elements (PTE) in the recent marine sediment of <b>Makirina</b> bay (central Adriatic), which could according to its organoleptic properties be used as a virgin material for medical treatment, wellness and relax purposes. Sediment samples were collected in June and July 2010 from six different sites in the central part of the bay. The range of measured elemental concentrations in analysed surficial sediment were: As (11 - 15, 8 ppm), Cr (61, 6 - 109, 5 ppm), Cu (19, 4 - 54, 2 ppm), Pb (16, 8 - 29, 6 ppm) and Zn (37 - 52 ppm). Sediment PTE pollution assessment was performed using contamination factor (CF), contamination degree (Cdeg) and pollution load index (PLI). The calculated environmental index values show a low to moderate contamination status of sediment. Future geochemical investigation on these sediments are necessary prior actual use in various therapeutic treatment...|$|E
