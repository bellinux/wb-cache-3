60|$|Genevra Octavia Tompkins was Judge Tompkins's only child. Her {{mother had}} long since died on the Plains. Reared in affluence, no pains had been spared with the daughter's education. She was a {{graduate}} of one of the principal seminaries, and spoke French with a perfect Benicia accent. Peerlessly beautiful, she was dressed in a white <b>moire</b> <b>antique</b> robe trimmed with tulle. That simple rosebud with which most heroines exclusively decorate their hair, was all she wore in her raven locks.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{some one}} knocked; {{she would not}} answer. Then came a voice, saying, [...] "Katharine." [...] It was Aunt Barbara's, but it was rather wavering. She would not answer, so the door was opened, and the steps, {{scarcely}} audible in the rustling of the silk, came in; and Kate felt that her aunt was looking at her, wondered whether she had better put out her head, ask pardon, and have it over, but was afraid; and presently heard the <b>moire</b> <b>antique</b> go sweeping away again.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Grantly {{kissed her}} and blessed {{her in the}} hall {{as she was about}} to step forward to her {{travelling}} carriage leaning on her father's arm, and the child put up her face to her mother for a last whisper. [...] "Mamma," [...] she said, [...] "I suppose Jane can put her hand at once on the <b>moire</b> <b>antique</b> when we reach Dover?" [...] Mrs. Grantly smiled and nodded, and again blessed her child. There was not a tear shed--at least, not then--nor a sign of sorrow to cloud for a moment the gay splendour of the day. But the mother did bethink herself, in the solitude of her own room, of those last words, and did acknowledge a lack of something for which her heart had sighed. She had boasted to her sister that she had nothing to regret as to her daughter's education; but now, when she was alone after her success, did she feel that she could still support herself with that boast? For, be it known, Mrs. Grantly had a heart within her bosom and a faith within her heart. The world, it is true, had pressed upon her sorely with all its weight of accumulated clerical wealth, but it had not utterly crushed her--not her, but only her child. For the sins of the father, are they not visited on the third and fourth generation? But if any such feeling of remorse did for awhile mar the fullness of Mrs. Grantly's joy, it was soon dispelled by the perfect success of her daughter's married life. At the end of the autumn the bride and bridegroom returned from their tour, and it was evident to all the circle at Hartletop Priory that Lord Dumbello was by no means dissatisfied with his bargain. His wife had been admired everywhere to the top of his bent. All the world at Ems, and Baden, and at Nice, had been stricken by the stately beauty of the young viscountess. And then, too, her manner, style, and high dignity of demeanour altogether supported the reverential feeling which her grace and form at first inspired. She never derogated from her husband's honour by the fictitious liveliness of gossip, or allowed any one to forget the peeress in the woman. Lord Dumbello soon found that his reputation for discretion was quite safe in her hands, and that there were no lessons as to conduct in which it was necessary that he should give instruction. Before the winter was over she had equally won the hearts of all the circle at Hartletop Priory. The duke was there and declared to the marchioness that Dumbello could not possibly have done better. [...] "Indeed, I do not think he could," [...] said the happy mother. [...] "She sees all that she ought to see, and nothing that she ought not." ...|$|E

[...] <b>Moire</b> <b>antiques</b> you never meet [...] Sweeping the filth of a dirty street [...] But every woman's claim to ton [...] Depends upon [...] The team she drives, whether phaeton, [...] Landau, or britzka. Hence it's plain [...] That Rose, who was of her toilet vain, [...] Should {{have a team}} {{that ought to be}} [...] Equal to any in all Paris! ...|$|R
60|$|We see {{the ladies}} go out shopping, {{in the most}} natural way, and flit from street to street and from store to store, just {{in the good old}} fashion, except that they leave the gondola, instead of a private carriage, waiting at the {{curbstone}} a couple of hours for them,--waiting while they make the nice young clerks pull down tons and tons of silks and velvets and <b>moire</b> <b>antiques</b> and those things; and then they buy a paper of pins and go paddling away to confer the rest of their disastrous patronage on some other firm. And they always have their purchases sent home just in the good old way. Human nature is very much the same all over the world; and it is so like my dear native home to see a Venetian lady go into a store and buy ten cents' worth of blue ribbon and have it sent home in a scow. Ah, it is these little touches of nature that move one to tears in these far-off foreign lands.|$|R
50|$|The {{dress was}} {{manufactured}} by Mrs Darvill, designed by Janet Fife, and {{composed of a}} rich robe of white moire antique; ornamented with three flounces of Honiton lace. The design of the lace consisted of bouquets in open work of the rose, shamrock, and thistle in three medallions. At {{the top of each}} flounce {{on the front of the}} dress was wreaths of orange and myrtle blossoms, the latter being the bridal flower of Germany, every wreath ended with bouquets of the same flowers and the length of each being so graduated as to give the appearance of a robe hemmed with flowers. The apex of this floral pyramid was formed by a large bouquet worn on the girdle. The train, which was of the unusual length of more than three yards, was of white <b>moire</b> <b>antique,</b> trimmed with two rows of Honiton lace surmounted by wreaths similar to those on the flounces of the dress with bouquets at short intervals.|$|E
5000|$|On {{his return}} from Bombay Duleep passed through Cairo and visited the missionaries there on 10 February 1864. He visited again {{a few days later}} and was taken around the girls' school, where he first met Bamba Müller, who was an instructor. She was the only girl there who had {{committed}} herself to a Christian life. On each visit Duleep made presents to the mission of several hundreds of pounds.Duleep Singh wrote to the teachers at the missionary school {{at the end of the}} month in the hope that they would recommend a wife for him as he was to live in Britain and he wanted a Christian wife of Eastern origin. Queen Victoria had told Duleep that he should marry an Indian princess who had been educated in England, but he desired a girl with less sophistication. The final proposal had to be done via an intermediary as Duleep did not speak Arabic, Müller's only language. [...] The missionaries discussed this proposal with Müller. She was unsure whether to accept the proposal offered via the missionaries. Her first ambition was to rise to teach children in a missionary school. Her father was consulted but he left the choice to his daughter. Müller eventually made her decision after praying for guidance. She decided that the marriage was God's call for her to widen her ambitions. Singh made a substantial contribution of one thousand pounds to the school and married Müller on 7 June 1864 in the British Consulate in Alexandria, Egypt. The ceremony was described as brief, with few witnesses. Both of them wore European dress apart from Duleep, who wore a turban. Bamba wore simple jewellery including pearls. She had a short sleeved, <b>moire,</b> <b>antique</b> dress, orange blossoms in her hair, and a veil. The Prince made his vows in English, whilst Bamba spoke in Arabic.|$|E
