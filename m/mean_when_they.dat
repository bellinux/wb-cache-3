25|$|Contemporary romance, {{which is}} set after World War II, is often what people <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> refer to a romance novel. Contemporary romance novels—the largest subgenre—are set in {{the time when they}} are written, and usually reflect the mores of that time. Heroines in {{contemporary}} romances prior to 1970 usually quit working when they marry or have children—while heroines after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred.|$|E
500|$|Today, it is {{generally}} accepted that Sappho's poetry portrays homoerotic feelings: as Sandra Boehringer puts it, her works [...] "clearly celebrate eros between women". Toward {{the end of the}} twentieth century, though, some scholars have begun to reject the question of whether or not Sappho was a lesbian – Glenn Most wrote that Sappho herself [...] "would have had no idea what people <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> call her nowadays a homosexual", André Lardinois stated that it is [...] "nonsensical" [...] to ask whether Sappho was a lesbian, and Page duBois calls the question a [...] "particularly obfuscating debate".|$|E
500|$|The 808's sounds do not {{resemble}} real percussion, {{and have}} been described as [...] "clicky and hypnotic", [...] "robotic", [...] "toy-like", [...] "spacey" [...] and [...] "futuristic". Fact described them as a combination of [...] "synth tones and white noise... more akin to bursts coming from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop [...] a proper rhythm section." [...] The machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a combination of a bridged T-network sine oscillator, a low-pass filter, and a voltage-controlled amplifier. The bass drum decay control allows the user to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over long periods, possibly not by design. The New Yorker wrote: [...] "Less a product of engineering than a force of nature, this bass-rolling subsonic boom has come to be what people <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> refer to 'an 808'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Communication between {{squirrels}} is {{done through}} both vocal and physical <b>means.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> meet, {{nose to nose}} contact is made or other body parts are pressed together. The [...] "tsik-tsik" [...] calls are made in response to threats and vary as between different predators. Deep guttural sounds are used to indicate land-based predators while short [...] "band whistle" [...] chatter indicates danger from the air.|$|R
5000|$|Ladies Chain : A half ladies chain, {{which is}} more common and usually what a caller <b>means</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> just say [...] "ladies chain," [...] has the ladies joining right hands {{in the center and}} pulling past each other to the {{opposite}} gent; the gents then give the ladies a courtesy turn (see above). This causes the ladies to trade sides in the set. A full ladies chain is two half-chains in succession, with everyone winding up where they started.|$|R

500|$|Duerr {{provides}} additional ethnographic examples {{showing how}} societal rules were reversed at special {{times of the}} year. In shamanic terms, societies which espouse an [...] "archaic mentality" [...] understand who they are by understanding who they are not; according to Duerr, modern societies fail to understand this concept. [...] Datura, a plant that contains toxic hallucinogens is discussed. [...] The plant was introduced to Europe in the early modern period. [...] Among the Huichol people of central Mexico, shamans have told anthropologists that Datura is used by malevolent witches. Duerr makes note of the anthropologists who have undertaken shamanic experiences with the people they are studying, such as Barbara Myerhoff and Carlos Castenada, but argues that such ethnographers have failed to truly understand what shamans <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> describe their experiences as [...] "flying". In Duerr's view, shamans learn to evaporate their [...] "ego boundaries", thereby experiencing themselves in a different way; it is this feeling that {{can be described as}} shamanic flying. Duerr ties these shamanic practices into the werewolves of early modern Europe, arguing that these werewolves did not physically transform into wolves, but that they embraced their [...] "wolf nature" [...] by crossing over the boundary from [...] "civilisation" [...] to [...] "wilderness".|$|E
2500|$|The {{relations}} among these quantities are {{not thought of}} as being given by formulas, {{but on the other}} hand they are surely not thought of as being the sort of general set-theoretic, anything-goes subsets of product spaces that modern mathematicians <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> use the word [...] "function".|$|E
2500|$|Litvinenko also {{commented on}} a new law that [...] "Russia {{has the right to}} carry out {{preemptive}} strikes on militant bases abroad" [...] and explained that these [...] "preemptive strikes may involve anything except nuclear weapons." [...] Litvinenko said, [...] "You know who they <b>mean</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> say 'terrorist bases abroad'? They mean us, Zakayev and Boris and me." [...] He also said that [...] "It was considered in our service that poison is an easier weapon than a pistol." [...] He referred to a secret laboratory in Moscow that still continues development of deadly poisons, according to him.|$|E
50|$|After the {{selection}} of features that are important for our task {{it is crucial to}} analyze the chosen data. Before the actual analysis, the clinical and molecular (sometimes even the genetic) data needs to be integrated because it has a big impact on what can be deducted from the analysis. There are different methods to finally analyze the data. First, the different features are compared to one another to find out whether they have any information in common and to reveal what it <b>means</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> all occur at the same time.|$|R
60|$|Among {{those who}} had {{attained}} to the enviable ox-waggon were our friends John Skyd and Frank Dobson. Possessing a remnant of their <b>means</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> gave up farming, two of the brothers, James and Robert, established a small general store in Grahamstown, while John and Frank set up a joint waggon and took to hunting and trading on a large scale. Of course they bought all their supplies of brass-wire, beads and buttons, powder and shot etcetera, from the Skyd store, and sold their ivory, etcetera, at the same place, with mutual benefit.|$|R
40|$|The NFV {{paradigm}} transforms those applications {{executed for}} decades in dedicated appliances, into software images to be consolidated in standard server.
