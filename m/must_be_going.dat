500|$|In April 2004, Michael Grade {{returned}} to the BBC, {{this time as the}} Chairman of the Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he had previously disliked the show and imposed an eighteen-month hiatus on it during the Sixth Doctor era, he eventually wrote an e-mail to the Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity. He also declared, [...] " [...] never dreamed I would ever write this. I <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> soft!" [...] The revival also impressed former Doctor Sylvester McCoy, who praised Eccleston and Piper as well as their characters, and the pacing of the first episode. His only criticism was about the new TARDIS interior, though he did comment that he was [...] "also a bit dismayed that more wasn't made of the show's incidental music, which seemed fairly anonymous in the background".|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{received}} favourably {{by the majority}} of music critics, although opinions have become more negative in subsequent decades and it has rarely been featured in [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] lists since. It won three Grammy Awards including for Album of the Year in 1986. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that Collins was [...] "quietly revolutionising and expanding the role of the drums in pop record making". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote that, [...] "Like his '81 and '82 outings, Face Value and Hello, I <b>Must</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Going!,</b> No Jacket Required is not an album that waits to be liked". Collins' most commercially successful solo album, it reached number one in several countries, including the US (where it {{was at the top of}} the charts for seven weeks), the UK and Canada. According to the RIAA, the record sold over twelve million copies in the US, and in the UK, the album sold over two million copies, and was certified 6Ã— platinum.
