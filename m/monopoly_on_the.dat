5|$|In 1670, Charles II {{incorporated}} by royal charter the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), granting it a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fur {{trade in the}} area known as Rupert's Land, which would later form {{a large proportion of}} the Dominion of Canada. Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent New France.|$|E
5|$|The 1790 edition was {{the only}} one to appear in Bellman's lifetime. It was {{published}} by Olof Åhlström, by royal privilege; he held a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> printing of sheet music in Sweden. Åhlström arranged the songs for piano, and Kellgren edited the song texts and wrote an introduction, but the extent of their influence on the shape of Fredman's Epistles cannot be fully determined. The edition was illustrated with a frontispiece by the leading Swedish artist Johan Tobias Sergel, engraved by Johan Fredrik Martin.|$|E

5|$|The Bank of England, {{founded in}} 1694 by Scottish banker William Paterson, is the United Kingdom's central bank.

The bank has a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of banknotes in England and Wales, although not {{in other parts of the}} United Kingdom. The government has devolved responsibility to the bank's Monetary Policy Committee for managing the monetary policy of the country and setting interest rates.|$|E
5|$|The route Stavanger–Bergen–Trondheim {{was awarded}} to Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap in 1956, but this company filed for {{bankruptcy}} the following year. Ålesund Airport, Vigra was {{scheduled to open in}} 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger – Bergen – Ålesund – Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route Ålesund–Oslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since {{that would allow them to}} cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo–Trondheim, Oslo–Stavanger, Oslo–Kristiansand and Kristiansand–Stavanger–Bergen; Braathens SAFE had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> routes Oslo–Ålesund and Bergen–Ålesund–Trondheim, while SAS was granted a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> routes Oslo–Bergen and (Oslo)–Trondheim–Bodø–Bardufoss. In 1958, Braathens SAFE had 77,591 passengers.|$|E
5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of state <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government. It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike. This is why the Polish flag, {{as a symbol of}} patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule, is part of the Solidarity trade union logo.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most important offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as {{it was felt that}} they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League had already lost its <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{profitable}} and prosperous Baltic Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the Baltic Sea, controlled {{the entrance to the}} Baltic Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|Economic life in {{the towns}} was {{subsequently}} brought {{under the control of}} entrepreneurial Bugis, Makassarese, and Butonese immigrants from South Sulawesi, while East Timor products were exported under partnerships between army officials and Indonesian businessmen. Denok, a military-controlled firm, monopolised some of East Timor's most lucrative commercial activities, including sandal wood export, hotels, and the import of consumer products. The group's most profitable business, however, was its <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> export of coffee, which was the territory's most valuable cash crop. Indonesian entrepreneurs came to dominate non-Denok/military enterprises, and local manufactures from the Portuguese period made way for Indonesian imports.|$|E

5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was an 18th century Court Jew in the employ of Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg in Stuttgart. As a {{financial}} advisor for Duke Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, he also gained a prominent {{position as a}} court Jew and held the reins of the finances in his duchy. He established a duchy <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trade of salt, leather, tobacco, and liquor and founded a bank and porcelain factory. In the process, he {{made a number of}} enemies who claimed, among other things, that he was involved with local gambling houses.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1 April 1994, all air {{transport}} in Norway {{was restricted to}} airlines that had received concession from the ministry. On the primary domestic routes, the traffic was split between SAS and Braathens SAFE, although both had services to Trondheim and Stavanger. SAS had a monopoly to Bergen and Northern Norway (Alta, Bardufoss, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Kirkenes, Longyearbyen and Tromsø), while Braathens SAFE had a monopoly to the other primary airports in Southern Norway (Haugesund, Kristiansand, Kristiansund, Molde, Røros and Ålesund). Widerøe had a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> regional state-supported routes (Brønnøysund, Florø, Førde, Sandane, Sogndal and Ørsta/Volda), and also served Stord and Sandefjord.|$|E

5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he hoped they would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|WIN became {{regional}} Western Australia's second {{commercial television}} network on 26 March 1999 after winning rights in 1997. Prior to {{the launch of}} the new station, GWN held a commercial <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market. GWN became an affiliate of the Seven Network, while WIN took a combination of Nine Network and Network Ten programming. Despite the Nine Network's traditional ratings dominance throughout most of the country, GWN has remained the market's most-watched station. The second ratings survey of 2006 placed WIN Television with a 34.7% commercial audience share in prime time, compared to the Golden West Network with 65.3%, thus being no.2 among regional viewers.|$|E
5|$|With {{this growth}} in commerce, Tudor's initial <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trade broke down, but he {{continued}} to make significant profits from the growing trade. Increased supplies of ice were also needed {{to keep up with}} demand. From 1842 onwards, Tudor and others invested at Walden Pond in New England for additional supplies. New companies began to spring up, such as the Philadelphia Ice Company, which made use of the new railroad lines to transport harvested ice, while the Kershow family introduced improved ice harvesting to the New York region.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Cantillon became {{involved}} with British mercantilist John Law through the Mississippi Company. Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract The Key of Wealth, John Law posited that increases in the money supply {{would lead to the}} employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity. In 1716, the French government granted him both permission to found the Banque Générale and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named the Mississippi Company. In return, Law promised the French government to finance their debt at low rates of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the Banque Générales virtual <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of bank notes to finance his investors.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{developed}} a large practice among powerful people, including Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester {{and the principal}} secretary Sir Francis Walsingham, and in 1581 he was made physician-in-chief to Queen Elizabeth I of England and her household, with a life pension of £50 per year. In June 1584, Elizabeth granted him a <b>monopoly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> importation of aniseed and sumac to England for ten years; this was renewed in January 1593. In 1588 he was given land and tithes in Worcestershire belonging to the Bishop of Worcester Edmund Freke. Gabriel Harvey, an English scholar of the era, remarked on Lopez's rise on the title page of a book he owned, Judaeorum Medicastrorum calumnias:Doctor Lopus, the Queenes physitian, is descended of Jewes: but himselfe A Christian, & Portugall.

A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose handy for putting out a fire.|$|E
