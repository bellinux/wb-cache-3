40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the development of smart meter using Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). This entails transport of metering data from energy consumer’s premises to the data management systems of energy provider using a practical mesh networking solution to realize metering communication. When the demand in the grid increases with decreased amount of power generated, this in turn leads to insufficient availability of power at the consumer premises. The proposed work employs a ZigBee based digital power meter in which prioritization of appliances are employed. If the power is less on the grid, the power will be automatically managed using the controller embedded in the digital <b>meter.</b> <b>Constant</b> uninterrupted power is fed to the higher priority appliances connected to the meter, while the lower priority appliances receive power according to the power availability on the grid. The power usage of consumer is monitored through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) by the energy provider, {{in order to prevent}} the power theft...|$|E

Strictly, EV is not a measure of luminance or illuminance; rather, an EV corresponds to a luminance (or illuminance) for which a camera with a given ISO speed would use the indicated EV to obtain the nominally correct exposure. Nonetheless, it is common practice among photographic equipment manufacturers to express luminance in EV for ISO 100 speed, as when specifying metering range (Ray 2000, 318) or autofocus sensitivity. And the practice is long established; (Ray 2002, 592) cites Ulffers (1968) as an early example.

If the cost to lift one gram of mass one vertical <b>meter</b> is <b>constant,</b> small animals should require proportionally smaller increases in metabolic cost to run uphill. To test this hypothesis on very small animals possessing an exceptional capacity for ascending steep gradients, we measured the metabolic cost of locomotion in the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, running at angles of 0, 45 and 90 ° to the horizontal. Resting oxygen consumption (Vc^rest) was not affected by incline angle. Steady-state oxygen consumption (Vo 2 ss) increased linearly with speed at all angles of ascent. The minimum cost of locomotion (the slope of the Vc ̂ ss versus speed function) increased with increasing angle of ascent. The minimum cost of locomotion on 45 and 90 ° inclines was two and three times greater, respectively, than the cost during horizontal running. The cockroach's metabolic cost of ascent greatly exceeds that predicted from the hypothesis of a constant efficiency for vertical work. Variations in stride frequency and contact time cannot account for the high metabolic cost, because they were independent of incline angle. An increase in the metabolic cost or amount of force production may best explain the increase in metabolic cost. Small animals, such as P. americana, can easily scale vertical surfaces, but the energetic cost is considerable...|$|R

This study also incorporates different angles of applied force and varying mannequin positions to simulate conditions often encountered in the operating room. Methods: An airway trainer mannequin was intubated using a standard cuffed endotracheal tube and secured with one of four varieties of tape and one of three taping methods in randomly assigned order.

40|$|A {{selective}} {{combination of}} the principles of a thermal mass flow <b>meter</b> and <b>constant</b> temperature anemometry was used to develop a solid mass flow meter that improves significantly on the flow meter developed by De Vos et al (2010). The flow meter has a measurement plate that is kept at a constant temperature. Due to conductive heat transfer between the entrained solids and the measurement plate, additional power is needed to maintain the plate at this setpoint temperature value. This additional power was correlated against the average solids flow rate. The calibration curve shows a linear relationship between the power measurement and the entrainment flux for entrainment fluxes between 3. 4 x 10 - 4 kg/(m 2. s) and 7. 5 x 10 - 3 kg/(m 2. s). Deviation from a linear response at lower entrainment fluxes may be caused by a longer residence time of fine particles on the measurement plate due to lower shear forces. At higher entrainment fluxes the power measurements were unreliable due to poor temperature control. The turndown ratio of the linear section of the calibration curve is approximately 3 times that of the linear part of the calibration curve of the flow meter developed by De Vos et al (2010). Even further improvement is possible with better temperature control. In a case study to test the applicability of the flow meter to measure changes in entrainment rate associated with hydrodynamic properties other than a change in gas superficial velocity, small amounts of ethanol were dosed to the inlet air. The continuously measured entrainment rate increased at lower ethanol dosing rates but decreased as the dosing rate of ethanol was increased. The increase in entrainment rate may be explained by a reduction in static electricity in the bed, while the decrease at higher dosing rates may be as a result of increased powder cohesivity.
