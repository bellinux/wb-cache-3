500|$|Among {{the more}} {{surprising}} and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology {{is that the}} diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity {{at the level of}} the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: [...] "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), where does it come from? Novelty <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>by</b> mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.|$|E

6000|$|The {{definition}} of a germ as [...] "matter potentially alive, and having within itself the tendency to assume a definite living form," [...] appears to meet all the requirements of modern science. For, notwithstanding it might be justly questioned whether a germ is not merely potentially, but rather actually, alive, though its vital manifestations are reduced to a minimum, the term [...] "potential" [...] may fairly {{be used in a}} sense broad enough to escape the objection. And the qualification of [...] "potential" [...] has the advantage of reminding us that the great characteristic of the germ is not so much what it is, but what it may, under suitable conditions, become. Harvey shared the belief of Aristotle--whose writings he so often quotes and of whom he speaks as his precursor and model, with the generous respect with which one genuine worker should regard another--that such germs <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>by</b> a process of [...] "equivocal generation" [...] out of not-living matter; and the aphorism so commonly ascribed to him, [...] "omne vivum ex ovo" [...] and which is indeed a fair summary of his reiterated assertions, though incessantly employed against the modern advocates of spontaneous generation, can be honestly so used only by those who have never read a score of pages of the [...] "Exercitationes." [...] Harvey, in fact, believed as implicitly as Aristotle did in the equivocal generation of the lower animals. But, while the course of modern investigation has only brought out into greater prominence the accuracy of Harvey's conception of the nature and mode of development of germs, it has as distinctly tended to disprove the occurrence of equivocal generation, or abiogenesis, in the present course of nature. In the immense majority of both plants and animals, it is certain that the germ is not merely a body in which life is dormant or potential, but that it is itself simply a detached portion of the substance of a pre-existing living body; and the evidence has yet to be adduced which will satisfy any cautious reasoner that [...] "omne vivum ex vivo" [...] is not as well-established a law of the existing course of nature as [...] "omne vivum ex ovo." ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{opposed to}} sharing full ownership, and without {{dividing}} land physically, {{the use and}} enjoyment of land can be shared when owners grant licences or leases. The {{difference between the two}} matters because a lease counts as a property right that binds third parties even if a freehold changes hands, and because more statutory protection for tenants attaches only to leases, albeit that many cases have increased protection for license holders too. A licence {{is said to be a}} personal obligation, which in traditional theory was said to create rights enforceable only between the people privy to the licence. First, licences <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>by</b> implication of the law, such as when a customer walks through an open shop door. The customer is recognised as having a [...] "bare licence" [...] which makes him immune from an action for trespass, and can only be asked to leave over within a reasonable time. Second, they <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>by</b> statute, as with the Family Law Act 1996 sections 30-31. Third, they <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> <b>by</b> estoppel. And practically most important, licences can arise through a contract. This will set the terms of the land's use by the licensee. For example, in Hurst v Picture Theatres Ltd, Mr Hurst was removed from a High Street Kensington theatre by a manager who honestly believed that he had not paid for his ticket. Buckley LJ held the theatre was not entitled to remove him, even if it revoked the ticket, because with, and in addition to breach of contract they committed assault on him, for which he could claim additional damages. However, breach of contractual licence will not entitle the victim to force his way back, so in Thompson v Park a teacher who tried to force his way back into a school was told he had no remedy because he should have sought a court declaration first. If possible, and as damages will often be inadequate, the courts show preference for awarding specific performance. This was so even when the claimant was the National Front, who had licensed a Pavilion for its annual conference.|$|E
