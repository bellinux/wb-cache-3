He also formed an extensive collection of fossils. The organic remains of the London Clay attracted particular attention, and about the year 1836 he and six other workers founded The London Clay Club - the members comprising Dr Bowerbank, Frederick E. Edwards (1799-1875), author of The Eocene Mollusca (Palaeontograph. Soc.), Searles Valentine Wood, John Morris, Alfred White (zoologist), N. T. Wetherell, surgeon of Highgate (1800-1875), and James De Carle Sowerby. In 1840, Bowerbank published A History of the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of the London Clay, {{and two years later}} he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.In 1847 he suggested the establishment of a society for the publication of undescribed British Fossils, and thus originated the Palaeontographical Society. From 1844 until 1864 he did much to encourage a love of natural science by being at home every Monday evening at his residence in Park Street, Islington, and afterwards in Highbury Grove, where the treasures of his museum, his 4 microscopes, and his personal assistance were at the service of every earnest student. In the study of sponges he became specially interested, and he was author of A Monograph of the British Spongiadae in 4 vols., published by the Ray Society, 1864-1882. He retired in 1864 to St Leonards-on-Sea, where he died on 8 March 1877.|$|R

50|$|<b>Moss</b> <b>agate</b> (also called mocha stone) is a semi-precious {{gemstone}} {{formed from}} silicon dioxide. It {{is a form}} of chalcedony which includes minerals of a green colour embedded in the stone, forming filaments and other patterns suggestive of moss. The field is a clear or milky-white quartz, and the included minerals are mainly oxides of manganese or iron. It is not a true form of agate, as it lacks agate's defining feature of concentric banding. <b>Moss</b> <b>agate</b> is of the white variety with green inclusions that resemble moss. It occurs in many locations. The colors are formed due to trace amounts of metal present as an impurity, such as chrome or iron. The metals can make different colors depending on their valence (oxidation state).|$|E

50|$|A Mexican agate, showing only {{a single}} eye, has {{received}} the name of cyclops agate. Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or <b>moss</b> <b>agate.</b> Dendritic agates have fern like patterns in them formed due {{to the presence of}} manganese and iron oxides. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance. Enhydro agate contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles.|$|E
5000|$|Marcantonio Sabbatini (1637 - 1724), of a noble {{family of}} Bologna, was an antiquary and papal curator to Pope Clement XI and art advisor to Charles VI, {{a central figure}} among the cognoscenti in Baroque Rome. Under his {{supervision}} the pope's nephew, Alessandro Albani, developed the taste for antiquities {{for which he is}} remembered; it was Sabbatini who selected from Albani's collection the antique <b>moss</b> <b>agate</b> carved in high relief with a sleeping tiger that would make a suitable gift to Prince Eugene of Savoy.Among carved gems the [...] "Strozzi Medusa" [...] bearing a signature [...] "Solon" [...] passed through Sabatini's collection. Carved gems in his collection were included among those in Paolo Alessandro Maffei's Gemme antiche (Rome: Domenico de' Rossi), 1708; one of them, a head of Vespasian bears the added inscription LAUR. MED. of Lorenzo de' Medici, which was a habit of Lorenzo's. A caricature by Pier Leone Ghezzi of Sabbatini and Baron Philipp von Stosch, another renowned antiquary, closely examining engraved gems, is conserved in the Ashmolean museum. Sabbatini's portrait is in the library of the Università di Bologna.|$|E
5000|$|Mocha {{decorated}} pottery {{is a type}} of dipped ware (slip-decorated, lathe-turned, utilitarian earthenware), mocha or mochaware, {{in addition}} to colored slip bands on white and buff-colored bodies, is adorned with dendritic (tree-like or branching) markings resembling the natural geological markings on <b>moss</b> <b>agate,</b> known as [...] "mocha stone" [...] in Great Britain in the late 18th century. The stone was imported from Arabia through the port of Mocha (al Mukha in Yemen) from whence came large supplies of coffee. An unknown potter or turner discovered that by dripping a colored acidic solution into wet alkaline slip on a pot body, the color would instantly ramify into the dendritic random markings that fit into the tradition of imitating geological surfaces prevalent in the potteries of that period. The earliest known dated example (1799) is a mug {{in the collection of the}} Christchurch Mansion Museum in Ipswich, England.Archaeological excavations of the wreck of the HMS Nymphe in Road Town Harbor on Tortuga in the British West Indies produced sherds of two earthenware vessels with dendritic markings on slip marbled surfaces. The sloop was accidentally burned and sunk in 1783, giving an earlier date for this technique provided the sherds are from that wreck. The context appears to support that supposition. Archival references are known that mention [...] "mocoe beakers" [...] as early as 1792.|$|E

40|$|Recent archaeological {{research}} in High Plains archaeology focuses on aspects of landscape and identifying areas that likely registered as “places” {{in the minds}} of past peoples. Agate Fossil Beds National Monument in Sioux County, Nebraska is located in an area wealthy in multi-component sites and a rich research history. Yet so many of the features common at neighboring sites are missing from this area. Based on what Agate Fossil Beds National Monument lacks, researchers refer to this area as transitional, merely a crossroads between places. However, Agate Fossil Beds National Monument contains multiple desirable resources such as a perennial water supply (local springs and the Niobrara River), as well as tabular deposits of Upper Harrison Formation <b>Moss</b> <b>Agate.</b> Past research within the monument shows that past peoples occupied this portion of the Nebraska High Plains from the earliest known prehistoric archaeological culture until historic times. Was Agate Fossil Beds just a crossroads to other locations as has been suggested? Or did something else make this area a persistent destination for native peoples? This thesis relies on a landscape approach, as well as recent archaeological {{research in}}vestigating issues of time and place, with a chipped stone tool analysis to explore the answer to this problem...|$|E
