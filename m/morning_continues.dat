50|$|The {{third and}} final session on Saturday <b>morning</b> <b>continued</b> the trend, with Sebastian Vettel {{returning}} {{to the top of}} the time sheets, with Mark Webber a close second; both drivers were the only two men to break the 1min 31sec barrier all weekend. Several drivers were hampered with mechanical issues, with Trulli losing more time to hydraulics problems, as did Adrian Sutil. Timo Glock also had little on-track time after this VR-01 fell victim to a throttle problem. Vettel also suffered his own mechanical problem when his front wing detached itself on the high-speed approach to Abbey late in the hour. The young German driver was able to slow the car down and prevent an accident, and his time remained unbeaten for the last few minutes of the session.|$|R

After three decades of resistance, Disney finally entered Saturday morning in 1985 when The Gummi Bears and The Wuzzles debuted with significantly more substantial budgets; the first-run syndication success of DuckTales, which premiered in 1987, eventually inspired a whole block of Disney-produced syndicated cartoons which forced competing studios to improve their own production standards to compete.|$|R

60|$|After {{examining}} his {{bonds and}} assuring {{themselves that they}} were tight, the Indians lay down to sleep, but in the <b>morning</b> <b>continued</b> their journey as soon as daylight broke. From the absence of undergrowth and of lianas stretching {{from tree to tree}} anywhere low down, Stephen {{came to the conclusion that}} they were following what was in the dry season a track through the forest. The Indians were quite young men, and laughed and talked without any of the gravity that distinguished the older men among the natives. For some hours they paddled on, then their progress was stopped by a deep tangle of creepers stretching from tree to tree across their way. There was an exclamation of surprise and, as Stephen thought, of apprehension; they began to talk rapidly and eagerly together, one pointing in one direction and another in quite an opposite one.|$|R

After a transmeridian flight from London To San Francisco, sleep onset was faster and, {{although there was}} increased wakefulness {{during the second half}} of the night, sleep duration and efficiency over the whole night were not changed. The progressive decrease in sleep latencies observed normally in the multiple sleep latency test during the <b>morning</b> <b>continued</b> throughout the day after arrival. Of the 13 subjects, 12 took a nap of around 1 -h duration in the afternoon preceding the return flight. These naps would have been encouraged by the drowsiness at this time and facilitated by the departure of the aircraft being scheduled during the early evening. An early evening departure had the further advantage that the circadian increase in vigilance expected during the early part of the day would occur during the latter part of the return flight...|$|R

So the days passed on until Nanina left her situation and returned to Pisa. This circumstance was duly reported to Father Rocco by his correspondent at Florence; but, whether he was too much occupied among the statues, or whether it was one result of his cautious resolution never to expose himself unnecessarily to so much as the breath of detraction, he made no attempt to see Nanina, or even to justify himself toward her by writing her a letter. All his <b>mornings</b> <b>continued</b> to be spent alone in the studio, and all his afternoons to be occupied by his clerical duties, until the day before the masked ball at the Melani Palace.|$|R
