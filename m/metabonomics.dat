5000|$|... ==Metabonomics== <b>Metabonomics</b> {{is defined}} as [...] "the {{quantitative}} measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification". The word origin is from the Greek μεταβολή meaning change and nomos meaning a rule set or set of laws. This approach was pioneered by Jeremy Nicholson at Imperial College London and {{has been used in}} toxicology, disease diagnosis {{and a number of other}} fields. Historically, the <b>metabonomics</b> approach was one of the first methods to apply the scope of systems biology to studies of metabolism.|$|E

50|$|The term {{metabolomic}} {{has been}} recently introduced {{to address the}} global analysis of all metabolites in a biological sample. A related term, <b>metabonomics,</b> was introduced to refer specifically {{to the analysis of}} metabolic responses to drugs or diseases. <b>Metabonomics</b> has become a major area of research; it is the complex system biological study, used as a method to identify the biomarker for various disease. In general, in most disease cases, a metabolic pathway had or has been either activated or deactivated - this parameter can thus be used as a marker for some diseases. Serotonin production pathways, activated in a person who has recently consumed alcohol for instance, can be a metabolic marker of recent alcohol consumption.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} some {{disagreement}} over the exact differences between 'metabolomics' and 'metabonomics'. The {{difference between the two}} terms is not related to choice of analytical platform: although <b>metabonomics</b> is more associated with NMR spectroscopy and metabolomics with mass spectrometry-based techniques, this is simply because of usages amongst different groups that have popularized the different terms. While there is still no absolute agreement, there is a growing consensus that 'metabolomics' places a greater emphasis on metabolic profiling at a cellular or organ level and is primarily concerned with normal endogenous metabolism. 'Metabonomics' extends metabolic profiling to include information about perturbations of metabolism caused by environmental factors (including diet and toxins), disease processes, and the involvement of extragenomic influences, such as gut microflora. This is not a trivial difference; metabolomic studies should, by definition, exclude metabolic contributions from extragenomic sources, because these are external to the system being studied. However, in practice, within the field of human disease research there is still a large degree of overlap in the way both terms are used, and they are often in effect synonymous.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring the {{progression}} of HIV infection to full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and assessing responses to treatment will benefit greatly from the identification of novel biological markers especially since existing clinical indicators of disease are not infallible. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) are powerful methodologies used in metabonomic analyses for an approximation of HIV-induced changes to the phenotype of an infected individual. Although early in its application to HIV/AIDS, (biofluid) <b>metabonomics</b> has already identified metabolic pathways influenced by both HIV and/or its treatment. To date, biofluid NMR and MS data show that the virus and highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) mainly influence carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, suggesting that infected individuals are susceptible to very specific metabolic complications. A number of well-defined biofluid metabonomic studies clearly distinguished HIV negative, positive and treatment experienced patient profiles from one another. While many of the virus or treatment affected metabolites have been identified, the <b>metabonomics</b> measurements were mostly qualitative. The identities of the molecules were not always validated neither were the statistical models used to distinguish between groups. Assigning particular metabolic changes to specific drug regimens using <b>metabonomics</b> also remains to be done.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{feasibility}} of <b>metabonomics</b> in clinical studies and the curative effect of drug. It is projected that type 2 diabetes will be the biggest killer in the western world by 2020. Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is the main chronicity complication of Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Losartan, a kind of hypertension-drug, was found to have some curative effect to diabetes mellitus. The current GC pattern recognition (PR) approach to investigating the dose-related and the time-related metabolic effects of drug is described by the <b>metabonomics</b> platform. Diabetes Mellitus patients were dosed with Losartan (dose a and b) and urine was collected at 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Firstly the biochemical criterions (blood pressure, urinary albumen, urinary 8 －OHdG and blood creatinine) were analyzed. Then urine samples were derivatived and analyzed by GC. After alignment the data were treated with multivariate analysis. The result indicated <b>metabonomics</b> analysis had special advantages and could show metabolic differences and biochemical variation associated with the drug, although the single biochemical criterion could not. When the method was applied to the clinical pharmacology, we could see dose a was the suited dose and the drug had better effect on patients after 12 weeks than after 8 weeks. Thus, the GC-based <b>metabonomics</b> analysis has enabled the rapid identification of significant metabolic differences and provided information concerning evaluation of the curative effect of Losartan.

40|$|<b>Metabonomics,</b> {{the study}} of {{metabolites}} and their roles in various disease states, is a novel methodology arising from the post-genomics era. This methodology has been applied in many fields. Current <b>metabonomics</b> practice has relied on mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to analyze metabolites. In this study, a novel approach of using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in conjunction with developed software was employed. Using the principal components analysis method (PCA), all (113) peaks of urinary metabolites with a cis-diol structure from patients with hepatitis and hepatocirrhosis were compared to those from liver cancer patients.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{examine how}} {{biological}} data practices enable researchers {{to interact with}} and enact biological life in statistical ways, and how this poses challenges to the use and integration of biological knowledge with clinical practices. Instead of considering data as a pre-existing cognitive representation of the world, I combine scholarship on the anthropology of science with scholarship from science and technology studies to consider data {{as a form of}} material practice. I consider, in other words, how data is intertwined with technologies, people, and values, such that data is used to make normative and naturalized claims about biology and disease. To explore the generation, interpretation, and use of biological data, I focus on the field of “metabonomics”—the post-genomic study of metabolism—as it is carried out within the Biomolecular Medicine Laboratory (BMM) at Imperial College London. In doing so, I examine how <b>metabonomics</b> researchers use biochemical techniques and multivariate statistics to investigate metabolism and disease. After providing an overview of the literature, central questions, and methodology that frame this dissertation, I examine how multivariate statistical practices are central to the historical identity and epistemic culture of <b>metabonomics</b> research at the BMM. From there, I demonstrate how multivariate statistics require and enable <b>metabonomics</b> to enact metabolism as an inherently complex entity. Consequently, I examine how researchers struggle to assign the categories of “normal” and “abnormal” to dynamic notions of metabolism and health. I then explore how the translation of <b>metabonomics</b> knowledge into clinical practices places value on multivariate forms and large volumes of information, eclipsing the importance of human interpretation and judgment.

40|$|<b>Metabonomics</b> {{has been}} defined as “quantitative {{measurement}} of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification” and can provide information on disease processes, drug toxicity, and gene function. In this approach many samples of biological origin (biofluids such as urine or plasma) are analyzed using techniques that produce simultaneous detection. A variety of analytical metabolic profiling tools are used routinely, are also currently under development, and include proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry with a prior online separation step such as high-performance liquid chromatography, ultra-performance liquid chromatography, or gas chromatography. Data generated by these analytical techniques are often combined with multivariate data analysis, i. e., pattern recognition, for respectively generating and interpreting the metabolic profiles of the investigated samples. <b>Metabonomics</b> has gained great prominence in diabetes research within the last few years and has already been applied to understand the metabolism in a range of animal models and, more recently, attempts have been done to process complex metabolic data sets from clinical studies.
