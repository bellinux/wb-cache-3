5|$|Casting {{the role}} of Dimitri gave All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> difficulty. The series' casting director, Judy Blye Wilson, tested between fifteen and twenty actors, and {{could not find the}} right actor for the job. Wilson then learned that the former Dynasty star, Michael Nader was {{available}} and suggested the show offer him the part.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013, {{following}} a twelve-year absence from All <b>My</b> <b>Children,</b> Nader was announced to be reprising {{the role of}} Dimitri, scheduled to begin in June. Initially his first airdate was 3 June, however, due to Prospect Park's decision {{to reduce the amount}} of episodes made available each week, he did not air until 12 June.|$|E

5|$|After Nader got {{help for}} his drug {{addiction}} at Hazelton Clinic in Minnesota, All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> {{opted not to}} bring him back. Nader filed a $31.7 million lawsuit against ABC for breach of contract under the Americans with Disabilities Act. ABC's lawyers cited Nader's violation of the morals clause in his contract as justification for not rehiring him. The firing and lawsuit {{caught the attention of}} non-soap opera medias such as TV Guide, Inside Edition, People, Celebrity Justice, Extra, Entertainment Tonight, and Larry King Live. Manhattan Federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff threw out the suit in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, Nader {{was let go}} from All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> due to {{budgetary}} considerations, however, {{he later}} returned in May 2000. The following year, the actor's arrest brought him and the character {{to the center of}} a large fan campaign organized by a group called the Loyalists, as well as a highly publicized lawsuit catching the attention of People and Entertainment Tonight, among other media outlets. As a result, Nader was let go again by the soap opera, with an official statement saying they would be prepared to consider having him return once he had addressed the lawsuit issues. The role was temporarily recast with actor Anthony Addabbo, who was negatively received by viewers, and let go shortly after his debut. Nader later stated in an interview that ABC had informed him that they had no intention of ever bringing him or the character back {{due to a lack of}} storyline. In 2004, Nader's suit was subsequently thrown out. In May 2013, after a twelve-year absence from All <b>My</b> <b>Children,</b> Nader was announced to be reprising the role, with his return airing on June 12, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Chloe Mitchell is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera, The Young and the Restless. Introduced by former executive producer Edward J.

Originally portrayed by twins, Darla and Sandra Greer, until 1991, upon her brief return in 1994, child actress, Danielle Ryah, portrayed the role. On February 6, 2008, executive producer/head writer Josh Griffith introduced a new character, Chloe Mitchell, played by former All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> actress, Elizabeth Hendrickson. That August, a change in storyline revealed Chloe was Kate, having legally changed her name while offscreen, when the character was away in boarding school. Upgraded from recurring to contract status, Hendrickson became {{an integral part of the}} cast.|$|E

5|$|Lilly Wachowski, after {{completing}} her gender transition, {{decided to take}} some time off and did not return as writer or director for the second season, although she remained active as co-creator. Straczynski, who had a very active role during season 1 from pre-production to post-production in order to assist the Wachowskis with their first foray into TV, said his primary involvement in season 2 finished with the completion of the writing phase, as Lana felt this time she had the required experience to tackle the filmmaking aspect of the show on her own. He also said that the second season was designed to explore the mythology of sensates, introduce other clusters, and provide answers to many of the questions viewers had after the first season. Lana {{came up with the idea}} of making the first episode of the second season a two-hour Christmas special, because of her love for such programming in the television shows that she watched as a kid, such as Hill Street Blues, Mork & Mindy, and All <b>My</b> <b>Children.</b> Lana explained she enjoyed watching the lives of the characters in specials intersect with her own and considered birthdays, holidays and celebrations unique events for their ability to make one feel connected but also isolated and alone.|$|E
5|$|To {{further the}} mystery element and add an {{international}} {{twist to the}} story, Nixon scripted Dimitri as having close European roots, though he is an American. He {{is the son of}} Hungarian parents, Hugo and Anna. Originally, his wealth comes from all the land around Pine Valley and the One Life to Live city Llanview, which he inherits from his parents. That is also where his fictional estate, Wildwind, is located. Later, during Dimitri's 1992 story with Erica Kane, he is revealed to also be Hungarian nobility as Count Andrassy. He inherited his title and his Hungarian castle, Vadzel, from his father's side. Both of his parents were dead by the time Dimitri first appears on All <b>My</b> <b>Children.</b> He spends his childhood years growing up in Europe and on the Wildwind estate. He has a complicated relationship with Edmund Gresham, the son of two of his family's employees, unknown to Dimitri to be his half-brother. His childhood sweetheart was Angelique Voynitzeva, the daughter of his nanny, Helga. Helga later becomes his housekeeper. Fifteen years prior to Dimitri's appearance on-screen, he and Angelique married. Angelique becomes pregnant but suffers a miscarriage which devastates both of them. Angelique has a riding accident which leaves her in a coma. Dimitri tries to find a cure, but is unable to and sends her to a clinic in Austria. He becomes reclusive for the next decade because of the guilt he feels over her condition. Finding Natalie in 1991 brings him out into society again.|$|E

25|$|Prospect Park {{initially}} {{intended for}} All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> to begin its {{run on the}} internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited in was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of All <b>My</b> <b>Children.</b> On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> along with its sister soap One Life to Live would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated One Life to Live. Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park {{not being able to}} sign enough cast members from All <b>My</b> <b>Children.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of One Life to Live, a series Nixon created in 1968, ABC asked her to create another soap opera for them.

25|$|On April 14, 2011, it was {{announced}} that ABC canceled All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> after 41 years on the air due to low ratings. On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> to third-party production company Prospect Park with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of webisodes. The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011, with a cliffhanger. On September 26, 2011, the following Monday, ABC replaced All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> with a newly debuted talk show The Chew. Prospect Park had suspended its plan to revive the series on November 23, 2011, due to lack of funding and unsuccessful negotiation with the union organizations representing the actors and crews. On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park officially brought back its project to restore All <b>My</b> <b>Children</b> as a web series. The show taped its first scenes for Prospect Park TOLN on February 18, 2013, and its first episode on the network aired on April 29, 2013. However, the new series faced several behind-the-scene obstacles throughout its run.
