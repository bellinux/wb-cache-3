40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the calculation of the current value of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>provision</b> and moulds it in a deterministic and stochastic scenario, using a proper term structure of interest rates estimated by means of a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. It provides a complete and original year-by-year evaluation model for the business performance, and a closed solution for the current evaluation of the reserve, together with a comprehensive insight into the dynamics of the reserve connected to the selection of a defined term structure of interest rates. Moreover, the calculation of the VaR of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>provision</b> is prospected as risk measure useful to appreciate also the evaluation rate risk. Future research prospects concern the selection of the stochastic process used to describe the dynamics of the interest rates and the possible managerial and regulatory application of a VaR measure. The modelling has been applied, as an exemplification, to a life annuity portfolio but it can be easily replicated for any kind of policy and any kind of portfolios even non homogeneous. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the legislation that}} regulates the Romanian unit-linked life insurance market. The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no. 32 / 2000 on insurance undertakings and insurance supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and reinsurance undertakings, of mutual undertakings, {{as well as of}} insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance undertakings conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive, 2002 / 83 /EC, unit-linked life insurance products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the insurance undertaking, usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the insurance undertaking's entire business, of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical <b>provisions,</b> including <b>mathematical</b> <b>provisions,</b> and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the home Member State pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all life insurance products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked life insurance products and the one regarding traditional life insurance products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked insurance products are life insurance policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{in modern}} city are often built closely {{to each other}} due limited land available. These {{building}} in most cases, are separated without any structural connection. Hence earthquake resistant capacity of each building mainly depends on itself. To improve the earthquake resistance of these building, the concept of coupledbuilding control has been taken in to consideration.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{liability}} valuation of the insured loan in compliance of the fair value requirements for the financial assets and liabilities, as mapped out by the international boards engaged in this tool. Initially we propose a closed form for the fair valuation of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>provision</b> in a framework in which the randomness in the mortality is considered along with the financial risk component. Furthermore, {{the aim of the}} paper is to analyze the relevance of the risk arising from the demographic movements on the insured loan reserve. The approach we follow implies the <b>mathematical</b> <b>provision</b> calculated as current values, this meaning at current interest rates and at current mortality rates. In these two variables the basic risk drivers of a life insurance business dwell and the many-sided risk system consists, in its systematic aspects, in the choice of the adequate models for forecasting the future scenarios. The relevance {{of the impact of the}} risk connected to the choice of the mortality table (table risk) on the fair value of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>provision</b> is pointed out and quantified using a measurement tool obtained by conditional expectation calculus. The risk mapping is performed analyzing the accidental risk impact on the insured loan portfolio liabilities. In all likelihood, insured loan portfolios are not large enough to be considered well diversified to the aim of the pooling risk reduction; this consideration makes interesting the measuring of the liability variability caused by the random events connected to mortality (mortality risk). Practical implications of assuming different mortality scenarios on the reserve fair value are presented, a graphic description of the model risk deriving from the choice of the demographic model is provided and numerical evidences of the accidental mortality risk are show...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the calculation of}} the value at risk (VaR) of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>provision</b> applied in a fair valuation context. Following a balance-sheet approach, the classical definition of VaR needs some clarifications. For indentifying worst cases it is opportune to observe that {{an increase in the}} value of the liability corresponds to expenses or, better, additional costs, which may result in either a profit shrinkage or a proper loss. Therefore, the classical portfolio return distribution can be redesigned as a liability cost distribution, where critical values lie in the right-hand tail. In the case of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>provision,</b> the expected cost can be easily linked to the expected value of the reserve at the end of the risk horizon. After an overall view on the VaR problems from a managerial perspective, the paper presents, the choice of the VaR model and the number of risk factors to take into account, in addition to describing the calculation technique. The calculation, performed using a simulation approach, is developed as an application case of a life annuity portfolio and provides an estimate of the worst-case loss at a fixed confidence level after a fixed period of time...|$|E

In this environment, the complexity of a life insurance contract management practically involves the choice of the most suitable mortality table and discounting process; in the paper the tool is treated in a stochastic scenario for interest rates and in random hypotheses for the mortality rates. The amortization schedule used for the loan repayment is considered at variable interest rates, hooked at opportune rate indexes. A numerical application of the model is presented and a comparison between the behaviour of the fair values of the insured loan portfolio reserve in the two cases of an amortization schedule at fixed and at variable interest rates is reported. The fair reserve sensitivity to the changes of the amortization interest rate is studied and showed with illustrations...|$|E
