25|$|The {{process of}} {{matching}} hedge funds to investors {{has traditionally been}} fairly opaque, with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers. Many funds disclose their holdings, strategy, and historic performance relative to market indices, giving investors some idea of how their <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> allocated, although individual holdings are often not disclosed. Investors are often drawn to hedge funds {{by the possibility of}} realizing significant returns, or hedging against volatility in the market. The complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – Calpers, the largest pension fund in the US, announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in 2014. Some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors: HedgeZ is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds; iMatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investor's goals and behavioral profile, in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{criticism}} is that <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> spent on the rich {{at the expense of}} the poor. Critics contend that it does not serve any of the townships of Gauteng where the transport problem is severe and where the majority of the people live. However, supporters maintain that the train was never meant to be an alternative to mass public transport; instead, it was intended to reduce pressure on Johannesburg's overloaded highway system. Figures released by the Gauteng provincial government in 2003 indicated that the project would do little to relieve traffic on the over-used Ben Schoeman Highway (one of the major motivations for the project), as traffic volumes would be higher when the Gautrain was completed and operating at full capacity in 2010. Leftist political groupings like the SACP and labour movements like COSATU branded the Gautrain as a train for the rich and called on government not to proceed with the project. A national parliamentary oversight body, the Transport Portfolio Committee, held public hearings in November 2005 and subsequently advised Cabinet to scrap or postpone the project. However, National Cabinet decided on 7 December 2005 to financially support Gautrain.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fare collections, the MARTA budget {{is funded by}} a 1% sales tax in Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties along with limited federal money. In 2017, the City of Atlanta raised their sales tax for MARTA to 1.5% to improve and expand MARTA. For fiscal year 2007, MARTA had a farebox recovery ratio of 31.8%. By law, funds from the 1% sales tax must be split evenly between MARTA's operational and Capital expenditure budgets. This restriction {{does not apply to}} other sources of revenue, including passenger revenue. The split was written into MARTA legislation at MARTA's formation with the rationale that MARTA should continue expanding and investing in the system. However, MARTA has no active rail construction projects. Capital funds continue to decrease every year, creating a shortfall. The operations funds limit the amount of service MARTA provides. The sales tax law was amended by the state legislature in 2002 to allow a temporary three-year 45% capital/55% operations split. This additional 5% for operations expired in 2005. A 2005 bill to renew the split was tabled by the legislature's MARTA Oversight Committee, forcing MARTA to pass a new budget with cuts in service. The temporary 45%/55% capital/operations split was renewed again in the 2006 state legislative session. The capital funds surplus has resulted in projects, such as a new US$100million Breeze Card fare collection system and US$1.1million automatic toilets in the MARTA Five Points station, occurring {{at the same time that}} MARTA is struggling to pay for bus and rail operations. In 2015, the Georgia Assembly approved a new bill that no longer requires MARTA to split the 1% Sales Tax. Due to low Sales Tax Revenue and no source of funding from the State of Georgia, MARTA was forced to eliminate 43 bus routes, eliminate shuttles, (Excluding the Six Flags Over Georgia and Braves Shuttle) and reduce Rail Service frequencies and hours. MARTA also closed the majority of its station restrooms. There are 13 station restrooms open to the public, which most are located at the end of each line including College Park, Arts Center, Peachtree Center, West End, Avondale, Kensington and Lindbergh Center. There are two Ridestores available. The two Ridestores are located at the Airport and Five Points Rail Stations. Despite the massive cuts, MARTA predicted the system would still come up 69.34million dollars short for FY 2011; in which was pulled from their Reserved Account. A $9 million addition was posted for 2013. This <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> re-invested into the system by adding frequency to trains and bus routes.|$|E

Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper The National. Orr: [...] "Our <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> used to pay pensions for current players". The NHL's response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: [...] "It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment of one of our game's icons, Bobby Orr. And isn't it interesting that baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, {{as far as we can}} understand, have US$31.9 million." [...] The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case.|$|E
500|$|Record {{executives}} {{in the music industry}} believe that music charts will increasingly be filled with YouTube-driven globalised acts from foreign countries.

According to Adam Sherwin from The Independent, the global web demand for Gangnam Style had short-circuited the [...] "traditional reluctance" [...] of radio stations to play foreign-language songs. The song is also underlining a shift in how <b>money</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> made in the music business. Although Psy earned more than US$60,000 from music sales of [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in South Korea alone, he and his music label YG Entertainment have raked in almost US$1 million from advertisements which appear on YouTube videos identified for using [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] in its content. The Harvard Business Review published an article written by Kevin Evers, who explained how [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] had changed Billboard's ranking methodology of its music charts. Instead of relying solely on radio plays and paid purchases, Billboard started to place a heavier emphasis on digital sales and YouTube views. As a result of the change, Gangnam Style moved up to the top position of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs music chart. According to the British Phonographic Industry's report based on Official Charts Company sales data, thanks to Psy's song and Carly Rae Jepsen's [...] "Call Me Maybe", pop became the UK's favourite musical genre of the year, taking the lion's share of the singles market (38.5%) in 2012.|$|E
