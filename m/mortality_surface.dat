30|$|The fourth model obtains {{regional}} {{death rates}} from a <b>Mortality</b> <b>Surface</b> 2 created {{from a range}} of historical and forecast national life tables (Wilson 2015). The surface consists of life table nLx values by sex and age over time, with the temporal range extending far enough so that it covers all possible future mortality levels for all subnational regions. In practice, it uses national life tables from several decades into the past to those for well over a century into the future. The <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> effectively acts as a series of model life tables (Moultrie and Timaeus 2013) for the subnational regions. It assumes that all regions follow a mortality trajectory described by the national <b>mortality</b> <b>surface,</b> but from different starting points and at their own pace.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a new simple but {{powerful}} tool, namely the surface by age and time of leading causes of death, which may prove useful in the descriptive analysis of trends and profile changes in cause-specific mortality. First, considering the Italian mortality data by age and sex for large groups of causes of death, we review the epidemiological transition in Italy through the <b>mortality</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the first leading cause of death from 1895 to 1994. Second, focusing on recent years (1969 - 2001), we analyse the new mortality profiles through the surfaces of the first leading cause of death within the two groups of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. The approach followed in this study seems very promising. The resulting detailed picture of mortality dynamics can help to direct the public policy towards more suitable and prompt interventions, and can prove useful for teaching purposes...|$|R
30|$|The <b>Mortality</b> <b>Surface</b> {{approach}} is relatively complex and involves {{a number of}} steps. In this study, it was implemented with a VBA subroutine, though {{it is possible to}} set out the calculations in a spreadsheet in a number of steps without any code. First, the national <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> was created using past and projected life table nLx values. Then, base period scaling factors of regional to national life expectancy at birth values by sex were calculated. Regional life expectancy forecasts were created by multiplying national life expectancy forecasts by the scaling factors. Appropriate nLx values were then picked out of the <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> corresponding to each projected life expectancy at birth value. This is the most complex part because Excel formulas must be created to select nLx values which correspond with each projected life expectancy at birth assumption. Period-cohort death rates can then be obtained from the interpolated nLx values.|$|E
30|$|In the <b>Mortality</b> <b>Surface</b> approach, most of {{the input}} data and data {{preparation}} occurs at the national scale in creating the national <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> itself. Relatively little regional input data is required. Just base period regional life expectancy at birth by sex is needed (2 r data cells), though if regional life expectancies are unavailable {{they will have to}} be calculated from age-sex-specific death rates and the input data requirements will be higher. Regional life expectancy forecasts are calculated by multiplying base period life expectancy regional/national scaling factors by independent national life expectancy forecasts.|$|E
40|$|A <b>{{mortality}}</b> <b>surface</b> is {{a measure}} of mortality indexed by year and age. A central limit theorem for aggregate data is established for the <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> defined by the logistic transform of the year and age-specific probability of death and this is used to postulate and estimate a regression model. Extra variance {{may be the result of}} heterogeneity within cohorts, and it is shown how the model based on aggregate data could be decomposed to accommodate sub-cohorts by using proportional odds. In the absence of disaggregated data, excess variance is modelled as a function of age and year and estimation is done by maximum likelihood. The parametric surface so estimated is used to examine deceleration of mortality at old ages and trends in deceleration are discussed with reference to selection and heterogeneity. The results are applied to mortality data from the Netherlands for 1890 - 1991, ages 50 - 90. aging, deceleration, heterogeneity, mortality, <b>mortality</b> <b>surface,</b> regression,...|$|E
40|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20 th century, {{mortality}} patterns in industrialized countries showed a continuous tendency of reduction at all ages, even at the oldest ones. However, the pace of mortality decline considerably varies depending on the country. Furthermore, in a few cases, stagnation and even an unexpected reversed pattern have been observed in more recent years. In this paper a comparative analysis of mortality trends in several developed countries is performed. The aim of the paper is to locate deviations from expected mortality patterns, and to understand the reasons for these deviations. As a first step of the analysis, a new two-dimensional relational model is applied to <b>mortality</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the selected developed countries, between 1960 and 1999, for the age range 50 - 99.

40|$|Comparisons of {{differential}} survival by country {{are useful in}} many domains. In the area of public policy, they help policymakers and analysts assess how much various groups benefit from public programs, such as social security and health care. In financial markets and especially for actuaries, they are important for designing annuities and life insurance products. This paper presents a method for clustering information about differential mortality by country. The approach is then used to group <b>mortality</b> <b>surfaces</b> for European Union (EU) countries. The aim {{of this paper is}} to measure between-group inequality in mortality experience in EU countries through a range of mortality indicators. Additionally, the indicators permit the characterization of each group. It is important to take into account characteristics such as sex; therefore, this study differentiates between males and females in order to detect whether their patterns and characterizations are different. It is concluded that there are clear differences in mortality between the east and west of the EU that are more important than the traditional south-north division, with a significant disadvantage for Eastern Europe, and especially for males in Baltic countries. We find that the mortality indicators have evolved in all countries in such a way that the gap between groups has been maintained, both in terms of the differences in mortality levels and variability...|$|R
30|$|The National Death Rates approach, {{where all}} {{projected}} regional death rates are set equal to national death rates, {{is a very}} safe option in that all regional death rates will be plausible (so long as the national mortality forecast is competent).

40|$|Abstract. Landscape-level {{bark beetle}} (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) {{outbreaks}} occurred in Arizona ponder- osa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Law.) forests from 2001 to 2003 {{in response to}} severe drought and suitable forest conditions. We quantified surface fuel loadings and depths, and calculated canopy fuels based on forest structure attributes in 60 plots established 5 years previously on five national forests. Half of the plots we sampled in 2007 had bark beetle- caused pine mortality and half did not have mortality. Adjusting for differences in pre-outbreak stand density, plots with <b>mortality</b> had higher <b>surface</b> fuel and lower canopy fuel loadings 5 years after the outbreak compared with plots without <b>mortality.</b> Total <b>surface</b> fuels averaged 2. 5 times higher and calculated canopy fuels 2 times lower in plots with mortality. Nearly half of the trees killed in the bark beetle outbreak had fallen within 5 years, resulting in loadings of 1000 -h woody fuels above recommended ranges for dry coniferous forests in 20 % of the mortality plots. We expect 1000 -h fuel loadings in other mortality plots to exceed recommended ranges as remaining snags fall to the ground.

30|$|The low {{torching}} {{potential is}} contradictory to {{local and regional}} experience on recent wildfires, where torching potential appears to be substantial (Williamson 1999, R. Harrod and K. Satterfield, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests, personal communication). Resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the scale at which the data are presented. Unit averages were comprised of about 30 plot measurements each, and across all units, 17 % of these plots had sufficiently high surface fireline intensity and sufficiently low canopy base height values such that torching would be enabled with 97 percentile weather. As not only the torched plot but surrounding trees would also be killed from the heat generated by the torched group, perhaps {{a third of the}} stand would be killed simply from the torching, above any <b>mortality</b> from <b>surface</b> fire activity alone. This is likely the scale at which the forest would actually experience the fire, and it is consistent with local wildfire experience. However, the experimental design, if analyzed at the plot scale, would have been pseudoreplicated (Hurlbert 1984), so that statistical analysis at the plot scale is not possible.|$|R
30|$|Amongst the {{remaining}} methods, none was clearly superior {{to any of}} the others. For overall mortality the best method, by a small margin, was Broad Age SMR Scaling, followed closely by several other methods.

30|$|Slightly {{more complex}} {{relational}} models include the Brass relational model (Brass, 1971) and its extensions (e.g. Ewbank et al. 1983 and Murray et al. 2003). The Brass model relates life table lx values {{from a national}} (or model) population to those for regions (or other subpopulations). Two parameters describe the relationship of regional mortality to national mortality, and {{they are used to}} forecast regional mortality assuming the relationship remains constant. An alternative method is to obtain region-specific mortality rates from a national <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> consisting of past and projected life tables which span a wide range of mortality conditions. Effectively, it acts as a set of model life tables. Regional mortality is projected in terms of life expectancy at birth, and then death rates which correspond to the assumed life expectancy are selected from the <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> (Wilson 2014, 2015). This type of method is useful when forecasters wish to formulate regional mortality assumptions in terms of the ‘headline’ indicator of life expectancy at birth.|$|E
30|$|The four methods National Death Rates, SMR Scaling, <b>Mortality</b> <b>Surface,</b> and Brass Relational {{will always}} produce {{relatively}} smooth mortality age profiles {{because they are}} very closely or directly based on national mortality age profiles.

In the first experiment, grub mortality was observed with all equipment types (hollow-tine, solid, vibratory-tine, air and solid injection equipment). However, given the low densities (~ 5 larvae per ft. 2) and patchiness of the natural grub populations, only single- and double-passes of hollow-tine equipment were able to reduce populations when compared to untreated controls. In the second study, hollow- and solid, vibratory-tine treatments were capable of reducing grub populations below commonly accepted damage thresholds (< 10 larvae per sq. ft.), though hollow-tine treatments provided the only statistically significant reductions. In both study locations, traditional hollow-tine cultivation provided superior control to solid, vibratory-tine cultivation in both grub <b>mortality</b> and <b>surface</b> disruption. These studies indicate that performing routine cultivation can provide secondary benefits in reducing grub populations, and when performed intensively, {{may serve as a}} stand-alone pest management tactic for turfgrass systems where chemical insecticides are not an option...|$|R

40|$|Background: Renal {{impairment}} is a {{major risk}} factor for mortality in various populations.

40|$|Abstract: We {{suppose that}} we have {{mortality}} data arranged in two tables: one of deaths and the other of exposures {{to the risk of}} death, each classified by age at death and year of death. It is natural to suppose that there is a smooth underlying force of mortality, the <b>mortality</b> <b>surface,</b> that varies with age and year (or period). However, observed mortality is subject to more than stochastic deviation from this smooth surface. For example, flu epidemics, hot summers or cold winters can disproportionately affect the mortality of certain age groups in particular years. We call such an effect a period shock. We describe the <b>mortality</b> <b>surface</b> with an additive model with two components: the underlying smooth surface is modelled with two-dimensional P-splines and the period shocks are modelled with one-dimensional P-splines in the age direction, one P-spline for each year. This large regression model is written as an additive generalized linear array model and this enables the computations to be performed efficiently. We illustrate our methods with Swedish mortality data taken from the Human Mortality Database. Key words: generalized linear array model; mortality; period shock; P-splines; smoothin...|$|E

Although various remote sensing approaches have been developed to monitor insect impacts, most studies have focused on single insect agents or single locations and have not related observed changes to ground-based measurements. This study presents a remote sensing framework to (1) characterize spectral trajectories associated with insect activity of varying duration and severity and (2) relate those trajectories to ground-based measurements of tree <b>mortality</b> and <b>surface</b> fuels in the Cascade Range, Oregon, USA. We leverage a Landsat time series change detection algorithm (LandTrendr), annual forest health aerial detection surveys (ADS), and field measurements to investigate two study landscapes broadly applicable to conifer forests and dominant insect agents of western North America. We distributed 38 plots across multiple forest types (ranging from mesic mixed-conifer to xeric lodgepole pine) and insect agents (defoliator [western spruce budworm] and bark beetle [mountain pine beetle]). Insect effects were evident in the Landsat time series as combinations of both short- and long-duration changes in the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. Western spruce budworm trajectories appeared to show a consistent temporal evolution of long-duration spectral decline (loss of vegetation) followed by recovery, whereas mountain pine beetle plots exhibited both short- and long-duration spectral declines and variable recovery rates. Although temporally variable, insect-affected stands generally conformed to four spectral trajectories: short-duration decline then recovery, short- then long-duration decline, long-duration decline, long-duration decline then recovery. When comparing remote sensing data with field measurements of insect impacts, we found that spectral changes were related to cover-based estimates (tree basal area mortality R(adj) (2);= 0. 40, F(1. 34) = 24. 76, P< 0. 0001] and down coarse woody detritus [R(adj) (2) = 0. 29, F(1. 32) = 14. 72. P = 0. 0006]). In contrast, ADS changes were related to count-based estimates (e. g., ADS mortality from mountain pine beetle positively correlated with ground-based counts [R(adj) (2) = 037, F(1. 22) = 14. 71, P= 0. 0009]). Fine woody detritus and forest floor depth were not well correlated with Landsat- or aerial survey-based change metrics. By characterizing several distinct temporal manifestations of insect activity in conifer forests, this study demonstrates the utility of insect mapping methods that capture a wide range of spectral trajectories. This study also confirms the key role that satellite imagery can play in understanding the interactions among insects, fuels, and wildfire. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|Although MPB-caused tree <b>mortality</b> {{inflated}} <b>surface</b> fuel {{differences between}} thinned and control units, {{our analysis of}} fire potential indicated MPB only inflated differences in PT between those treatments. Studies have shown that an MPB outbreak can exacerbate fire behavior, depending on time since disturbance and metrics analyzed (synthesized in Jenkins et al. 2014, but see Harvey et al. 2013). But beyond beetle-caused inputs to surface fuels, beetles actually thin out forest canopies and eventually moderate potential crown fire spread, akin to the silviculturist’s fuel treatments. Our analysis shows that MPB-caused tree mortality—which was greater in unthinned units—offsets the initial positive effect of thinning on canopy fuel (CBD) and therefore crown fire potential (CI). However, since this offset effect is minor (indirect effect magnitude was smaller than direct effect magnitude), it demonstrates that “natural thinning” by MPB neither reduces crown fire potential as well as active management nor hinders the effective longevity of silvicultural thinning. PT, on the other hand, incorporates potential surface fire behavior where the canopy-based metrics do not. Silviculture and MPB effects had consistent influence on the thinning versus control contrast for this metric because silvicultural thinning reduces PT but MPB-caused tree mortality increases it by compounding ladder fuels with heavy surface loading, inflating the difference (in fuel loading and longevity) between thinned and unthinned units.|$|R
