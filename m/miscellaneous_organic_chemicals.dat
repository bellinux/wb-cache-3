40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{strategy}} is proposed to predict physical properties, partitioning, bioconcentration and degradability of nonionized, nonpolymeric <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The strategy uses structural features of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> structure activity relationships, sequenced estimation techniques (including recently developed computerized methods), and laboratory screening tests. The cost {{to use this}} {{strategy is}} compared {{with the cost of}} conducting a standard menu of tests to measure physical properties, partitioning, bioconcentration and degradability. This chapter proposes a strategy for using structural features of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals,</b> structure activity relationships, sequenced estimation techniques (including some recently developed computerized methods) and laboratory screening tests to predict the chemical fate of nonionized, nonpolymeric <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> (figure 13 - 1). It emphasizes the need to consider computerized methods to make these predictions, especially as these methods relate to the “cost and time considerations” emphasized by the April 24 - 25, 1995...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} current state of {{knowledge}} on the rejection of emerging trace <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> by forward osmosis (FO) processes, beginning with a brief introduction to the occurrence of emerging trace <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in municipal wastewater effluent. Due to the frequent detection of emerging <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> in secondary treated effluent, a multibarrier concept is widely utilized in the design of wastewater reclamation processes to ensure the quality of product water. The chapter outlines three major aspects to delineate how they affect rejection of trace organic chemicals; process parameters include properties of membrane and draw solution and operating conditions, membrane fouling, and FO-based hybrid processes. Potential benefits of the FO-based hybrid systems extend beyond better product water quality and energy and cost savings. The chapter ends with several concluding remarks that strengthen the potential of FO in effectively dealing with emerging trace <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Porous resins {{have been}} used to sorb organic {{residues}} in industrial wastewaters for over four decades. A survey of literature revealed that these resins have surface areas up to 1500 m 2 /g, and may be tailor made to selectively sorb certain groups of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Resins may be regenerated, upon saturation, on site at ambient temperature by solvent elution, or by other means such as pH adjustment, microwave, or steam. The <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> are desorbed from the resin, during regeneration, and may be recovered for reuse. This paper reviews literature related to the applications of these porous resin sorbents for the removal and recovery of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> from wastewater, their syntheses and physicochemical properties, as well as their sorption characteristics and mechanisms. Sorption data scattered in literature are compiled, methods of resin regeneration and recovery of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> for reuse are discussed, and case studies of full-scale industrial applications in both the United States and China are presented. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{protocol}} {{to validate the}} rejection of <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> of potential health risk by low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO) membranes was developed for decision making support regarding the monitoring level required for potable water reuse. Ten <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals</b> were selected for evaluation, based on their recorded usage, the scarcity of rejection data, and difficulty in analytical determination at concentrations relevant to their potential impact on human-health. An analytical method was developed for these <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The target rejections of 90 and 99 % for neutral and charged chemicals respectively were successfully achieved under the standard operating condition with only two exceptions (i. e. bisoprolol and carazolol rejections by the TFC-HR membrane). These lower rejections by the TFC-HR {{can be attributed to}} its highestwater permeability amongst the three membranes while both bisoprolol and carazolol are positively charged. Changes in operating conditions including permeate flux, feed temperature and chemical cleaning can exert a considerable impact on conductivity rejection by the three LPRO membranes investigated here. Feed temperature showed an apparent impact on the rejection of the selected <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals.</b> However, their rejections were still higher than the target validation values. The protocol developed here can be expanded for the validation of other <b>organic</b> <b>chemicals...</b>|$|R
