25|$|Most analog {{multimeters}} of the moving-pointer type are unbuffered, {{and draw}} current from the circuit under test to deflect the <b>meter</b> <b>pointer.</b> The impedance of the meter {{varies depending on}} the basic sensitivity of the meter movement and the range which is selected. For example, a meter with a typical 20,000ohms/volt sensitivity will have an input resistance of two million ohms on the 100-volt range (100 V * 20,000 ohms/volt = 2,000,000 ohms). On every range, at full scale voltage of the range, the full current required to deflect the meter movement is taken from the circuit under test. Lower sensitivity meter movements are acceptable for testing in circuits where source impedances are low compared to the meter impedance, for example, power circuits; these meters are more rugged mechanically. Some measurements in signal circuits require higher sensitivity movements {{so as not to}} load the circuit under test with the meter impedance.|$|E
50|$|The {{sensitivity}} and input resistance of a voltmeter {{can be increased}} if the current required to deflect the <b>meter</b> <b>pointer</b> is supplied by an amplifier and power supply instead of by the circuit under test. The electronic amplifier between input and meter gives two benefits; a rugged moving coil instrument can be used, since its sensitivity need not be high, and the input resistance can be made high, reducing the current drawn from the circuit under test. Amplified voltmeters often have an input resistance of 1, 10, or 20 megohms which is independent of the range selected. A once-popular form of this instrument used a vacuum tube in the amplifier circuit and so was called the vacuum tube voltmeter, or VTVM. These were almost always powered by the local AC line current and so were not particularly portable. Today these circuits use a solid-state amplifier using field-effect transistors, hence FET-VM, and appear in handheld digital multimeters {{as well as in}} bench and laboratory instruments. These are now so ubiquitous that they have largely replaced non-amplified multimeters except in the least expensive price ranges.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWith {{the rapid}} {{development}} of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition, {{digital image processing}} and recognition technologies become a popular research direction, especially, the using of it is quite extensive in power industry. Among various using, dashboard automatic reading {{is an important part}} of routing inspection of substation system by using robot. Automatic reading of SF 6 pressure gauge pointer is based on image processing and automatic reading techniques, avoiding the influence of subjective factors of naked eye judgment. Designing and analyzing of identification algorithm ofSF 6 <b>meter</b> <b>pointer</b> are shown in this paper. First, pre-processing operations were operated on the instrument image by using gray level transformation equalization and binarization to improve image quality, by using Hough line detection to realize pointer line extraction; determining the number by using the straight-line in mathematics. This traditional method of using morphological and Hough line detection method to determine reading have certain bias, so the using of Hough circle detection methods and centroid detection methods were proposed. The results showed that the improved method has greatly improved the accuracy of the readings, the method has better accuracy than traditional standard line Hough detection method...|$|E
50|$|Once digital {{computers}} {{of adequate}} performance became available, the solution methods developed on analog network analyzers were {{migrated to the}} digital realm, where plugboards, switches and <b>meter</b> <b>pointers</b> were replaced with punch cards and printouts. The same general-purpose digital computer hardware that ran network studies could easily be dual-tasked with business functions such as payroll. Analog network analyzers faded from general use for load-flow and fault studies, although some persisted in transient studies for a while longer. Analog analyzers were dismantled and either sold off to other utilities, donated to engineering schools, or scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Airspeed {{indication}} {{is provided}} by a single pointer, dual scale airspeed/ mach <b>meter.</b> The <b>pointer</b> responds to the dynamic pressure from the pitot heads on the nose compartment. The conventional airspeed scale is calibrated in knots and the Mach scale is calibrated in percentage of Mach and connected to an aneroid that moves the scale to compensate for changes in pressure altitude.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 40) An {{experimental study}} was conducted to determine the effectiveness of discrete auditory localization cues in directing visual attention in an instrument monitoring task. Eighteen subjects were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: two groups, each differing in the number of sound localization cues employed, and the third (the control group), which used no localization cues. Subjects were required to locate a "deviant. " <b>meter</b> (one whose <b>pointer</b> was deflected to a non-zero position) on a 32 meter instrument panel. The dependent variable, ???response time", was the time required by subjects to locate a deviant meter, and activate a switch corresponding to the proper meter. The effectiveness of sound localization cues was evaluated in terms of group differences in response times, using two different panel configurations. The following conclusions were made: (a) Sound localization cues served to reduce the search time required in the search task (The reductions were found to have practical, as well as statistical significance.), (b) Sound localization cues which provided differential lateral and vertical cueing information, produced shorter response times than cues providing only lateral information, (c) Sound localization cues reduced the response time variability of various locations of visual elements, (d) Where response time is critical, sound localization cues may increase the operator???s probability of detecting a ???signal", (e) Sound localization cues were equally effective in straight and wrap around panel configurations...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{continuous}} (in time) position measurements on a quantum system using a single pseudoclassical meter. The nonselective evolution {{of the system is}} described by a master equation which is identical to that obtained from previous models. The selective evolution is described by a stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The significance of this equation is that the stochastic term has a physical interpretaion. By carefully choosing the parameters which define the meter and the system-meter coupling, we obtain a <b>meter</b> <b>pointer</b> with well-defined position which undergoes fluctuations. This ‘‘jitter’’ in the pointer position gives rise to the stochastic dynamical collapse of the system wave function. By the inclusion of feedback on the meter, the pointer is made to relax towards an appropriate readout. We apply this model to the selective measurement of the position of a particle in a double-well potential. In contrast to a recent claim [H. Fearn and W. E. Lamb, Jr., Phys. Rev. A 46, 1199 (1992) ] we show that truly continuous position measurements lead to a quantum Zeno effect in certain parameter regimes. This is manifest by the changing of the particle dynamics from coherent tunneling between the well minima to incoherent flipping, as in a random telegraph. As the measurement strength increases, the average length of time the particle remains stuck in one well increases proportionally...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{starts with}} {{a brief review of}} the topic of strong and weak pre- and post-selected (PPS) quantum measurements, as well as weak values, and {{afterwards}} presents original work. In particular, we develop a nonperturbative theory of weak PPS measurements of an arbitrary system with an arbitrary meter, for arbitrary initial states. New and simple analytical formulas are obtained for the average and the distribution of the <b>meter</b> <b>pointer</b> variable, which hold to all orders in the weak value. In the case of a mixed preselected state, in addition to the standard weak value, an associated weak value is required to describe weak PPS measurements. In the linear regime, the theory provides the generalized Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman formula. Moreover, we reveal two new regimes of weak PPS measurements: the strongly-nonlinear regime and the inverted region, where the system-dependent contribution to the pointer deflection decreases with increasing the measurement strength. The optimal conditions for weak PPS measurements are achieved in the strongly-nonlinear regime, where the magnitude of the average pointer deflection is equal or close to the maximum. This maximum is independent of the measurement strength, being typically of the order of the pointer uncertainty. We show that the amplification in the weak PPS measurements is a product of two qualitatively different quantities: proper amplification and enhancement. The effects of the free system and meter Hamiltonians are discussed. We also identify optimal meters for weak measurements. Exact solutions are obtained for a certain class of the measured observables. These solutions are used for numerical calculations, the results of which agree with the theory. Moreover, the theory is extended to allow for a completely general post-selection measurement. We also discuss time-symmetry properties of PPS measurements of any strength.
