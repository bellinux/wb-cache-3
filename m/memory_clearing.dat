40|$|This article offers new {{insights}} on the learning control approach developed by [Hu et al. IEEE/ASME Trans. Mechatronics, 19 (1) : 191 - 200, 2014]. Theoretical insights are further proposed to unveil why the contraction-type iterative learning control (ILC) schemes are suitable and effective in compensating for hysteresis, widely existing in biorobotic locomotion. Under such circumstances, iteration- based second-order dynamics is adopted {{to describe the}} biorobotic systems acted upon by one unknown Preisach hysteresis term. The <b>memory</b> <b>clearing</b> operator is mathematically proven to enable feasibility of contraction-type ILC methods, {{regardless of whether the}} initial state is accurately set or not. The simulation examples confirm that the developed iteration-based controller combined with a preceded operator effectively reduce tracking errors caused by the hysteresis nonlinearity. Furthermore, the {{new insights}} on theoretical feasibility are definitively corroborated in accordance with the previously published experimental results...|$|E

He is to understand that the grand tug of War, this Year, gradually turns out not to be hereabouts, nor with Daun and his adjacencies at all, but with the Russians, who arrive from the opposite Northern quarter; and that all else will prove to be merely prefatory and nugatory in comparison.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new pathfinding algorithm called the boundary iterative-deepening depth-first search (BIDDFS) algorithm. The BIDDFS compromises the increasing memory {{usage of the}} Dijkstra 2 ̆ 7 s algorithm, where the <b>memory</b> <b>clears</b> enables the BIDDFS to consume less memory than the Dijkstra 2 ̆ 7 s algorithm. The expansion redundancy of the iterative-deepening depth-first search (IDDFS) is also compensated; it is faster than the IDDFS {{in all of the}} testing instances conducted. The BIDDFS is further enhanced for bidirectional searching to allow expanding to fewer nodes and reducing pathfinding time. The bidirectional BIDDFS and the parallel bidirectional BIDDFS are also proposed. The proposed BIDDFS is further extended to the multi-goal BIDDFS, which is able to search for multiple goals present on the map in a single search. Simulation examples and comparisons have revealed the good performance of the proposed algorithms...|$|R

5000|$|Dennis Mair {{notes in}} a Mail & Guardian review of Drive By/Ice (an {{exhibition}} {{of work by}} Tom Cullberg and Mandy Jandrell) that [...] "Together the works contained in the art space resonate sweet visual melodies uncharacteristic of contemporary rebels. The uncomplicated aesthetic of the work {{as a whole is}} refreshing and correlates harmoniously in this hidden creative outpost, shining light in a previously darkened space". Referring specifically to Cullberg's work, Mair further observed that [...] "Multiple images caress one’s view in his work about quiet <b>memories,</b> <b>clear</b> feelings and simple senses that move beyond the medium of each lithograph". In a review for Artthrob, Natasha Norman suggests that [...] "Cullberg’s Periphery works seem to visualise the very binary of figuration and abstraction itself. The works reveal a move towards that invisible border as a painted space unto itself". Cullberg's work has been described as being highly intellectual but lovely, [...] "incorporating both experience and intellect". His abstract works have also been described as having [...] "perfectly placed lines amongst the chaos of the darker splashes of colour".|$|R

We had a little slave boy whom we had hired from some one, there in Hannibal. He was from the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and had been brought away from his family and his friends, half-way across the American continent, and sold. He was a cheery spirit, innocent and gentle, and the noisiest creature that ever was, perhaps. All day long he was singing, whistling, yelling, whooping, laughing--it was maddening, devastating, unendurable. At last, one day, I lost all my temper, and went raging to my mother, and said Sandy had been singing for an hour without a single break, and I couldn't stand it, and wouldn't she please shut him up. The tears came into her eyes, and her lip trembled, and she said something like this-- ...|$|R

The thought brought him to his feet, though he had to throw his arm round the stem of the palm tree to steady his swimming head. There was a big black man lying where he had fallen, his huge chest pocked with bullet-marks, every wound rosetted with its circle of flies. The Arab was stretched out within a few yards of him, with two hands clasped over the dreadful thing which had been his head. Across him was lying Anerley's fowling-piece, one barrel discharged, the other at half cock.|$|R
