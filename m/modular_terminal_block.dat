50|$|One type of <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> accepts {{wires that}} are {{prepared}} only by removing (stripping) a short length of insulation from the end. Another type accepts wires that have ring or spade terminal lugs crimped onto the wires. Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> allow individual wires {{to be connected}} to the circuit board. PCB mounted <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are soldered to the board, but they are available in a pull-apart version that allows the wire-connecting half of the block to be unplugged from the part that is soldered to the PCB.|$|R

50|$|<b>Terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> (also called <b>terminal</b> boards or strips) {{provide a}} {{convenient}} means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to connect wiring among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R
50|$|New Islamabad International Airport {{will have}} an 180,000m² <b>modular</b> <b>terminal</b> {{building}} which will initially {{be able to handle}} 9 million passengers and 80,000 metric tons cargo per annum. The numbers are expected to reach 25 million passengers by 2024. Being a new airport, {{a significant portion of the}} land has been earmarked for commercial purposes such as duty-free shops, hotel and convention center, air malls, business centre, food courts, leisure and recreational facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{control units}} are {{typically}} wall-mounted control panels {{and can be}} mounted in a NEMA enclosure. Control units vary by technology by using line and load <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> relays, activation <b>terminals,</b> transformers, as well as monitoring electronics.|$|R
50|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} components and devices sometimes have {{plug and socket}} connectors or <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> but individual screw terminals and fast-on or quick-disconnect terminals are more common. Small components have bare lead wires for soldering. They are manufactured using casting.|$|R
50|$|This town {{is close}} to Fera, about 15 minutes boat ride. The {{airfield}} is on Fera Island. It is a grass field and only 10 to 15 passenger planes land here. A new <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> was completed in April 2012.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{terminals}} {{can also}} be arranged as a terminal strip or <b>terminal</b> <b>block,</b> with several screws along (typically) two long strips. This creates a bus bar for power distribution, and so may also include a master input connector, usually binding posts or banana connectors.|$|R
50|$|The ICL 7500 series (7501, 7502, 7503, 7561, etc.) was a {{range of}} {{terminals}} and workstations, that were developed by ICL during the 1970s for their new range ICL 2900 Series mainframe computers. The colour scheme was compatible with the 2900. The term 7561 is a commonly used though loose term for the interactive video aspects of the 7502 series. The 7501 and 7502 systems were known as <b>Modular</b> <b>Terminal</b> Processors in marketing publications. 7501 and 7502 systems were built at Blackhorse Road, Letchworth (1/3 factory).|$|R

50|$|Twist-on wire {{connectors}} are commonly color-coded {{to indicate the}} connector size and, hence, their capacity. They are commonly used {{as an alternative to}} <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> or the soldering of conductors together, since they are quicker to install and, unlike soldered connections, allow easy subsequent removal for future modifications.|$|R
50|$|In the {{automation}} industry, {{a terminal}} adapter is a passive device that converts a connector like the 8P8C (RJ-45) modular connector or 9 pin D-Sub into a <b>terminal</b> <b>block</b> to facilitate wiring.

40|$|Platinum and platinum-rhodium strip heaters PLATINUM and platinum-rhodium strip heaters {{have been}} {{described}} by Roberts and Morey, 1930, Cech, 1950, and Keith and Roy, 1954. In all the previous cases a single strip of platinum or platinum-rhodium alloy has been mounted between <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> usually water-cooled, to which a high-amperage, low-potential current has been applied, of a magnitude determined by {{the dimensions of the}} strip. The maximum temperatures in such uniform strips have been obtained {{in the middle of the}} strip and have shown a gradual decrease towards the <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks.</b> Various methods for obtaining a better heat distribution {{have been described}}, most of which have involved a bending of the strip into a U shape. Higher temperatures have been obtained using molybdenum and tungsten strips but as these are easily oxidized they must be used in vacuo or an inert atmosphere.

40|$|Thermoplastic poly(ester–siloxane) s (TPES) and poly(ester–ether–siloxane) s, (TPEES), {{based on}} poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) as the hard segment and {{different}} siloxane-prepolymers as the soft segments, were prepared. The TPES and TPEES were synthesized by catalyzed two-step transesterification from dimethyl terephthalate, (DMT), 1, 4 -butanediol, (BD) and a siloxane-prepolymer. Incorporation of dicarboxypropyl- or disilanol-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) s (PDMS) into the polar poly(butylene terephthalate) chains resulted in rather inhomogeneous TPES copolymers, {{which was a}} consequence of a prononuced phase separation of the polar and non-polar reactants during synthesis. Two concepts were employed to avoid or reduce phase separation: 1) the use of siloxane-containing triblock prepolymers with hydrophilic <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks,</b> such as ethylene oxide (EO), poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) or poly(caprolactone) (PLC) when the <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> serve as a compatibilizer between the extremely non-polar PDMS and the polar DMT and BD, and 2) {{the use of a}} high-boiling solvent (1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene) during {{the first phase of the}} reaction. Homogeneity was significantly improved in the case of copolymers based on PCL–PDMS–PCL...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{behavior}} of the pH- and thermoresponsive amphiphilic ABCBA pentablock copolymer has been studied {{with respect to the}} environmental conditions. We demonstrate that the pentablock copolymer poly((diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) -b-(ethylene oxide) -b-(propylene oxide) -b-(ethylene oxide) -b-(diethylaminoethyl methacrylate)) possesses reversible temperature changes at the air-water interface in a narrow pH range of the water subphase. Significant diversity in the surface morphology of pentablock copolymer monolayers at different pH and temperatures observed were related to the corresponding reorganization of central and <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks.</b> Remarkable reversible variations of the surface pressure observed for the Langmuir monolayers at pH 7. 4 in the course of heating and cooling between 27 and 50 Â°C is associated with conformational transformations of <b>terminal</b> <b>blocks</b> crossing the phase line {{in the vicinity of the}} lower critical solution temperature point. The observed thermoresponsive surface behavior can be exploited for modeling of the corresponding {{behavior of}} pentablock copolymers adsorbed onto various biointerfaces for intracellular delivery for deeper understanding of stimuli-responsive transformations relevant to controlled drug and biomolecules release and retention...|$|R

40|$|A {{design for}} a transoceanic, dry cargo-carrying {{freighter}} is suggested; its use and operation in port are discussed. With a gross weight of 4500 metric tons (5000 tons), more than 50 percent of which is cargo, it will cruise at 50 meters per second (100 knots) in waves 2. 4 meters (8 ft) high. Its peripheral jet-flexible skirt air cushion concept and air thrustors will let the freighter go over waves 8 meters high at reduced velocity. Power comes from a 1280 megawatt, helium-cooled thermal reactor. It could dock at any major port in the world, but because it needs no surface contact, it could also travel inland to land-locked ports. A <b>modular</b> <b>terminal</b> design and methods of cargo transfer are suggested. The concept of cargo containerization influences both the freighter and terminal design...|$|R
5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank {{communication}} devices.
