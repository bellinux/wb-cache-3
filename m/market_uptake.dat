Web-based questionnaire survey. Participants. Organizations offering accreditation services nationally or internationally to health-care provider institutions or networks at primary, secondary or tertiary level in 2010. Main Outcome Measure(s).

The ERRAC Project Evaluation Working Group (EWG) determines the market impact of previous rail research to improve use of research funding and to ensure a strategic approach to the prioritisation of rail research. Individual projects are evaluated after they have been completed to ensure successful dissemination of project results {{in order to ensure that}} the results of previous rail research can be taken into account for future projects and avoid weak <b>market</b> <b>uptake</b> of results by learning the lessons of previous research. The EWG provides intelligence based on the project evaluations for input into future European Framework Programmes. ERRAC EWG has evaluated over 50 finished projects from the ERRAC database which has details of all Rail-related past and current rail research funded by the European Commission. A methodology has been developed to evaluate the market impact of projects and assess the contribution of evaluated projects to the ERRAC ROADMAPS and Strategic Rail Research Agenda (SRRA) goals. This information provides inputs to EC Project officers during the negotiation phase and during the course of the projects for project review.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to quantify both the sales and volume uptake of orphan drugs in Europe and to assess whether a countrys gross domestic product (GDP) and/or health technology assessment (HTA) influences the orphan drugs <b>market</b> <b>uptake.</b> Methods: We analysed the numbers of orphan drugs launched and the sales and volume uptake for 17 orphan drugs in 23 European countries from 2001 until the beginning of 2010 using the IMS Health database. Countries were clustered based on GDP and the availability of a formal HTA-organization. Results and Discussion: The uptake of orphan drugs varied across European countries. The highest volumes and contributions of orphan drugs in the first year occurred in countries with a high GDP (and implicitly, a higher budget for healthcare), independently of the existence of an HTA-organization. In contrast, in countries with a low GDP, orphan drugs were less available when there was a formal HTA-organization. There, budgetary restrictions can cause the exclusion of less cost-effective orphan drugs. What is new and Conclusion: We observed substantial variation in the <b>market</b> <b>uptake</b> of orphan drugs.

Although supporting infrastructure is under development and green economics high on the agenda, unless electric vehicles tick consumer boxes {{it is difficult to}} see how electric cars herald the future for automotive. Recent studies highlight significant and potentially unachievable driver expectations of electric vehicles. Consumers expect electric vehicles not only to be as good as traditional cars but additionally in some way better. Much research and development focus has been on the ability of electric vehicles to match a whole range of criteria: performance, safety, cost, supporting infrastructure. However, several studies also indicate that a key factor for electric vehicle adoption is their appearance. This paper discusses the first phase of a series of studies designed to highlight those elements of visual comfort appreciation most relevant and effective in promoting and enhancing new electric vehicle design adoption. The aim of the first study was to tap general perceptions of electric vehicles according to various pre-identified design parameters. Three focus groups were conducted and ten design parameters of importance were highlighted. Discussions also highlighted unrealistic perceptions with regards to the visual form of electric vehicles.

The high acquisition costs of biologics for healthcare providers could be reduced by switching to biosimilars, thus alleviating budgetary pressures and increasing patient access. Therefore, the acceptance of biosimilars by prescribers in Great Britain (GB; England, Scotland, Wales) needs to be described and understood. Objective To determine uptake of {{the first wave of}} biosimilars (somatropin, epoetin, filgrastim) by local formularies (lists of preferred medicines for prescribing in local healthcare settings). Settings This study targeted local formularies in GB. Method In November 2014, local formularies (medicines formularies of Acute Trusts and Health Boards in GB) were screened for their approach to listing of biologics and their biosimilars as well as recommendations on usage of these pharmaceuticals. Main Outcomes Measures Listing frequencies of biosimilars. Results One hundred and forty-six British local formularies were screened. Amongst the 80 % of formularies in which brand names were specified, biosimilar filgrastim was the most frequently listed when compared to the other targeted biosimilars. Biosimilars were listed in preference to reference biologic medicine in 49 % of local formularies for filgrastim, 11 % for somatropin and in only 6 % for epoetin. Conclusion Although the market for biosimilars can act in parallel to the generic <b>market,</b> their <b>uptake</b> measured using local British formularies was less than what is expected given that the British market for medicines has a strong focus on generics.

Methods: A two-stage cohort study, involving a questionnaire survey, combining interview and self-completion, was administered in respondents homes. Respondents {{were drawn from}} secondary schools in three adjoining local authority areas in the West of Scotland, UK. From a baseline sample of 920 teenagers (aged 12 - 14, mean age 13), in 2006, a cohort of 552 was followed up 2 years later (aged 14 - 16, mean age 15). Data were gathered on multiple forms of alcohol marketing and measures of drinking initiation, frequency and consumption. Results: At follow-up, logistic regression demonstrated that, after controlling for confounding variables, involvement with alcohol marketing at baseline was predictive of both uptake of drinking and increased frequency of drinking. Awareness of marketing at baseline was also {{associated with an increased}} frequency of drinking at follow-up. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate an association between involvement with, and awareness of, alcohol <b>marketing</b> and drinking <b>uptake</b> or increased drinking frequency, and we consider whether the current regulatory environment affords youth sufficient protection from alcohol marketing. 11 page(s...|$|R
