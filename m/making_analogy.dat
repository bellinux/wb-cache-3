In {{a potential}}-based routing, {{it is essential}} to calculate the potential function at the location of nodes. The best existing algorithm proposed for distributed potential calculation makes use of Jacobi iterations. These iterations are well-known for their slow convergence which makes them useless for practi-cal applications. Our proposed method aims at improving the convergence rate of potential calculation. We propose a novel method inspired by wave propagation in physical media by <b>making</b> <b>analogy</b> between a simple path network and a single stub transmission line. We generalize our method to make it applicable to all possible network topologies. Analysis results show that the required number of iterations reduces significantly to O(N) for the path network of N nodes, compared to O(N 2) for Jacobi iterations. I...|$|E

Multi Agent Technology has been used to facilitate the underneath support for this, while primarily using the power of relating in different domains as the working mechanism for agents. Agents are used to isolate an appropriate domain in which the same problem that happens to be analogically feasible; and for this domain selection, communication and negotiation features of agent technology have been used. The model has been partially scrutinized in the geometric analogy domain for empirical validations and the idea is still in a conceptual level...|$|E

Detailed analyses concern factors conditioning contents, structures {{and implementation of}} these processes. First of all, there are analyzed factors affecting women's professional activization, that is taking of jobs by them outside their home. Next the author analyzes factors determining professional preferences of women and taking {{of jobs in the}} teaching profession by them. The causes of these processes were sought in political, ideological, economic, social, cultural, and even biopsychic spheres. Proceeding from the assumption that not all of these factors appear in a given period of time and not all of them exert a similar impact, the author tried to define the role of some of them in the thrity—year period of the People's Poland.

40|$|The {{survival}} amplitude G(t) of a nonstationary state decaying into {{a purely}} continuous spectrum is treated {{in terms of}} an integral transform of an energy distribution with infinity>Egreater than or equal to 0. We examine three such distributions. Two are real functions, the Lorentzian g(L) (E) and a modified Lorentzian G(E) =g(L) (E) E- 1 / 2, and one is the complex version of g(L) (E),g(c) (L) (E). Real distributions are associated with Hermitian treatments while complex ones result from non-Hermitian treatments. The difference between the two has repercussions on the G(t) for nonexponential decay (NED) and on the understanding of irreversible decay at the quantum level. For all three distributions, we derive analytically amplitudes (propagators) for NED and then show that these satisfy differential equations, from which additional insight into the decay process for very long and very short times can be obtained. By <b>making</b> <b>analogy</b> with the classical Langevin equation, the terms of the differential equation that are derived when the simpler g(L) (E) and g(c) (L) (E) are employed, are interpreted using concepts such as friction and fluctuation. On the other hand, when g(L) (E) is multiplied by an energy-dependent factor, as in G(E), the results are, as expected, more complicated and the interpretability of the differential equation satisfied by the NED propagator loses clarity...|$|E
40|$|Multiple-objective {{optimization}} {{is common}} in biological systems. In the mammalian olfactory system, each sensory neuron stochastically expresses {{only one out of}} up to thousands of olfactory receptor (OR) gene alleles; at organism level the types of expressed ORs need to be maximized. Existing models focus only on monoallele activation, and cannot explain recent observations in mutants, especially the reduced global diversity of expressed ORs in G 9 a/GLP knockouts. In this work we integrated existing information on OR expression, and constructed a comprehensive model that has all its components based on physical interactions. Analyzing the model reveals an evolutionarily optimized three-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal segregation, epigenetic barrier crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop that mechanistically differs from previous theoretical proposals, and a previously unidentified enhancer competition step. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR expression, but also elucidates how the olfactory system maximizes and maintains the diversity of OR expression, and has multiple predictions validated by existing experimental results. Through <b>making</b> <b>analogy</b> to a physical system with thermally activated barrier crossing and comparative reverse engineering analyses, the study reveals that the olfactory receptor selection system is optimally designed, and particularly underscores cooperativity and synergy as a general design principle for multi-objective optimization in biology.

40|$|As {{a natural}} quandary it is a {{question}} that who are humans? It is possible to justify those humans, who are taxonomically known as Homo-sapiens; are nothing but <b>analogy</b> <b>making</b> species. <b>Analogy</b> <b>making</b> is the fundamental practice of the human cognitive process that makes to understand new things or knowledge based on what have been already understood. Abstract reasoning, language, introspection, problem solving, etc. all are merely governed by the <b>analogy</b> <b>making</b> process. Even though this is an innate ability of humans, embedding this feature into a computational analogy solving model has been a research challenge. Various types of analogy related research has been started from Thomas G. Evans ‘ANALOGY’ program in 1964; and a number of sophisticated approaches have been published like; Structure Mapping Engine, Analogical Constraint Matching Engine, Incremental Analogy Machine, Associative Memory-Based Reasoning, etc. Nevertheless, most of these works mainly have been driven by heuristic search strategies with rule based approaches, which are fundamentally away from a general <b>analogy</b> <b>making</b> process; though successfully accounted for many applications. Intelligence is the central property that can be inspected through any <b>analogy</b> <b>making,</b> and the main skill that differentiates human beings from all the other beings. Therefore, there is a core relation between <b>analogy</b> <b>making</b> and the intelligence. Intelligence can be considered as an emergent property with the holist view point that emerges when conditions met. Therefore, <b>analogy</b> <b>making</b> can be modelled through emerge intelligence by taking everything as conditioned phenomena. This approach has been enriched with five aggregates that explain in Buddhist Philosophy namely ‘Form’ (rūpa), ‘Sensation’ (vedanā), ‘Perception’ (saññā), ‘Mental formations’ (sañkhāra), and ‘Consciousness’(viññāna). First any phenomenon can be considered as a ‘Form’ consisting of receiving knowledge of the outside world through the senses; and through that ‘Sensation’ will be developed that bridges the internal sense organs with external sense objects. That event leads to ‘Perception’ that makes the assimilation of sensation with ideas that pre-exist. Through that ‘Mental formations’ will be activated that will develop thoughts; which is the core in conditioned phenomena finally to form ‘Consciousness’. In <b>analogy</b> <b>making</b> too; a phenomena/problem can be considered as a form and through sensation that will be mapped into the computer understandable form (a domain mapping) that will be contributed to relate with existing ontology to get the perceptions. That will be further reason out with concept formation techniques to emerge intelligence. This approach has implemented with Multi Agent technology by utilising its emergent ability through communication and negotiation features. Furthermore, the approach suggested for <b>analogy</b> <b>making</b> in this research is general though it has been scrutinized only for geometric domain for evaluation purposes. The model assumed that it has been given an analogy in the form of first order logic through the abstraction. That will be bound with ontology to develop appropriate perceptions to interpret the analogy in various manners. Those interpreted data will be going through a formation process that will be empowered by various reasoning strategies mainly through relations. These independent actions communicate appropriately when needed consciously and make an analogy. Furthermore, this approach has been evaluated in the geometric analogy domain parallel with eight to nine year old students and it is found to be that the results obtained from the system is substantial.
