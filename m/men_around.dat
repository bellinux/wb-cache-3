5|$|At 17:30, {{three hours}} into the war, the twelfth and final {{infantry}} wave crossed, bringing the total in all five bridgeheads to 32,000 <b>men</b> (<b>around</b> 6,400 in each bridgehead). By then Israeli armored losses had reached around 100 tanks. The magnitude of Israeli losses stemmed from their insistence to reach their comrades in the Bar Lev Line, and they repeatedly ran into aggressive ambushes by Egyptian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the battle, Waller {{captured}} at least 500 <b>men,</b> <b>around</b> 100 of these re-enlisting with him. Additionally, more than 100 Royalist soldiers were killed. Together, the men lost represented nearly half of Hopton's infantry forces in the south. Waller, on the other hand, lost around ten men and gained much reputation for his success. Waller put his prisoners to work dragging the horse carcasses from the church, dismantling the scaffoldings inside, and burying their fallen comrades near the northern wall of the building. All of the captured men were then marched to Farnham tied together in pairs.|$|E
5|$|In September 1899, it {{was clear}} that the crisis in South Africa was likely to turn into war. By 2 October, all {{military}} leave had been cancelled, and urgent preparations were under way to send a large expeditionary force to the Cape, with horses and supplies being requisitioned and mobilised. On 7 October, a proclamation was issued calling out the Army Reserve. Of 65,000 liable <b>men,</b> <b>around</b> 25,000 were intended to be called up for service. The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October.|$|E

5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly with a drug that {{effectively}} controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of <b>men</b> <b>around</b> her. He takes {{her back to the}} suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as anoetic histamine. She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30, Egyptian forces {{captured}} Fort Lahtzanit, {{the first}} fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall, {{and by then}} the infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage {{in less than an}} hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 <b>men</b> (<b>around</b> 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.|$|E
5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted <b>men</b> <b>around</b> the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E

5|$|Gaveston's first exile {{was to be}} a short one. In early July 1307, Edward I {{fell ill}} while once more campaigning in the north, and lay dying at Burgh by Sands near the Scottish border. According to one chronicle, he {{gathered}} some of his most trusted <b>men</b> <b>around</b> him, including Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; and Aymer de Valence, soon to be Earl of Pembroke. Edward entrusted the magnates with the care of his son, and instructed them particularly to prevent the return of Piers Gaveston from exile. Nevertheless, when the King died on 7 July, one of Edward II's first acts as king was to recall his friend. Gaveston returned almost immediately, and the two were reunited by early August.|$|E
5|$|In 1370 the French made a {{successful}} attack on Portsmouth, commencing a new sequence of raids along the English coast. In due course first Edward, then Richard II, responded by improving the defences {{in the south}} of England. Part of this involved improving the condition of Southampton Castle, where, owing in part to the theft of building materials, including stone and lead, by the citizens of the town, the defences were in a poor condition. Henry Yevele, who oversaw the improvements to the castle, probably also constructed the Arcades along the western walls in 1380: this involved adopting the 1360 proposal to block up the properties along the western quay to form a solid wall, and adding three towers and gunports. Sir John Sondes and John Polymond were appointed by the king in 1386 to further improve the town walls, working with Sir John Arundel, the castle governor – Polymond and Arundel Towers were probably named after these <b>men</b> <b>around</b> this time.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his <b>men</b> <b>around</b> the bend, {{carefully}} {{keeping them}} behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey came out from cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Bryennios's victory seemed certain, for {{his wings}} began to envelop Alexios's Franks in the centre. Realizing his {{position}} and despairing {{in the face of}} defeat (and, as Bryennios the Younger records, because he had disobeyed imperial orders to wait for more Turkish reinforcements and feared punishment from Botaneiates), Alexios at first resolved to attempt an all-or-nothing attack on Bryennios himself to decapitate the enemy army, but was dissuaded by his servant. With only six of his <b>men</b> <b>around</b> him, he then managed to break through the surrounding enemy soldiers. Confusion reigned behind their lines {{as a result of the}} Pecheneg attack on the rebel camp, and in this tumult Alexios saw Bryennios's imperial parade horse, with his two swords of state, being driven away to safety. Alexios and his men charged the escort, seized the horse, and rode away with it from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{returned}} to Washington Barracks {{to attend the}} Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917. The course was abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his fitness for promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail transport unit, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun-sur-Yèvre and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is-sur-Tille. Somervell got his projects completed by working his <b>men</b> <b>around</b> the clock and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost. For his role, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of free women in {{classical}} Athens was {{to marry and}} bear children. The emphasis on marriage {{as a way to}} perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens, when (at least amongst the powerful) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family. Athenian women typically first married much older <b>men</b> <b>around</b> age fourteen. Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative, who was responsible for choosing their husband; the bride had little say in this decision. Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents' property, women often married relatives. This was especially the case of women with no brothers (epikleroi), whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her.|$|E

5|$|With a {{strength}} that {{continued to grow}} until there was about 350 <b>men</b> <b>around</b> the bridge, the charges that had {{been placed on the}} bridge were removed and No. 3 Commando settled in to defend the bridge as they waited for 50th Division to arrive. Over {{the course of the next}} few hours they were subjected to mortar fire and shelling from a Panzer IV tank. Eventually, as casualties mounted and their reinforcement became overdue the Commandos were forced to abandon the position, nevertheless they had prevented the bridge from being blown up and it was eventually recaptured as the Eighth Army arrived a short time later. The unit, however, suffered heavily for the success, suffering 30 killed, 66 wounded and 59 missing or captured. The bridge was later renamed No. 3 Commando Bridge in their honour.|$|E
5|$|After this truce, Grant's army {{began to}} fill the 12-mile ring around Vicksburg. In short time {{it became clear that}} even 50,000 Union {{soldiers}} {{would not be able to}} effect a complete encirclement of the Confederate defenses. Pemberton's outlook on escape was pessimistic, but there were still roads leading south out of Vicksburg unguarded by Federal troops. Grant found help from Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, the Union general-in-chief. Halleck quickly began to shift Union troops in the West to meet Grant's needs. The first of these reinforcements to arrive along the siege lines was a 5,000 man division from the Department of the Missouri under Maj. Gen. Francis J. Herron on June 11. Herron's troops, remnants of the Army of the Frontier, were attached to McPherson's corps and took up position on the far south. Next came a three division detachment from the XVI Corps led by Brig. Gen. Cadwallader C. Washburn on June 12, assembled from troops at nearby posts of Corinth, Memphis, and LaGrange. The final significant group of reinforcements to join was the 8,000 man strong IX Corps from the Department of the Ohio, led by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, arriving on June 14. With the arrival of Parke, Grant had 77,000 <b>men</b> <b>around</b> Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the day B Company was subjected to intense indirect fire on the Hinge, as was C Company on Hill 317. The Anti-Tank Platoon and Assault Pioneer Platoon reinforced C Company, with a platoon of C Company moved forward to the Hinge to support B Company. At 20:00 both the Hinge and Hill 317 were again heavily shelled for 45 minutes, heralding the beginning of the inevitable Chinese counterattack. Heavy mist concealed the Chinese advance, and this assisted many to penetrate the Australian perimeter. Throughout the night of 7/8 October the Hinge was attacked on three occasions from both the front and the flanks by a force of battalion strength, however the Australians beat back the Chinese in desperate hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese swept forward, but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire. During one such assault Sergeant P.J. O'Connell, on seeing one of his platoon's Bren gunners wounded, manned the light machine-gun himself, breaking up a Chinese assault, while controlling the fire of the <b>men</b> <b>around</b> him. Meanwhile, Sergeant R.W. Strong arranged the resupply of ammunition to the forward Australian sections. Both were awarded the Military Medal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of Sunday October 7, just after midnight, Egyptian infantry, now with tank support, {{advanced}} to expand their bridgeheads. Israeli armored formations had experienced heavy losses in trying repeatedly to reach the Bar Lev Line and were disorganized and confused. Many Israeli units, however, stubbornly resisted the Egyptian advance. Twice during the night of October 6 to October 7, groups of tanks and infantry penetrated the bridgeheads to reach the canal line, where they managed to damage two bridges and destroy a number of ferries. Surrounded on all sides, however, these units were soon destroyed. Before sunrise the bridgeheads had reached a depth of , and the attacking Israeli units retreated. With sufficient numbers of armor finally on the east bank, reinforcements of infantry began to cross. Dawn on October 7 saw a total of 50,000 <b>men</b> (<b>around</b> 10,000 to each bridgehead) and 400 Egyptian tanks occupying five bridgeheads in the Sinai across the Suez Canal. Egyptian forces reorganised and entrenched themselves in anticipation of Israeli counterattacks.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} <b>men</b> <b>around</b> the bend behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, {{out into the}} open {{streambed}} to render medical assistance. Though his prominent Red Cross flag was clearly visible, the hidden cadres immediately opened fire on Coey, who was killed almost instantly by a shot through the head. His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of the}} day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI man were wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early hours, they ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI men and a fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area. The morale of 2 Commando's men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful Fireforce in which the cadres had killed four Rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{the open}} fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny {{to fill a}} hole {{in the center of the}} Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode out in front of the regiment, strenuously urging them to hurry, and refuting {{warnings}} that Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates concealed just inside a nearby tree line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit when most of the <b>men</b> <b>around</b> him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in Amherst.|$|E
