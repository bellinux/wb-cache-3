30|$|From Fig.  9, we can {{see that}} the CDDC method {{frequently}} uses the discrete devices’ response to fluctuations in wind-power generation between 00 : 00 and 03 : 30. This means that there are few shunt capacitors/reactors available after 05 : 45, and the OLTC tap position cannot change after 01 : 00. The SDDC and THDDC methods both take the day-long time coupling between the discrete devices into account and avoid using up the permitted number of operations. In addition, the THDDC method decides to operate the devices based on the actual wind power curve instead <b>of</b> the <b>mid-value</b> <b>of</b> the wind forecast for the day ahead, which is used by the SDDC method. We can see from Fig.  9 a that the variations in the total shunt capacitor/reactor reactive power reserves are closer to those of the actual total wind power shown in Fig.  8 when they are controlled by the THDDC method.|$|R

After a considerable {{drop in the}} previous period, inflation gradually stabilised at its lowest level since 1991, {{the beginning of the}} country?s economic transformation. Net inflation continued to be determined largely by food prices. The economy livened up somewhat in Q 2 1999, fostered in particular by an improvement in net exports and by growth in household consumption. The current macroeconomic framework is marked by the anti-inflationary effect of the demand side and by the revival of some cost-push inflationary factors.

In the present work, CFD fluidization modeling of a biomass bed is validated by comparison with X-ray computed tomography experimental data. A parametric study {{was carried out by}} employing ground walnut shell or ground corncob as model biomass bed materials, and fluidization was performed at a gas velocity twice the minimum fluidization velocity. An important result is the use of an 2 ̆ 2 effective density 2 ̆ 2 for biomass in the CFD model, the use of which is necessary because the biomass particles can be characterized by an irregular shape and some degree of porosity, whereas CFD models assume the biomass particles to be solid spheres. If the <b>mid-value</b> <b>of</b> the density range provided by the manufacturer is employed, the bulk density of the solid phase in the bed is overestimated.

3000|$|The {{parameter}} list {{also includes}} the QTL positions {{with reference to the}} sequence of the Nipponbare pseudo-chromosomes v 5.0 to facilitate the shift from the QTL and meta-QTL confidence intervals to the underlying genes. The positions of the QTLs were determined by the physical position of the most significant markers for QTLs mapped through single marker analysis. For QTLs detected through interval or composite interval mapping, their positions were defined as the <b>mid-values</b> <b>of</b> the physical positions of the two markers flanking the QTL peak because the names of flanking markers were always indicated in the papers, while this was seldom the case for estimated QTL positions. To determine the physical positions of the markers, Gramene data or BLAST results based on Gramene sequence information were used when available. Otherwise, for example in the case of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), the nearest marker with a known sequence in the original genetic map was used as a proxy. This solution led to a loss of precision in positioning the marker, but in our dataset, AFLPs represented only 5.9 % of the markers linked to QTLs. Information on the physical position of each marker or of the proxy we used is also available in Tropgene DB ([URL] For original data or additional details on a particular experiment, the reader is referred to the initial publications in the list of references.

40|$|Abstract—Voting {{algorithms}} {{are used}} in a wide area of control systems from real-time and safety-critical control systems to pattern recognition, image processing and human organization systems in order to arbitrating among redundant results of processing in redundant hardware modules or software versions. From a point of view, voting algorithms can be categorized to agreement-based voters like plurality and majority or some voters which produce output regardless to agreement existence among the results of redundant variants. In some applications {{it is necessary to}} use second type voters including median and weighted average. Although both of median and weighted average voters are the choicest voters for highly available application, weighted average voting is often more trustable than median. Meanwhile median voter simply selects the <b>mid-value</b> <b>of</b> results; weighted average voter assigns weight to each input, based on their pre-determined priority or their differences, so that the share of more trustable inputs will increase rather than the inputs with low probable correctness. This paper introduces a novel weighted average voting algorithm based on neural networks that is capable of improving the rate of system reliability. Our experimental results showed that the neural weighted average voter has increases the reliability 116. 63 % in general and 309. 82 %, 130. 27 % and 9. 37 % respectively for large, medium and small errors in comparison with weighted average, and 73. 87 % in general and 160. 44 %, 83. 59 % and 7. 52 % respectively for large, medium and small errors in comparison with median voter.
