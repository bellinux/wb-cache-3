In recent years, benchmark comparisons between RL and BBO have been made, and there have been several attempts to specify which approach works best for which types of problem classes. In this article, we make several contributions to this line of research by: 1) Classifying several RL algorithms in terms of their algorithmic properties. 2) Showing how the derivation of ever <b>more</b> powerful <b>RL</b> algorithms displays a trend towards BBO. 3) Continuing this trend by applying two modifications to the state-of-the-art PI 2 algorithm, which yields an algorithm we denote PIBB.

40|$|Substance {{dependent}} individuals (SDI) often exhibit decision-making deficits; however, {{it remains}} unclear whether {{the nature of the}} underlying decision-making processes is the same in users of different classes of drugs and whether these deficits persist after discontinuation of drug use. We used computational modeling to address these questions in a unique sample of relatively pure amphetamine-dependent (N= 38) and heroin-dependent individuals (N= 43) who were currently in protracted abstinence, and in 48 healthy controls. A Bayesian model comparison technique, a simulation method, and parameter recovery tests were used to compare three cognitive models: (1) Prospect Valence Learning with decay reinforcement learning rule (PVL-DecayRI), (2) PVL with delta learning rule (PVL-Delta), and (3) Value-Plus-Perseverance (VPP) models based on Win-Stay-Lose-Switch (WSLS) strategy. The model comparison results indicated that the VPP model, a hybrid model of reinforcement learning (RL) and a heuristic strategy of perseverance had the best post hoc model fit, but the two PVL models showed better simulation performance. Computational modeling results suggested that overall all three groups relied <b>more</b> on <b>RL</b> than on a WSLS strategy. Heroin users displayed reduced loss aversion relative to healthy controls across all three models, which suggests that their decision-making deficits are longstanding (or pre-existing) and may be driven by reduced sensitivity to loss. In contrast, amphetamine users showed comparable cognitive functions to healthy controls with the VPP model, whereas the second best-fitting model with relatively good simulation performance (PVL-DecayRI) revealed increased reward sensitivity relative to healthy controls. These results suggest that some decision-making deficits persist in protracted abstinence and may be mediated by different mechanisms in opiate and stimulant users...|$|R

Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep <b>RL</b> <b>more</b> reproducible.

Despite {{the impressive}} achievements of reinforcement learning (RL) in playing Backgammon {{already in the}} beginning of the 90 ’s, relatively few successful real-world applications of RL have been reported since then. This could be due to the tendency of RL research to focus on discrete Markov Decision Processes that make it difficult to handle tasks with continuous-valued features. Another reason could be a tendency to develop continuously <b>more</b> complex mathematical <b>RL</b> models that are difficult to implement and operate. Both of these issues are addressed in this paper by using the gradient-descent Sarsa(λ) method together with a Normalised Radial Basis Function neural net. The experimental results on three typical benchmark control tasks show that these methods outperform most previously reported results on these tasks, while remaining computationally feasible to implement even as embedded software. Therefore the presented results can serve as a reference both regarding learning performance and computational applicability of RL for real-life applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) {{can be used}} {{to restore}} {{function}} in people living with paralysis. Current BMIs require extensive calibration that increase the set-up times and external inputs for decoder training that may be difficult to produce in paralyzed individuals. Both these factors have presented challenges in transitioning the technology from research environments to activities of daily living (ADL). For BMIs to be seamlessly used in ADL, these issues should be handled with minimal external input thus reducing the need for a technician/caregiver to calibrate the system. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based BMIs are a good tool to be used when there is no external training signal and can provide an adaptive modality to train BMI decoders. However, RL based BMIs are sensitive to the feedback provided to adapt the BMI. In actor-critic BMIs, this feedback is provided by the critic and the overall system performance is limited by the critic accuracy. In this work, we developed an adaptive BMI that could handle inaccuracies in the critic feedback in an effort to produce <b>more</b> accurate <b>RL</b> based BMIs. We developed a confidence measure, which indicated how appropriate the feedback is for updating the decoding parameters of the actor. The results show that with the new update formulation, the critic accuracy is no longer a limiting factor for the overall performance. We tested and validated the system on three different data sets: synthetic data generated by an Izhikevich neural spiking model, synthetic data with a Gaussian noise distribution, and data collected from a non-human primate engaged in a reaching task. All results indicated that the system with the critic confidence built in always outperformed the system without the critic confidence. Results of this study suggest the potential application of the technique in developing an autonomous BMI that does not need an external signal for training or extensive calibration...|$|R

A specific part of the existing literature addresses the importance of CSI in MIMO systems, such as [21, 46 – 49]. In the context of SatComs, channel knowledge can be acquired at the end-user ground stations for the FL and then fed back to the gateway station (GS) for the <b>RL.</b> <b>More</b> specifically, CSI should be available at the GS so that multiuser precoding can be performed for the FL and joint decoding at the RL. Current standards are using pilot sequences, either available within the standard as an optional feature (i.e., for DVB-S 2) or defined within the specified requirements for the transmission burst structure of the Multi-Frequency Time Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA) return channel (i.e., for the DVB-RCS NG). A recent study for the effect of CSI in the satellite context can be found in [50], where the satellite link performance with and without CSI is compared and a technique for estimating CSI is proposed. Subsequently, the current state of the art reference transmission standards are well suited for the adaptation of the proposed multibeam satellite systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Motivated {{learning}} (ML) {{is a new}} biologically inspired {{machine learning}} method. It is {{the combination of a}} reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm and a system that creates hierarchy of goals. The goal creation system is concerned with creating new internal goals, building a hierarchy of them, and controlling the agent’s behavior according to this constituted hierarchy of goals. As in case of reinforcement learning method, a motivated learning agent is learning through interaction with the environment. The comparisons of both methods in special type test environment show that the motivated learning method is more efficient in learning complex relations between available resources (concepts). ML has better performance than RL, especially in dynamically changing environments. In the presented experiments we have shown that ML based agent, which has the ability to set its internal goals autonomously, is able to fulfill the designer’s goals <b>more</b> effectively than <b>RL</b> based agent. In addition, because the observed concepts are not predefined but emerge during the learning process, this method also addresses problem of merging connectionist and symbolic approaches for intelligent autonomous systems.

The interplanetary shocks were detected during the pe-riod from 1996 to 2006. First we analyze the CME properties near the Sun. The CMEs with an ESP-producing shock are faster (〈VCME 〉 = 1088 km/s) than those driving shocks without an ESP event (〈VCME 〉 = 771 km/s) and have a larger fraction of halo CMEs (67 % vs. 38 %). The Alfvénic Mach numbers of shocks with an ESP event are on average 1. 6 times {{higher than those of}} shocks without. We also contrast the ESP event properties and fre-quency in shocks with and without a type II radio burst by dividing the shocks into radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) shocks, respectively. The shocks seem to be organized into a decreasing sequence by the energy content of the CMEs: RL shocks with an ESP event are driven by the most energetic CMEs, followed by RL shocks without an ESP event, then RQ shocks with and with-out an ESP event.

Each operation is performed by more than one resource simultaneously. Number of units of each resource used for performing an operation is one or more units. The problem deals with determining a schedule of operations minimizing total weighted tardiness. In this paper, solution techniques based on Lagrangian relaxation are proposed. In general, the Lagrangian relaxation technique consists of three parts run iteratively, i. e., (1) solving individual job problems, (2) obtaining a feasible solution, and (3) solving a Lagrangian dual problem. For solving the individual job problems, two approaches are applied, i. e., enumeration and dynamic program¬ming. In this paper, the Lagrangian relaxation technique using the enumeration and dynamic programming approaches are called RL 1 and RL 2, respectively. The solution techniques proposed are examined using a set of hypothetical instances. Numerical experiments are carried out to compare the performance of RL 1, RL 2, and two others solution techniques (optimal and genetic algorithm techniques). Numerical experiments show that <b>RL</b> 2 is <b>more</b> efficient than <b>RL</b> 1.

Purpose: The purpose of this generic qualitative study was to uncover the main internal and external drivers and barriers of RL within major South African grocery retailers. Method: Eleven face-to-face, semi-structured interviews and one telephonic interview were conducted with participants from four large grocery retailers. Findings: Optimising profitability and cost reduction goals are the identified internal drivers, whereas the main external driver was to reduce the organisations’ environmental impact. A lack of information systems – such as enterprise resource planning systems or warehouse management system software – and infrastructure were revealed as the main internal barriers for organisations’ RL practices, whereas supplier non-compliance and transportation inefficiencies were the main external barriers exposed. Managerial implications: In order to optimise {{the efficiency of the}} reverse flow, managers are recommended to devote <b>more</b> capital to <b>RL</b> infrastructure, develop policies to manage supplier behaviour, focus on RL as a revenue generating stream as well as implement information systems to manage the entire reverse flow.

The frequency of these interactions has shown to positively affect learning. To assist and guide RL, alternative instructional tools are needed. Task cards combining {{a picture of the}} skill with instruction about how to perform the skill can be considered as multimedia instructional tools. Offering visual and verbal information fosters learning as explained by Paivio’s dual coding theory. Mayer elaborated the dual coding theory and identified the conditions under which multimedia messages are more likely to foster learning. In Physical Education task cards have been implemented to guide practice time, deliver prompts and cues, guide feedback and assess performance. However, these studies did not emphasize on the effectiveness of design and use of task cards to promote student learning. In this study participants were given 20 min to learn Basic Life Support (BLS) in pairs by means of task cards. Four experimental conditions were implemented. Experimental conditions differed in the way reciprocity and task card use was structured. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} a <b>more</b> structured <b>RL</b> setting will lead to higher BLS performance than less structured settings. Methods and materials: 72 first year kinesiology students from the University of Leuven were paired and randomized into 4 groups to learn BLS in 20 min with task cards. In the ‘role’ group students switched roles of doer and helper every 5 min. In the ‘function’ group the task of the doer and helper was defined. In the ‘combined’ group tasks for helper and doer were defined and every 5 min students switched roles. In the ‘control’ group no structure was implemented. All BLS skills were individually assessed on a Laerdal AED ResusciAnne manikin using the Laerdal PC-Skill reporting system. A total BLS score was calculated and performance was measured before training (baseline), immediately after training (intervention) and 2 weeks later (retention). Results: At intervention and retention, all groups achieved between 71 and 81 % of the maximum total score. At intervention there was a significant difference between groups for the percentage of correct chest compressions (P = 0. 039). Significantly more students from the combined group remembered and consequently performed all BLS items at retention (P = 0. 035). Conclusion: Implementing structure in a RL setting with task cards fosters skill retention. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} {{exploring}} a spectroscopic unification for all known types of broad line emitting AGN. The 4 D Eigenvector 1 (4 DE 1) parameter space shows promise as a unification capable of organizing quasar diversity on a sequence primarily governed by Eddington ratio. This paper considers {{the role of}} Civλ 1549 measures with special emphasis on the Civλ 1549 line shift as a principal 4 DE 1 diagnostic. We use HST archival spectra for 130 sources with S/N high enough to permit reliable Civλ 1549 broad component measures. We find a Civλ 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largely radio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(HβBC) � 4000 km s − 1 (which we call Population A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy 1, with FWHM Hβ ≤ 2000 km s − 1) sources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. The systematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, is not observed in broader line AGN (including most radio-loud (RL) sources but also ∼ 25 % of RQ) which we call Population B. We find new correlations between FWHM(Civλ 1549 BC) and Civλ 1549 line shift {{as well as the}} equivalent width of Civλ 1549. They are seen only in Pop. A sources. Broader-lined sources show random scatter. Civλ 1549 measures enhance the apparent dichotomy between sources with FWHM(HβBC) less and greater than 4000 km s − 1 (Sulentic et al. 2000 a) suggesting that it has more significance in the context of Broad Line Region structure than the <b>more</b> commonly discussed <b>RL</b> vs. RQ dichotomy.

40|$|Purpose: Endometrial {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} common gynecologic malignancy which is associated with a poor prognosis when diagnosed at an advanced stage; therefore, the discovery of efficacious new drugs is required to reinforce conventional chemotherapy. Short-term cultures of primary cells from endometrial tumors could be used for testing new anticancer therapeutics {{as well as for the}} development of personalized cancer therapy strategy. Here, the antitumor effect of a recombinant analogue of lactaptin (RL 2), a new potential anticancer molecule, was examined against primary human endometrial cancer cells. Materials and Methods: Primary cell cultures of malignant and normal human endometrium were performed by enzymatic digestion of endometrial tissue from biopsy material. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) state of estrogen (ERs) and progesterone (PRs) hormone receptors and aromatase (Cyp 19) in cell cultures. Dynamic monitoring of cell adhesion and proliferation was made using the iCELLigence system (ASEA Biosciences). The sensitivity of cell cultures to conventional anticancer drugs and the lactaptin analog was estimated by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 -thiazolyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, flow cytometry, and the iCELLligence system. Results: Established short-term primary cultures of endometrial cancer cells were ERα/ERβ/PR-positive and sensitive for RL 2. The IC 50 values of doxorubicin and cisplatin were determined for all of the primary cultures designed. KE normal cells displaying low Cyp 19 mRNA levels and high ERβ and PR mRNA levels were <b>more</b> resistant to <b>RL</b> 2 treatment as well as to cisplatin and doxorubicin. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the recombinant analog of lactaptin, RL 2, exerts cytotoxic effects against primary hormone-dependent endometrial tumor cells in vitro with features of apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Abridged] We {{have been}} {{exploring}} a spectroscopic unification for all known types of broad line emitting AGN. The 4 D Eigenvector 1 (4 DE 1) parameter space shows promise as a unification capable of organizing quasar diversity on a sequence primarily governed by Eddington ratio. This paper considers {{the role of}} CIV 1549 measures with special emphasis on the CIV 1549 line shift as a principal 4 DE 1 diagnostic. We use HST archival spectra for 130 sources with S/N high enough to permit reliable CIV 1549 broad component (BC) measures. We find a CIV 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largely radio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(H beta BC) < 4000 km/s (which we call Population A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy 1, with FWHM H beta < 2000 km/s) sources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. The systematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, is not observed in broader lined AGN which we call Population B. We find new correlations between FWHM(CIV 1549 BC) and CIV 1549 line shift {{as well as the}} equivalent width of CIV 1549. They are seen only in Pop. A sources. CIV 1549 measures enhance the apparent dichotomy at FWHM(Hbeta BC) approx. 4000 (Sulentic et al. 2000) suggesting that it has more significance in the context of Broad Line Region structure than the <b>more</b> commonly discussed <b>RL</b> vs. RQ dichotomy. Black hole masses computed from FWHM CIV 1549 BC for about 80 AGN indicate that the CIV 1549 width is a poor virial estimator. Comparison of mass estimates derived from Hbeta BC and CIV 1549 reveals that the latter show different and nonlinear offsets for population A and B sources. A significant number of sources also show narrow line CIV 1549 emission. We present a recipe for CIV 1549 narrow component extraction.
