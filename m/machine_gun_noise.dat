30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel and robust voice {{activity}} detection (VAD) algorithm utilizing long-term spectral flatness measure (LSFM) which is capable of working at 10 dB and lower signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs). This new LSFM-based VAD improves speech detection robustness in various noisy environments by employing a low-variance spectrum estimate and an adaptive threshold. The discriminative power of the new LSFM feature is shown by conducting {{an analysis of the}} speech/non-speech LSFM distributions. The proposed algorithm was evaluated under 12 types of noises (11 from NOISEX- 92 and speech-shaped noise) and five types of SNR in core TIMIT test corpus. Comparisons with three modern standardized algorithms (ETSI adaptive multi-rate (AMR) options AMR 1 and AMR 2 and ITU-T G. 729) demonstrate that our proposed LSFM-based VAD scheme achieved the best average accuracy rate. A long-term signal variability (LTSV)-based VAD scheme is also compared with our proposed method. The results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the LTSV-based VAD scheme for most of the noises considered including difficult noises like <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> <b>noise</b> and speech babble noise.|$|E
30|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this article}} was the introduction of an efficient long-term spectral flatness measure-based VAD algorithm. The motivation of exploring flatness measure along time frames using a long window was clarified by the LSFM feature distributions {{as a function of the}} long-term window length R. The discriminative power of the LSFM feature was verified in terms of the separateness of its distribution for noisy speech and non-speech signals. The decision threshold was adapted according to the previous 100 LSFM measures of speech and non-speech. Experiments were done on core TIMIT test set for 12 kinds of noises (11 from NOISEX- 92 database and speech-shaped noise) across five different SNRs ranging from − 10 to 10 dB. No a priori knowledge of noise characteristics was needed for training purposes. The performance of our proposed method was compared with the three standards (namely G. 729 B, AMR 1, and AMR 2) and with an emerging LTSV-based VAD algorithm. The results were analyzed by accuracy rate and error rate. Through extensive experiments, we showed that our proposed LSFM-based VAD achieved the best CORRECT, HR 0, and NDS and among all tested schemes that averaged all 12 kinds of noises. Furthermore, we investigated the individual performance on each noise type. Our proposed LSFM-based VAD outperformed LTSV-based VAD for 6 out of 12 noise types tested especially for non-stationary impulsive <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> <b>noise</b> and speechlike babble noise.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The speech {{reception}} threshold (SRT) traditionally {{is measured}} in stationary noise that has the long-term average speech spectrum of the target speech. However, in real life the instantaneous spectrum of the background noise {{is likely to be}} different from the stationary long-term average speech spectrum noise. To gain more insight into the effect of real-life background noises on speech intelligibility, the SRT of listeners with normal hearing was measured in a set of noises that varied in both the spectral and the temporal domain. This article investigates the ability of the extended speech intelligibility index (ESII), proposed by Rhebergen et al. to account for SRTs in these real-life background noises. DESIGN: SRTs in noise were measured in 12 subjects with normal hearing. Interfering noises consisted of a variety of real-life noises, selected from a database, and chosen {{on the basis of their}} spectrotemporal differences. Measured SRTs were converted to ESII values and compared. Ideally, at threshold, ESII values should be the same, because the ESII represents the amount of speech information available to the listener. RESULTS: SRTs ranged from - 6 dB SNR (in stationary noise) to - 21 dB SNR (in <b>machine</b> <b>gun</b> <b>noise).</b> Conversion to ESII values resulted in an average value of 0. 34, with a standard deviation of 0. 06. SRT predictions with the ESII model were better than those obtained with the conventional SII (ANSI 53. 5 - 1997) model. In case of interfering speech, the ESII model predictions were poorer, because additional, nonenergetic (informational) masking is thought to occur. CONCLUSIONS: For the present set of masking noises, being representative for a variety of real-life noises, the ESII model of Rhebergen et al. is able to predict the SRTs of subjects with normal hearing with reasonable accuracy. It may be concluded that the ESII model can provide valuable predictions for the speech intelligibility in some everyday situation...|$|E
