40|$|Modeling is {{regarded}} as fundamental to human cog-nition and scientific inquiry (Schwarz and White 2005). It helps learners express and externalize their thinking, visualize and test components of their theories, and make materials more interesting. Particularly, the impor-tance of learners constructing conceptual interpretations of system behavior has been pointed out many times (<b>Mettes</b> and Roossink [1981], Elio and Sharf [1990], Ploetzner and Spada [1998], Frederiksen and White [2002]). Modeling envi-ronments can thus make {{a significant contribution to}} the improvement of science education. A new class of knowledge construction tools is emerging that uses logic-based (symbolic, nonnumeric) representations for expressing conceptual systems knowledge (Forbus et al. 2005, Leelawong and Biswas 2008, Bredeweg et al. 2009). Dif-ferent from the numeric-based tools (Richmond and Peter-son 1992, Pratap 2009), these tools employ a qualitative vocabulary (Forbus 2008) for users to construct their expla-nation of phenomena, notably about systems and how they behave. The use of graphical interfaces has improved usabil-ity (Bouwer and Bredeweg 2010), and the tools are becoming more common in education (Forbus et al. 2004, Kinnebrew and Biswas 2011), and professional practice (Bredeweg and Salles 2009). The DynaLearn interactive learning environment (ILE) can be regarded as a member of this new class of tools. Its devel-opment is directly motivated by specific needs from the edu...|$|R
2500|$|Today, Soka Gakkai {{is rarely}} criticized in {{mainstream}} news media. Ikeda occasionally contributes editorials to major newspapers, which also print reports on Gakkai business. Since the Komeito Party joined the ruling government coalition in 1999, widespread criticism {{by the media}} of the Soka Gakkai has abated and the Soka Gakkai is gaining acceptance {{as part of the}} Japanese mainstream. There has been a [...] "fractured view" [...] of the Soka Gakkai in Japan. On the one hand it is seen as a politically and socially engaged movement; on the other, it is still viewed with suspicion by some Japanese. James R. Lewis claims the Soka Gakkai's perception has suffered from sensationalist and often irresponsible treatment by the media even though the group has matured into a responsible member of society. Other scholars reject the cult label. Some scholars who utilize the Bryan R. Wilson typology of newly emerging denominations categorize it as [...] "gnostic-manipulationist", a category of teachings holding that the world can improve as people master the right means and techniques to overcome their problems. [...] According to Anne <b>Mette</b> Fisker-Nielsen, [...] "Soka Gakkai's relentless, but highly successful, proselytizing in the 1950s stirred up fear in wider society. Soka Gakkai was portrayed by the mass media as aggressive even violent– although it is difficult to find evidence." [...] Throughout the 1950s, the Soka Gakkai was a relatively radical movement that remained outside mainstream Japanese society, but since the foundation of the Komeito in the 1960s, it has considerably moderated its activities and has become a very mainstream movement, especially after the Komeito joined the coalition government in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|In 1961, a Danish {{ophthalmologist}} named <b>Mette</b> Warburg reported about a Danish {{family that}} showed seven cases of a hereditary degenerative disease throughout seven generations. The first {{member of the}} family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating. The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass. [...] Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of retinoblastoma, a cancerous tumor on the retina. A histologic examination showed a hemorrhagic necrotic mass in the posterior chamber, surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) glial tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, hyperplasia of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment epithelium, hypoplasia and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and phthisis bulbi. This means his eye was removed because the physician suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells already began to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well. She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, Gordon Norrie (1855–1941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.|$|E
2500|$|Europe {{entered an}} arms race to build ever larger {{artillery}} pieces. Burgundy's guns continued to develop, {{and in the same}} year that Odruik fell, Philip's smith constructed a gun capable of shooting balls weighing 200 kilograms. In 1382 an [...] "incredibly huge bombard" [...] was aimed at Oudenaarde, its muzzle 60 inches around and 20 inches in diameter. One observer described it thus, [...] "One could hear it for five leagues in the daytime, and ten leagues at night, and it made such a huge noise that … it seemed as though all the demons of hell were present." [...] By the early 15th century both French and English armies were equipped with larger pieces known as bombards, weighing up to 5 tons (4,535kg) and firing balls weighing up to 300lbs (136kg). In 1404 a cannon was created with the inscription, [...] "I am named Katrin. Beware of what I hold. I punish injustice." [...] In 1411 the cast iron cannon Faule <b>Mette</b> was created, and it was capable of shooting stone balls weighing 400 kilograms, but didn't very often. The artillery trains used by Henry V of England in the 1415 Siege of Harfleur and 1419 Siege of Rouen proved effective in breaching French fortifications, while artillery contributed to the victories of French forces under Joan of Arc in the Loire Campaign (1429). It wasn't just the English blasting their way through France either. Burgundy started by battering down the walls of Vellexon in 1409 and in 1411 they took Ham with only three shots from their bombard Griette. France eventually came around under the reforms of King Charles V (1422-1461), whose leadership made France the premier artillery force in Europe, and won the Hundred Years' War. Gun developments in France would prove extremely effective during the Italian wars of the 1490s. In 1431 a wrought-iron cannon was forged, weighing over 12,000 kilograms and could fire projectiles of 300 kilograms. It was called the Dulle Griet. These weapons were transformational for European warfare. A hundred years earlier the Frenchman Pierre Dubois wrote that a [...] "castle can hardly be taken within a year, and even if it does fall, it means more expenses for the king's purse and for his subjects than the conquest is worth," [...] but by the 15th century European walls fell with the utmost regularity.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} {{parts of}} this series [Mettes et al. (2004). Acta Cryst. A 60, 621 - 636; McClurg & Keith (2010). Acta Cryst. A 66, 38 - 49] a method for constructing global phase diagrams (GPDs) for molecular crystals was developed and the method was applied to single-component ordered crystal structures of tetrahedral molecules. GPDs are useful for visualizing what types of crystal structures a given molecule may assume depending on molecular form/interaction. Their construction uses group-theoretical methods which enumerate all possible symmetry breakings during a statistical mechanical high-to-low temperature search. In this work these results are expanded upon by outlining a method to determine a sufficiently rich parameter space to represent the experimentally observed crystal structures in a data set derived from the Cambridge Structural Database. This is significant because previous work (<b>Mettes</b> et al., 2004) did not specify the number of parameters needed for GPDs. Although there are suggestions in the literature that thousands of parameters are required to adequately describe tetrahedral molecule intermolecular potentials, {{it is found that}} 15 parameters are sufficient to represent the structures of the test data. The origin of this difference and its implications for determining GPD parameter values from a more detailed intermolecular potential and for interpreting GPD parameter values are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In an 8 December 1892 {{letter to}} his wife, Gauguin gives {{translations}} of the Tahitian titles of the paintings he intends to send. He stresses this is for <b>Mette's</b> eyes only, {{so that she can}} provide them for those who ask for them. He fixes a price of at least 1,500 francs for the painting, and goes on to describe it as follows:I painted a nude of a young girl. In this position she {{is on the verge of}} being indecent. But I want it that way: the lines and movement are interesting to me. And so, I give her, in depicting the head, a bit of a fright. It is necessary to justify this fright if not to explain it because it is in the character of a Maori person. Traditionally these people have a great fear of the spirits of the dead. One of our own young girls Europe would be frightened to be caught in this position. (The women here would not.) I have to explain this fright with the least possible literary means as was done formerly. So I did this. General harmony, somber, sad, frightening, telling in the eye like a funeral knell. Violet, somber blue, and orange-yellow. I make the linen greenish-yellow: 1 because the linen of this savage is a different linen than ours (beaten tree bark); 2 because it creates, suggests artificial light (the Kanaka woman never sleeps in darkness) and yet I don't want the effect of a lamp (it is common); 3 this yellow linking the orange-yellow and the blue completes the musical harmony. There are several flowers in the background, but they should not be real, being imaginative, I make them resemble sparks. For the Kanaka, the phosphorescences of the night are from the spirit of the dead, they believe they are there and fear them. Finally, to end, I make the ghost quite simply, a little old woman; because the young girl, unacquainted with the spirits of the French stage, could not visualise death except in the form of a person like herself. There you have the script that will prepare you for the critics when they bombard you with their malicious questions. To conclude, the painting had to be made very simple, the motif being savage, childlike ...|$|R
