40|$|This is {{a chapter}} from the book, Moments of Truth: The Politics of Financial Crises in Comparative Perspective [© Routledge]. The recent {{financial}} and subsequent sovereign debt crisis caused {{shock and awe}} in Greek politics. For {{the first time since}} the restoration of democracy in 1974, Greece entered a period of prolonged recession from 2008 onwards. After signing up to the Troika (European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund) bail-out in 2010, the recession intensified and was coupled with significant and widespread cuts in public spending and benefits along with big tax rises. Greece also had to implement a series of unpopular labour market and welfare reforms, restructure its state apparatus and proceed with <b>mass</b> scale <b>privatisations.</b> This economic and policy shift affected Greek politics immensely. The immediate impact of the crisis was a dramatic rise in protests, strikes and public discontent. The long-term impact seems to be the extensive reconfiguration of the post- 1974 political system: in the June 2012 elections Greece’s two major parties witnessed a dramatic decline in their vote share, while - for the first time in Greek history - extreme-left and extreme-right parties’ popularity rose considerably...|$|R
40|$|This study {{surveys the}} {{academic}} and professional literature examining the privatisation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), {{with a focus on}} empirical studies. Privatisation has been instrumental in reducing state ownership in many countries and had a transforming effect on global stock markets, although the role of SOEs in many other countries is similar to what it was two decades ago. Countries have adopted large-scale privatisation programs primarily for two reasons: first, the conclusive evidence that privately-owned firms outperform SOEs and, second, the empirical evidence clearly shows that privatisation significantly (often dramatically) improves the operating and financial performance of divested firms. Governments can also raise significant revenues by selling SOEs. While the choice between privatisation via public share offering versus through asset sales is still imperfectly understood, factors such as firm size, government fiscal condition, and the state of national economic development are important influences. Further, those countries which have chosen the <b>mass</b> (voucher) <b>privatisation</b> route have done so largely out of necessity [...] and face ongoing efficiency problems as a result. Governments have great discretion in pricing the SOEs they sell, especially those being sold via public share offering, and they use this discretion to pursue political and economic ends. Finally, investors who purchase the shares of firms being privatised earn significantly positive excess returns both in the short-run (due to deliberate underpricing of share issues by the government) and over one, three, and five-year investment horizons.

40|$|Initial {{ownership}} structures {{resulting from}} the <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation</b> programme were intended as transitional, whereas optimal would be set up gradually and would result from secondary transactions. Therefore, <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation</b> is typically considered successful if secondary transactions lead to improved ownership, in particular, with emergence of strategic investors. If this approach is correct, positive effects of <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation</b> are thus not shown only by companies remaining in control of initial owners but mostly by the companies that have already gone through secondary privatisation. Accordingly, the success of secondary sales is to be evaluated by how successfully companies perform after the sale to new owners. This paper attempts to verify empirically those assumptions. The econometric analysis of panel data, after correcting for a selection bias, shows that TFP (total factor productivity) growth is highest in public companies. In addition {{we found that the}} secondary privatisation has had practically no positive effect on economic efficiency in the period 1995 - 99.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} using routine data identified rapid <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation</b> {{as an important}} driver of mortality crisis following the collapse of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe. However, existing studies on the mortality crisis relying on individual level or routine data cannot assess both distal (societal) and proximal (individual) causes of mortality simultaneously. The aim of the PrivMort Project is to overcome these limitations and to investigate the role of societal factors (particularly rapid <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation)</b> and individual-level factors (e. g. alcohol consumption) in the mortality changes in post-communist countries. Methods The PrivMort conducts large-sample surveys in Russia, Belarus and Hungary. The approach is unique in comparing towns that have undergone rapid privatisation of their key industrial enterprises with those that experienced more gradual forms of privatisation, employing a multi-level retrospective cohort design that combines data on the industrial characteristics of the towns, socio-economic descriptions of the communities, settlement-level data, individual socio-economic characteristics, and individuals’ health behaviour. It then incorporates data on mortality {{of different types of}} relatives of survey respondents, employing a retrospective demographic approach, which enables linkage of historical patterns of mortality to exposures, based on experiences of family members. By May 2016, 63, 073 respondents provided information on themselves and 205, 607 relatives, of whom 102, 971 had died.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} some of {{the results}} of a survey of ownership sructure. The survey uses the classic tradition in the treatment of the problem,stating that the means for effective control on the management of the enterprise are determined by the scale and the distribution of the shareholders’ participation in its capital. Later on this was used as a basis {{for the development of a}} methodological approach for practical surveys by authors like Cubbin & Leech (1983) and (Zeitlin 1974), and John Scott (1991. On the basis of this approach the main concepts for majority-minority control and the whole scale of derivative forms (mechanisms) such as the presence/absence of majority shareholder, the presence/absence of a second strong shareholder or group of shareholders in the capital of a company, the correlation between the capital in the hands of the biggest (the leading) shareholder and the others, and finally the general structure of shareholders’ participation are drawn. All of these determine the classification of one or another form of corporate control. The whole entity of specific forms of corporate control defines the structure of corporate control in a given country. Those criteria, taken not only in their temporal development, but in their national specifics, are analyzed in detail in the report. This focus of the report is predetermined not only by the scale and the influence of <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation,</b> but by the fact that initial dispersion of property was present in the <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation,</b> unlike all the other forms which in Bulgaria were based on direct techniques for transfer of property in the hands of one buyer.

Privatisation and Transition in Albania 2 This paper considers the privatisation policy {{and its role in}} the transition to a market economy in Albania. The disintegration of the old regime took place over a much longer time than in other Central and East European countries, resulting in chaos and a political vacuum in which no systematic or effective policy could be formulated. The new government, committed to fundamental reforms necessary for a market economy, did not take power until after the second general election in March 1992. One outcome of this long pre-transition period was that the privatisation programme had to evolve gradually in the course of transformation, without ever having been planned in a comprehensive and integrated manner.

Although the programme covered only 512 companies the collected evidence provides a unique opportunity to compare the Polish MPP to the schemes implemented in other post-socialist economies of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia as well as to other privatisation methods applied in Poland. The Polish MPP created intermediaries in the form of National Investment Funds (NIF), which were granted the leading and minor status in the ownership of their portfolio companies. The clear ownership and the incentive structure appeared to be important mechanisms that helped minimse the control vacuum and stimulated restructuring and privatisation of the portfolio companies.

40|$|The Polish <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation</b> {{programme}} (MPP), though debated {{at length}} {{in the early}} phase of tra nsition, was implemented with a long delay {{which led to the}} deterioration of the financial position of many of the companies in the scheme and the loss of, at least, some of the potential benefits of such schemes. The most important lesson of the programme for other countries is that <b>mass</b> <b>privatisation</b> should be implemented quickly in order to avoid uncertainty and to prevent opportunistic behaviour by the managers. The Polish MPP involved the selection of 512 medium and l arge enterprises and the allocation of 60 % of their shares to 15 National Investment Funds (NIFs) to act as the dominant owner of these enterprises and as intermediaries between the citizens and enterprises. The ownership of NIFs was transferred to the adult population through a universal share certificate (PSU) which was later converted to a share in each of the 15 NIFs. By giving NIFs the majority control on the supervisory boards of mass privatised companies, and by linking the funds income and fund managers remuneration, to the performance of their companies, the programme ensured that the corporate governance (and the associated principal-agent problems) at the company level are ameliorated to a large extent. Our investigations show that most NIFs have taken their l ead position in the MPP seriously and embarked on the restructuring of their portfolio companies and brought about major changes in the management structure, output bundle, input combinations and methods of production. Overmanning has been reduced, non-productive assets and spare capacity disposed of, many companies have been floated on the stock market or sold to strategic investors, and some of the loss making enterprises liquidated or entered the bankruptcy process. The performance of funds in their first two years of public trading, however, has been rather disappointing. Despite improvements in profitability (or reductions in losses) and labour productivity of portfolio companies, the net asset values of most NIFs has not kept up with inflation. Moreover, share prices have been on a general decline in this period. Indeed the conversion of PSUs to shares has resulted in a loss for their owners. All funds are traded with a large discount - a gap between their net asset value per share and their share prices. Our investigations indicate that this discount varies inversely with size and the share of assets tied up in minority companies. The existence of a fund management company, whether it is controlled by Polish or foreign financial institutions, seems to have an insignificant effect on the discount. The corporate governa nce at the fund level remains a problem and an effective system is still not developed.
