50|$|The {{performances}} {{of these two}} prostheses were compared with a box-and-blocks test, where the patient was allowed 2 minutes to move one-inch cubes from one box to another, over a short wall. The result was quantified {{by the total number}} of blocks moved. To test the terminal device (“hand”), elbow and wrist rotator, the patient was administered a clothes-pin test, where he was asked to pick up clothes pins from a horizontal bar, rotate them, then put them on a higher vertical bar. The time used to <b>move</b> <b>3</b> clothes-pins was recorded. Both tests were repeated 3 times. The quantified results showed that the myoelectric prosthesis performed 246% better (moved 2.46 times more blocks) in box-and-blocks test, and 26.3% better (used 26.3% less time in moving clothes pins) in clothes-pin test.|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} Phase 10 Twist {{is to be}} the first player to {{complete}} phase 10 by moving around the game board. Every player starts with their pawn on phase 1 on the game board. They must complete phase 1 in order to move their pawn. There are three pawn movements; <b>move</b> <b>3</b> spaces if you complete the phase and discard all of your cards, move 2 spaces if you complete the phase but do not discard all of your cards, or move 1 space if you don't complete the phase. If you land on a twist phase you can decide to play a twist phase or one of the phases {{on either side of the}} twist phase space. If you play a twist phase the pawn movements change to 6 spaces if you complete the phase and discard all of your cards, 4 if you complete the phase but do not discard all of your cards, or move back one space if you do not complete the phase.|$|E
50|$|Rules govern {{which leads}} are possible. Players must lead as follows, {{in order of}} priority: 1) If the lead player has a {{continuous}} series of winning cards in a suit, then this sequence must be led, {{with the exception of}} the last card in the sequence which is kept for later. 2) The next possibility is a move called 'deni'. This is possible when a player lacks the hukm in a given suit, but has the second highest outstanding card. In this case the player may lead a low card in that suit, and call for the hukm. The opponent with the hukm then wins the trick but the player that made the 'deni' move retains the lead, which is the advantage of making this move. If the player with the hukm also holds the third highest card in the suit, he may play this card as well, and it is said that the deni is doubled. In this case everyone plays a second card and the player with the hukm wins two tricks. However the lead still returns to the player who made the deni <b>move.</b> <b>3)</b> When a leader cannot make either of the two leads described above, he then leads out any remaining hukm cards, all at once, a move called 'utari'. In McLeod's account this is the only option available to a player at this stage, so a player would need to lead any hukms they might have, and then pass the lead as described next in step 4. However in the rules given by Wilkins there is a second option, whereby the player can instead simply lead a low card or non-winning card of his choosing to pass the lead. 4) If a player has no further valid options for leading cards, he gives up the lead by shuffling his hand, and placing the cards face down. The player to his right then selects the card that he must lead, for example by saying 'fourth from the top' or pointing to a card if they are spread out. The lead then passes to the player who wins the trick, who then follows the same sequence of possible leads as described above.|$|E
