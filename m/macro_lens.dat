500|$|The album {{title is}} Cockney rhyming slang for [...] "I should think so". The front {{cover of the}} album is a {{painting}} based on three separate photos of Coombes, Goffey, and Quinn. The portraits of Coombes and Goffey were taken by Quinn {{in the summer of}} 1994 when he was experimenting with a <b>macro</b> <b>lens.</b> The photo of Quinn was taken that same year by a friend, while they were on tour in Wolverhampton. The painting was then created by the Moody Painters who were based on Oxford's Cowley Road. The white band at the top was inspired by an old Donovan record that Quinn owned and is an homage to old 1950s and 1960s records, with the stereo-mono signs. The photo {{on the back of the}} album was taken at a club in London about five minutes after they came off stage. The photo consists of two separate shots grafted together because Quinn was [...] "pulling a disgusting face in the original". All of these elements were then put together by Nick Bax of The Designers Republic to create the finished sleeve. The Bonus 7" [...] featured a more kaleidoscope-style front cover.|$|E

5000|$|... "Macro" [...] lenses {{specifically}} designed for close-up work, with a long barrel for close focusing and optimized for high reproduction ratios, {{are one of the}} most common tools for macro photography. (Unlike most other lens makers, Nikon designates its <b>macro</b> <b>lenses</b> as [...] "Micro" [...] because of their original use in making microform.) Most modern <b>macro</b> <b>lenses</b> can focus continuously to infinity as well and can provide excellent optical quality for normal photography. True <b>macro</b> <b>lenses,</b> such as the Canon MP-E 65 mm f/2.8 or Minolta AF 3x-1x 1.7-2.8 Macro, can achieve higher magnification than life size, enabling photography of the structure of small insect eyes, snowflakes, and other minuscule objects. Others, such as the Infinity Photo-Optical's TS-160 can achieve magnifications from 0-18x on sensor, focusing from infinity down to 18 mm from the object.|$|R

The other Canon FD <b>macro</b> <b>lenses</b> achieve only a 1:2 (half life size) magnification without extension tubes and require the lens {{to be closer to}} the subject; on the other hand, the 200 mm's shallower depth of field at equivalent aperture settings can be limiting.|$|R

50|$|With <b>macro</b> <b>lenses,</b> the {{distortion}} caused by refraction {{is not a}} problem, so normally a simple flat glass port is used. Refraction increases the magnification of a macro lens; this is considered a benefit to photographers {{who are trying to}} capture very small subjects.|$|R
50|$|Focusing is internal, so {{polarizing}} filters {{can be used}} consistently. The 46mm thread lets a Micro Four Thirds user share filters between it, the Panasonic 14mm, Panasonic Lumix 20mm, Panasonic Leica 45mm, Panasonic 45-175mm, Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 12mm f/2 and Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 60mm f/2.8 <b>Macro</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Macro</b> <b>lenses</b> are {{designed}} for extreme closeup work. Such lenses are popular for nature shooting such as small flowers, {{as well as for}} many technical applications. As most of these lenses can also focus to infinity and tend to be quite sharp, many are used as general-purpose optics.|$|R
