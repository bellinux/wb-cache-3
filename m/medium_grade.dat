500|$|The {{indigenous}} communities of Taiwan are closely linked with ecological awareness and conservation {{issues on the}} island, {{as many of the}} environmental issues are spearheaded by aborigines. Political activism and sizable public protests regarding the logging of the Chilan Formosan Cypress, as well as efforts by an Atayal member of the Legislative Yuan, [...] "focused debate on natural resource management and specifically on the involvement of aboriginal people therein". Another high-profile case is the nuclear waste storage facility on Orchid Island, a small tropical island [...] off the southeast coast of Taiwan. The inhabitants are the 4,000 members of the Tao (or Yami). In the 1970s the island was designated as a possible site to store low and <b>medium</b> <b>grade</b> nuclear waste. The island was selected {{on the grounds that it}} would be cheaper to build the necessary infrastructure for storage and it was thought that the population would not cause trouble. Large-scale construction began in 1978 on a site [...] from the Immorod fishing fields. The Tao alleges that government sources at the time described the site as a [...] "factory" [...] or a [...] "fish cannery", intended to bring [...] "jobs [...] home of the Tao/Yami, one of the least economically integrated areas in Taiwan". When the facility was completed in 1982, however, it was in fact a storage facility for [...] "97,000 barrels of low-radiation nuclear waste from Taiwan's three nuclear power plants". The Tao have since stood at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement and launched several exorcisms and protests to remove the waste they claim has resulted in deaths and sickness. The lease on the land has expired, and an alternative site has yet to be selected.|$|E

50|$|The macabre {{constant}} is {{a theoretical}} {{explanation of the}} supposedly prevalent fact (particularly in the French educational system) {{that there is a}} constant percentage of poor <b>grades,</b> of <b>medium</b> <b>grades</b> and of high grades in the educational system, no matter the actual academic level of the students and their proficiency at the knowledge and skills actually required. It should be noted that this concept does not apply only to elite courses (even if it is more prevalent in these courses), but also to general education and at all levels of education. This results in the socially relative selection of students, instead of an absolute, objective selection relative to the level of knowledge required. This phenomenon can form {{a large part of the}} cause of the distress and scholar disengagement for many students facing those issues, and thus it could be one of the main causes of educational failure.|$|R
