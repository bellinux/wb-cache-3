40|$|Measurement {{of water}} content in {{oil-water}} mixing flow was restricted by special {{problems such as}} narrow measuring range and low accuracy. A simulated multi-sensor measurement system in the laboratory was established, {{and the influence of}} multi-factor such as temperature, and salinity content on the measurement was investigated by numerical simulation combined with experimental test. A soft measurement model based on rough set-support vector machine (RS-SVM) classifier and genetic algorithm-neural network (GA-NN) predictors was reported in this paper. Investigation results indicate that RS-SVM classifier effectively realized the pattern identification for water holdup states via fuzzy reasoning and self-learning, and GA-NN predictors are capable of subsection forecasting water content in the different water holdup patterns, as well as adjusting the model parameters adaptively in terms of online measuring range.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this dissertation research is to use reflected-light image analysis to measure brightness of standard samples of conifer rings and then use brightness in dendrochronological research {{as a substitute for}} density. I developed an imaging system that ensures identical configuration of all components and measuring steps for all rings of a sample so that subsequent comparison of brightness between rings would be valid. From a mesic New England tree-ring site, I <b>measured</b> <b>ring</b> brightness of cores that had been previously measured using X-ray densitometry. Latewood brightness and density both correlate with April-May temperature such that they reconstruct that climate variable equally well. From a semiarid Southwest tree-ring site, I <b>measured</b> <b>ring</b> brightness of cores with severe extraneous color [...] mostly due to heartwood-sapwood color differences. Bleaching and organic extraction of cores did not overcome the problem of extraneous color, but autoregressively modeling brightness index series did. Various brightness and width variables combined to model July-October precipitation, a climate variable not usually reconstructed by Southwest tree-ring sites. From a stand of trees affected by a past earthquake, I <b>measured</b> <b>ring</b> brightness of one tree that responded to surface deformation with an apparent change in latewood density. Absolute latewood brightness did not change per se after the earthquake, but the amount of latewood relative to the total ring increased dramatically. Although technical and paleoenvironmental issues remain for future research, this study indicates that reflected-light image analysis is an excellent tool in dendrochronological research for increasing our understanding paleoenvironmental processes of the latest Holocene. The secondary {{objective of this}} dissertation research is to demonstrate a method for identifying low-frequency variation of tree-ring chronologies and/or past climate as reconstructed using tree-rings. This method provides confidence intervals with which to judge the significance or importance of low-frequency departures in tree-ring data as well as a visual basis for determining whether or not low-frequency variation is robustly estimated. This method is a re-ordering of the individual steps commonly used in constructing tree-ring chronologies or reconstructions...|$|R

40|$|SummaryCytokinesis {{involves}} constriction of a contractile actomyosin ring. The mechanisms generating ring {{tension and}} setting the constriction rate remain unknown because {{the organization of the}} ring is poorly characterized, its tension was rarely measured, and constriction is coupled to other processes. To isolate ring mechanisms, we studied fission yeast protoplasts, in which constriction occurs without the cell wall. Exploiting the absence of cell wall and actin cortex, we <b>measured</b> <b>ring</b> tension and imaged ring organization, which was dynamic and disordered. Computer simulations based on the amounts and biochemical properties of the key proteins showed that they spontaneously self-organize into a tension-generating bundle. Together with rapid component turnover, the self-organization mechanism continuously reassembles and remodels the constricting ring. Ring constriction depended on cell shape, revealing that the ring operates close to conditions of isometric tension. Thus, the fission yeast ring sets its own tension, but other processes set the constriction rate...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{circuit design}} needs {{efficient}} methods to characterize and model circuit variation {{in order to}} obtain high-yielding integrated circuits. Circuit and mask designers need accurate guidelines to prevent failures due to layout-induced variation. This thesis addresses this need by contributing a variation test chip and variation analysis methods. The test chip consists of carefully designed ring oscillator circuits which are made sensitive {{to some of the most}} common and critical layout-dependent variations; analysis of the ring oscillator output frequencies enables assessment of variation impact at both the device (FEOL) level and interconnect (BEOL) level. FEOL variations studied are density vs. isolation, polysilicon fingers proximity, global polysilicon density, orientation and others. BEOL variations studied include parasitic coupling, fringing and planar capacitance, among others.

The investigated molecules differed {{in the number of}} hydroxyl groups attached to the polyphenolic benzo-γ-pyrone compounds. To {{investigate the}} relation between hydrophobicity and membrane localization/orientation, we have applied 1 H magic angle spinning NMR techniques <b>measuring</b> <b>ring</b> current induced chemical shift changes, nuclear Overhauser enhancement cross-relaxation rates, and lateral diffusion coefficients. All investigated flavonoids show a broad distribution along the membrane normal with a maximum in the lipid/water interface. With increasing number of hydroxyl groups, the maximum of this distribution is biased towards the lipid headgroups. These results are confirmed by pulsed field gradient NMR measurements of the lateral diffusion coefficients of phospholipids and flavonoids, respectively. From the localization of different flavonoid protons in the membrane, a model for the orientation of the molecules in a lipid bilayer can be deduced. This orientation depends on the position of the polar center of the flavonoid molecule...|$|R

Local anesthetics (LA) inhibit signaling of TXA(2) receptors expressed in cell models.

Rings (3 -mm length) of the rat thoracic aorta were mounted in organ baths and isometric contractile force was <b>measured.</b> <b>Rings,</b> with or without endothelium, were incubated for 60 min in bupivacaine (10 (- 6) or 10 (- 5) M) or Krebs-Henseleit solution (control group) and subsequently exposed to cumulative concentrations of U 46619 (10 (- 10) to 10 (- 6) M). The reversibility of the TXA(2) -induced vasoconstriction by bupivacaine was also studied. Pretreatment of rings with bupivacaine concentration-dependently diminished TXA(2) -induced contraction in rat aortic rings. We found no significant differences in relaxing effect of bupivacaine between rings with and without endothelium. Contraction in rings established with U 46619 could not be reversed by cumulative concentrations of bupivacaine. Bupivacaine inhibited carbachol-induced vascular relaxation.

Ring width was observed {{to be related}} to precipitation and relative humidity but not significantly to temperature. δ 13 C and δ 18 O were significantly related to all studied climatic variables, most strongly to cloud cover. Var-iations in δ 2 H were discovered to be complex combinations of signals from biochemical and physical processes. The re-sults suggest that oaks in Finland {{can be used as a}} source of climate information. δ 18 O was discovered to be especially promising as it showed the strongest climate signal and high-est common signal between trees. The relationship between climate and ring width indicates that water availability is the main control of ring radial growth. This is supported by the isotope data. High correlation between δ 13 C and δ 18 O time series indicates that photosynthetic carbon assimilation is limited by stomatal control. Therefore, in contrast to the expected temperature limitation, our data indicate that drought limits oak growth more than cold temperatures on the border of its northernmost distribution range...|$|R
