40|$|Abstract Background <b>Mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> with {{a robotic}} device is a {{candidate}} technique for teaching people desired movement patterns during motor rehabilitation, surgery, and sports training, but {{it is unclear how}} effective this approach is as compared to visual demonstration alone. Further, little is known about motor learning and retention involved with either robot-mediated <b>mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> or visual demonstration alone. Methods Healthy subjects (n = 20) attempted to reproduce a novel three-dimensional path after practicing it with <b>mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> from a robot. Subjects viewed their arm as the robot guided it, so this "haptic guidance" training condition provided both somatosensory and visual input. Learning was compared to reproducing the movement following only visual observation of the robot moving along the path, with the hand in the lap (the "visual demonstration" training condition). Retention was assessed periodically by instructing the subjects to reproduce the path without robotic demonstration. Results Subjects improved in ability to reproduce the path following practice in the haptic guidance or visual demonstration training conditions, as evidenced by a 30 – 40 % decrease in spatial error across 126 movement attempts in each condition. Performance gains were not significantly different between the two techniques, but there was a nearly significant trend for the visual demonstration condition to be better than the haptic guidance condition (p = 0. 09). The 95 % confidence interval of the mean difference between the techniques was at most 25 % of the absolute error in the last cycle. When asked to reproduce the path repeatedly following either training condition, the subjects' performance degraded significantly {{over the course of a}} few trials. The tracing errors were not random, but instead were consistent with a systematic evolution toward another path, as if being drawn to an "attractor path". Conclusion These results indicate that both forms of robotic demonstration can improve short-term performance of a novel desired path. The availability of both haptic and visual input during the haptic guidance condition did not significantly improve performance compared to visual input alone in the visual demonstration condition. Further, the motor system is inclined to repeat its previous mistakes following just a few movements without robotic demonstration, but these systematic errors can be reduced with periodic training. </p...|$|E

Our previous report has shown the effectiveness of phase-array intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) -guided transseptal puncture in patients with dilated left atrium undergoing PTMC. However, there are few reports comparing the new-generation mechanical versus phase-array ICE-guided transseptal puncture in PTMC. Methods: Between March 2007 and March 2008, 6 consecutive patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis with dilated left atrium (range, 4. 1 – 6. 1 cm) underwent transseptal puncture by <b>mechanical</b> ICE <b>guidance</b> in PTMC by the same experienced operator. The procedural, echocardiographic and clinical results were retrospectively retrieved and analyzed. In addition, phase-array ICE-guided transseptal cases (n = 7), which included consecutive cases from May to December 2008, were compared. Results: All 6 patients could have fossa ovalis visualized by ICE, {{and none of them}} had false transseptal puncture. Mechanical ICE provided a panoramic wider view of the interatrium septum, and offered better knowledge of the needle's geographic contact to the fossa ovalis than did the phase-array system. The fluoroscopic time of PTMC in the mechanical ICE-guided group (37 ± 9 minutes, n = 6) was similar (p = 0. 465) to that of phase-array guidance (31 ± 15 minutes, n = 7).

40|$|Reducing {{the amount}} of metal used within a timber {{structure}} has many advantages, particularly when dealing with connections. Fire resistance and durability are commonly cited benefits. In addition the use of alternative connector materials minimises thermal bridging and can also provide a lighter weight structural solution. Existing contemporary forms of non-metallic timber connections are commonly provided {{through the use of}} adhesives. However, these connections are reliant on a need for careful offsite, prefabricated construction. Traditional green oak carpentry connections provide a mechanically fastened non-metallic solution. However, carpentry connections are not widely compatible with contemporary architectural design or with the use of modern engineered timber products such as glulam. Building upon research completed at the University of Bath, the aim of this thesis was to develop a mechanical, non-metallic connection system suitable for contemporary applications. Specific objectives were to investigate the structural performance of a defined connection system and to develop analysis methods to facilitate design. A review of the literature demonstrated a lack of uptake and use of <b>mechanical</b> non-metallic connections. <b>Guidance</b> for the design of mechanical fasteners reflects the lack of innovation and research into the use of non-metallic materials. Following an initial experimental investigation of non-metallic materials, an experimental testing programme was completed to investigate the use of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) dowels in conjunction with densified veneer wood (DVW) plates. The findings of the experimental study demonstrate that the use of these materials can provide a robust connection system for contemporary applications. The results of the experimental work provide guidance on dowel spacing requirements, connection response to load and connection failure modes. The failure modes of the proposed connection system were shown to be unique to the materials used and specific strength analysis methods have been developed to predict connection yield and ultimate strength.

This thesis explores optogenetic neural stimulation as a means to control neurite growth that promises greater cell-type specificity than commonly used electrical stimulation. Using dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) expressing channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR 2) as a test system, I have investigated a broad range of optical stimulation parameters and identified conditions that enhance neurite outgrowth by three-fold as compared to unstimulated controls or wild-type DRGs lacking ChR 2. I have also found that optogenetic stimulation of ChR 2 expressing DRGs induces directional outgrowth in WT DRGs co-cultured within a 10 mm vicinity of the optically sensitive ganglia. The observed directional increase of neurite growth was correlated to an increased expression of neural growth and brain derived neurotrophic factors (NGF, BDNF). Finally, experiments performed with DRGs seeded within the <b>mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> channels showed that simultaneous optical and topographic stimulation act synergistically to increase nerve regeneration rate.

40|$|Abstract. The {{economies of}} scale enable large farming {{operations}} to adopt GPS guidance technologies with sub-inch accuracy capabilities for multiple pass operations. For small to intermediate-size vegetable growers, precision guidance technologies are usually considered too expensive and are rarely utilized. A low-cost <b>mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> system could be particularly beneficial for smaller-scale vegetable farms with limited labor pools because it can free up the driver for other operations requiring manual input such as transplanting, thinning, harvesting, etc. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a mechanical furrow-following system suitable for smaller-scale vegetable production and to assess its accuracy over multiple passes to determine whether it could achieve accuracy and precision similar to that of much more expensive GPS guidance systems. To assess the accuracy of the system, a GPS receiver was mounted on the frame of an existing wide-stance three-wheeled machine to precisely record machine position as it was used to carry out work on fixed beds. Guidance furrows were created by the narrow front wheels of the machine when it was initially manually driven in freshly-tilled soil. GPS data from the initial pass on each row was recorded and used as a baseline that all subsequent passes were compared to. Results show that it is possible to achieve high levels of accuracy (1. 3 in.

40|$|Linear drives provide {{many new}} {{attractive}} {{solutions for the}} material transportation and processing in the manufacturing industry. With no mechanical transmission elements, they enable high dynamics and rigidity as well as low installation- and low maintenance-costs. That performance can give the linear motor system a better precision, a higher acceleration and a higher speed of the moving part. Therefore, the material transportation and processing using linear motors is studied and applied increasingly in manufacturing industry. For these applications, the linear motor is typically with stationary long primary and a short moving secondary. As the secondary part is passive, no energy transmission is required between the moving and stationary part, avoiding the use of brushes or inductive transmission. The motor type best suited for the mentioned applications is the synchronous one with permanent magnets, because of its higher efficiency, compactness, but most important because it allows a higher air-gap. In the usual approach, the linear motor is only used for thrust force production. The guidance is usually implemented by a mechanical assembly. The guidance constrains the movement to the longitudinal displacement, fixing the lateral and vertical displacement: yaw, roll and pitch. To achieve the necessary precision of the movement, accurate <b>mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> is required. Such the mechanical assembly can be complex and source of high friction. In this dissertation, a research of an active guiding system is presented. The purpose {{of this research is}} finding out a solution for the material transportation and processing applications. The target is a linear drive system, which can reduce the complicated mechanical structure. In additions, the passive vehicle is also necessary. The result of the research is PM-synchronous linear motors with long and double-sided primaries. In the system, the lateral displacement and the yaw angle are controlled while a simple wheel-rail system fixes the vertical displacement. This combination of the magnetic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> offers a good trade-off among the complexity of the control, actuators and mechanics, when considering industrial applications. To allow multiple vehicles traveling simultaneously and independently on the guide-way (each vehicle is controlled by an individual part of the guide-way), the double side primary is separated into segments. With that structure, flexible-operating methods can be implemented. That is very useful in process-integrated material handling where different speeds of material carriers in each processing station are necessary. Another advantage of segmented structure is the energy saving. The power is supplied only to the segment or the two consecutive segments in which the vehicle runs over. In one segment, each side of the primary is supplied by its own inverter, allowing the necessary degree of freedom to control the lateral position and the yaw angle in addition to the thrust control. In order to make the vehicle completely passive, a capacitive sensor is proposed and implemented to measure the lateral position and the yaw angle. The sensor has active parts installed on the guide-way and passive parts on the vehicle. The mathematical analysis and the finite element method (FEM) are used to analysis the proposed system. With the analysed results, the control for the system is investigated in detail. Hardware and software for the experimental system is developed and implemented. The analysed results and the experimental results validate the proposed system.

After fabrication, the 2 D electrode channel array is rolled into a 3 D channel bundle fitting the peripheral nerve. The efficiency with which axons enter the 2 D channel array was evaluated in vitro as a function of channel width, spacing and pitch. Axon outgrowth is maximised when micro-channels are wide (> 30 μm), and when the array transparency (the channel width to pitch ratio) is at least 50 %. To ensure the metallic electrodes remain functional in the rolled device, substrate thickness and micro-channel height must also be optimized to position the metal film in the neutral plane of the rolled structure. Electrodes embedded in the implant polyimide structure are robust to rolling. Their impedance at 1 kHz in Ringer solution is of the order of 1 MΩ on flat samples, and changes little when the same samples are rolled and inserted into 1. 5 mm inner diameter tube. Such 3 D, electrode channel devices on polymer not only provides a novel technological approach to physical guidance of regenerating neurons in vivo but also enables the fabrication of an electrode implant with direct electrical communication with multiple groups of nerve fibres in a regenerating peripheral nerve. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{development}} of the retinal projections {{to the roof of}} the midbrain was studied in Syrian hamsters after right superior colliculus (SC) lesions on the day of birth, using both autoradiogaphic and degeneration techniques. The dead tissue resulting from the heat lesion is not completely removed until the eighth day after birth. Normally the midline of the SC is defined by a pia-lined fissure separating the left and right colliculi, but in the animals with early unilateral lesions, the pia at the midline is damaged. When it regrows, together with vascular and other meningeal tissues, it forms a flat tissue bridge across the midline as early as two days after the lesion. When the axons from the left eye reach the right SC, they encounter the dead tissue and separate into two bundles. One bundle courses over the surface of the dead tissue and one grows underneath it. It is not until the third to fourth day that axons in the dorsal bundle cross the midline, via the tissue bridge, to terminate anomalously in the medial wall of the left SC. When the quantity of such recrossing axons is small, they overlap extensively with the optic tract fibers from the other (right) eye which normally have innervated the entire SC by day 3. However, it appears that as the density of the recrossing axons increases they displace the axons originating in the other eye from the medial wall of the left SC. Thus, eventually fibers from both eyes terminate in the left SC, occupying separate territories, with little, if any, overlap. Axons in the ventral bundle begin to innervate the deep layers of the right SC on day 2. These axons were never observed to recross the midline. These results indicate that <b>mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> and axonal segregation dependent on relative densities are two processes that govern the {{development of}} retinotectal projections after early SC lesions in hamsters. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerve repair {{outcomes}} have {{lagged behind}} comparable surgical techniques for many decades. A number of advanced approaches {{have been adopted}} over the last ten years. In particular the application of electrical stimulation during a repair is of great interest. It is clear that electrical stimulation of regenerating nerve tissue has a great many effects and can improve functional outcomes for patients. This work has focused on developing systems capable of applying accurate electric fields on the microscale within a biodegradable conduit, powered wirelessly. Experiments were conducted in vitro {{with a view to}} making progress towards an in vivo implementation. Electrical stimulation was applied to regenerating sensory neurons in vitro, from a rat dorsal root ganglion. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>guidance</b> cues aligned neurons towards different microelectrode configurations in order to record the effect of applied electrical stimulation. This was performed using custom stimulation modules. SU- 8 microgrooves and Ti/Au electrodes acted as mechanical and electrical cues respectively. This method was employed to great effect, identifying the effect of a number of electrical stimulation parameters. This led to a stimulation protocol featuring a 1 : 4 duty cycle, 20 mV amplitude, 100 Hz sinusoidal signal. This produced a number of interesting effects, including neuronal turning and a barrier formation. These results, demonstrated at the cellular level using a custom device and an autonomous stimulation system illustrates progress towards an optimised electrical stimulation waveform for neuronal growth control. A novel transfer printing process was developed to produce patterned gold films on the biodegradable polymer, polycaprolactone. Patterned Au, 400 nm thick, was transferred to a sheet of the polymer, producing a 15 turn, spiral inductor. The inductor was then electroplated to a thickness of 30 μm and wire-bonded. Power and data were transferred wirelessly to the receiver circuit. Receiver circuits, connected to stimulation test modules in planar form, delivered electrical stimulation waveforms to regenerating sensory neurons on polycaprolactone. This stimulation resulted in confinement of the cells between two pairs of electrodes, demonstrating the efficacy of the novel receiver circuits. This was achieved with four electrodes in a twin-barrier configuration. These results illustrate progress towards implantation in vivo, using remotely powered electronics to guide regenerating neurons to their targets with microelectrodes. Sensing cell growth through changes in electrical impedance is a well-documented technique. A receiver inductor has been connected to caco- 2 cells in culture. Power was transmitted to the receiver inductor through an inductive link. Changes in the cell-monolayer have been detected at the transmitter output circuit, showing that the impedance changes are of sufficient magnitude to be reflected to the transmitter. Trypsin or EDTA were added to confluent layers of caco- 2 cells, detaching them {{from the surface of the}} microchannel electrode array. This detachment was seen at the transmitter in the form of transient voltage changes. Data was acquired in using Labview programming and PXI hardware systems. This work illustrates progress towards biodegradable, passive cell sensing inspired by radio frequency identification technology, and electric cell impedance sensing...|$|E
