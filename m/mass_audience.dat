5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a <b>mass</b> <b>audience.</b> Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach {{of a large number}} of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E
5|$|Although he was successful, Ice later regretted his {{business}} arrangements with SBK, which had paid him {{to adopt a}} more commercial appearance {{to appeal to a}} <b>mass</b> <b>audience</b> and published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. After surviving a suicide attempt, Ice was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. While his later, less mainstream albums failed to chart or receive much radio airplay, Ice has had a loyal underground following. In 2009, Ice began hosting The Vanilla Ice Project on DIY Network. His latest album WTF – Wisdom, Tenacity & Focus was released in August 2011. Ice is currently signed to Psychopathic Records.|$|E

5|$|Strange Days was a {{commercial}} failure and almost derailed Bigelow's career, making {{little more than}} a sixth of its $42 million production cost. Upon release, the film polarized film critics; some reviewers praised its gritty atmosphere and the performances by Fiennes and Bassett, while others criticized it for failing to comment on its violence. Nevertheless, the film's critical standing has improved over the years, with many fans feeling that the film has been overlooked by a casual <b>mass</b> <b>audience</b> and misguided critics. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.|$|E
5|$|Fueled {{by events}} such as the Waco Siege in 1993, the murders and suicides {{associated}} with the Order of the Solar Temple, and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan, German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s, with Scientology attracting particular attention. Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young, an American ex-Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology, visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der Spiegel, a widely read weekly magazine, describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag – the Rehabilitation Project Force – for members of Scientology's Sea Org found guilty of transgressions. From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a <b>mass</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1934, he {{established}} the Institute of Archaeology {{as part of}} the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maidan Castle. During World War II, he re-joined the Armed Forces and rose to the rank of brigadier, serving in the North African Campaign and then the Allied invasion of Italy. In 1944 he was appointed Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, through which he oversaw excavations of sites at Harappa, Arikamedu, and Brahmagiri, and implemented reforms to the subcontinent's archaeological establishment. Returning to Britain in 1948, he divided his time between lecturing for the Institute of Archaeology and acting as archaeological adviser to Pakistan's government. In later life, his popular books, cruise ship lectures, and appearances on radio and television, particularly the BBC series Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?, helped to bring archaeology to a <b>mass</b> <b>audience.</b> Appointed Honorary Secretary of the British Academy, he raised large sums of money for archaeological projects, and was appointed British representative for several UNESCO projects.|$|E

25|$|Working {{simultaneously}} in theater and film, Fassbinder created his own style from {{a fusion of}} the two artforms. His ten early films are characterized by a self-conscious and assertive formalism. Influenced by Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Marie Straub and the theories of Bertolt Brecht, these films are austere and minimalist in style. Although praised by many critics, they proved too demanding and inaccessible for a <b>mass</b> <b>audience.</b> Fassbinder's rapid working methods had begun by this stage.|$|E

Academic experts discuss the impact of early innovators like Frank Conrad of station KDKA, Pittsburgh, who broadcasted from his garage; the power of personalities to influence <b>mass</b> <b>audiences,</b> citing FDR, Edward R.

25|$|The {{understanding}} {{of form and}} volume which informs his two-dimensional work finds further expression in an ongoing series of sculptural busts (many {{of which can be}} viewed at Grossman's portfolio website). Unlike most sculpture, they are not intended to be walked around, but are constructed to be photographed from a single point, under particular lighting, printed, and shown to a <b>mass</b> <b>audience.</b> Grossman sculpts these in red modeling clay, then brings a painterly {{understanding of}} color to their multi-hued veneers. Unlike his paintings, which may take on any subject, the sculptures have been primarily a medium for Grossman's caricatures.|$|E
25|$|His first book, The Immense Journey, was a {{collection}} of writings {{about the history of}} humanity, and it proved to be that rare science book that appealed to a <b>mass</b> <b>audience.</b> It has sold over a million copies and has been published in at least 16 languages. Besides being his first book, The Immense Journey was also Eiseley's most well known book and established him as a writer with the ability to combine science and humanity in a poetic way. This book was originally published in 1946. Then, it was published again in 1957, a few years after the Piltdown Man hoax discovery.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of when Shostakovich {{initially}} {{conceived the}} symphony, the Nazi attack and consequent relaxing of Soviet censorship gave Shostakovich {{the hope of}} writing the work for a <b>mass</b> <b>audience.</b> A model {{on how to do}} this was Igor Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms. Stravinsky's compositions held considerable influence over Shostakovich and he had been deeply impressed with this particular work. Moreover, Stravinsky had initially set the Russian text of the Psalms, only later switching to Latin. As soon as Shostakovich received the score, he transcribed it for piano four-hands. He often performed this arrangement with students in his composition class at Leningrad Conservatory.|$|E

This began the long process of making newspapers available to a <b>mass</b> <b>audience</b> (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of book production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other metadata.

25|$|The {{new media}} {{industry}} shares an open association with many market segments {{in areas such}} as software/video game design, television, radio, mobile and particularly movies, advertising and marketing, through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the Internet. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the television industry has used new media and the Internet to expand their resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar interactive advertising subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases advertising agencies have also set up new divisions to study new media. Public relations firms are also taking advantage of the opportunities in new media through interactive PR practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media to reach a <b>mass</b> <b>audience</b> of online social network users.|$|E
25|$|The {{scheduling}} of Panorama has, {{since the}} 1980s, often been {{a subject of}} media debate and controversy, due to {{the duties of the}} BBC to provide both on the one hand entertaining programming that appeals to a <b>mass</b> <b>audience,</b> and on the other serious journalism that might have a narrower audience. In February 1985, with the programme being watched by an average audience of just 3.5million viewers, Controller of BBC One Michael Grade moved the programme from its traditional prime time 8.10pm slot on Monday evenings back to 9.30pm, after the Nine O'Clock News. Despite many protests about this move in the media, Panorama remained in this slot until 1997, although two of Grade's successors, Alan Yenotob and Michael Jackson, were known to be unhappy about running 70 continuous minutes of news from 9pm. In May 1997 the Acting Controller of BBC One, Mark Thompson, did move Panorama back half an hour to 10pm, {{to make way for the}} sitcom Birds of a Feather, which opened the BBC to criticism that it was side-lining serious content in favour of lighter programming.|$|E
