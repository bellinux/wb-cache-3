25|$|Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal {{metabolite}} used experimentally {{to disrupt}} the secretion pathway as a <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> Golgi function. BFA blocks the activation of some ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). ARFs are small GTPases which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding of COPs to endosomes and the Golgi. BFA inhibits the function of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs. Treatment of cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.|$|E
25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> pH is {{to expose}} the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{genetic testing}} {{is the most}} {{effective}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing,</b> as HPRT1 is the only gene known to be associated with LNS. Individuals who display the full Lesch–Nyhan phenotype all have mutations in the HPRT1 gene. Sequence analysis of mRNA is available clinically and can be utilized in order to detect HPRT1 mutations in males affected with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Techniques such as RT-PCR, multiplex genomic PCR, and sequence analysis (cDNA and genomic DNA), used for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, are performed on a research basis. If RT-PCR tests result in cDNA showing the absence of an entire exon or exons, then multiplex genomic PCR testing is performed. Multiplex genomic PCR testing amplifies the nine exons of the HPRT1 gene as eight PCR products. If the exon in question is deleted, the corresponding band will be missing from the multiplex PCR. However, if the exon is present, the exon is sequenced to identify the mutation, therefore causing exclusion of the exon from cDNA. If no cDNA is created by RT-PCR, then multiplex PCR is performed on the notion that most or all of the gene is obliterated.|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{the points}} to which I {{directed}} particular attention {{on that occasion}} were these: in the first place, that instruction in physical science supplies information of a character of especial value, both in a practical and a speculative point of view--information which cannot be obtained otherwise; and, in the second place, that, as educational discipline, it supplies, in a better form than any other study can supply, exercise in a special form of logic, and a peculiar <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> the validity of our processes of inquiry. I said further, that, even at that time, a great and increasing attention was being paid to physical science in our schools and colleges, and that, most assuredly, such attention must go on growing and increasing, until education in these matters occupied a very much {{larger share of the}} time which is given to teaching and training, than had been the case heretofore. And I threw all the strength of argumentation of which I was possessed into the support of these propositions. But I venture to remind you, also, of some other words I used at that time, and which I ask permission to read to you. They were these:--"There are other forms of culture besides physical science, and I should be profoundly sorry to see the fact forgotten, or even to observe a tendency to starve or cripple literary or aesthetic culture for the sake of science. Such a narrow view of the nature of education {{has nothing to do with}} my firm conclusion that a complete and thorough scientific culture ought to be introduced into all schools." ...|$|E

A. SCOPE This method covers the procedures to be used to determine the suitability of organic and inorganic materials to be used for overlay of Portland cement concrete pavement or structures or for patching spalls in Portland cement concrete. Material set time, compressive strength, flexural strength, bonding strength, chord modulus of elasticity, specific gravity, and absorption are covered. Further testing may be necessary to fully evaluate most materials. This standard may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This standard does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with its use. This test method is divided into the following parts: 1. <b>Method</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> for compressive strength and flow of overlay and patching materials (using 50 -mm cube specimens). 2. <b>Method</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> for set time of concrete overlay and patching material by Gillmore Needles. 3.
