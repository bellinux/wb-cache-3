5|$|Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115) was {{the ruler}} of the Kingdom of the Isles, the Kingdom of Thomond, and perhaps the Kingdom of Dublin as well. His father was Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster, which meant that Domnall {{was a member of}} the Meic Taidc, a branch of the Uí Briain. Domnall's mother was Mór, {{daughter}} of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Domnall a stake to the kingship of the Isles.|$|E
5|$|In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook's circumnavigation of {{the globe}} aboard the Resolution that reached 70°10' latitude. He also drew from A Narrative of Four Voyages (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell that became a bestseller. A Narrative of Four Voyages <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> Poe {{the idea of the}} {{summarized}} title of his novel.

5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, and it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> rise to later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E

5|$|The Hetumoger {{confederation}} was {{strengthened by}} the arrival of the Kabars, who (according to Constantine) joined the Hungarians following their unsuccessful riot against the Khazar Khaganate. The Hungarians and the Kabars are mentioned in the longer version of the Annals of Salzburg, which relates that the Hungarians fought around Vienna, while the Kabars fought nearby at Culmite in 881. Madgearu proposes that Kavar groups were already settled in the Tisza plain within the Carpathian Basin around 881, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> rise to the anachronistic reference to Cumans in the Gesta Hungarorum {{at the time of the}} Hungarian conquest.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} puffins (Fratercula arctica), which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the island its name, {{declined}} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with the 2005 breeding population estimated to be {{only two or three}} pairs, as a consequence of depredations by brown and black rats (Rattus rattus) (which have now been eliminated) and possibly also as a result of commercial fishing for sand eels, the puffins' principal prey. Since 2005, the breeding numbers have been slowly increasing. Adults were seen taking fish into four burrows in 2007, and six burrows in 2008.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became {{difficult}} to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are {{a rich source of}} the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation's crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to {{children under the age of}} two, and this <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market.|$|E

5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} claimed that had German {{intruder}} operations been maintained over Britain in 1941, and thereafter, the British night flying training program, which produced {{the nucleus of the}} huge bomber force that operated in 1944–45, could have been halted or disrupted. The decision not to continue intruder operations, in their view, allowed the British to build their bomber force virtually unhindered for over four years. A consequence of an effective German intruder campaign at this time <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the Luftwaffe night fighter defences an unassailable lead in the night war, and may have stopped, or diminished, the effectiveness of British bombing operations. This omission could be {{regarded as one of the}} major errors attributable to the OKL concerning the air defence of Germany.|$|E

His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E

5|$|The Western Gangas gave {{patronage}} to all {{the major}} religions of the time; Jainism and the Hindu sects of Shaivism, Vedic Brahminism and Vaishnavism. However scholars have argued that not all Gangas kings <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> equal priority {{to all the}} faiths. Some historians believe that the Gangas were ardent Jains. However, inscriptions contradict this by providing references to kalamukhas (staunch Shaiva ascetics), pasupatas and lokayatas (followers of Pasupatha doctrine) who flourished in Gangavadi, indicating that Shaivism was also popular. King Madhava and Harivarma were devoted to cows and brahmins, King Vishnugopa was a devout Vaishnava, Madhava III's and Avinita's inscriptions describe lavish endowments to Jain orders and temples and King Durvinita performed Vedic sacrifices prompting historians to claim he was a Hindu.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} {{published}} in Century magazine in September 1898, Edwin Emerson, Jr., was {{pretending to be a}} German journalist. He presented himself to the German Consul in St. Thomas and asked for the names of Puerto Ricans of German descent whom he could interview. Among the names which the consul gave him were that of the Riefkohl family of the town of Maunabo. Upon his arrival in the town of Maunabo he met 14-year-old Rudolph W. Riefkohl and asked the lad in German if he had a map of Puerto Rico (Emerson had lost his). Riefkohl answered that he did, however it was decidedly too big for Emerson's use. Riefkohl returned home, not knowing that Emerson was a spy, and quickly drew another with a depiction of the major ports and harbors of Puerto Rico. Emerson used the map and it is believed by some that he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the map to the U.S. Army Commanding General, Nelson A. Miles, influencing Mile's decision on the landing points for the invasion of Puerto Rico. A photostatic copy of Riefkohl's map was {{published in}} the Century article.|$|E
5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men who could be relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E

5|$|In 1977 Barsbold {{suggested}} that oviraptorids fed on molluscs, but Longrich and colleagues {{rejected the idea}} that they practised shell-crushing altogether, since such animals tend to have teeth with broad crushing surfaces. Instead, the shape of the dentary bones in the lower jaws of oviraptorids suggests they had a sharp-edged beak used for shearing tough food, not for cracking hard food items such as bivalves or eggs. The symphyseal shelf {{at the front of the}} dentary <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> some ability for crushing, but as this was a relatively small area, it was probably not the main function of the jaws. The fact that most oviraptorids have been found in sediments that are interpreted as having been xeric and arid or semi-arid environments also argues against them having been specialised eaters of shellfish and eggs, as it is unlikely there would have been enough of these items under such conditions to support them.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{primates}} {{belonging to}} the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early primates. In this regard, lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar. All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene (56 to 34mya) or Paleocene (66 to 56mya). Adapiforms, however, lack a specialized arrangement of teeth, known as a toothcomb, which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess. A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids (loris-like) primates. This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochromeb gene {{and the presence of}} the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups. Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs, the adapiforms <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids, a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65mya according to molecular studies, although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55mya for this divergence. However, the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene.|$|E
