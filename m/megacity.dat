40|$|Ambient PM 2. 5 {{pollution}} {{is a substantial}} threat to public health in global <b>megacities.</b> This paper reviews the PM 2. 5 pollution of 45 global <b>megacities</b> in 2013, based on mass concentration from official monitoring networks and composition data reported in the literature. The {{results showed that the}} five most polluted <b>megacities</b> were Delhi, Cairo, Xi'an, Tianjin and Chengdu, all of which had an annual average concentration of PM 2. 5 greater than 89 μg/m 3. The five cleanest <b>megacities</b> were Miami, Toronto, New York, Madrid and Philadelphia, the annual averages of which were less than 10 μg/m 3. Spatial distribution indicated that the highly polluted <b>megacities</b> are concentrated in east-central China and the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Organic matter and SNA (sum of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) contributed 30 % and 36 %, respectively, of the average PM 2. 5 mass for all <b>megacities.</b> Notable seasonal variation of PM 2. 5 polluted days was observed, especially for the polluted <b>megacities</b> of China and India, resulting in frequent heavy pollution episodes occurring during more polluted seasons such as winter. Marked differences in PM 2. 5 pollution between developing and developed <b>megacities</b> require more effort on local emissions reduction as well as global cooperation to address the PM 2. 5 pollution of those <b>megacities</b> mainly in Asia.

40|$|Research on {{physical}} characteristics and land-cover dynamic changes of <b>megacities</b> over time provides valuable insights for effectively regulating urban planning and management. This study conducts a comparative analysis of 30 -year urban expansion patterns and rates among three metropolises in China (Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) and another {{three in the}} USA (New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago) based on time-series impervious surface area (ISA) data extracted from multitemporal Landsat images using the linear spectral mixture analysis approach. This research indicates significantly different urbanization patterns and rates between the Chinese and American <b>megacities.</b> The ISA expansion area in Chinese <b>megacities</b> was five times higher than that in American <b>megacities</b> {{during the past three}} decades. The Chinese <b>megacities</b> expand outward from the urban core to the periphery in a concentric ring structure, whereas the American <b>megacities</b> increase ISA mainly within the inner cities with patch-filling patterns. The Chinese <b>megacities</b> are in the development stage where population and economic conditions significantly influence urban expansion patterns and rates, but the American <b>megacities</b> are in the developed stage where population and economic conditions are not important forces driving the ISA expansion. The ISA intensity in the American <b>megacities</b> decreases constantly and smoothly, but ISA intensity in Chinese <b>megacities</b> decays abruptly within certain distances, depending on different cities and years. The most obvious urban expansions were between 8 and 20 km in Beijing in the 1980 s, between 14 and 50 km in Shanghai in the 2000 s, and between Sand 18 km in Guangzhou in the 1990 s.

40|$|Human beings {{should live}} {{in places where}} they are most productive, and <b>megacities,</b> where information, {{innovation}} and opportunities congregate, would be the optimal choice. Yet <b>megacities</b> in both China and the U. S. are excluding people by limiting housing supply. Why, despite their many differences, is {{the same type of}} exclusion happening in both Chinese and U. S. <b>megacities?</b> Urban law and policy scholars argue that Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) homeowners are taking over <b>megacities</b> in the U. S. and hindering housing development therein. They pin their hopes on an efficient growth machine that makes sure “above all, nothing {{gets in the way of}} building. ” Yet the growth-dominated <b>megacities</b> of China demonstrate that relying on business and political elites to provide affordable housing is a false hope. Our comparative study of the homeowner-dominated <b>megacities</b> of the U. S. and growth-dominated <b>megacities</b> of China demonstrates that the origin of exclusionary <b>megacities</b> is not a choice between growth elites and homeowners, but the exclusionary nature of property rights. Our study reveals that <b>megacities</b> in the two countries share a property-centered approach, which prioritizes the maximization of existing property interests and neglects ultimate housing consumers’ interests, resulting in unaffordable housing. Giving housing consumers a voice in land use control and urban governance becomes the last resort to counteract this result. This comparative study shows that the conventional triangular framework of land use comprising government, developers, and homeowners is incomplete, and argues for a citizenship-based approach to urban governance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} the <b>megacities</b> {{of the world on}} global tropospheric ozone, and conversely, the extent to which <b>megacities</b> are {{influenced}} by emissions of ozone pre-cursors from outside of the <b>megacities</b> is examined under the four alternative RCP (“Representative Concentration Path-way”) emissions scenarios. Despite accounting for about 6 % of present-day anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursor species, the contribution of emissions from <b>megacities</b> to global tropospheric ozone is calculated to be 0. 84 %. By 2100 this contribution falls to between 0. 18 % and 0. 62 % depending on the scenario, with the lower value being for the most-polluting of the four future emissions scenarios due to stringent controls on ozone precursor emissions from highly populated areas combined with a stronger tropospheric back-ground ozone field.

25|$|Since the 2000s, {{the largest}} <b>megacity</b> {{has been the}} Greater Tokyo Area. The {{population}} of this urban agglomeration includes areas such as Yokohama and Kawasaki, and {{is estimated to be}} between 37 and 38 million. This variation in estimates can be accounted for by different definitions of what the area encompasses. While the prefectures of Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa, and Saitama are commonly included in statistical information, the Japan Statistics Bureau only includes the area within 50 kilometers of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Offices in Shinjuku, thus arriving at a smaller population estimate. A characteristic issue of megacities is the difficulty in defining their outer limits and accurately estimating the populations.|$|E
