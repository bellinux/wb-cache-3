[...] Cridlin called SheiKra, [...] "a majestic, one-of-a-kind roller coaster experience", and mentions that the attraction, [...] "may be the world's finest dive coaster". In a 2005 article, Cridlin mostly praised the 90-degree drop and wrote that, [...] "Despite its sheer size and dominance of the Busch Gardens landscape... the coaster likely will still inspire debate among park visitors." [...] Eric Michael from Orlando Sentinel wrote, [...] "The 200-foot monster, Florida's tallest, wins <b>my</b> <b>vote</b> for best drop, straight down at 90-degrees, and most shameless tease (riders hang at the top for a few seconds)". In 2007, SheiKra was featured on Discovery Channel's television series Build It Bigger.|$|E
500|$|Commented {{longtime}} former Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox on Bagwell – {{who opposed}} {{him from the}} dugout for the entirety of his career, including numerous times in the playoffs: [...] "Jeff Bagwell was [...] {{for so long and}} starred every year. [...] For me a guy that dominated like that for one team, even in the league stats through the years. [...] His are up there with anybody's. [...] I would put him in right away. [...] So he would get <b>my</b> <b>vote</b> on the first ballot." [...] Still, in spite of the speculation that Bagwell used performance-enhancing drugs, San Francisco Chronicle sportswriter Bruce Jenkins opined that Bagwell did not have the credentials to be in the Hall of Fame. [...] In July 2015, he acknowledged [...] "that many are suspicious of Bagwell—without proof, as you say. [...] I've always voted for the best players—Bonds, McGwire, Clemens, etc.—so that's not a factor for me. [...] I always found Bagwell just a bit short of Hall of Fame material." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{four months}} of conflict, and having the {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the Argentine Congress, the president introduced the new taxation bill. However, many legislators gave priority to the local agendas of their provinces as their economies depended heavily on agriculture. Many FPV legislators, such as Rubén Marín, opposed the bill. Marín argued: [...] "For us, agriculture is the economy". There were two demonstrations the day of the vote: one against the bill, attended by 235,000 people, and the other in support of the bill, attended by 100,000 people. Farmers had announced that they would continue their demonstrations if the bill was approved without amendments. Senator Emilio Rached from Santiago del Estero cast the vote that resulted in a 36–36 tie. In the case of a tie, the vice president, who also serves as president of the Senate but without the right to vote, is required to cast the tie-breaking vote. Julio Cobos voted against the bill, which was then rejected, saying that: [...] "My vote is not in favor, <b>my</b> <b>vote</b> is against". Despite the chilly relations between Cobos and Cristina Kirchner since that event, he completed his term as vice president.|$|E

He writes: [...] "Over the last 9 years, I have always <b>voted</b> <b>my</b> conscience placing my constituents’ best interests above anything else.

500|$|Although eleven {{songs were}} {{originally}} slated for the album, only ten made the final track listing. A song penned by Hanneman, entitled [...] "Final Six," [...] {{was meant for}} inclusion, with the song name originally declared as the album's title by vocalist Tom Araya to George Stroumboulopoulos of CBC's The Hour. Questioned about the album's title by Kevin and Bean of Los Angeles KROQ-FM, King replied [...] "I'm not positive it's been nailed yet. I think last week was the deadline and I'm not sure where it ended up, so I'm gonna {{have to take the}} fifth on that one. The way it was going, <b>my</b> <b>vote</b> was overlooked, so… That's why I'm not real thrilled about it." [...] However, Araya took one weekend off for vacation during the recording of the album and required a two-hour gall bladder operation the following Monday on May 5, 2006. Thus, he was unable to finish the vocals for the song in time for the album's release. King hinted [...] "Final Six" [...] might appear on a special digipack release of Christ Illusion: a release which eventually surfaced in July 2007. [...] "Final Six" [...] also appeared on the soundtrack to the film [...] the following year.|$|E
500|$|Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World in 1992 praised its {{setting for}} {{containing}} the [...] "right combination of gravity, silliness, genuine scholarship and mystical mumbo-jumbo", {{and called it}} a [...] "strong enough storyline to hold its own next {{to any of the}} Indy films." [...] He highly praised the game's Team, Wits, Fists system, about which he wrote, [...] "Never before has a game paid this much attention to what the player wants." [...] He also enjoyed its graphics and varied locales. Although he cited the pixelated character sprites and lack of voice acting as low points, Ardai summarized Fate of Atlantis as an [...] "exuberant, funny, well-crafted and clever game" [...] that bettered its predecessor, The Last Crusade. QuestBusters also praised the game, stating that it [...] "is not only the best adventure ever done by LucasArts ... but is also probably the nicest graphic adventure ever ... just about perfect in all areas". The reviewer wrote [...] "Atlantis shines in 256 colors" [...] and that [...] "the musicians and sound effects specialists deserve a tip of the hat", stating that the audio [...] "completes the effect of playing a movie". He described the puzzles as quite creative and certainly fair" [...] and liked the multiple solutions. The reviewer concluded that the game was [...] "a must-buy for all adventurers" [...] and [...] "gets <b>my</b> <b>vote</b> ... for 'Best Quest of the Year'", tied with Ultima Underworld, [...] "both of which redefine the state-of-the-art in their respective genres".|$|E
500|$|The {{scrutiny}} {{phase of}} the election is as follows: The cardinal electors proceed, in order of precedence, to take their completed ballots (which bear only {{the name of the}} individual voted for) to the altar, where the Scrutineers stand. Before casting the ballot, each cardinal elector takes a Latin oath, which translates to: [...] "I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that <b>my</b> <b>vote</b> is given to the one who before God I think should be elected." [...] If any cardinal elector is in the Chapel, but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity, the last Scrutineer may go to him and take his ballot after the oath is recited. If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room, the Infirmarii go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box. Any such sick cardinals take the oath and then complete the ballot papers. When the Infirmarii return to the Chapel, the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals; thereafter, they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle. This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots. If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny, then a second scrutiny immediately follows. A maximum total of four scrutinies can be taken each day, two in the morning and two in the afternoon.|$|E

500|$|The next morning, Conkling then {{submitted}} {{a resolution that}} bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who was sitting at the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind <b>my</b> <b>vote</b> against my will on any question whatever." [...] Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation.
