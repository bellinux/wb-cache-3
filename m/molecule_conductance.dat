This thesis in particular explores the single <b>molecule</b> <b>conductance</b> and electron transfer over a range of molecules in a room temperature ionic liquid medium. Prior to the work contained in this thesis, no conductance measurements of a single molecule had been recorded in a room temperature ionic liquid medium, {{to the best of our}} knowledge. Due to the novelty of room temperature ionic liquids in this field, it was decided that alkanedithiols would be an ideal starting point, largely due to their simplicity and reputation as a model system in single molecule electronics. Ionic liquids have several notable advantages as a medium in such measurements and the aim of the research contained in this thesis is first to show that ionic liquids are indeed a viable medium and secondly, to demonstrate their advantages over more widely used, conventional aqueous or organic media.

Association constants were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments with fullerenes C 70, C 60, and Phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). NMR titration experiments mimic fluorescence quenching results that suggest that association in solution increases with shape-complementarity between donor and acceptor. Second, efforts towards the synthesis of azulene HBC, an HBC derivative with red-shifted absorption, are discussed. Calculations of this target molecule and a selected intermediate are compared to those of the parent contorted HBC. Finally, an azulene HBC synthetic intermediate is explored as a potential sensor.

A technique has been developed to realize Au films with similar to 1. 5 angstrom surface roughness comparable to the best available techniques and suitable for formation of patterned device structures. The technique utilizes room temperature e-beam evaporated Au films over oxidized Si substrates silanized with (3 -mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTMS). The lateral (single/few molecule) and vertical (many molecules) device structures are both enabled by the process for realizing ultraflat Au layer. Lateral metal-molecule-metal (M-M-M) device structures are fabricated by forming pairs of Au electrodes with nanometer separation (nano-gap) through an electromigration-induced break-junction (EIBJ) technique at room temperature and conductivity measurements are carried out for dithiol functionalized single molecules. We have used the flat Au layer (using the current technique) as the bottom contact in vertical M-M-M device structures. Here, molecular self-assembly are formed on the Au surface, and patterned (20 x 20 mu m(2)) top Au contacts were successfully transferred on to the device using a stamping technique (where the Au is deposited on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pad and following a physical contact on the thiolated Au layer).

40|$|Non-adiabatic charge {{transfer}} (CT) {{is one of}} the simplest but very important (if not the most important) chemical reactions. As a model system, alkanedithiols are among the most popular ones for short- or medium-range CT. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs), which consist of nucleobases but with peptide backbones instead of the phosphate backbones in DNA, is another promising model system for long-range CT. Various models and computational methods have been developed to describe three major experimental configurations: electrochemical measurement with self-assembled monolayer films (SAMs), single-molecule conductance measurement and photoinduced electron transfer (PET). This dissertation have employed above experimental techniques and computational methods to study the two model systems. The first work focuses on electrochemical models. Single-step models are widely used for analyzing CT through SAMs. However, long-range CT can occur in a “hopping” regime that involves multiple events. This study describes a three-step kinetic scheme to model CT in this regime. It is corroborated by the experimental results of a 10 -mer peptide nucleic acid SAM. The second study compares single <b>molecule</b> <b>conductances</b> of alkanedithiols and alkoxydithiols. Both molecular junction measurements and theoretical simulations by non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) method show that the conductance is lower for alkoxydithiols and the difference is length dependent. A pathway analysis of the electronic coupling is used to explain the results. The last two studies address the importance of conformational distributions on {{charge transfer}} in PNAs: The third study compares the electrochemical charge transfer rates of normal aeg-PNA and γ-PNA which has a less flexible backbone. Molecular dynamics and NEGF calculations show that the greater flexibility of the aeg-PNA gives rise to a more frequent appearance of high-CT rate conformations. In the last study a new PNA scaffold with a [Ru(Bpy) 3] 2 + donor and a bis(8 -hydroxyquinolinate) 2 copper acceptor for PET is described. Experiments show that whether the [Ru(Bpy) 3] 2 + is terminally or centrally situated affects PET. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the difference in conformational distributions is a possible explanation. The findings in these studies provide a deeper understanding of CT in molecules, and may facilitate the development of non-adiabatic dynamics in a bigger picture. ...|$|R

These single molecule technologies described in part II are likely to contribute to more powerful computer chips in the future, which will in turn lead to faster and more accurate computational predictions for chemical problems. Part I: Computers for Chemistry: Progress towards the design of accurate computational tools to predict the selectivity of chemical reactions. The first fully quantum mechanical study to predict enantioselectivities for a large dataset of organic reactions has been reported. Enantioselectivities were calculated for a diverse set of 46 dioxirane catalyzed epoxidation reactions. Comparison to experiments showed that our methodology is able to accurately predict the free energy differences between transition states leading to enantiomeric products. To further improve the predictive performance, we have also developed a new correction scheme, which increases the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) for non-covalent interactions. Our new correction scheme accurately estimates interaction energies of non-covalent complexes not only with large, but also with small basis sets at lower computational cost. The improved enantioselectivity prediction protocol containing our latest non-covalent corrections has now been fully automated in a user-friendly fashion. We are currently testing its accuracy for other asymmetric reactions, such as CBS reductions and are also trying to use our methodology to design new asymmetric organocatalysts. In collaboration with Dr. Jianing Li, a structure based computational methodology to predict sites of metabolism of organic substrates with P 450 enzymes has also been developed, which is highly relevant for structure-based drug discovery.

Part II of this dissertation describes studies of antiaromatic and pi-pi-stacked molecular wires as well as new direct ways to connect them to gold electrodes. At the beginning, the first successful single <b>molecule</b> <b>conductance</b> measurements ever on partially antiaromatic molecular wires are described.

Then, two new ways to connect single molecules to gold electrodes with direct Au-C links are presented. The first methodology is based on strained arene rings in [2. 2]-paracyclophanes, which were found to directly contact gold electrodes with their pi-systems. The second methodology employs tin based precursors, which get replaced in situ by gold electrodes to also form direct Au-C bonds with very low resistance.

Within this framework, I study the single <b>molecule</b> <b>conductances</b> of five-membered ring compounds to investigate the effect of molecular symmetry and quantum interference on the charge transport through single molecule junctions. This theoretical and experimental study highlights the presence of destructive quantum interference and more importantly reveals that the control of molecular asymmetry via the heteroatom substitution allows the tuning of destructive quantum interference. Theoretically, I identify similar features over some range of energies using different anchoring groups and elucidate the impact of the anchoring groups on the charge transport through single molecule. Moreover, I find that molecular symmetry has a slight effect on the binding energies of the 1 - 8 compounds seen in Figure 3. 1. Within the phase coherent regime, electron transport through a single molecule junction is described by the transmission coefficient, which describes how electrons pass through a molecule from one electrode to the other. Predicting features related to the transmission coefficient is a powerful tool for probing the electronic structure of molecular systems. In this connection, mid-gap transport theory is considered an efficient and easy method, which utilizes a magic ratio rule (MRR) to predict electrical conductance ratios associated with constructive quantum interference in aromatic molecules. I demonstrate that the MRR can be also applied for antiaromatic molecules and provide a comparison between the transmission coefficients of the aromatic and antiaromatic molecules. Furthermore, I present a theoretical study to investigate the transport properties of C 60 using carbon-carbon triple bond anchoring groups and prove the validity of MRR when applied to such non-aromatic molecule...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the effect of}} bonding of a CO <b>molecule</b> on the <b>conductance</b> of Au, Cu, Pt, and Ni atomic contacts at 4. 2 K. When CO gas is admitted to the metal nano contacts, a conductance feature appears in the conductance histogram near 0. 5 of the quantum unit of conductance, for all metals. For Au, the intensity of this fractional conductance feature can be tuned with the bias voltage, and it disappears at high bias voltage (above ∼ 200 mV). The bonding of CO to Au appears to be weakest, and associated with monotomic Au wire formation. Comment: 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{conductance}} {{of a series}} of amine-terminated oligophenyl and alkane molecular junctions formed with Ag and Au electrodes using the scanning tunneling microscope based break-junction technique. For these molecules that conduct through the highest occupied molecular orbital, junctions formed with Au electrodes are more conductive than those formed with Ag electrodes, consistent with the lower work function for Ag. The measured conductance decays exponentially with molecular backbone length with a decay constant that is essentially the same for Ag and Au electrodes. However, the formation and evolution of molecular junctions upon elongation are very different for these two metals. Specifically, junctions formed with Ag electrodes sustain significantly longer elongation when compared with Au due to a difference in the initial gap opened up when the metal point-contact is broken. Using this observation and density functional theory calculations of junction structure and conductance we explain the trends observed in the single <b>molecule</b> junction <b>conductance.</b> Our work thus opens a new path to the conductance measurements of a single molecule junction in Ag electrodes...|$|R
