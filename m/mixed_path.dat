40|$|The {{histories}} of THO and Sr- 90 fallout in the Southern Hemisphere are compared {{for the data}} available to June 1966. The seasonal variation pattern (JulyJune) for THO in mid-latitude oceanic rain-waters is fairly closely reproduced from year to year, and peaks in late winter-spring. The peak coincides with {{the absence of the}} temperature inversion at the polar tropo-pause, suggesting that the stratosphere-troposphere exchange of the bulk of Southern Hemisphere THO fallout takes place over the polar regions. For Sr- 90 in mid-latitude rainwaters, the seasonal variation pattern is not so closely reproduced from year to year, but shows a broad summer maximum and winter mini-mum. It appears that the bulk of the bomb particulate products mixes southward within the lower stratosphere and enters the troposphere at mid-latitudes, the seasonal fallout variation being similar to that found for the Northern Hemisphere, but 6 months out of phase. Consideration of the balance of THO in the troposphere leads to a relation which allows a seasonal variation pattern for the stratosphere-troposphere exchange of THO to be deduced from the rainwater concentrations. Stratospheric measurements of bomb particulete products are taken into account in an assessment of Sr- 90 southward <b>mixing</b> <b>paths.</b> An attempt is also made to deduce the origin and possible southward <b>mixing</b> <b>paths</b> for thermonuclear THO appearing in the Southern Hemisphere.

40|$|Abstract. At a macro scale level, mixing is {{generally}} achieved by a turbulent flow, which makes possible of segregating the fluid in small domains, thereby {{leading to an}} increase in the contact surface and decrease in the <b>mixing</b> <b>path.</b> At low Reynolds number, the viscous effects dominate inertial effects and a completely laminar flow occurs. In the laminar flow system, fluid streams flow parallel to each other and the velocity at any location within the fluid stream is variant with pressure when boundary conditions are constant and due to the change in surface area–to-volume tension and diffusion, do not simply scale linearly from large to small devices. This makes the use of microfluidic as a mixing device difficult. Thus, the study posed to bridge this gap by created geometrically enhanced Micromixer for homogenous mixing...|$|R

We distinguish a purely academic educational path from a purely vocational path and a <b>mixed</b> <b>path</b> with loops through both systems. To study the labor market outcome we compare earnings and calculate net return rates as well as risk measures to investigate whether different educational paths are characterized by different risk-return trade-offs. We use Lazear’s jack-of-all-trades theory on entrepreneurship to derive testable predictions about the labour market outcome of different combinations of education for entrepreneurs and employees. Our empirical results are based on the Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS) and demonstrate that mixed educational paths are well rewarded in the labor market. However, a high return is also associated with a high income variance which is driven by those who end up as entrepreneurs. risk-return trade-off, complete educational paths, occupational choice...|$|E
40|$|Software-Defined Networking {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} in industries {{as well as}} in the academic since its inception. Open flow is widely accepted southbound interface and is managed by Open Networking Foundation (ONF). Open flow uses the concept of backup path for packet transmission in the switches so that if primary path fails, it may use backup path without having to pass through controller so that path stability is maintained. But this leads to high miss rate in the lookup table of all the switches of the path in the network and thus adds extra overhead of miss penalty to all the switches in path (encapsulation of the packet and sending the packet to the controller through secure channel for further processing and controller sends the packet back to the switch). This adds extra latency to end delay. In this paper we proposed <b>mixed</b> <b>path</b> where elephant flow uses double (backup) path and mice flow uses single path so as to reduce miss rate in lookup table of the switches and path stability is maintained...|$|E

To achieve a realistic result, the trip generation should provide a variety of trips between pairs of locations from Origin-Destination (OD) table reflecting the choices of drivers.

Our algorithm <b>mixes</b> shortest <b>path</b> trees starting from some location nodes in each subarea of the OD table as preprocessing and then generates trips by probabilistically traversing the <b>mixed</b> shortest <b>path</b> trees.

40|$|In this paper, a {{propagation}} path loss model for inland river is proposed by three improvements {{compared with the}} Round Earth Loss (REL) model for open-sea environment. Specifically, parameters optimization uses Okumura-Hata model in dB scale to replace the equation transformed from the free space loss in REL model; secondly, diffraction loss caused by the obstacles (e. g., large buildings, bridges, or some other facilities near the river bank) is also taken into account; mixed-path methodology as another improvement is used for Inland River (IR) model because the actual propagation environment between transmitter (TX) antenna and receiver (RX) antenna contains both land part and water part. The paper presents a set of 1. 4 [*]GHz measurements conducted along the Yangtze River in Wuhan. According to the comparison between path loss models and experimental results, IR model shows a good matching degree. After that, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Grey Relation Grade and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (GRG-MAPE), Pearson Correlation Coefficient, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (PCC-MAPE) are employed to implement quantitative analysis.

40|$|Choosing routes {{such that}} the network {{lifetime}} is maximized in a wireless network with limited energy resources is a major routing problem in wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks. In this paper, we study the problem where participants are rationally selfish and non-cooperative. By selfish we designate the users {{who are ready to}} tamper with their source-routing (senders could choose intermediate nodes in the routing paths) or next hop selection strategies in order to increase the total number of packets transmitted, but do not try to harm or drop packets of the other nodes. The problem therefore amounts to a non-cooperative game. In the works [2, 6, 19, 23], the authors show that the game admits Nash equilibria [1]. Along this line, we first show that if the cost function is linear, this game has pure-strategy equilibrium flow even though participants have different demands. However, finding a Nash equilibrium for a normal game is computationally hard [9]. In this work, inspired by mixed-strategy equilibrium, we propose a simple local routing algorithm called <b>MIxed</b> <b>Path</b> Routing protocol (MiPR). Using analysis and simulations, we show that MiPR drives the system to an equilibrium state where selfish participants do not have incentive to deviate. Moreover, MiPR significantly improves the network lifetime as compared to original routing protocols...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, a {{consensus}} {{has been reached}} about the relevance of calculating the value of congestion {{and the value of}} reliability for better understanding and therefore better prediction of travel behavior. The current study proposed a revealed preference approach that used a large amount of GPS data from probe vehicles to provide insight into actual behavior in choosing a route. <b>Mixed</b> <b>path</b> size correction logit models were estimated from samples of 5, 759 observations in the peak period and 7, 964 observations in the off-peak period, while a mean-variance model was specified to consider both congestion and reliability terms. Results illustrated that the value of time and the value of congestion were significantly higher in the peak period because of possible higher penalties for drivers being late and consequently possible higher time pressure. Moreover, results showed that the marginal rate of substitution between travel time reliability and total travel time did not vary across periods and traffic conditions, with the obvious caveat that the absolute values were significantly higher for the peak period. Last, results showed the immense potential of exploiting the growing availability of large amounts of data from cheap and enhanced technology to obtain estimates of the monetary value of different travel time components from the observation of actual behavior, with arguably potential significant impact on the realism of large-scale models...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the rates of return and the risks of different types of educational paths – all leading to a tertiary educational degree. The paper seeks to distinguish a purely academic educational path from a purely vocational path and a <b>mixed</b> <b>path</b> with loops through both systems. Design/methodology/approach – The paper studies the labor market outcome to compare earnings and calculate net return rates as well as risk measures to investigate whether different educational paths are characterized by different risk-return trade-offs. Entrepreneurs are separated from employees in order to examine whether for the same combination of education the labour market outcomes differ between the two groups. Findings – The empirical results are based on the Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS) and demonstrate that mixed educational paths are well rewarded in the labor market. However, for entrepreneurs a high return is also associated with a high income variance. Research limitations/implications – The findings provide evidence for the existence of complementarities between vocational and academic education. Further research on mixed educational paths might provide more insight into this presumed relationship. Practical implications – Since the results indicate that mixed educational paths are a worthwhile strategy, the permeability of a national education system is a very important educational policy issue. Originality/value – The study is innovative in three ways: first, it focuses on complete educational paths and not just the highest educational degree. Second, an alternative measure, the Baldwin rate of return, is used to assess the profitability attached to different educational paths. Third, the income risk associated with each educational path is calculated. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a recent trend of {{cooperation}} between local traffic authorities and in-vehicle route guidance service providers that involves free exchange of traffic data. It is important for both sides to understand the outcomes of the cooperation and how to improve their individual outcomes. Despite the relevance of this topic, this area has not been explored in detail by existing studies. Hence, this thesis focuses on investigating cooperation strategies for both local authorities and service providers. This research first develops a cooperation strategy evaluation framework for free data exchange schemes. The framework consists of two model components. The first component is a <b>mixed</b> <b>Path</b> Size Logit (PSL) based market equilibrium model that estimates the market response to a given cooperation strategy. The second component comprises functions to evaluate the benefit for local traffic authorities and service providers. In particular, the benefit functions for free service providers and paid service providers are developed based on assumptions about their differences in revenue sources. Next, a framework for optimising cooperation strategies for the local authority and service providers is developed based on a non-cooperative Nash game. The framework is formulated as an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC), which is solved by a Particle Swarm Optimiser (PSO) based Diagonalization algorithm that is developed {{as a part of}} this research. This optimisation framework is subsequently extended to analyse cooperation scenarios involving paid data sharing schemes and a mix of free and paid schemes. A number of numerical studies are conducted using the developed frameworks. One numerical study investigates the impact of market characteristics on the market share of a service provider with relatively good data quality, and finds that the route choice set composition, drivers’ value of time (VOT) and their perception accuracy with respect to service providers’ utility {{have a significant impact on}} the market share. The other numerical studies show three general implications for the cooperation. Firstly, when a local traffic authority’s objective is to maximise the network performance, it should cooperate with all service providers via free data exchange schemes and make sure that cooperative service providers use the data to enhance their data quality and not just reduce their own data acquisition costs. Secondly, when a local traffic authority considers generating a revenue by selling its data to cooperative service providers (via paid schemes), the authority should be aware that its revenue does not always increase when the data is sold to more service providers; higher revenues can sometimes be obtained from service providers who get a data quality advantage over other providers from local authority data. Finally, there may be a public concern about whether the local traffic authority’s data is appropriately utilised for improving the public benefit when the local traffic authority cooperates with service providers via paid schemes, and such concerns may prevent the local traffic authority from engaging in commercial transactions with service providers through paid data exchange schemes.

Two different schemes are studied experimentally to assess the analytical model using a flat phantom with electric properties of human skin and different lengths of metallic inserts. The first scheme considers a metallic plate between the transmitting and receiving antennas, while the second scheme proposes locating the metallic plates under the antennas. It is shown that the second scheme yields a better link budget than the first one for the same length of metal.

This cutoff for the earth-ionosphere waveguide is illuminated by lightning sferics and is used to monitor the change in ionosphere height through the day-night boundary. The observed ionospheric heights are found to be dependent on the three kinds of source-receiver paths: daytime, nighttime and mixed. Accurate locations for individual events are obtained from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) to enable the analysis. Tweek sferics, which asymptote towards the transverse resonance frequency of the waveguide, predominate in the night path giving the most precise information about ionospheric heights. Weak dispersion and steep transitions in one-dimensional spectra provide information about daytime heights. Propagation over <b>mixed</b> <b>paths</b> reveals both daytime and nighttime signatures.
