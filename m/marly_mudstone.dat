The studied black shales are highly fossiliferous and fissile. They are texturally classified as phosphatic <b>marly</b> <b>mudstone</b> microfacies. The black shale mineral composition is mainly composed of calcite, apatite, quartz, pyrite and clay minerals. The average values of Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr, V, As and Se and the ratios Rb/Sr and Cr/Ni in black shale are enriched compared to those of the Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) values. Electrical properties of samples were measured using a non-polarizing electrode, at room temperature (∼ 18 °C), and relative atmospheric humidity of (∼ 35 %), in the frequency range from 42  Hz to 5  MHz. The changes in electrical properties were argued to be due to the change in mineral composition. Generally, the electrical properties of rocks are changed due to many factors such as grain size, mineral composition, grain shape and inter-granular relations between grains. The dielectric constant decreases with frequency, and increases with conductor concentration. Also, the conductivity increases with the increase of conductor continuous paths between electrodes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Duwi Formation in the Quseir-Safaga area is {{conformably}} overlain by the Quseir variegated shales and underlain by the Dakhla shales. Detailed mineralogical and geochemical {{studies were}} carried out on the middle member of the black shales of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga province to infer their source rocks, paleo-weathering and provenance of the sources. The studied black shales are highly fossiliferous and fissile. They are texturally classified as phosphatic <b>marly</b> <b>mudstone</b> microfacies. Mineralogically, they are composed mainly of calcite, apatite, quartz, pyrite and clay minerals. The studied clay fraction reveals that the well-crystalline Na-montmorillonite is the dominating clay mineral with mixed layer montmorillonite-illite and minor kaolinite. These shales {{could be used as a}} source for the sodium bentonite. The studied black shales are highly mature, detrital and authigenic in origin. They are most probably derived from basic volcanic rocks by intensive chemical weathering. The provenance constituted a part of passive and active continental margins similar to those the Devonian/Mississippian shales in USA. The Cretaceous black shales of the Duwi Formation in Quseir-Safaga area are part of Mes-Neoarchean Shales, and are typically comparable to the Archean Shale Average. The average values of Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr, V, As and Se and, with the ratios Rb/Sr and Cr/Ni, are enriched with respect to those of the PAAS values. This could be attributed to the abundance of mafic components. The felsic source rocks were considered as an added source similar to Cretaceous and Cambrian black shales in India and China; respectively. The ratios V/Cr, V/(V+Ni) and Mo/Al and the high concentrations of the redox sensitive elements revealed that the studied black shales were deposited under relatively euxinic to anoxic reducing marine environments coupled with hydrothermal solutions. They were found comparable to the Cretaceous Gulf of California, Posidonia, Cretaceous/Tertiary black shales, and those in the Black Sea. The studied black shales can be classified as good to excellent source of oil and trace elements. The chemical composition of the studied black shales of the Duwi Formation (Cretaceous) was correlated to published data at different localities and ages...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} micropaleontological and geochemical {{study was}} carried out on the Pliocene-age Bianco section located in Calabria, southern Italy. This section is somewhat unique for the Pliocene of the Mediterranean region in that it contains abundant calcareous and siliceous microfossils. Based on the biostratigraphic findings, it ranges in age from approximately 3. 7 - 3. 0 Ma. The Bianco section is composed of <b>marly</b> <b>mudstones</b> intercalated with diatomites, with the diatomites being particularly common in the upper 50 m of the section (above 3. 1 Ma). The diatomites contain an abundant benthic foraminiferal assemblage and have a low organic carbon content indicating that bottom waters were fairly well-oxygenated during their deposition. Faunal and floral indicators suggest a cooling of surface waters in this region at 3. 1 Ma. The diatom assemblages within the Bianco diatomites {{are very similar to}} those living in the Gulf of California, suggesting an upwelling origin for these silica-rich units. A model is proposed which attributes diatomite formation to upwelling induced by climatically controlled changes in local hydrography. © 1989...|$|R

These bed-parallel structural elements formed under a vertical loading, during the progressive burial of the carbonates. The present field and laboratory study focuses on the control exerted, on development and distribution of bed-parallel compaction bands and pressure solution seams, by compositional, sedimentological and pore network characteristics {{of a variety of}} carbonate rocks (skeletal grainstones and packstones, <b>marly</b> wackestones to <b>mudstones).</b> The main results are consistent with the following statements: (i) bed-parallel compaction bands formed only within poorly cemented, porous grainstones (2 D porosity > 10...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the controls exerted by sedimentologic and diagenetic factors on the preservation and modification of pore-network characteristics (porosity, pore types, sizes, shapes, and distribution) of carbonates {{belonging to the}} Bolognano Formation. This formation, exposed at the Majella Mountain, Italy, is composed of Oligocene–Miocene carbonates deposited inmiddle- to outer-ramp settings. The carbonates consist of (1) grainstones predominantly composed of either larger benthic foraminifera, especially Lepidocyclina, or bryozoans; (2) grainstones to packstones with abundant echinoid plates and spines; and (3) <b>marly</b> wackestones to <b>mudstones</b> with planktonic foraminifera. The results of this field- and laboratory-based study are consistent with skeletal grain assemblages, grain sizes, sorting, and shapes, all representing the sedimentologic factors responsible for high values of connected primary macroporosity in grainstones deposited on the high-energy, middle to proximal outer ramp. Cementation, responsible for porosity reduction and overall macropore shape and distribution in grainstones to packstones deposited on the intermediate outer ramp, was mainly dependent on the following factors: (1) amount of echinoid plates and spines, (2) grain size, (3) grain sorting and shapes, and (4) clay amount.

40|$|Both Gamba and Tingri {{are located}} on the {{southern}} Tethyan Himalaya and exhibit Paleogene marine sedimentary strata with similar lithological sequences, from the base up depositing Indian-derived sandstones, larger foraminifera-bearing limestones, green marls and Asian-derived siltstones, and red <b>marly</b> siltstones and <b>mudstones.</b> The green marls and siltstones are proposed to be deposited in the foredeep of a foreland basin, and therefore represent the Initial India-Asia Continental Collision (IIACC) (Najman, et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2005). Our studies on the stratigraphy, palaeontology, and palaeoenvironment in Gamba and Tingri show that the cessation of limestone deposition occurring at the Shallow Benthic Zonation 7 (SBZ 7, ~ 54 - 55 Ma) in Gamba predates that in Tingri (the base of SBZ 10, ~ 52. 8 Ma), indicating that Gamba fell into the foredeep earlier than Tingri, and consequently Gamba has a potential to provide a maximum age of the IIACC. In addition, on the distal part of a foreland basin (such as Tingri and Gamba), the forebulge will occur earlier than the foredeep, and consequently {{the age of the}} forebulge may better constrain the timing of the IIACC. In Gamba, a conglomerate layer immediately above the larger foraminiferal assemblage of SBZ 5 is proposed to represent the first formation of the forebulge during the onset of the foreland basin.

40|$|Brecciated fabrics, {{coupled with}} authigenic {{carbonate}} precipitation, extensively affect the carbonatic units {{developed during the}} Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) of the Mediterranean Sea. These limestones represent a complex unit in terms of genesis and stratigraphy: they show a rich facies inventory and are intimately related to a major basin-scale unconformity (the MES, Messinian Erosional Surface). The brecciated limestones are known as “Calcare di Base” Fm. (basal limestone) and show sulphur-bearing lithofacies at places. They have been long investigated and the attempt to group them {{on the basis of}} sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical datasets results in still fragmentary models, where the fabric aspects have not been highlighted yet, nor the trigger for the wholesale brecciation hasn’t been clearly defined. Two different triggers for brecciation have been so far claimed: evaporitic collapse and mass wasting processes. The relation between the upper Messinian breccias and fluid migration, to date only speculated, is tested in the present study using a suite of sedimentary techniques (outcrop facies analysis, natural radioactive measurements, facies and fabric investigations) and geochemical techniques (XRD and EDS analyses, stable isotopes δ 18 O and δ 13 C, organic geochemistry). The brecciated limestones widely crop out in the Western Mediterranean area: some key-sections located in Italy (Maiella area; Calabrian Arc; Sicily) have been chosen in this thesis to obtain an exhaustive stratigraphic framework and a genetic model for the Upper Messinian breccias. The overall challenge is to validate the role of investigating brecciated fabric as: 1) a sedimentological tool for detecting ancient cold seeps, offering a contribute to the “paleo-seep search strategy”; 2) an opportunity to achieve an outstanding insight into the processes taking place below the seafloor in modern seepage settings. The Messinian breccias are made up of limestones exhibiting high variability in facies and thickness: their geometry varies from a patchy distribution within a host sediment to massive or stratified thick bodies interbedded with pelitic horizons. The carbonatic beds consist of locally brecciated <b>marly</b> lime <b>mudstones,</b> highly cemented, devoid of gravity segregation and any preferential distribution. Generally brecciation overprints the primary fabric, resulting in fabric-retentive breccias (in situ brecciation). Breccias are typified by monomictic subangular clasts, showing scale-invariant fabric and lithology-independent patterns. Brecciation, accompanied by fluid migration pathways occurring at any scale of observation, is a diffused phenomenon at the mesoscale, but localized at the microscale. This possibly accounts for variation in the energy input of the fluids, supposed to have triggered brecciation in such environments. - 2 - The co-occurrence of plastic and brittle behaviour proxies point to fluidification and associated brecciation phenomena taking place in a partly unlithified sedimentary column, typified by differential diagenesis. Both the carbonates and the pelitic fraction show an intense natural radioactivity (up to 63 Cps), mostly related to authigenic 238 U. The geochemical dataset is complex and shows wide ranges both in δ 18 O (+ 7. 74 down to - 9. 64 ‰ PDB) and δ 13 C values (+ 4. 14 down to - 43. 7 ‰ PDB). This is the result of: 1) originally mixed carbon sources involved in authigenesis; 2) a complex fluid-rock interaction; 3) different fluid composition in the different basins (in the Maiella Basin and at Capodarso - in the Caltanissetta basin - they were enriched in hydrocarbons; in the Calabrian Arc and in Centuripe - in the Caltanissetta basin - the nature of the fluids, was possibly saline). In addition, the coupled positive δ 18 O - negative δ 13 C widely typifying the Calcare di Base both in Sicily and Calabria, could be related to gas hydrate destabilization processes, since textures resembling gas-hydrate bearing sediments were observed as well. A revisiting of the term “seep limestone” is proposed herein, since the aforementioned facies and fabric association enucleates important sedimentological proxies for the detection of seep limestones: (a) irregular geometries of the geobodies; (b) primary fabric overprinting; (c) peculiar textural characters of breccias; (d) scale-independent and lithology-independent patterns; (e) complex rheology; (f) fabric resembling gas-hydrate infilling sediments. The upper Messinian brecciated limestones occur in correspondence to different phases of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, but are strictly related to the regional unconformity: the MES {{played a critical role in}} the brecciation processes. There is no evidence to consider the upper Messinian breccias as a stratigraphic unit: the processes of brecciation and widespread fluid migration took place, involving different stratigraphic levels, according to their rheology and to the structural local setting. The age of this processes is constrained to the early upper Messinian phase, before the development of the Lago-Mare event. The major drawdown of the Mediterranean Sea recorded by the MES corresponds to a huge sea level drop: this most likely represents the primary trigger for fluid migration: the high depressurization experienced by the sedimentary column after the removal of at least 1 km of water column, could have likely favoured a catastrophic migration of overpressured fluids from below...|$|R
40|$|Sixty {{exposures}} of lucinid deposits ("calcari a Lucina" of the literature) {{in different}} depositional and tectonic settings {{of the northern}} Apeninnes, from backland (satellite and minor basins) to foredeep (turbidites and closure deposits) and foreland (Sicily), were studied and, in many cases, reinterpreted in the field. Field and compositional data show that lucinid deposits include not only peculiar carbonate blocks, but a variety of lithologies and fossil assemblages: micritic limestones, <b>marly</b> limestones, <b>mudstones,</b> marls and arenitic marls, fine to coarse-grained arenites, fine to coarse-grained calcarenites, carbonate monomictic and polymictic breccias and microconglomerates. The fossil content is not only adscribable to the genus Lucina, but more generally to lucinids or other bivalves. Lithological and compositional characters are mainly controlled by the depositional and tectonic setting. Lucinid deposits from satellite basins and foredeep slope sediments show evidences of primary deposition while those included in foredeep turbidite deposits are clearly reworked. In some cases only isolated shells are reworked. Primary lucinid deposits occur as: - type 1) marly-calcareous and calcarenitic lenses or column-like bodies, crowded with articulated specimens usually representing the dominant fauna of an oligotypic community; these lenses are often clustered but not related to a precise stratigraphic level and they gradually pass to the host sediments (marly mudstones); - type 2) isolated specimens or associated with a dense high diversity fauna in mudstones, marls, arenitic and calcareous marls. Secondary lucinid deposits occur as: - type 3) carbonate olistoliths crowded with articulated or disarticulated specimens associated with an oligotypic fauna; they are usually enclosed within chaotic horizons made up of intraformational slumps, ligurian-subligurian olistostromes, ligurian-epiligurian olistoliths, resedimented arenitic beds and polymictic breccias, intercalated in turbiditic formations; - type 4) coquina debris, isolated articulated or disarticulated shells, (in few cases associated with abundant fauna from shelf areas) in resedimented arenites, calcarenites, carbonate breccias with biogenic debris (debrites). Most of the type- 1 and type- 3 deposits are strongly 13 C depleted, and are interpreted as chemosynthetic communities (pseudobioherms) with authigenic carbonate deposition related to methane-rich fluid vents. Petrographic data show that {{the composition of the}} siliciclastic fraction present in lucinid deposits is consistent with the composition of the host deposits. Lucinid deposits included in the foredeep turbidites of the Marnoso-arenacea and Cervarola Formations display a wide variety of textures and lithologies. Most of the samples are characterized by a sort of "chaotic" texture with an abundant terrigenous fraction associated with micritic intraclasts and planctonic foraminifera. The interstitial fraction is made of micrite, but microspatic to spatitic calcite cements and patchy poikilotopic calcite are also present. The composition of the terrigenous fraction shows a great similarity with the composition of the including turbidites, thus indicating only an intrabasinal reworking of lucinid deposits. In primary, non reworked lucinid deposits of the epiligurian (Termina Formation) and slope sediments (Vicchio and Letto Marls) the terrigenous fraction is absent or very scarse and fine-grained. Samples show more homogeneous textures and lithologies, mainly represented by micritic to biomicritic limestones; planctonic foraminifera are abundant. Detrital carbonate clasts of ligurian affinity are sometimes present in epiligurian lucinid outcrops. According to this study, primary pseudobioherms occur only in epiligurian and foredeep closure pelitic sediments, rich in organic matter. Lucinid deposits in the Marnoso-arenacea and Cervarola foredeep turbidites show evidence of a moderate reworking probably from adjacent slope pelites. Reworking processes are then related to the advancement of the deformational front, as indicated by slumps and olistostromes. Only lucinid deposits located {{at the top of the}} thrust belt front (satellite basins) or in mudstones marking the closure stage of the foredeep could have the possibility to be preserved as primary deposits, whereas most of the slope sediments, which represent the main source of secondary lucinid deposits, is reworked and resedimented in the turbiditic units. This is due to foredeep instability phenomena, probably heralding the tectonic events. On the other hand the cold seepage could have lowered the sediment shear strenght and opened the way to foredeep instability which in turn could let the gases out more easily. We hypothesize that the source of the oldest pseudobioherms is represented by the Vicchio Marls, whereas isolated shells and coquina debris in resedimented beds of the minor basins and of the problematic Cervarola-Falterona Formation of the Modena-Bologna Apennine, are probably originated from satellite basins or from faunal communities (methane related ?) located in pelitic horizons no more preserved. Confirming this hypothesis, two pelitic horizons bearing methanogenic lucinid blocks are still preserved in the inner Marnoso-arenacea. A comparison between lucinid concentration peaks (Serravallian-Tortonian and Tortonian-Messinian boundaries) and the neogenic tectonic events of the Apenninic chain do not show any particular relation. No direct connection between fracture planes and the irregular disposition of the non reworked lucinid deposits seems to be evident. Thus further studies are necessary in order to better understand the relations between the advancement of the thrust belt front and fluid escape. Isotopic, sedimentological, stratigraphycal and structural data seem to support that biogenic methane is likely to have been the main source for primary pseudobioherms and related carbonate deposits. The gas could have a shallow origin in local pockets from biodegradation of trapped organic matter. Lucinid pseudiobioherms grew in different open marine environment, from outer shelf to deep basins and do not characterize a precise paleogeographic or paleotectonic setting. Petrographic data also suggest to correlate the Castel Guerrino unit to the Marnoso-arenacea Formation and to interpret the middle Miocene Cervarola Formation of the Modena-Bologna Apennine as a minor foredeep basin (internal part of the Marnoso-arenacea Formation ?) ...|$|R
