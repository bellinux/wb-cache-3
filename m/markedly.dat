5|$|Washing {{and drying}} clothes resembles a noncommutative operation; washing and then drying {{produces}} a <b>markedly</b> different result to drying and then washing.|$|E
5|$|In Almendra's {{first record}} are the Beatles, Cortázar, the French May, free jazz, the {{experimentation}} of the Di Tella, the avant-garde tango, the folklore of projection, the French Nouvelle Vague, Borges, {{and the new}} trends in national plastic arts, among other influences, but none <b>markedly</b> mentioned or honored axiomatically.|$|E
5|$|In wine making, the {{delicate}} {{nature of the}} Riesling grape requires special handling during harvesting to avoid crushing or bruising the skin. Without this care, the broken skins could leak tannin into the juice, giving a <b>markedly</b> coarse taste and throwing off balance the Riesling's range of flavors and aromas.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, {{air traffic}} has {{increased}} <b>markedly</b> {{in recent years}} between Paris and the Gulf airports, the emerging nations of Africa, Russia, Turkey, Portugal, Italy, and mainland China, whereas noticeable decline has been recorded between Paris and the British Isles, Egypt, Tunisia, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} {{is caused}} by exposure to oxygen at partial pressures greater than those to which the body is normally exposed. This occurs in three principal settings: underwater diving, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, {{and the provision of}} supplemental oxygen, particularly to premature infants. In each case, the risk factors are <b>markedly</b> different.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{and water}} {{conservation}} projects <b>markedly</b> changed practices {{in the state and}} led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.|$|E
5|$|Tamazight is in {{the middle}} of a dialect {{continuum}} between Riff to its north-east and Shilha to its south-west. The basic lexicon of Tamazight differs <b>markedly</b> from Shilha, and its verbal system is more similar to Riff or Kabyle. Moreover, Tamazight has a greater amount of internal diversity than Shilha.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of ironclads {{tended to}} become concentrated {{in a small}} number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range; calibre and weight of guns increased <b>markedly</b> to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading.|$|E
5|$|The family Threskiornithidae {{includes}} the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings. Their bodies are elongated, the neck more so, with long legs. The bill is also long, curved downward in the ibises, straight and <b>markedly</b> flattened in the spoonbills.|$|E
5|$|Though {{it was one}} of {{the three}} first {{elements}} to be synthesized in the Big Bang, lithium, together with beryllium and boron, is <b>markedly</b> less abundant than other elements. This is a result of the low temperature necessary to destroy lithium, and a lack of common processes to produce it.|$|E
5|$|A {{library was}} {{operating}} from the wooden church building by 1860. Patronage {{of the library}} had declined <b>markedly</b> by the 20th century and by the 1930s it was virtually unused. A mobile library began calling in the 1960s {{and for a time}} called once per month. The bookmobile service was finally ended, for all places not only Whitemore, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that 12%, or around one in 10 people in Greater Manchester use Metrolink {{to travel to}} work, and 8% use the system every day. The system is most commonly used by 21- to 30-year olds, and was used most <b>markedly</b> by residents of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury — accounting for around {{a third of their}} commuter journeys.|$|E
5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, <b>markedly</b> different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change <b>markedly</b> with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E
5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; they held the absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before {{they were able to}} <b>markedly</b> alter the power structure.|$|E
5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is <b>markedly</b> {{different from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of his observations were made during his stay {{on the island of}} Lesbos, including especially his descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is <b>markedly</b> unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E
5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with it. Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is <b>markedly</b> thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.|$|E
5|$|Bjørnebye's {{experiences}} as a Reds' player in the 1994–95 season under the management of Roy Evans, were <b>markedly</b> more successful than that of previous campaigns. He gained a regular place in the senior team, supplanting the left back position from Julian Dicks, and featured in the 2–1 win against Bolton Wanderers in {{the final of the}} 1995 League Cup Final on 2 April 1995. Subsequent injury, a broken leg sustained on 5 April 1995 in a 3–1 win match against Southampton, terminated his season and he was replaced by Steve Harkness.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, navies across Europe {{had adopted}} ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles {{using the new}} ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships <b>markedly</b> different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of Gloire and Warrior. The use of ironclads by {{both sides in the}} American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs <b>markedly</b> from {{camouflage}} on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore <b>markedly</b> improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|D. s. harrissoni, {{known as}} the Bornean Rhinoceros or Eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, which was once common {{throughout}} Borneo; now, only about 15 individuals are estimated to survive. The known population lives in East Kalimantan, with them having recently gone extinct in Sabah. Reports of animals surviving in Sarawak are unconfirmed. This subspecies is named after Tom Harrisson, who worked extensively with Bornean zoology and anthropology in the 1960s. The Bornean subspecies is <b>markedly</b> smaller than the other two. The captive population consists of one male and two females at the Borneo Rhinoceros Sanctuary in Sabah.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus is {{both the}} type genus of, and gives its name to, the Diplodocidae, the family to which it belongs. Members of this family, while still massive, are of a <b>markedly</b> more slender build than other sauropods, such as the titanosaurs and brachiosaurs. All are characterised by long necks and tails and a {{horizontal}} posture, with fore limbs shorter than hind limbs. Diplodocids flourished in the Late Jurassic of North America and possibly Africa.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the <b>markedly</b> pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. He {{shows that the}} shape of the egg favours its {{movement}} along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased <b>markedly</b> over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are <b>markedly</b> affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|If {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is considered an opportunity to emphasize the <b>markedly</b> increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous pneumothorax. If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|Illyrian was {{spoken in}} the northwest, {{and to the}} {{northeast}} Thracian and Dacian. These three languages, all Indo-European, are sometimes thought to be earlier forms of Albanian. From his exile in Tomis on the Black Sea (present-day Constanța, Romania), the Augustan poet Ovid learned Getic and Sarmatian, and noted that Greek was spoken with a <b>markedly</b> Getic accent. Inscriptions from Tomis in the Imperial period are generally Greek, with Thracian personal names and religious references.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting the officers and seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was <b>markedly</b> different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, X.bracteatum can be {{distinguished}} from X.bicolor in Tasmania by its broader leaves and cobwebby hairs on the stems, and from X.macranthum in Western Australia by the flower head colour; the latter species has white flower heads whereas those of X.bracteatum are golden yellow. Xerochrysum subundulatum from alpine and subalpine areas of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania is rhizomatous, and has <b>markedly</b> pointed orange bracts. The eastern Australian species X. viscosum may {{be distinguished}} by its rough and sticky leaves.|$|E
5|$|Ishaan's {{situation}} changes {{when a new}} art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, {{joins the}} school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with developmental disabilities, Nikumbh's teaching style is <b>markedly</b> {{different from that of}} his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation <b>markedly</b> reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red tinge, unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on its belly and white spots on its secondaries, inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be <b>markedly</b> divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its calls are shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook plesseni {{is known}} from Pantar and Alor Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Erwin Stresemann in 1929. The upperparts are grey-brown and heavily spotted and marked with white, giving rise to a cross-barred pattern on its back. Its underparts have longitudinal white streaks and its tail is prominently barred. It lives in Eucalyptus urophylla woodlands, and has an unusual low-pitched call different to subspecies boobook. Genetic and call analysis show it to be <b>markedly</b> divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook rotiensis {{is found}} on Rote Island in the Lesser Sunda Islands. It was first {{described}} in 1997 by Australian biologists Ronald Johnstone and J.C. Darnell from a female {{collected in a}} mist net in 1990. It is smaller than subspecies boobook, with heavily barred primaries, rump and tail. Locally common, it is known to the local people as Tuterui and Kokorok. Genetic and call analysis show it to be <b>markedly</b> divergent from the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species.|$|E
