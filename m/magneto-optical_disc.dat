50|$|<b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>disc</b> {{storage is}} optical disc storage where the {{magnetic}} state on a ferromagnetic surface stores information. The information is read optically and written by combining magnetic and optical methods. <b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>disc</b> storage is non-volatile, sequential access, slow write, fast read storage used for tertiary and off-line storage.|$|E

50|$|An Ultra Density Optical disc or UDO is a 133.35 mm (5.25") ISO {{cartridge}} {{optical disc}} which can store up to 30 GB of data. The second generation UDO2 media {{was introduced in}} April 2007 and has a capacity of up to 60 GBs. Utilising a design based on a <b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>disc,</b> but using Phase Change technology combined with a blue violet laser, a UDO/UDO2 disc can store substantially more data than a <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disc</b> or MO, because of the shorter wavelength (405 nm) of the blue-violet laser employed. MOs use a 650 nm-wavelength red laser. Because its beam width is shorter when burning to a disc than a red-laser for MO, a blue-violet laser allows more information to be stored digitally in {{the same amount of}} space.|$|E

50|$|Large {{quantities}} of individual magnetic tapes, and optical or <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>discs</b> may {{be stored in}} robotic tertiary storage devices. In tape storage field they are known as tape libraries, and in optical storage field optical jukeboxes, or optical disk libraries per analogy. Smallest forms of either technology containing just one drive device {{are referred to as}} autoloaders or autochangers.|$|R
50|$|The MiniDisc is {{a similar}} concept again, using a small {{proprietary}} <b>Magneto-optical</b> type <b>disc</b> instead, also in a fixed unopenable caddy.|$|R
50|$|The DWDD (Domain Wall Displacement Detection) is a media {{reproducing}} technology developed Canon and Sony {{and first}} implemented {{in a commercial}} product in 2004 as part of Sony's Hi-MD format. The DWDD technology uses a physics phenomenon called domain wall displacement, which shortens the masks but {{does not need to}} change the laser beam. With such technology, the density of the <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disc</b> could be increased dramatically.|$|E
50|$|By default, {{magneto-optical}} drives verify information {{after writing}} {{it to the}} disc, {{and are able to}} immediately report any problems to the operating system. This means writing can actually take three times longer than reading, but it makes the media extremely reliable, unlike the CD-R or DVD-R media upon which data is written without any concurrent data integrity checking. Using a <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disc</b> is much more like using a diskette drive than a CD-RW drive.|$|E
50|$|A {{magneto-optical}} drive {{is a kind}} of optical disc drive capable of writing and rewriting data upon a <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disc.</b> Both 130 mm (5.25 in) and 90 mm (3.5 in) form factors exist. The technology was introduced commercially in 1985. Although optical, they appear as hard disk drives to the operating system and can be formatted with any file system. Magneto-optical drives were common in some countries, such as Japan because {{of the success of the}} Sony MiniDisc, but have fallen into disuse.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, Sony {{followed}} their counterpart Philips to the Compact Disc (CD). In addition to developing consumer-based recording media, after {{the launch of}} the CD Sony began development of commercially based recording media. In 1986 they launched Write-Once optical discs (WO) and in 1988 launched <b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>discs</b> which were around 125MB size for the specific use of archival data storage. [...] In 1984, Sony launched the Discman series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, just a {{year after}} the {{introduction}} of the Compact Disc, Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable <b>magneto-optical</b> Compact <b>Discs</b> during the 73rd AES Convention in Eindhoven. It took, however, almost 10 years before their idea was commercialized.|$|R
50|$|In computing, {{mass storage}} {{refers to the}} storage of large amounts of data in a {{persisting}} and machine-readable fashion. Devices and/or systems that {{have been described as}} mass storage include tape libraries, RAID systems, and a variety of computer drives such as hard disk drives, magnetic tape drives, <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disc</b> drives, optical disc drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives. It also includes experimental forms like holographic memory. Mass storage includes devices with removable and non-removable media. It does not include random access memory (RAM).|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{high quality}} and {{reliability}} in mechatronics products, thorough consideration of dynamic performance in structural design is essential. Typical {{examples include the}} design of optical pick-ups for disk related products, such as Compact Disc (CD) drives, and <b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>Disc</b> (MO) drives. Many researchers have developed design methodologies to optimize the nominal dynamic characteristics. Recently, robustness of dynamic performance has become an important issue in addition to optimizing nominal performance. Engineers seek {{to improve the quality}} of products by minimizing the effects of numerous variations that arise during the productâ€™s manufacturing and life-cycle operation. This paper reports on the application of the robust design concept to the dynamic design of an optical pick-up actuator focusing on shape synthesis using computer models and design of experiments. By comparing this approach to analytical sensitivity solution, the authors provide a rationale for using the relatively simple statistical approach with orthogonal arrays...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Telemetry Data Distribution System (TDDS) {{solves the}} need to record, archive, and {{distribute}} sounding rocket and satellite data on a compact, user-friendly medium, such as CD-Recordable discs. The TDDS also archives telemetry data on floppy disks, nine-track tapes, and <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>disc</b> cartridges. The PC-based, semi-automated, TDDS digitizes, time stamps, formats, and archives frequency modulated (FM) or pulse code modulated (PCM) telemetry data. An analog tape or a real-time signal may provide the telemetry data source. The TDDS accepts IRIG A, B, G, H, and NASA 36 analog code sources for time stamp data. The output time tag includes time, frame, and subframe status information. Telemetry data may be time stamped based upon a user-specified number of frames, subframes, or words. Once recorded, the TDDS performs data quality testing, formatting, and validation and logs the results automatically. Telemetry data is quality checked to ensure a good analog source track was selected. Raw telemetry data is formatted by dividing the data into records and appending header information. The formatted telemetry data is validated by checking consecutive time tags and subframe identification counter values (if applicable) to identify data drop-outs. After validation, the TDDS archives the formatted data {{to any of the}} following media types: CD-Recordable (CD-R) Disc (650 megabytes capacity); nine track tape (180 megabytes capacity); and erasable optical disc (499 megabytes capacity). Additionally, previously archived science data may be re-formatted and archived to a different output media...|$|E
