40|$|The {{greatest}} {{attention to}} the UK wind climatology has focused upon mean windspeeds, despite a knowledge of gust speeds being essential {{to a variety of}} users. This paper goes some way to redressing this imbalance by analysing observed daily <b>maximum</b> <b>gust</b> speeds from a 43 -station network over the period 1980 – 2005. Complementing these data are dynamically downscaled reanalysis data, generated using the PRECIS Regional Climate Modelling system, for the period 1959 – 2001. Inter-annual variations in both the observed and downscaled reanalysis gust speeds are presented, with a statistically significant (at the 95 % confidence interval) 5 % increase across the network in daily <b>maximum</b> <b>gust</b> speeds between 1959 and the early 1990 s, followed by an apparent decrease. The benefit of incorporating dynamically downscaled reanalysis data is revealed {{by the fact that the}} decrease in gust speeds since 1993 may be placed in the context of a very slight increase displayed over the longer 1959 – 2001 period. Furthermore, the severity of individual windstorm events is considered, with high profile recent events placed into the context of the long term record. A daily cycle is identified from the station observations in the timing of the daily <b>maximum</b> <b>gust</b> speeds, with an afternoon peak occurring between 12 : 00 – 15 : 00, exhibiting spatial and intra-annual variations...|$|R

40|$|The weather {{forecast}} centers in Australia {{and many other}} countries use a scale of cyclone intensity categories (categories 1 - 5) in their cyclone advisories, which {{are considered to be}} indicative of the cyclone damage potential.

In a recent research project involving computer modeling of cyclonic wind forces on roof claddings and fatigue damage to claddings, it was found that cyclone damage not only depends on the <b>maximum</b> <b>gust</b> wind speed, but also on two other cyclone parameters, namely, the forward speed and radius to maximum winds.

40|$|Part 1 of {{this paper}} reports results from the {{extensive}} full-scale slipstream measurements carried out {{as part of the}} AeroTRAIN project, and in particular concentrates on the ensemble analysis of this data. This paper concentrates on the analysis of <b>maximum</b> <b>gusts,</b> in order to make suggestions for modifications to the current technical specifications for interoperability (TSI) methodology. The very large data set obtained for one particular high-speed train type (the S- 103) enabled the variation of slipstream gusts with vehicle speed and wind speed to be determined. It was also possible to carry out a statistical analysis of the gusts that enabled the standard uncertainty of the TSI gust parameter to be determined. It was shown that for most trains the <b>maximum</b> <b>gusts</b> occurred in the near wake of the train, but for double-unit trains the <b>maximum</b> <b>gusts</b> could occur around the gap between the units and for locomotive/coach combinations the maxima could occur around the nose of the locomotive or at the discontinuity between the train and the locomotive. Perhaps the most significant result, which could allow a considerable simplification of the TSI methodology, was that if both trackside and platform measurements for a particular train were plotted against height above the rail, then, with very few exceptions, they fell onto one curve, which implies that a trackside measurement could replace the current required platform measurement. © IMechE 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub. co. uk/journalsPermissions. nav...|$|R

40|$|The {{case studies}} of two cold air {{outbreaks}} in Zagreb which cause a local wind bora on the eastern Adriatic area are presented (17 December 1978 and 7 January 1982). The cold air outbreak on 17 December 1978 appeared as a shallow zone of large equivalent potential temperature drop (Q e) and NE wind with maximum at 800 m above ground. The stable layer which was placed above this zone was more {{expressed in terms of}} vertical Q e - rather than temperature-structure which was consequence of very humid and warm air advected from SW above the cold bora layer. This upstream bora layer characteristics and strengthening of cyclonic activity on the Tyrrhenian Sea caused a longlasting and strong bora associated with precipitation on the northern Adriatic. The strongest bora with <b>maximum</b> <b>gusts</b> of 35. 2 m s - 1 and with the longest duration of bora was 28 - 40 hours with the <b>maximum</b> <b>gusts</b> varying from 14. 9 m s - 1 to 34. 7 m s - 1. In the case of 7 January 1982, a strong bora, associated with anticyclone strengthening over the middle Europe, occurred along the entire Adriatic coast as a consequence of an expressed cold and dry air outbreak. The main characteristic in this situation was a narrow zone of sudden drop of Q e and NE wind with a maximum at 2. 5 km altitude. The stability above this zone was smaller than in the first situation and the temperature fall occurred throughout the troposphere. Due to extremely dry air supply, the bora occurred without precipitation lasting from 16 to 31 hours and even 52 hours in Senj. The <b>maximum</b> <b>gusts</b> varied from 17. 0 m s - 1 to 35. 4 m s - 1.
