40|$|Energy {{consumption}} is a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>concern</b> {{in the world}} today. Research demonstrates that {{as a consequence of}} the constantly evolving and expanding field of information technology, data centers are now major consumers of electrical energy. Such high electrical energy consumption emphasizes the issues of sustainability and cost. Against this background, the present paper proposes a power load distribution algorithm (PLDA) to optimize energy distribution of data center power infrastructures. The PLDA, which is based on the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, is supported by an environment called ASTRO, capable of performing the integrated evaluation of dependability, cost and sustainability. More specifically, the PLDA optimizes the flow distribution of the energy flow model (EFM). EFMs are responsible for estimating sustainability and cost issues of data center infrastructures without crossing the restrictions of the power capacity that each device can provide (power system) or extract (cooling system). Additionally, a case study is presented that analyzed seven data center power architectures. Significant results were observed, achieving a reduction in power consumption of up to 15. 5 %...|$|E

One key aspect of POINT is to assess the ways in which groups and communities work to gain greatest use of information. Using an innovative methodology called ‘Triple Task’, the authors are applying a three cornered approach in order to gain an understanding as to how groups work, how they assesses themselves and how they appear to function from an external perspective. In this paper, the first stage of Triple Task is described and explored. Task One is effectively a ‘soft’ means for a group to work together on problem identification and action planning, and the key to this is the device is known as the Rich Picture. Rich Pictures have been used in group work for over thirty years, primarily as a means for the group to express its preliminary vision concerning a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>concern,</b> but so far they have not been applied as means to explore the conscious and unconscious workings of a group nor have they been assessed in terms of their content and ‘message’.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{examination}} of relationships between children’s perceptions of motivational climate, goal orientation, and their engagement in light- to vigorous-intensity physical activity. The sample comprised 585 school children at age of 11 to 16 -year-old from three small cities located in Northeast-Finland. The cross-sectional data was collected using online questionnaires in April 2014. The findings indicated that the higher task-involving motivational climate in physical education the children reported, the higher total light- and moderate-intensity levels they accumulated. Task-involving climate also indicated higher task orientation and ego-involving climate higher ego orientation. Additionally, the more children accumulated light-intensity physical activity, the more they engaged in moderate and vigorous physical activity. No indirect paths were observed from task- and ego-involving climate to light- and moderate- or vigorousintensity activity via task or ego orientation.

40|$|Urban {{residents}} have been using internet technologies for civic and political discussion since {{the earliest days of}} Usenet. A large part of this online talk is distinguished by its informality and spontaneity. This dissertation analyzes informal discussion as actually practiced in everyday, computer-mediated settings. The project considers the ways in which online discourse operates at a moment in political life in which day-to-day issues of urban living are articulated, contested, and brought into focus as public concerns. Using data collected from a 1. 5 year online ethnography based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the dissertation characterizes this informal, publicly-oriented discussion as networked public talk. Networked public talk has four principal characteristics: (1) the primary activity is sustained discussion among citizens; (2) it is talk characterized by informality, not governed by procedural rules or a pre-existing agenda; (3) it is mediated through networked technologies and comprised of publicly-viewable discussions; and (4) it involves issues of collective concerns, rather than purely personal issues. What constitutes these public matters is not pre-determined nor are the issues predefined—they emerge and take shape through public talk. The concept of networked public talk foregrounds the relationship between informal political discussion and a specific moment in public life in which participants are sifting through, articulating, and bringing into focus what are their collective concerns. In this sense, networked public talk is conceived as political because it is through talk that citizens demonstrate that an issue should be a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>concern.</b> The dissertation proposes that informal talk online be understood as a process of making sense of public issues. It looks at three components of that process in online urban forums: the ways in which public issues are brought to attention, articulated, and sustained as focal points of conversation through the use of internet technologies as discussion mediums; how an information architecture and established participant norms both support and constrain a sometimes serendipitous encounter with a multiplicity of perspectives; and how the networked discussion and recognition of public issues is mediated through and helps to construct lived material places...|$|E
40|$|Die Europaeische Waehrungsunion (EWU) gilt als neuer Rahmen sowohl fuer die europaeische Geldpolitik als auch fuer die Finanzpolitiken der einzelnen Mitgliedsstaaten. Die EWU stellt eine waehrungspolitische Vereinbarung dar, die eine Waehrungsautoritaet mit mehreren {{nationale}}n Finanzautoritaeten konfrontiert. Der Anspruch besteht darin, die Finanzpolitik durch eine einzelne zentrale Behoerde auf der Ebene der Waehrungsunion zu bestimmen anstelle mittels der herkoemmlichen nationalen Waehrungssysteme. In den Abkommen der Europaeischen Union (Maastrichter bzw. Amsterdamer Abkommen) ist festgelegt, dass die Finanzpolitik eine nationale Kompetenz der EWU-Mitgliedslaender bleibt, allerdings einige Einschraenkungen beachtet werden muessen. Dazu gehoeren unter anderem das Verfahren der gegenseitigen Ueberwachung, die Begrenzung des Haushaltsdefizits, der Stabilitaets- und Wachstumspakt sowie jene Klausel, wonach die EU und die Mitgliedslaender nicht gegen ihren Willen fuer die finanziellen Verbindlichkeiten eines oder mehrerer Mitglieder eintreten muessen. Der Beitrag gibt einen Ueberblick ueber die wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Grundlagen dieser waehrungspolitischen Massnahmen, die institutionelle Ausgestaltung und die bisherigen Erfahrungen in der EWU. Die Ausfuehrungen beginnen mit einer Diskussion der institutionellen Entwicklungen. Im Anschluss werden die Aspekte der Finanzdisziplin und des Wachstums behandelt. Der Bericht schliesst mit einer Zusammenfassung und gibt einen Ausblick auf die zukuenftige europaeische Waehrungspolitik. (ICGUebers) 'The European Monetary Union (EMU), {{which began}} on 1 January 1999, {{is a new}} framework not only for monetary policy, {{but also for the}} fiscal policies of its member states. EMU is an exceptional monetary arrangement in that it confronts a monetary authority with multiple, large national fiscal authorities rather a single central government conducting fiscal policy {{at the level of the}} monetary union, as in conventional, national monetary systems. In 2001, total government spending in the euro area was 43. 6 percent of the combined GDP, but Community spending was below 1. 3 percent of GDP. The combined gross public debt of the euro area states was 69. 1 percent of GDP, while EU debt is negligible. The need to create a genuine institutional framework to deal with this exceptional degree of fiscal decentralization in a monetary area was recognized clearly in the blue-print for monetary union in Europe, the Delors Report (1989). Building on its predecessor, the Werner Report (1970), the Delors Report called for institutional provisions safeguarding fiscal discipline in the monetary union, arguing that a lack of fiscal discipline might undermine the stability of the new currency. Furthermore, the Delors Report argued that the fiscal policies of the member states needed to be coordinated to assure a smooth macro economic functioning of EMU, and that there should be some degree of fiscal equalization among the members transferring public resources from member states in cyclical upswings to those in cyclical downswings. The Treaty on European Union (TEU), i. e., the Maastricht Treaty and its successor, the Amsterdam Treaty, did not accomplish that agenda in its full extent. Fiscal policy remains a national competence for EMU member states, but under several constraints. According to Art 4 (3) of the TEU, 'sound public finances' are one of the guiding principle of economic policy in the EU. EU Procedures with relevance to the conduct and coordination of fiscal policy are the Mutual Surveillance Procedure (Article 99), the 'No-bail-out clause' (Art 103), the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP, Art. 104), and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP, Council Regulations 1466 / 97, 1476 / 97, Council Resolution 97 /C 236 / 01 - 02). Art 99 holds that the member states of the EU regard their economic policies as a <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>common</b> <b>concern</b> and coordinate them through the ECOFIN Council and on the basis of 'Broad Economic Guidelines'. The No-bail-out rule protects the Community and the member states from becoming responsible for financial liabilities of other member states against their will. The EDP sets up a detailed process of monitoring the public finances of the member states with a view to ensuring that they remain sustainable. It includes the mandate (Article 3 of the Protocol) that the member states of EMU should implement appropriate institutions at the national level that enable them to fulfill their obligation for maintaining sustainable finances. There is, however, no explanation of what this obligation means in practice. The SGP refines and concretises the procedures of the EDP. In this paper, we review the economic rationales for each of these issues, the relevant institutional provisions, and the experience in EMU so far. We begin with a discussion of the institutional developments. In section 3, we turn to the issue of fiscal discipline and growth. The final section concludes and looks ahead towards the future.
