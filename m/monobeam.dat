5000|$|Inventing and {{promoting}} the Project 21 <b>monobeam,</b> later System 21, the world's only aerial rail system suitable for networks above city streets. Whereas a classical monorail requires {{a pair of}} beams for two-way traffic and its switching limitations hinder its ability to run on networks, the <b>monobeam</b> carries opposite trains alongside a single slender beam; its footprint is smaller, and its breakthrough switching technology enables it to form networks.System 21 was praised by two Secretaries of Transportation and Vice President Al Gore {{as well as the}} Regional Plan Association in two federally supported books. In March 1989, the Federal Register noted, [...] "This project has high technical merit representing an innovative technology which has a strong possibility of allowing for future reductions in the nation's energy consumption." ...|$|E

Early in his career, he pioneered technologies for U.S. space and missile defense programs. He {{went on to}} invent and promote high-speed Gravity-Vacuum Transit and <b>monobeam</b> rail transit. He obtained a total of 14 patents in those areas.|$|E

50|$|The red {{and gold}} armor was {{composed}} of an ultra-fine 3-D knit alloy and incorporated motors into the knitting to allow full mobility. The armor also included a stealth mode. While it ran on {{the same type of}} power, the power consumption was much more efficient. The boot jets were upgraded to chemically fueled thrusters, which provided a much faster flight speed. Weaponry consisted of the chest-mounted Mk II <b>Monobeam</b> (useful range was still only several yards), repulsor rays, a proton gun, and powerful electromagnets to pull metal objects to him or repel/push them away. Communications and sensors consisted of a short-wave radio. Other features included an image reproducer and collapsible roller skates. Most functions were controlled by miniature electronic switches mounted on the insides of various pieces of the armor such as the helmet and the gloves; by pressing various combinations of them, different systems were engaged. The switches in the helmet were enabled by the wearer's tongue; other functions were enabled by wrist-mounted controls.|$|E
50|$|Stark's grey armor was {{the first}} Iron Man armor he built and (in retrospect) a {{prototype}} for the later models. It was built around an iron chest plate designed to prevent the piece of shrapnel he received in Vietnam from travelling to his heart and killing him. The armor, made from ordinary iron, provided protection from physical attacks, small arms, fire, extreme temperatures, some forms of energy, and acid. Powered by flat linear armature DC motors (rechargeable via any electrical outlet), the exoskeleton boosted {{the strength of the}} wearer by about 10 times, and employed motion-sensing negative feedback to control movement. Air pressure jets allowed for extended jumps (but not true flight) and removable suction cups allowed the wearer to cling to walls and ceilings. Weaponry included a chest-mounted <b>monobeam</b> (proton beam generator; useful range was only a few yards), a miniature hacksaw that could be attached to the gauntlet's fingertip, and magnetic turbo-insulators that allowed Stark to magnetically deflect metal projectiles or bring metal objects to him. Sensors consisted of a short-wave radio. All of the armor's devices and functions were manually controlled by the wearer. Stark used it to escape terrorists in Vietnam who were holding him hostage. He constructed at least one updated, form-fitting (although still rigid) version upon his return to the United States.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} make this armor - which {{originally}} was gun-metal grey, like the original - less frightening to the general public, Stark created a gold-colored version with {{a wide array of}} improvements over the original. The new armor used the three dimensional, collapsible micro-structure now common in Stark's suits, so that it could be folded up and stored in his briefcase while inactive. The chest-plate was streamlined so that it could be worn under normal clothing without being noticeable. The suit had a semi-rigid interior with 3D knitted metallic exterior of a lightweight iron alloy, providing the same protection as his old suit did. This was also the first suit to be equipped with a force field generator. Power was still provided by flat linear armature DC motors, rechargeable by solar power as well as electrical outlets, and motion sensing was still provided by negative feedback. The Mk II air pressure boot-jets provided limited flight; steering while flying was accomplished by bodily movement. Weaponry consisted of the chest-mounted Mk II <b>Monobeam</b> (usable as either a concussive force beam or a heat beam), a sledgehammer, hacksaws extending from the fingertips, hand drills, electromagnets allowing him to pull things to him and push them away, and an electrical field generator. Communications and sensor arrays consisted of a loudspeaker, short-wave two-way radio, radar, and a tape recorder. When one iteration of this particular armor was partially destroyed by the Melter, a super-villain who could dissolve iron and iron alloys with a special ray, Stark built an exact copy using aluminium instead of iron, which was unaffected by the Melter's ability to dissolve iron.|$|E

30|$|Due to {{the limited}} and {{expensive}} spectrum resource, cognitive radio communication can be an efficient technique to enhance the spectrum efficiency {{in the context of}} coexistence of heterogeneous networks. Heterogeneous networks may exist within the same spectrum band in different ways such as two terrestrial networks or two satellite networks. In the terrestrial paradigm, the coexistence of small cells and macrocells can be considered within the same spectrum while in the satellite paradigm {{the focus is on the}} coexistence of <b>monobeam</b> and multibeam satellite systems. Heterogeneous networks in this article refer to small/macro cell terrestrial and mono/multibeam satellite systems. In the context of terrestrial paradigm, the macrocell system can be considered as primary and a small cell system as secondary system. Similarly, in the context of dual satellite coexistence scenarios, a <b>monobeam</b> system can be considered as primary and a multibeam system as secondary. In both scenarios, the interference from the secondary system to the primary system should be suppressed while the secondary system must tolerate the interference from the primary system.|$|E

Furthermore, Frequency Packing (FP) {{can be considered as}} an important technique for enhancing the spectrum efficiency in spectrum-limited satellite applications. In this paper, we consider a spectral coexistence scenario of a multibeam satellite and a <b>monobeam</b> satellite with the <b>monobeam</b> satellite as primary and the multibeam satellite as secondary. In this context, this paper focuses on examining the effect of FP on the performance of multi-carrier based IA technique. For this purpose, different IA techniques such as coordinated IA, uncoordinated IA and static IA have been considered. The effect of FP on the performance of different IA techniques in the considered scenario is evaluated in terms of system sum rate and primary rate protection ratio. It is shown that the system sum rate increases with the FP factor for all the techniques and the primary rate is perfectly protected with the coordinated IA technique even with dense FP...|$|E

The multicarrier model considered in this scenario differs from MIMO (spatial) channel matrix with full entries as considered in the terrestrial scenario.|$|E

Compared to classic 2 D images from <b>monobeam</b> echo-sounder, new descriptors must be found for 3 D images, which give more detailed information on objects. Viewing objects patterns as realizations of spatial point processes, descriptive statistics providing a joint characterization of visual content and spatial organization of the image are investigated. This method is then applied to classify fish schools on 2 D and 3 D sonar images. Reported experiments illustrate the relevance of the proposed descriptors...|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} a single ST 1, N number of ST 2 s served by N beams of SAT 2. Multibeam joint processing is considered at the gateway of SAT 2 to decode the received signals from ST 2 s jointly. Since a single gateway {{is responsible for}} processing the transmitted and received signals corresponding to a large geographic area, the application of joint processing techniques in the satellite context is centralized. After scheduling, we consider that one ST 1 and N number of ST 2 s are transmitting simultaneously in a single slot over a common spectrum band. In this context, we consider spatial multiplexing for the primary <b>monobeam</b> system and we employ multiple dimensions (carriers) in the secondary multibeam system to align interference with the reference vector.|$|E
30|$|The {{spectral}} {{coexistence of}} heterogenous networks in terrestrial and satellite paradigms has been investigated. The coexistence of small cells and macrocells equipped with MIMO transceivers in terrestrial paradigm and the coexistence of multibeam and <b>monobeam</b> satellites with multicarrier transceivers in satellite paradigm have been considered. The primary only {{case has been}} compared to the coexistence scenarios with no mitigation, resource division and different IA techniques. More specifically, three types of IA have been considered depending on the level of network coordination and on whether it adapts to channel conditions. The different techniques have been compared in terms of system rate, primary to secondary rate ratio and primary rate protection rate. From the results, it can be deduced that the coordinated IA perfectly protects the primary rate. Although no mitigation achieves the highest sum-rate in terrestrial coexistence scenario, the primary protection rate degrades with the number of small cells. From the viewpoint of protecting primary rate as well as achieving the highest rate, the coordinated IA technique is the best among all other techniques in satellite coexistence scenario.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{sea floor}} {{characterization}} is mainly {{based on the}} signal or image processing of the data acquired using an active acoustic system called sediment sonar. Each processing method suits {{a specific type of}} sonar, such as the <b>monobeam,</b> the multibeam, or the side-scan sonar. Most types of sonar offer a two dimensional view of the sea floor surface. Therefore, a high resolution image results which can be further analyzed. The inconvenient is that the sonar cannot view inside of the sea floor for a deeper analysis. Therefore, lower frequency acoustic systems are used for in-depth sea floor penetration (boomer, sparker, airguns or sub-bottom profilers). In this case, a mono dimensional signal results. Previous studies on the low-frequency systems are mainly based on the visual inspection by a geological human expert. To automatize this process, we propose the use of feature sets based on the transposed expert fuzzy reasoning. Two features are extracted, the first based on the sea floor contour and the second based on the sub-bottom sediment texture...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increased}} motorcar popularity, public transport use has declined while congestion costs billions in wasted time, fuel, accidents, {{air and water}} pollution. Proposed passenger transport projects have been cancelled in major cities, and completed projects have not attracted the private motorist. This study investigates reasons for this. As cities grow vertically and horizontally, they form three-dimensional mazes requiring special transport design solutions that enhance the city. Congestion can be alleviated by transferring passenger transport onto elevated solutions such as the presented Elevated Small Group Automated Rapid Transit (ESGART) SkyCabs system, which straddles the gap between Group Rapid Transit (GRT) and Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). This two-way <b>monobeam</b> is detailed, including ease of building through cities and low construction cost. Architectural and engineering aspects of eight-seater cabs, cab frequency, stations, and lines are described.

30|$|The {{coexistence}} of heterogeneous networks {{within the same}} spectrum for enhancing the spectrum efficiency has attracted large interest lately in the research community. Furthermore, the research interest towards the deployment of small cells and multibeam satellites is increasing due to high capacity, easier deployment and higher energy efficiency. However, due to the scarcity of available spectrum and the requirement of additional spectrum for these systems, small cells need to coexist with macrocells and multibeam satellites need to coexist with <b>monobeam</b> satellites within the same spectrum. In this context, this contribution investigates an underlay spectral coexistence mechanism which exploits an interference alignment (IA) technique in order to mitigate the interference of cognitive transmitters towards the primary receivers in a normal uplink mode. More specifically, three types of IA techniques, namely static, uncoordinated and coordinated are investigated. The performance of the IA technique is evaluated and compared with primary only, resource division and no-mitigation techniques in terms of sum-rate capacity, primary to secondary rate ratio and primary rate protection ratio. It is shown that the coordinated IA technique perfectly protects the primary rate in both terrestrial and satellite coexistence scenarios.|$|E
40|$|Interference Alignment (IA) {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as a promising interference mitigation technique since it can achieve the optimal degrees of freedom in certain interference limited channels. In the context of Cognitive Radio (CR) networks, this technique allows the coexistence of two heterogeneous wireless systems in an underlay cognitive mode. The main concept behind this technique is the alignment of the interference on a signal subspace {{in such a way}} that it can be filtered out at the non-intended receiver by sacrificing some signal dimensions. This chapter starts with an overview of IA principle, Degree of Freedom (DoF) concept, and the classification of existing IA techniques. Furthermore, this chapter includes a discussion about IA applications in CR networks. Moreover, a generic system model is presented for allowing the coexistence of two heterogeneous networks using IA approach while relevant precoding and filtering processes are described. In addition, two important practical applications of the IA technique are presented along with the numerical results for underlay spectral coexistence of (i) femtocell-macrocell systems, and (ii) monobeam-multibeam satellite systems. More specifically, an uplink IA scheme is investigated in order to mitigate the interference of femtocell User Terminals (UTs) towards the macrocell Base Station (BS) in the spatial domain and the interference of multibeam satellite terminals towards the <b>monobeam</b> satellite in the frequency domain...|$|E
30|$|The {{coexistence}} of heterogeneous {{networks in the}} same spectrum band can be modeled as cognitive radio networks with interference channels between primary and secondary systems. The operation of the primary network usually follows a well established standard {{and should not be}} degraded while the secondary network should employ advanced communication techniques to exploit the underutilized dimensions in the signal space. When the strength of secondary interference to the primary is comparable to the desired signal, treating as noise is not an option because of interference constraints while decoding and canceling requires complex primary receivers. In this context, interference alignment (IA) as an interference mitigation tool has received important attention recently in the cognitive radio research community [6, 7]. The concept behind IA is that signals can be designed {{in such a way that}} they cast overlapping shadows at the receivers where they constitute interference and remain distinguishable at the receivers where they are desired. In this direction, this study investigates an underlay spectral coexistence mechanism which exploits uplink interference alignment in order to mitigate the interference of small cell user terminals (UTs) towards the macrocell base station (BS) or the interference of multibeam satellite terminals towards the <b>monobeam</b> satellite. The proposed IA technique is compared to a passive transmission technique which allows for cochannel interference, as well as to a resource splitting approach which would require altering the spectrum regulations. Furthermore, the performance of different IA techniques is evaluated in terms of ergodic sum-rate capacity, primary to secondary rate ratio and primary rate protection ratio.|$|E
30|$|Due to the advancements in {{terrestrial}} cellular {{technology and}} satellite multibeam technology, denser deployments of cells/beams has become possible for providing higher capacity and network availability. Small cell systems provide higher cellular capacity {{and a large}} number of small cells is in general more energy efficient than macrocells since there is more flexibility of operating unused small cells in sleep mode due to their smaller coverage area [1]. Similarly, in satellite systems, multiple beams can be employed instead of a single global beam in order to enhance the capacity [2]. A geostationary satellite can be equipped with multibeam antennas to cover the multiple spots over the surface of the Earth. However, current network configurations use macrocell/monobeam systems and the deployment of new small cells/multibeam systems need additional bandwidth which is scarce and expensive to acquire. In this context, dense cellular networks (small cells) have to coexist with traditional macrocells and multibeam satellites have to coexist with the traditional <b>monobeam</b> satellites to utilize the existing spectrum optimally. This need has led to the concept of cognitive radio communications which allows for the coexistence of two systems, primary and secondary, over the same spectrum. The most common cognitive techniques in the literature can be categorized into spectrum sensing (SS) or interweave, underlay, overlay and database techniques [3]. In SS only techniques [4, 5], secondary users (SUs) are allowed to transmit whenever primary users (PUs) do not use that specific band, whereas in underlay techniques, SUs are allowed to transmit as long as they meet the interference constraint of the PUs.|$|E

The increased popularity of the private vehicle and the low budgets available to public-transport (PT) planners have meant that PT patronage has decreased significantly from what it once was. This has led to congestion and pollution problems in many cities around the world. It is thus apparent that a new, high quality and sustainable PT system is needed to open the opportunity to attract more people to use PT. This work describes such a system called SkyCabs. The SkyCabs concept is comprised of many lightweight, driverless cabs running two ways on a single elevated <b>monobeam.</b> With each cab seating up to eight people, the aim is to create a feeling of personal travel, and by doing so increase the level of patronage on PT services.

30|$|The IA is {{combined}} with the CR system to divide the signal space and the interference space so that the interference can be avoided between PU and SU signals. Amir et al. analyzed the degree of freedom (DoF) available in IA-based PU and SU networks and maximized the transmission rate of the PU through water-filling [16]. Zhou et al. proposed optimizing the precoding matrix and power allocation to increase the transmission rate of SUs in a network of single PUs and multiple SUs [17]. Men et al. proposed an algorithm that guarantees the transmission performance of the PU using a partial IA algorithm [18]. IA-based CR {{can be applied to}} applications considering interference between heterogeneous systems. Chatzinotas and Ottersten applied IA to small cells to mitigate interference in macrocell base stations in small cells [19], and Huang et al. investigated a joint opportunistic interference avoidance scheme using the interweave paradigm-based Gale-Shapley spectral-sharing scheme to mitigate interference between a macrocell network and a femtocell network [20]. Sharma et al. proposed a coordinated and uncoordinated approach in a system consisting of <b>monobeam</b> and multibeam satellites as well as macrocell and small-cell systems [21]. On the other hand, methods of accessing the information of the PU and performing IA were proposed. Chen et al. proposed a system that helps the PU to transfer data while the SU uses a DoF that is not used by the PU [22], and Guler and Yener collected all channel information and proposed an interference technique using successive semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation [23]. And Perlaza et al. allow the SU to transmit signals without interfering with the PU through the remaining eigenmodes that are not used by the PU [24]. Hasani-Baferani et al. enabled the SU to perform IA by providing a femtocell with eigenmode information of the PU in a macrocell and femtocell system [25]. Zhao et al. optimized the sum rate of SUs, limiting it to the transmission rate threshold of the PU so that the sum rate of the entire network is optimized according to PU requirements [26].|$|E

Sur y Oriente de Fuerteventura y Lanzarote is one of the areas chosen to be depicted in the frame of INDEMARES project, although the study about benthic habitats and fishery footprint carried by IEO has restricted to Amanay and El Banquete Seamounts. El Banquete really is the extension of southern continental shelf while Amanay seamount is located at 25 km from Jand´ıa Lighthouse (S of Fuerteventura) and 55 km from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, at the coordinates 28 º 07 ’ Latitude N and 14 º 44 ’ LongitudeW, both volcanic buildings raise from more than 2, 000 m up to their summits at 25 - 30 m deep, separated by a 1. 500 m deep channel. The biological richness of Amanay and El Banquete seamounts is very influenced by the deep water up-welling phenomena, which create a high productivity, attracting a multitude of pelagic species, such as cetaceans, turtles, sharks, and tunas looking for food. There is also a high influence from Saharian up-welling. Both the seamounts tops and their vicinities are often visited by a large artisanal local fishing fleet which profits of their fishery resources; also a rich invertebrate fauna cohabits in their bottoms. In general, its main impacts are related to uncontrolled fishing pressure, and maritime navigation. The available information on the anthropogenic impact of the area was scarce, and its level of research was very poor as well, before INDEMARES project. Methodology approach complies with a multidisciplinary perspective, having described the area from geological, oceanographic, biological and fisheries points of view.
