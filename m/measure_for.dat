His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of <b>Measure</b> <b>for</b> Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how the importance that {{is attributed to}} a variety of financial and non-financial performance measures depends on the type of use - evaluation versus reward. Survey data, collected on a sample of industrial companies, provide consistent evidence of a difference in the importance attached to performance <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> these two uses. More importance is attached to both financial and non-financial performance <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> the periodic evaluation than for variable rewards. The study also shows that the influence of production strategy and departmental interdependence on the importance attached to performance <b>measures</b> differs <b>for</b> evaluation and reward uses. A production strategy focused on differentiation by product-performance has a negative effect on the importance attached to financial <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> variable rewards but no effect on their importance for periodic evaluation. Moreover, departmental interdependence decreases the importance attached to financial <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> variable rewards but not for periodic evaluation. Departmental interdependence also has only a positive effect on non-financial <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> periodic evaluation and no effect on non-financial <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> variable rewards. Overall, the data suggest that it is essential to distinguish between different uses when studying performance measurement choices and their determinants. ...|$|R

5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to <b>measure</b> <b>for</b> a first down.

A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E

5|$|Obtaining {{funding for}} the battleships was a {{struggle}} for the Japanese government. The initial request was submitted in the budget of Prime Minister Matsukata Masayoshi in 1891, but was deleted by the Diet of Japan due to political infighting. Matsukata submitted the request again and, when again denied, was forced to dissolve his cabinet. His successor, Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi, attempted to pass the funding measure in 1892, but he also failed. This led to an extraordinary personal intervention by Emperor Meiji in a statement dated 10 February 1893, wherein the emperor offered to fund {{the construction of the}} two battleships himself, through an annual reduction in the expenses of the Imperial Household, and asked that all government officials likewise agree to a reduction in their salaries by ten percent. The funding <b>measure</b> <b>for</b> the Fuji-class battleships was passed by the Japanese Diet soon after. Completion of the ships was originally scheduled for 1899, but the start of the First Sino-Japanese War shortly before they were laid down in 1894 caused the government to accelerate the schedule by two years.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary <b>measure</b> <b>for</b> the realization of the aims of the park.
