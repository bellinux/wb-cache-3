40|$|To {{determine}} the number of maximal <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> manoeuvres needed to obtain a reproducible value of maximal inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> (MIP), we studied 44 patients with chronic airflow obstruction, with a mean (SD) % predicted FEV 1 value of 53. 9 (25), who were clinically stable. Maximal inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> was determined with an anaeroid manometer during maximal inspiratory efforts in a quasi static condition at residual volume. All patients performed 20 consecutive maximal inspiratory mouth manoeuvres, each one separated by 30 - 40 seconds. The mean (SD) values of MIP varied from 71. 5 (25. 5) cm H 2 O at the first measurement to 80. 1 (27) cm H 2 O at the last measurement. Maximal values of MIP were usually achieved after nine determinations. It is concluded that to obtain a reproducible MIP value in patients with chronic airflow obstruction who are untrained and unexperienced in such manoeuvres a minimum of nine technically acceptable maximal <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> manoeuvres should be performed...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{compared}} a small portable <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> meter (MPM) to our laboratory standard (LS) pressure recording equipment {{in order to}} evalu-ate this new device. The <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> meter measures and displays as a digital read-out peak pres-sure for inspiratory and expiratory efforts. It samples the signal at 16 Hz, and an integral microprocessor is programmed to determine and display the maximum pressure averaged over one second both during inspiratory and expiratory mano-euvres (PImax and PEmax, respectively). A fine bore catheter connecting the mouth-piece of the <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> meter to a Validyne pressure transducer enabled simultaneous measurement of pressure, which was analysed by LabVIEW, running on a Macintosh Quadra 700 computer. We studied 13 normal subjects and 11 patients with respiratory disease. Each subject performed inspiratory and five expi-ratory efforts. The values displayed from the <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> meter were manu-ally recorded. The <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> meter reliably and accurately measured peak pressure and maximal pressure both for inspiratory and expiratory efforts in normals and patients. The mean±SD difference {{when compared with the}} Validyne method was 0. 19 ± 0. 12 and- 0. 04 ± 0. 12 kPa, for PImax and PEmax, respectively.

Methods and Results We conducted a randomized con-trolled trial of 8 weeks of inspiratory muscle training in 18 patients with stable chronic heart failure, using the Threshold> trainer. Patients were randomized either to a training group inspiring for 30 min daily at 30 % of maxi-mum inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure,</b> or to {{a control group}} of ‘sham ’ training at 15 % of maximum inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure.</b> Sixteen of the 18 patients completed the study.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus, certain {{laboratory tests}} and evidence from muscle biopsy specimens of lymphocytic vasculitis reflect disease activity. A {{study was designed}} to determine if such indices predict respiratory lesions, and in particular whether the presence of vasculitis in quadriceps muscle reflects respiratory muscle function. METHODS: Twenty seven 27 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were studied, ten of whom were consecutive untreated patients and 17 having clinically active disease and being treated. They were prospectively evaluated on the basis of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lymphocyte count, C 3 degradation products, quadriceps muscle biopsy, spirometry, lung volumes, carbon monoxide transfer factor, and <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> during a maximal sniff. RESULTS: Lung function test results were abnormal in 12 patients. Vital capacity was reduced in seven, carbon monoxide transfer factor capacity in five, and <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> was low (< 70 % predicted) in ten. Lymphocytic vasculitis was seen in the muscle biopsy specimens of ten patients. No correlation was found between laboratory tests and lung function or <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure,</b> or between the presence of lymphocytic vasculitis and <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure.</b> In untreated patients, those with lymphocytic vasculitis had lower spirometric values. CONCLUSIONS: In systemic lupus erythematosus, evidence from muscle biopsy specimens of lymphocytic vasculitis is not predictive of impaired inspiratory muscle function as measured by <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure.</b> In untreated patients there were relationships between some laboratory test results and respiratory function, but {{this was not the case}} for the whole group. In systemic lupus erythematosus, laboratory tests and evidence from muscle biopsy specimens of lymphocytic vasculitis are therefore unlikely to be helpful in the assessment of respiratory disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Maximal inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> are {{suitable}} for non-invasive evaluation of respiratory muscle function. Different studies on PIMAX give predicted normal values and their relation to anthropometric data. Due to a large inter-subject variation of PIMAX, predicted values, however, maximal inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> are not suitable to define the individual expected normal PIMAX. What is the lower limit of the normal range?Methods: PIMAX has been prospectively measured in {{a representative sample of}} 504 healthy volunteers (248 males and 256 females) between 18 and 82 years of age with normal lung function. Age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and smoking status were recorded and incorporated stepwise in a multiple regression analysis to determine prediction equations. Lower limits of the normal range were defined as the fifth percentile of the residuals derived from the regression model. Results: Mean values of PIMAX were 9 · 95 kPa for men and 7 · 43 kPa for women. Significant correlations were found with height, weight, BMI, FEV 1, PEF and FVC (P< 0 · 01). The strongest correlation appeared with sex and age (P< 0 · 001). Smoking status and smoked pack-years were not independent predictors of inspiratory pressures. Lower limits of normal were 59 % for women and 60 % for men of the predicted PIMAX. Conclusions: In the interpretation of maximal inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures,</b> normal values should represent the lower limit of the normal range derived from the regression model in order to avoid false pathological results. Prediction equations as well as lower limits of normal resulting from a study cohort of healthy 18 – 82 -year-olds are given and are recommended to be used by pulmonary function laboratories in young and old patients...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{respiratory}} function in patients with growth hormone (GH) deficiency. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate lung volumes and respiratory muscle strength in patients diagnosed as GH deficient in childhood. Ten patients diagnosed as GH deficient in childhood and ten healthy subjects entered the study. For each subject the evaluation of respiratory function followed the same standard approach, consisting of respiratory muscle strength assessment, recording of flow-volume curves, measurement of static lung volumes and lung diffusing capacity. Both maximal inspiratory and expiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> were decreased in GH deficiency. Vital capacity, N 2 functional residual capacity and total lung capacity were significantly reduced when compared to healthy subjects. Conversely, the residual volume and diffusing lung capacity to CO did not show any significant change. No significant change of percentage forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio was observed. The decrease of respiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> was not correlated to the decrease of lung volumes. In conclusion, the results of this study show that adult patients affected with childhood onset GH deficiency suffer from impairment of ventilatory function and a decrease of respiratory muscle pressures, probably due to reduction of respiratory muscle strength...|$|R

Ventilatory and <b>mouth</b> occlusion <b>pressure</b> responses to CO 2 were measured in eight healthy volunteers before and after the intravenous administration of 0. 3 mg/kg of diazepam and 0. 15 mg/kg of midazolam. The mean ventilatory response to CO 2 (mean +/- SEM) decreased after administration of diazepam or midazolam from 2. 0 +/- 0. 2 to 1. 3 +/- 0. 1 1. min- 1 /torr or from 2. 1 +/- 0. 2 to 1. 4 +/- 0. 1 1. min- 1 /torr, respectively. In the same volunteers, the <b>mouth</b> occlusion <b>pressure</b> responses decreased from 0. 54 +/- 0. 05 to 0. 30 +/- 0. 04 cm H 2 O/torr after midazolam and from 0. 67 +/- 0. 12 to 0. 28 +/- 0. 07 cm H 2 O/torr after diazepam. When compared with the control slopes of the ventilatory and <b>mouth</b> occlusion <b>pressure</b> responses, the drug slopes were significantly different. Respiration was similarly depressed after diazepam and after midazolam. That both the ventilatory and <b>mouth</b> occlusion <b>pressure</b> responses to CO 2 are equally depressed by intravenous injections of midazolam and of diazepam at equipotent doses suggests a direct depression of the central respiratory drive by these drugs...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSimple {{models of}} {{clarinet}} instruments based on iterated maps {{have been used}} in the past to successfully estimate the threshold of oscillation of this instrument as a function of a constant blowing pressure. However, when the blowing pressure gradually increases through time, the oscillations appear at a much higher value, called dynamic oscillation threshold, than what is predicted in the static case. This is known as bifurcation delay, a phenomenon studied in [1, 2] for a clarinet model. In particular the dynamic oscillation threshold is predicted analytically when the blowing pressure is linearly increased. However, the <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> cannot grow indefinitely. During a note attack, after an increasing phase, the musician stabilizes the <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure.</b> In the present work, the analytical prediction of the dynamic oscillation threshold is extended to a situations in which the <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> approaches a steady state pressure according to an exponential time profile.

Pulmonary {{function was}} investigated by spirography, determination of a maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume curve and, when possible, maximal static <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> were determined. Peak inspiratory and expiratory flow, maximal expiratory flow at 50 % and maximal static <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> were significantly below normal values.

Flow-volume curves were normal in eight patients; four patients demonstrated flow decelerations and accelerations (type A) and 16 had a rounded off flow-volume curve (type B).

Ten adults diagnosed as GH deficient in childhood, ten adults diagnosed as GH deficient in adulthood and ten healthy subjects entered the study. For each subject, evaluation of respiratory function followed the same standard approach, consisting of respiratory muscle strength assessment, record of flow-volume curves, measurement of static lung volumes and lung diffusing capacity. Childhood-onset GH-deficient patients had a significant reduction of maximal inspiratory (p < 0. 01) and maximal expiratory (p < 0. 05) <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures.</b> Total lung capacity, vital capacity and functional residual capacity were significantly reduced compared to healthy subjects (p < 0. 05). Conversely, residual volume and diffusing lung capacity did not show any significant change. No significant change of the ratio between the percentage forced expiratory volume in 1 s and the forced vital capacity was observed. The decrease of respiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> was not correlated to the decrease of lung volumes. Adult-onset GH-deficient patients had only a significant reduction of maximal expiratory pressure compared to healthy subjects (p < 0. 05). After 6 months of treatment no significant differences in any of the evaluated parameters were found. After 12 months of treatment patients with childhood-onset GH deficiency show a significant improvement of lung volumes (p < 0. 01) and maximal respiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> (p < 0. 005), whereas adult-onset GH-deficient patients show a significant improvement of maximal expiratory pressure (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, the results of this study showed that adult patients affected with childhood-onset GH deficiency suffer from an impairment of the ventilatory function due to a reduction of lung volumes and a decrease of respiratory pressures probably due to a reduction of respiratory muscle strength. This impairment was reversed after 12 months of treatment with recombinant GH. Conversely, adult-onset GH-deficient patients had only an impairment of the maximal expiratory pressure, probably due to respiratory muscle weakness re-established after 12 months of GH therapy...|$|R

Reasons for such a non-linear relationship may include the loading mechanism of respiratory muscles, inefficiency of intercostal muscles at high levels of inspiration, their recruitment pattern and the histochemical characteristics of respiratory muscles.

ABSTRACT: In sixteen patients with myasthenia gravis, the weakness of respiratory muscles, especially of expiratory, caused some disturbances in lung function. Thirty minutes after injection of neostigmine, general improvement of muscle function was accompanied by an increase of strength and endurance of respiratory muscles. The mean value of maximal inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> (Pimax) increased by 33 %, maximal expiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> (PEmax) by 23. 5 % and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) by 21 %. As a consequence of these changes amelioration of lung function indices was found, vital capacity increasing on average by 13 % and residual volume decreasing by 12. 5 %.

Twelve healthy young men performed five 12 -min running tests on a 400 -m track on separate days: a preliminary trial, two trials after induction of EMF, and two trials without prior muscle fatigue. Tests with and without prior EMF were performed in an alternate order, randomly starting with either type.

Lung function analysis showed severe restriction and decreased maximal inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure.</b> Taking into account the pain in the shoulder in combination with decreased inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressure</b> suggestive of diaphragmatic paresis, isolated neuralgic amyotrophy with phrenic nerve involvement was diagnosed. As these cases demonstrate, the diagnosis 'neuralgic amyotrophy with phrenic nerve involvement' often can be determined by history taking and physical examination. Unfamiliarity with this condition may lead to severe delay in the diagnostic process and to unnecessary investigations, especially when no accompanying paresis of the shoulder girdle and arm musculature is present...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe authors {{review the}} methods of {{assessment}} of Maximal Static Respiratory <b>Pressures</b> at the <b>mouth</b> level They define Maximal Inspiratory Pressure and Maximal Expiratory Pressure and describe the principal indications for their measurement It is analysed the influence in the results of many factors-like: the conformation of the mouthpiece, the small air leak In the tube, the kind of pressure gauge used, {{the use of a}} nose dip, the number of manoeuvres for each assessment, the body position and finally the lung volume of the measurement The many published reference values and their equations are also reviewed. Finally, the authors made a proposition for a protocol of assessment of the maximal <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures.</b> REV PORT PNEUMOL 2000; VI (4) : 297 - 30...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{definition}} reference values including reference equations for parameters PImax, PEmax and P 0. 1 of the normal Czech population aged 14 - 15 years. 102 subjects were examined for this purpose (55 boys and 47 girls). Except the reference values for boys and girls, this work includes correlations of <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> with anthropometric data and also with other spirometric parameters. In case of boys were found a significant correlation of PEmax parameter with weight, BMI and PEF. In group of boys we also found a correlation of PImax with BMI and PImax with IC. Parameter P 0. 1 correlates only with VT. In group of girls we found a significant correlations of PImax, PEmax and P 0. 1 with PEF and MEF 25...|$|R

Physiol. 70 (6) : 2632 - 2639, 1991. -We {{examined}} expiratory muscle fa-tigue during expiratory resistive loading in 11 normal subjects. Subjects breathed against expiratory resistances {{at their own}} breathing frequency and tidal volume until exhaustion or for 60 min. Respiratory muscle strength was assessed from both the maximum static expiratory and inspiratory <b>mouth</b> <b>pressures</b> (PE mEu and PI,,). At the lowest resistance, PE,, and PI,, measured after completion of the expiratory loaded breathing were not different from control values. With higher resistance, both PE,, and PI,, were decreased (P < 0. 05), and the de-crease lasted for 260 min. The electromyogram high-to-low frequency power ratio for the rectus abdominis muscle de-creased progressively during loading (P < O. Ol), but the inte-grated EMG activity did not change during recovery. Trans...|$|R
