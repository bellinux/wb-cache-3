25|$|Another common {{argument}} against dualism consists {{in the idea}} that since human beings (both phylogenetically and ontogenetically) begin their existence as entirely physical or material entities and since nothing outside of {{the domain of the}} physical is added later on in the course of development, then we must necessarily end up being fully developed material beings. There is nothing non-material or mentalistic involved in conception, the formation of the blastula, the gastrula, and so on.

25|$|Physicist Sean M.

Psychokinesis would have to be either some form of one of these four forces, or a new force that has a billionth the strength of gravity, for otherwise it would have been captured in experiments already done. This leaves no physical force that could possibly account for psychokinesis.|$|E
25|$|One of Fechner's speculations about {{consciousness}} {{dealt with}} brain. During his time, {{it was known}} that the brain is bilaterally symmetrical {{and that there is}} a deep division between the two halves that are linked by a connecting band of fibers called the corpus callosum. Fechner speculated that if the corpus callosum were split, two separate streams of consciousness would result - the <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> become two. Yet, Fechner believed that his theory would never be tested; he was incorrect. During the mid-twentieth century, Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga worked on epileptic patients with sectioned corpus callosum and observed that Fechner's idea was correct.|$|E

50|$|Crathorn {{affirms that}} {{whenever}} one is contemplating a certain concept, {{the mind of}} the person thinking it actually mirrors the concept. He thought that mental concepts cannot resemble substances but only qualities of substances because the species of substance {{would have to be a}} substance itself and our <b>minds</b> <b>would</b> turn into a new substance if we thought of it. It also cannot be a pure quantity because in thinking of infinite magnitudes, our <b>minds</b> <b>would</b> become infinite, and the same is true for the other categories besides quality. Crathorn held that one's ability to conceptualize is therefore limited to natural concepts of qualities, which in being conceived become qualities of the soul.|$|R

25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of Life on Mars, Sam's {{uncertainty}} is reinforced by frequent paranormal phenomena, such as hearing voices and seeing images from 2006 on radios, telephones, and televisions. The voices discuss his medical condition, leading him to partially {{believe that he is}} in a coma. Other elements suggest to him that he is insane, such as his frequent and unexpected encounters with the Test Card Girl from Test Card F, who speaks directly to him. Annie Cartwright partially persuades Sam that he is truly in 1973, arguing that his <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> be unable to fabricate the amount of detail and tangibility in the world where he finds himself, evidence that he is in fact in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|The two volume {{biography}} of Whitehead by Victor Lowe {{is the most}} definitive presentation {{of the life of}} Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his [...] "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life.

[...] The doctor also said that only an unsound <b>mind</b> <b>would</b> dump the bodies close to his home when his plan was to distract the police. [...] In rebuttal, the prosecution's expert witness, Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital, said that Lim was [...] "purposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure". [...] In Dr Chee's opinion, Lim had indulged in sex because through his role as a [...] medium he obtained a supply of women who were willing to go to bed with him. [...] Furthermore, his belief in Kali was religious in nature, not delusional. [...] Lim's use of religion for personal benefit indicated full self-control.
