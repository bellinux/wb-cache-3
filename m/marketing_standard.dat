The proposed scheme allows to unambiguously characterize any given mobile marketing campaign and to identify the respective objectives. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the water {{activity}} and moisture contents of Capsicum annuum in different saturated salt solutions. The sorption isotherms of Capsicum annuum were determined within the range of 10 - 98 % relative air humidity at three different temperatures (30 oC, 45 oC and 60 oC), using static gravimetric method. The moisture content of the product was used as in the <b>marketing</b> <b>standard,</b> assuming that no microbial spoilage would occur below a certain moisture level. The best equation was predicted for the experimental data at each temperature using non-linear regression technique. Hence, this correlation between equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) can be given as a new model. Consequently, the experimental data were fitted in several models such as Oswin, GAB, Modified Henderson, Halsey and Modified Halsey. In order to compare these models, three statistical error parameters were used and the best fitted models between sorption isotherms were studied. GAB was the best model to describe the sorption isotherm adequately, over entire temperature range among the others. Besides, a new model which can be considered as better than GAB model, taking into account the experimental results for three temperatures, was proposed...|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} {{an analysis of}} Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) undergraduate programs. This thesis asks what the characteristics of an ideal undergraduate IMC program are and does any existing program have all these characteristics. The rise of IMC as a communication approach, combined with its adoption by many companies as the new <b>marketing</b> <b>standard,</b> has led many different universities to offer a curriculum in IMC, but the curriculum varies greatly. Since {{it is still a}} new subject, colleges place the new program in different disciplines, including the business school, the communications program, and the journalism department. While there are many similar academic programs under various names and with varying ideals, few colleges offer IMC-specific degrees. Six of those programs are for undergraduates. These undergraduate IMC programs have differences in their curricula and how their programs are structured. Currently, no program is consistent at offering the perfect foundation courses in a college environment. Through careful analysis and comparison of undergraduate IMC curricula, this thesis aims to identify the ideal composition of an undergraduate degree in Integrated Marketing Communications. By comparing the different approaches and challenges that the different programs face, one can discover a more effective way of teaching IMC. By researching and analyzing the origin and definition of IMC, the role of IMC today, and the variations between the different college curricula, this thesis will construct an informed and comprehensive approach for an undergraduate degree in Integrated Marketing Communications. The author defines modern IMC and how it will apply to students after interviews with Dr. Don E. Schultz, father of the IMC field, and Dr. Ed Meek, founder of the Meek School of Journalism and New Media at Ole Miss. An examination of the required courses at various university IMC programs will provide the basis for understanding the differences and areas of emphasis offered to students studying IMC today. By comparing and evaluating each program, the researcher will determine the focus of each program and if each curriculum is comprehensive. Finally, a recommendation will be made for the ideal curriculum for an undergraduate degree in Integrated Marketing Communications. ...|$|E
40|$|At present, wheat demand {{requires}} specific {{quality and}} industrial performance. Buyers {{are not only}} interested in protein content but also in protein quality. To evaluate the industrial aptitude, laboratory tests must be run to define wheat quality. In this way, {{the needs of the}} wheat chain can be satisfied. Millers and bakers want to know where to buy the suitable wheat to elaborate a certain product. Most of the literature on this topic shows graphs and tables of all wheat subregions that are difficult to understand due to the numerous details and data to be analyzed. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the distribution of commercial and industrial quality in theArgentine wheat area through a Geographic Information System that can handle large databases referenced spatially and to see them in maps. During three crops, five quality parameters were compared with the media of ten years. According to the results, the test weight had its highest values in 2007 in the reference range between 81. 26 - 85. 00 kg/hl, in the sub-regions I, IISouth, VN and VSouth. In the media of ten years, most of tested samples had test weight in the range 77. 51 to 81. 25 kg/hl, reaching easily to Grade 2 or higher of the Argentine <b>Marketing</b> <b>Standard</b> of wheat. The protein content was variable between years and zones, presenting higher values, between 12. 0 and 12. 9 %, in the I, IINorth, VNorth and V South Subregion. The P/L ratio was optimum between 0. 76 - 1. 50. Average of 10 years of the alveograph W values, were fairly homogeneous throughout the wheat area, with W between 241 and 323 Joules x 10 - 4, appropriate for baking, which could be considered very good ones for commodities, not classified wheat. Throughout the argentine wheat area, subregion IV had the higher values of farinograph stability (between 16. 0 and 25. 9 minutes, average of 10 years), the rest of subregions considered in this study were between 10. 0 and 15. 9 minutes with some focused areas with 16. 0 to 20. 9 minutes.

Assim, considerando também que a desidratação prolonga a vida-de-prateleira de alimentos perecíveis, a pesquisa se propôs a fazer uma contribuição para o desenvolvimento do processo de fabricação de passa a partir de frutos de caqui ‘Fuyu’. Foi utilizado um secador contendo circulação forçada de ar e cinco bandejas. O fruto descascado foi fatiado em quatro formas diferentes: fatias em metades, de corte transversal; fatias em ¼, de cortes longitudinais; fatias em ¼, de corte {{longitudinal}} seguido de corte transversal; fatias em 1 / 8, de dois cortes longitudinais seguidos de transversais. A condição de secagem que aplicou temperatura de 80 °C por 1 h seguida de 60 °C por cerca de 23 h produziu passas de caqui ‘Fuyu’ com a melhor aparência. A forma da fatia passa que teve a preferência dosprovadores foi aquela em que o fruto foi cortado em oito fatias (fatias de 1 / 8). As passas de caqui ‘Fuyu’ contendo umidades residuais baixas, 19, 7 e 27, 4 %, foram apreciadas, quanto ao paladar, igualmente pelos provadores. Os frutos de caqui proporcionaram, em peso, 16, 7 e 18, 1 % de produtos em passas e perdas estimadas em 25, 5 %. Os resultados indicaram que a passa de caqui ‘Fuyu’ constitui-se numa excelente oferta de fruta desidratada. Because kakis {{are usually}} sold fresh, {{this results in}} a high number of fruits that do not meet the <b>marketing</b> <b>standard.</b> Thus, considering that dehydration extends the shelf life of perishable foods, this research was aimed at providing a contribution {{for the development of a}} product referred to as dehydrated ‘Fuyu’ kaki. A forced air circulation dehydrator was used, equipped with five trays. The peeled fruit was sliced in four different ways: sliced into halves, transversally; sliced into quarters, longitudinally; sliced into quarters, once longitudinally and once transversally; sliced into eighths, by cutting twice longitudinally and then once transversally. The drying conditions adjusted at 80 °C for 1 h, followed by 60 °C for 23 h resulted in a dehydrated ‘Fuyu’ kaki of better pleasant in aspect. The slicing method preferred by the samplers was that in which the fruit was sliced into eight slices (eighths). The dehydrated‘Fuyu’ kaki, at low residual moistures of 19. 7 or 27. 4 %, were pleasant in aspect and palate, and had good acceptance by samplers. The kaki fruit yielded 16. 7 and 18. 1 % in weight of dehydrated products. Fruit losses during preparation into slices were estimated at 25. 5 %. The results demonstrated that the dehydrated ‘Fuyu’ kaki product is an excellent supply of dehydrated fruit...|$|E

In particular, we show that market standards: are an important form of normative and cultural regulation in the field of commercial office design; format and act as calculative devices in property markets; and result in forms of knowledge diminution that break the relationship between building design and occupiers’ practices. Together, these effects result in particular designs being legitimised and valued, and lower energy designs being delegitimised, devalued and pushed to the periphery of the attention of commercial office designers...|$|R
40|$|What {{explains}} {{the creation and}} strengthening of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> through the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) ? This thesis addresses this question by analyzing the creation and strengthening of four of IOSCO’s international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> between 1991 and 2010 relating to the following issues: the governance of cross-border financial crime, the objectives and principles of domestic securities market regulation, the regulation of credit rating agencies, and the regulation of hedge funds. This thesis argues that the creation and strengthening of these standards {{is derived from the}} role and influence of three different political actors: the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators, domestic legislatures, and states. The role and influence of these different political actors differs across issue areas and across time. To account for the differentiated sources of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards,</b> this thesis proposes a Principal-Agent (PA) analytical framework. Domestic legislatures (the principal) delegate to securities regulators (the agent) the authority to oversee and regulate domestic securities markets by granting regulators specific forms of statutory authority. Exercising discretion within this act of delegation, domestic securities regulators act together in a transgovernmental network to create and strengthen international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> They are prompted to act by threats to the integrity and stability of developed financial centers from under-regulated or ineffectively regulated foreign financial centers, as well as by new policy preferences of domestic legislatures seeking to regulate previously unregulated financial market actors. Domestic legislatures also use multiple agents to ensure that agents act consistent with their policy preferences: their concerns about the costs of under-regulated foreign jurisdictions can generate direct pressure from states on international financial regulatory institutions to strengthen the implementation of international financial standards. This thesis makes an empirical contribution to existing literature by analyzing previously understudied international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> This thesis also makes a theoretical contribution to both IPE literature and PA theory within International Organization (IO) literature. For IPE literature, this thesis establishes a theoretical framework that accounts for the differentiated role and influence of the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators, domestic legislatures, and states in the creation and strengthening of international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards.</b> For PA theory within IO literature, this thesis highlights the role of the principled professional interests of the transgovernmental network of securities market regulators in creating and strengthening international securities <b>market</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R
