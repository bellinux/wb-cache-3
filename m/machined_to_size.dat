25|$|The femoral {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are <b>machined</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E

A number of bearing designs seek to use bearing geometry to either provide an obstacle to the whirling fluid or to provide a stabilising load to minimize whirl.

In this design, shims are installed between {{the two halves of}} the bearing housing and then the bore is <b>machined</b> <b>to</b> <b>size.</b> After the shims are removed, the bore resembles a lemon shape, which decreases the clearance in one direction of the bore and increases the pre-load in that direction.

40|$|The {{structural}} concept {{considered for}} a spacecraft body structure is a grid stiffened skin with a skin laminate configuration and the stiffener grid geometry selected to best suit the design requirements. The orthogrid panel developed weighs 0. 55 lb/sq ft and resisted an ultimate in-plane shear load of 545 lbf/in. The basic concept of a grid stiffener composite panel is that a relatively thin skin is reinforced with a gridwork of stiffeners so that the overall panel can resist design loads without becoming structurally unstable or being overstressed. The main feature of the orthogrid panel design is that it provides the potential for low cost structural panels when advanced to the production phase.

50|$|It {{has been}} known for many years that an {{inactive}} iridium or cobalt metal object can be <b>machined</b> <b>to</b> <b>size.</b> In the case of cobalt it is common to alloy it with nickel to improve the mechanical properties. In the case of iridium a thin wire or rod could be used. These precursor materials can then be placed in stainless steel containers that have been leak tested before being converted into radioactive sources. These objects can be processed by neutron activation to form gamma-emitting radioisotopes. The stainless steel has only a small ability to be activated and the small activity due to 55Fe and 63Ni are unlikely to pose a problem in the final application because these isotopes are beta emitters, which have very weak gamma emission. The 59Fe isotope which might form has a short half-life, so by allowing a cobalt source to stand for a year much of this isotope will decay away.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} studies {{the properties of}} plasma-nitride coating on AISI D 2 tool steels prepared by non-directional grinding at various finishing. In the manufacturing process, the AISI D 2 was <b>machined</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> and hardened with a typical hardening process. In addition, its surface was treated with plasma nitriding. Various levels of roughness were produced as well as possible affects on the nitride coating properties. In this study, the following five conditions of grinding were performed on the hardened specimens: 1 -µm diamond particle and four SiC grinding papers: P 100, P 240, P 800, and P 2500. The surface finishing with at least 0. 023 -µm roughness value (P 800 grinding) provided a plasma-nitride layer with a moderately good hardness profile and a thick nitride layer compared with other finer finishing. This finishing process was also more economical requiring less time and manpower to create than others. Overall, {{this study suggests that}} finer surface finishing has a tendency to significantly improve the tool steels hardness profile and hardened depth...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} effort sponsored by NASA LeRC, the XD(trademark) process {{was used to}} produce ZrB 2 particulate reinforcements in Cu and the resulting extruded material was microstructurally characterized and evaluated in tension over a range of temperatures. A problem that was encountered in that study was microstructural inhomogeneity resulting from the frequent presence of 'ZrB 2 agglomerates' that were several microns in size. The presence of these agglomerates was attributed to improper mixing of powders in the green compact used in the XD process for elemental boron powder segregation. In this program, several milling parameters were examined {{in an effort to}} optimize this processing step; two levels of ZrB 2 reinforcements were considered (7 vol. percent and 15 vol. percent). Microstructures of the reacted powder mass were examined to verify the absence of these agglomerates. Larger bathes of powder were then mixed, reacted, <b>machined</b> <b>to</b> <b>size,</b> canned, and extruded. The microstructure and tensile properties of these extrusions were examined, and the measured properties were correlated with the observed microstructure. Large unreacted or partially reacted Zr particles were present. These particles affected the mechanical properties deleteriously, and their presence is attributed to insufficient heat of reaction during XD synthesis. Alternate processing routes are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Reinforcing {{critical}} areas in carbon polymer matrix composites (PMCs), {{also known as}} fiber reinforced composites (FRCs), is advantageous for structural durability. Since carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have extremely high tensile strength, {{they can be used}} as a functional additive to enhance the mechanical properties of FRCs. However, CNTs are not readily dispersible in the polymer matrix, which leads to lower than theoretically predicted improvement in mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of CNT composites. The inability to align CNTs in a polymer matrix is also a known issue. The feasibility of incorporating aligned CNTs into an FRC was demonstrated using a novel, yet commercially viable nanofiber approach, termed NRMs (nanofiber-reinforcing mats). The NRM concept of reinforcement allows for a convenient and safe means of incorporating CNTs into FRC structural components specifically where they are needed during the fabrication process. NRMs, fabricated through a novel and scalable process, were incorporated into FRC test panels using layup and vacuum bagging techniques, where alternating layers of the NRM and carbon prepreg were used to form the reinforced FRC structure. Control FRC test panel coupons were also fabricated in the same manner, but comprised of only carbon prepreg. The FRC coupons were <b>machined</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> and tested for flexural, tensile, and compression properties. This effort demonstrated that FRC structures can be fabricated using the NRM concept, with an increased average load at break during flexural testing versus that of the control. The NASA applications for the developed technologies are for lightweight structures for in-space and launch vehicles. In addition, the developed technologies would find use in NASA aerospace applications such as rockets, aircraft, aircraft/spacecraft propulsion systems, and supporting facilities. The reinforcing aspect of the technology will allow for more efficient joining of fiber composite parts, thus offering additional weight savings. More robust structures capable of withstanding micrometeoroid and space debris impacts will be possible with the enhanced mechanical properties imparted by the aligned CNTs incorporated into the fiber composite structure, as well as the potential for improved electrical and thermal properties. The materials fabrication approach developed in the present effort is a platform for customer applications where additional reinforcement is required or would be beneficial, especially in FRC structures and component parts. Depending upon the specific customer application, the NRM could be tailored to the specific matrix resin and desired property enhancement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Worldwide {{demand for}} wood and wood {{products}} {{will continue to}} increase as global human population increases. These increasing demands for wood will continue to provide economic incentives for non-industrial private forest-land (NIPF) owners to increase the availability and quality of wood fiber harvested from their lands. The challenge is to encourage and facilitate NlPF owners and other commercial forest industries to support these demands without I I. compromising their own short- and long-term economic and other ownership goals. Over the years silvicultural researchers have developed methods for growing quality trees faster and in more ecologically, environmentally, and socially acceptable ways. Simultaneously, harvesting researchers have developed an enormous database on alternative logging technologies to harvest timber in economically and environmentally acceptable ways. This study demonstrates that integrating what we know about growing trees with what we know about harvesting them can increase the availability of wood fiber and add value to future crops. Results for the oaklhickory forest type in West Virginia show that up to 1, 736. 61 ft 3 /acre of wood fiber can be harvested 10 years sooner than usual by simply matching <b>size</b> of <b>machine</b> <b>to</b> wood harvested.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the versatility of the shear punch test {{as described by}} Roydhouse and suggests {{that it should be}} considered {{as an alternative to the}} present standard compressive strength test for glass ionomer cements and flexural strength for composite resins. The shear punch test can be used for examining small thin specimens, about 1. 0 mm thick and 8. 0 mm in diameter, of both auto-cured and light-cured restorative materials such as composite resins and glass ionomer cements. The preparation of the specimen is simple and does not require a precision mould or subsequent <b>machining</b> <b>to</b> <b>size</b> except that, after curing, it may need to be abraded gently to obtain flat parallel test surfaces. The test apparatus consists of a punch approximately 3. 0 mm in diameter opposing a true fitting matching die. The specimen is supported over the die section and the punch is advanced through it in a compression cage. The formula used to calculate the shear strength allows for variation in specimen thickness and thus provides comparative data between materials. It also allows examination of the effects of variations in manipulation, maturation and storage of each material. It is suggested this test should be considered as an alternative to the present compression and flexural strength tests because it would provide a single strength test for a range of restorative materials being manipulated under a variety of circumstances. It is of particular significance for testing the light-cured materials because it examines a specimen size below that of the diameter of the exit window of a normal clinical light curing unit and also at a thickness where depth of cure of the material is not a problem...|$|R
