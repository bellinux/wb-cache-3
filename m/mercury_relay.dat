5000|$|A <b>mercury</b> <b>relay</b> (mercury {{displacement}} relay, mercury contactor) is a relay {{that uses}} mercury as the switching element.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded as a {{glass-blowing}} business by Hermann Pilz in Esslingen in 1948. Initial products included glass apparatus for medical technology and <b>mercury</b> <b>relays</b> for industrial applications.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{environmental}} considerations about the toxicity of <b>mercury,</b> <b>mercury</b> <b>relays</b> are mostly obsolete though modern encapsulated units still have applications. They are generally {{being replaced by}} solid state relays.|$|R
50|$|The most {{effective}} methods are to employ arc suppression circuitry including arc suppressors, solid state relays, hybrid power <b>relays,</b> <b>mercury</b> displacement <b>relays</b> and hybrid power contactors.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the mass}} of mercury moved during switching, {{compared}} to that of the armature and spring leaves of a conventional relay, the <b>mercury</b> <b>relay</b> is not a high-speed device. Despite this, the <b>mercury</b> <b>relay</b> does have a very low contact bounce time, in the sub-millisecond range. For some applications, particularly inductive loads, this alone may be a reason for their use - the timing of contact closure is not rapid, but the avoidance of bounce is valuable.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mercury</b> <b>relay,</b> {{sometimes}} called a mercury displacement relay, or, mercury contactor, is a relay {{that uses the}} liquid metal mercury in an insulated sealed container as the switching element.|$|E
50|$|The {{glass tube}} of a <b>mercury</b> <b>relay</b> must be mounted near-vertically. Their {{sensitivity}} {{can be adjusted}} by adjusting their angle relative to vertical. As sensitivity depends upon angle, they are unsuitable for use on mobile equipment or with conditions of high vibration.|$|E
50|$|A mercury-wetted {{reed relay}} {{is a form}} of reed relay in which the {{contacts}} are wetted with <b>mercury.</b> Such <b>relays</b> are used to switch low-voltage signals (one volt or less) where the mercury reduces the contact resistance and associated voltage drop, for low-current signals where surface contamination may make for a poor contact, or for high-speed applications where the mercury eliminates contact bounce. <b>Mercury</b> wetted <b>relays</b> are position-sensitive and must be mounted vertically to work properly. Because of the toxicity and expense of liquid <b>mercury,</b> these <b>relays</b> are now rarely used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>relays</b> {{have also}} been {{produced}} as latching or impulse relays. The Lenning design uses a horizontal glass tube with two axially isolated pools of mercury. A conductive stirrup can bridge these to make the connection. The relay {{is controlled by the}} stirrup being rotated {{in and out of the}} pool along the horizontal axis of the tube. A weight on the stirrup's armature gives an over-centre action that provides the latching behaviour. A magnetic slug on the armature allows it to be rotated and controlled by an external electromagnet.|$|R
500|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, <b>mercury</b> switches, <b>mercury</b> <b>relays,</b> {{fluorescent}} lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. [...] Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|R
50|$|A <b>mercury</b> <b>relay</b> is a relay {{that uses}} mercury as the {{switching}} element. They are used where contact erosion {{would be a}} problem for conventional relay contacts. Owing to environmental considerations about significant amount of mercury used and modern alternatives, they are now comparatively uncommon.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mercury</b> <b>relay</b> thus {{allows for}} {{switching}} of higher currents {{with a small}} control current for {{a large number of}} cycles. They are often installed into automatic controllers that required extended periods of unattended continuous switching operation. The mercury surface is self-restoring after an arc, and the contact resistance is low and stable.|$|E
40|$|The Model 500 pulser was {{designed}} primarily for calibrating pulse height analyzers. It can deliver to 93 ohms a pulse which is variable in amplitude {{from zero to}} 100 volts and of either polarity. Accuracy of a selected pulse amplitude {{is believed to be}} better than 1 %. The pulse is formed by discharging a capacitor through a resistance-capacitance network. This capacitor is switched between the charging source and the pulse-forming network by a <b>mercury</b> <b>relay.</b> It is believed that circuit behavior can be calculated with good accuracy since the <b>mercury</b> <b>relay</b> approximates an ideal switch and the circuit consists of linear passive elements, except for the power supply. Close tolerances can be held without difficulty on circuit componenets, but the mercury relays must be selected. "LA- 1330. ""Report written: January 1953 " [...] P. ii. "March 26, 1953.

25|$|Molybdenum {{is used in}} <b>mercury</b> wetted reed <b>relays,</b> because {{molybdenum}} {{does not}} form amalgams and is therefore resistant to corrosion by liquid mercury.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Mercury</b> <b>relays</b> {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} (usually glass) tube containing liquid mercury. They have isolated contacts {{at the bottom of}} the tube and partway up, usually in a side arm of the glass. The relay works by displacement. A pool of mercury fills the lower portion of the tube, but is insufficient to bridge the contacts. A magnetic slug of iron or steel is placed in the tube, where it sinks by gravity so as to displace the mercury. The displaced mercury rises in the tube, sufficiently to bridge the contacts and complete the circuit between them. Around the top part of the tube is placed the coil. When energised, this coil attracts the slug, lifting it upwards and out of the mercury pool. The mercury is no longer displaced, so flows downwards, away from the upper contact and the circuit opens. This allows for normally closed operation. For the more traditional normally open relay operation, the side contact is arranged somewhat higher up (or the volume of mercury is reduced) so that contact is not made when the iron slug is freely floating on the pool of mercury. The control coil is mounted below the rest level of the slug and when energised draws down the slug deeper into the pool displacing additional mercury thus raising the level to the previously uncovered side contact and closing the circuit.|$|R
40|$|From {{ferromagnetic}} resonance experiments and from calculations {{based on the}} modified Landau-Lifschitz equa-tion, switching times for the coherent rotation of the magnetization in thin, permalloy-type films have been predicted to lie {{in the range of}} 1 mi 1 limicrosecond. l First measurements by D. 0. Smith et a 1, 2 utilizing a travelling-wave oscilloscope with a response time of 2 mpec, indi-cated switching times of about 3 mpec. In this com-munication, first results of advanced millimicrosecond measurements are reported. These were obtained by using special pulse equipment including a sampling oscillo-scope, 324 with an over-all response time of about 0. 5 mpsec. Flux changes as fast as 1. 5 mpec could be ob-served, for not only the longitudinal flux component, 5 but also, for the first time, the transverse one. Figure I Strip transmission with longitudinal (a) and transverse (b) pick-ups. Short Communicate Experimental techniques A pulsed magnetic field is generated in a 50 -f 2 shortcircuited strip transmission line by discharging a 50 - 0 coaxial cable over a coaxial <b>mercury</b> <b>relay.</b> The end of the cable is matched for the reflected wave by diodes and RC-compensating networks. Two pairs of Helmholtz coils provide the premagnetization and reset fields in the plane of the film. The longitudinal magnetic flux change of the magnetic film is picked up by a wire placed in the symmetry axis of the strip line. The end of this wire is matched by four balancing resistors (Fig. la). By this means the voltage induced by the air flux is cancelled out. The transverse flux change of the film is picked up by a wire placed normal to the axis of the strip line (Fig. 1 b) ...|$|E
50|$|For {{high-speed}} use, the mercury-wetted relay is used instead. This {{combines the}} speed of a low-mass relay, together with the fast wetting of <b>mercury</b> contacts. A <b>relay,</b> usually a reed relay, has its contacts coated with a small quantity of mercury. This gives the low bounce advantage of mercury, although the current capacity is still limited to broadly that of the original reed relay.|$|R
