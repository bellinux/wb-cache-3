5|$|But now my {{attitude}} {{is getting to}} be a little different, I think. Now <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> is mostly to find out what there is in common... Autumn was written after November Steps. I really wanted to do something which I hadn't done in November Steps, not to blend the instruments, but to integrate them.|$|E
25|$|As I {{testified to}} the U.S. Senate in 1998, Iraq has the {{indigenous}} capability right now to reconstitute a chemical weapons program {{within a matter of}} weeks. And <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> is if we continue to push for military action against Iraq, and once the writing becomes clear on the wall -- and believe me, if Saddam Hussein doesn't understand that President Bush is dead serious about going to war against him now, I don't know when he'll be -- when he'll recognize that. But at some point, I believe that Iraq will seek to reconstitute militarized nerve agent that will be used in defense of Baghdad. And I think the Iraqi government's efforts to acquire significant stockpiles of atropine are an indication that this is the direction that Saddam Hussein is heading.|$|E

Welensky did not rule out deploying federal troops if the situation deteriorated. Speaking to the defence chiefs in Salisbury, he said that [...] "during {{the next three months}} we can expect some fairly serious trouble in Nyasaland... It is <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> to ensure that this government {{is in a position to}} exercise its responsibilities if trouble comes".|$|E

500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] <b>My</b> <b>concern</b> was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I had something in reserve.|$|E
500|$|The final trailer was [...] "unlocked" [...] by fans on March 4, 2015, via {{the use of}} hashtags on Twitter, {{ahead of}} its {{broadcast}} debut during the series premiere of American Crime on March 5. Mendelson felt [...] "this [...] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know" [...] adding, [...] "Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if this really is the final Avengers 2 trailer, then {{at least on the}} trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled." [...] A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had [...] "smashed records" [...] with over 35 million views.|$|E
500|$|During the {{subsequent}} media coverage, {{the game was}} removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons. Rockstar responded to this move by stating, [...] "we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner, and we fully respect their actions. We are naturally very surprised and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game ... We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt." [...] Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only; [...] "Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences, and [...] markets its games responsibly, targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older." [...] As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a [...] "significantly increased" [...] demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites. Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying [...] "it doesn't really come as surprise, they say no publicity is bad publicity. But I must say I'm saddened and disappointed. The content of this game is contemptible. It's a societal hazard and <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> is to get it off the shelves as there's enough violence in society already." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{commentators}} criticized Thune's letter as {{an example}} of government overreach against a private company. Facebook denied the bias allegations.

Over {{the past several months}} I have expressed <b>my</b> <b>concerns</b> to the Board about the direction the company is currently heading.

2500|$|Vaz {{has also}} criticised Bully, {{which had a}} pre-release {{screenshot}} showing three uniformed pupils fighting and kicking.

[...] Due to the controversy surrounding the Bully title, the game was released in the UK in 2006 under an alternative name though the original title was restored when the game was re-released in 2008 with a BBFC 15 rating and some positive reviews.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1989, the Princess {{visited a}} leprosy {{hospital}} in Indonesia. Following her visit, she became {{patron of the}} Leprosy Mission, an organisation dedicated to providing medicine, treatment, and other support services {{to those who are}} afflicted with the disease. She remained the patron of this charity until her death in 1997, and visited several of its hospitals around the world, especially in India, Nepal, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. She famously touched those affected by the disease when many people believed it could be contracted through casual contact. [...] "It has always been <b>my</b> <b>concern</b> to touch people with leprosy, trying to show in a simple action that they are not reviled, nor are we repulsed," [...] she commented. The Diana Princess of Wales Health Education and Media Centre in Noida, India, was opened in her honour in November 1999, funded by the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Fund to give social support to the people affected by leprosy and disability.|$|E

About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is that I think I understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director.
