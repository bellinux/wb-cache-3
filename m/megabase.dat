25|$|The genomes {{of several}} {{species in the}} genus Genlisea were studied in 2006.

25|$|The genomes {{of several}} {{species in the}} genus Genlisea were studied in 2006 along {{with other members of}} the Lentibulariaceae family. According to the study, prior to its {{publication}} the smallest known angiosperm (flowering plant) genome was that of Arabidopsis thaliana at 157 <b>Megabase</b> pairs (Mbp). With a diploid chromosome number of around 40 (2n = ca. 40), G. margaretae held the distinction of having the smallest known angiosperm genome size at 63.4 Mbp, just 0.2 Mbp lower than that of Genlisea aurea. Further research in 2014 found that a related species, Genlisea tuberosa has a smaller genome size at around 61 Mbp. The smallest individual chromatids from mitotic anaphase are just 2.1 Mbp and therefore have a size smaller than some bacterial chromosomes, such as the approximate 4 Mbp of Escherichia coli. G. margaretae and G. aurea also both appear to be polyploid species with the unusual circumstances of having a high chromosome number with extremely small chromosomes. Other species in the genus Genlisea and the family Lentibulariaceae have much lower chromosome numbers and larger genome sizes, affirming that one characteristic of this botanic family is rapid molecular evolution. G. margaretae in particular may be helpful in research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind genome downsizing.|$|E
40|$|Understanding linkage {{block size}} and {{molecular}} mechanisms of recombination suppression {{is important for}} plant breeding. Previously large linkage blocks ranging from 14 <b>megabases</b> to 27 <b>megabases</b> were observed around the rice blast resistance gene Pi-ta in rice cultivars and backcross progeny involving an indica and japonica cross. In the present study, the same linkage block was further examined in 456 random recombinant individuals of rice involving 5 crosses ranging from F 2 to F 10 generation, with and without Pi-ta containing genomic indica regions with both indica and japonica germplasm. Simple sequence repeat markers spanning the entire chromosome 12 were used to detect recombination break points and to delimit physical size of linkage blocks. Large linkage blocks ranging from 4. 1 <b>megabases</b> to 10 <b>megabases</b> were predicted from recombinant individuals involving genomic regions of indica and japonica. However, a significantly reduced block from less than 800 kb to 2. 1 <b>megabases</b> was identified from crosses of indica with indica rice regardless {{of the existence of}} Pi-ta. These findings suggest that crosses of indica and japonica rice have significant recombination suppression near the centromere on chromosome 12...|$|R
