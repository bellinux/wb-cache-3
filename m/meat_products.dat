5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with <b>meat</b> <b>products</b> and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E

5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while kipper, its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g.

30|$|Color is {{the most}} {{important}} factor considered by the consumer while selecting <b>meat</b> or <b>meat</b> <b>product.</b> The final color of the cooked <b>meat</b> <b>product</b> depends upon the pigmentary changes that take place during cooking. The mean color scores of duck meat sausages decreased significantly (P <  0.01) as the refrigerated storage increased to 14  days. This reduction in color scores of stored product might be due to oxidative fading. The gradual decrease in color scores of products stored at refrigeration storage might also be due to pigment and lipid oxidation resulting in non-enzymatic browning.|$|R
