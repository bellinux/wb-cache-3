5|$|Although Bagramyan {{found it}} {{acceptable}} to sustain heavy casualties (as {{did all the}} commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining. He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining {{the element of surprise}} in operations. In his preparations for Bagration, he planned for the 43rd Army to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> more suitable terrain. He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the 43rd achieved success in its attack. Commander of the 43rd Army, General Afanasy Beloborodov, wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.|$|E
5|$|July 8, 2005- The extratropical {{remnants}} of Hurricane Cindy <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the state, producing heavy rainfall {{of up to}} 4.55inches (116mm) in Delmar.

5|$|The rails are a {{large and}} very {{widespread}} family, with nearly 150 species. They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them <b>move</b> <b>through</b> dense vegetation.

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{striking}} Long Island, Gloria made its final landfall in western Connecticut near Westport, and proceeded to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> New England while weakening. The NHC estimated that Gloria became extratropical over Maine early by 0000 UTC on September 28. The storm continued to the northeast through Atlantic Canada passing south of Greenland on September 30. The extratropical circulation of Gloria was last noted on October 2, although the remnants later affected Europe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the junior}} singles at the 2010 Australian Open, Robson was unseeded and {{defeated}} Belinda Woolcock, Yulia Putintseva, and Cristina Dinu {{to reach the}} quarterfinals. In the last eight she easily overcame American Ester Goldfeld to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> to her fourth Junior Grand Slam semi-final where she defeated Kristýna Plíšková of the Czech Republic. She was defeated by Kristýna's twin sister Karolína Plíšková in the final. In the Wimbledon Championships junior singles she reached the semifinals, losing to Sachie Ishizu of Japan.|$|E
5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further complicated {{by the lack of}} vehicle crossings along the railway line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel's envelopment was {{extended}} at 09:25, when Chaytor ordered a regiment {{to circle the}} entrenched positions and <b>move</b> <b>through</b> Aulad Ali, to cut off a possible line of retreat {{to the south and}} south east. The 10th Light Horse Regiment with two sections of the brigade Machine Gun Squadron, led by Brigadier General J. R. Royston, commander of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, succeeded in capturing Aulad Ali and 300 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} <b>move</b> <b>through</b> a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for what he}} hoped would be the final attack on The Gully, Vokes shifted the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade to occupy positions formerly belonging to the 1st Brigade. Vokes planned for an attack by The Carleton and York Regiment {{to be the last}} of the frontal assaults against The Gully. Should this attack fail, the 1st Brigade's Seaforth Highlanders and the Royal Canadian Regiment would <b>move</b> <b>through</b> Casa Berardi and outflank German defences, forcing a withdrawal from The Gully.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges' {{trade with}} the Pontic Steppe and Black Sea was {{extremely}} important to their economy. This can {{can be seen in}} one of the concessions offered to them by Marcus Aurelius after the Marcomannic War, in which he allows the Iazyges to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> Dacia and {{trade with the}} Roxolani, which reconnected them to the Pontic Steppe trade network. This trade route lasted until 260, when the Goths took over Tyras and Olbia, cutting off both the Roxolani and the Iazyges' trade with the Pontic Steppe.|$|E
5|$|The Stage Synthesizer {{combines}} wavetables with analog oscillators and FM operators. Featuring {{filter and}} envelope controls, the Synth Section's timbre knob {{allows users to}} <b>move</b> <b>through</b> different sound groups. A number of programs are available to store sounds under three categories – Synth, Pad or Bass. The Synth also includes a 2-band EQ, a glide (portamento) function, and a unison function {{which is used to}} thicken the sound. The Synth Section is 16-note polyphonic.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is filled}} {{with a variety of}} puzzles that must be solved to advance the story. These include memory games and mazes. Others involve {{competing}} against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item. Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to <b>move</b> <b>through</b> game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E

A short-lived cyclone, Danielle developed on September7 {{to the east of}} the southern Lesser Antilles. Strengthening to peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), the storm moved through Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, where a rainband moved across the main island with hurricane-force gusts. Continuing westward, Danielle absorbed dry air from northern South America and dissipated on September10.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{began the}} race, started under the safety car, ahead of Kovalainen in second. Red Bull's Mark Webber started from third. Rain {{early in the}} race allowed Vettel to {{establish}} a solid lead over Kovalainen, which he extended as the track dried. Kubica and Fernando Alonso {{finished in the top}} four after starting from 11th and eighth, respectively.

5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they <b>move</b> <b>through</b> the water.|$|E
