5|$|After a whistle-blower {{reported}} that the MSDF's preference had been improperly changed an investigation was launched. On December 16 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated {{that it had not}} confirmed lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for mentioning the MCH-101 by name during the procurement process to his subordinates. This had come after MSDF officials had {{reported that}} the Mitsubishi-built SH helicopters <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best.</b>|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|The Native Americans {{played the}} first folk music {{in what is}} now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near {{universal}} among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and shakers. Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.|$|E

5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best.</b> Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E

25|$|There {{is thus a}} filesize {{trade-off}} {{between high}} color depth, maximal metadata (including color space information, together with information that does not affect display), interlacing, and speed of compression, which all yield large files, with lower color depth, fewer or no ancillary chunks, no interlacing, and tuned but computationally intensive filtering and compression. For different purposes, different trade-offs are chosen: a maximal file <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> for archiving and editing, while a stripped down file <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> for use on a website, and similarly fast but poor compression is preferred when repeatedly editing and saving a file, while slow but high compression is preferred when a file is stable: when archiving or posting.|$|E

It {{is suggested that}} learning <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> {{during the day and}} when the stomach is empty, since ghrelin levels are higher at these times. A similar effect on human memory performance is possible. In rodents, X/A-like cells produce ghrelin.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} in genealogical DNA tests {{has been linked}} to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an {{interest in}} personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.|$|E

25|$|The spirit {{behind this}} rewritten riddle <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> {{exemplified}} by a pun in the penultimate {{line of the}} Exeter Book version. In the manner of other riddles, the riddle dares us to find the solution, calling the reader searoÃ¾oncum gleaw, 'clever with cunning thoughts'. As a separate word, searo has several competing senses. It may designate either a 'device' or the intellectual power that created such a device. But more specifically, searo can mean 'armour'â€”so the pun reads, 'clever with thoughts of armour'.|$|E

The night of the firing a crowd estimated at 2,000, consisting mostly of students, vandalized the Showalter Fountain, the university football field, and marched on the president's on-campus home, the Bryan House. During this unrest, Brand was hanged in effigy. Despite his effectiveness as a fundraiser, Brand's firing of Bobby Knight caused his popularity among students and alumni to plummet.|$|E
