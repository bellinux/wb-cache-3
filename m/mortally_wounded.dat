5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was <b>mortally</b> <b>wounded</b> on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći.

He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy.

As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E
