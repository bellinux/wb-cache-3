5|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{among those with}} non-chronic back pain {{alternative}} treatments are useful. For chiropractic care or spinal <b>manipulation</b> therapy (SMT) it is unclear if it improves outcomes {{more or less than}} other treatments. Some reviews find that SMT results in equal or better improvements in pain and function when compared with other commonly used interventions for short, intermediate, and long-term follow-up; other reviews find it to be no more effective in reducing pain than either inert interventions, sham <b>manipulation,</b> or other treatments, and conclude that adding SMT to other treatments does improve outcomes. National guidelines reach different conclusions, with some not recommending spinal <b>manipulation,</b> some describing <b>manipulation</b> as optional, and others recommending a short course {{for those who do not}} improve with other treatments. A 2017 review recommended spinal <b>manipulation</b> based on low quality evidence. <b>Manipulation</b> under anaesthesia, or medically assisted <b>manipulation,</b> has not enough evidence to make any confident recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{has also}} been reported in association with some forms of neck <b>manipulation.</b> There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck <b>manipulation.</b> It may be that <b>manipulation</b> can cause dissection, or {{it may be that the}} dissection is already present in some people who seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck <b>manipulation</b> and stroke, or no association.|$|E

30|$|We had {{a number}} of {{predictions}} about people’s ability to detect and locate <b>manipulations</b> in real-world photos. We expected the type of manipulation—implausible versus plausible—to affect people’s ability to detect and locate <b>manipulations.</b> In particular, people should correctly identify more of the physically implausible <b>manipulations</b> than the physically plausible <b>manipulations</b> given the availability of evidence within the photo. We also expected people to be better at correctly detecting and locating <b>manipulations</b> that caused more change to the pixels in the photo than <b>manipulations</b> that caused less change.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Semi-fragile {{watermarking}} techniques aim at detecting malicious <b>manipulations</b> on an image, {{while allowing}} acceptable <b>manipulations</b> such as lossy compression. Although {{both of these}} <b>manipulations</b> {{are considered to be}} pixel value changes, semi-fragile watermarks should be sensitive to malicious <b>manipulations</b> but robust to the degradation introduced by lossy compression and other defined acceptable <b>manipulations.</b> In this paper, after studying the characteristics of both natural images and malicious <b>manipulations,</b> we propose two new semi-fragile authentication techniques robust against lossy compression, using random bias and nonuniform quantization, to improve the performance of the methods proposed by Lin and Chang.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the non-adiabatic processes occurring during the <b>manipulations</b> of Majorana qubits in 1 -D semiconducting wires with proximity induced superconductivity. Majorana qubits are usually {{protected by the}} excitation gap. Yet, <b>manipulations</b> performed at a finite pace can introduce both decoherence and renormalization effects. Though exponentially small for slow <b>manipulations,</b> these effects are important as they may constitute the ultimate decoherence mechanism. Moreover, as adiabatic topological <b>manipulations</b> fail to produce a universal set of quantum gates, non-adiabatic <b>manipulations</b> might be necessary to perform quantum computation.

For SOSM, we find that strongly monotone preferences in populations and weakly maximin preferences are the maximal domains of college preferences that guarantee immunity to <b>manipulations</b> via capacities and pre-arranged matches, respectively. In contrast, COSM is susceptible to both <b>manipulations</b> whenever colleges have multiple positions. ...|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{protection}} level, audio authentication {{can be classified}} into hard and soft authentication [1]. Hard authentication rejects any modifications except lossless compression or format conversion. Soft authentication passes certain incidental or admissible <b>manipulations</b> and rejects all the rest called malicious <b>manipulations.</b> Soft authentication can be further divided into quality-based authentication which rejects any <b>manipulations</b> that lower the perceptual quality below an acceptable level and content-based authentication which rejects any <b>manipulations</b> that change the semantic meaning of the content. Apparently, hard authentication has the minimum distortion endurance, while content-based soft authentication has the maximum capability.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual <b>manipulation</b> (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that <b>manipulation</b> should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

This comparison reveals four broad design strategies: `secretive,' where <b>manipulations</b> and effects are largely hidden; `expressive,' where they are revealed, enabling the spectator to fully appreciate the performer's interaction; `magical,' where effects are revealed but the <b>manipulations</b> that caused them are hidden; and finally `suspenseful,' where <b>manipulations</b> are apparent, but effects only get revealed when the spectator takes their turn...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study the impact of need for {{cognitive}} closure (NFC) <b>manipulations</b> via time pressure and explicit closure goal activation on executive control was investigated.

Moreover, we hypothesized that making <b>manipulations</b> of the geometric properties of triangles through mouse movements would be superior to observing those <b>manipulations</b> being made by an instructor in terms of cognitive load, retention- and transfer test performance. Whereas the first hypothesis was confirmed, the latter hypothesis was only confirmed for retention test performance. Possible implications for educational practice are discussed...|$|R
