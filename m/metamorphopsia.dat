40|$|Background: Alice in Wonderland {{syndrome}} (AIWS) {{is a rare}} {{cluster of}} CNS symptoms characterized by visual distortions (i. e. <b>metamorphopsias),</b> body image distortions, time distortions, and deja experiences. Verbal auditory hallucinations (VAHs) are the most prevalent type of hallucination in adults {{with or without a}} history of psychiatric illness. Here, we report the case of a woman with AIWS, long-lasting VAHs, and various additional perceptual and mood symptoms. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were used to assess symptoms, and functional MRI (fMRI) was employed to localize cerebral activity during self-reported VAHs. Treatment consisted of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at a frequency of 1 Hz at T 3 P 3, overlying Brodmann's area 40. Results: Activation during VAHs was observed bilaterally in the basal ganglia, the primary auditory cortex, the association auditory cortex, the temporal poles, and the anterior cingulated gyrus. The left and right inferior frontal gyri (Broca's area and its contralateral homologue) were involved, along with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, synchronized activation was observed in the primary visual cortex (areas V 1 and V 2), and the bilateral dorsal visual cortex. The higher visual association cortex also showed significant, but less prominent, activation. During the second week of rTMS treatment, not only the VAHs, but also the other sensory deceptions/distortions and mood symptoms showed complete remission. The patient remained free of any symptoms during a 4 -month follow-up phase. After 8 months, when many of the original symptoms had returned, a second treatment phase with rTMS was again followed by complete remission. Conclusions: This case indicates that VAHs and <b>metamorphopsias</b> in AIWS are associated with synchronized activation in both auditory and visual cortices. It also indicates that local rTMS treatment may have global therapeutic effects, suggesting an effect on multiple brain regions in a distributed network. Although a placebo effect cannot be ruled out, this case warrants further investigation of the effects of rTMS treatment in AIWS. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{present a}} case of a patient with pattern {{dystrophy}} (PD) associated choroidal neovascularization (CNV) that resolved spontaneously without treatment. Methods. A 69 -year-old male patient was referred to our unit, for evaluation of a recent visual loss (<b>metamorphopsias)</b> in his left eye. Fundus examination, fundus autofluorescence imaging, and fluorescein angiography showed a choroidal neovascular membrane in his left eye. Since visual acuity was satisfactory the patient elected observation. Clinical examination and OCT testing were repeated at 6 and 12 months after presentation. Results. Visual acuity remained stable at the level of 0. 9 (baseline BCVA) during the follow-up period (12 months). Repeat OCT testing showed complete spontaneous regression of the choroidal neovascular membrane without evidence of intra- or subretinal fluid in both follow-up visits. Conclusions. Spontaneous regression of choroidal neovascularization can occur in patients with retinal dystrophies and associated choroidal neovascular membranes.

5000|$|Many times, an optic pit is {{asymptomatic}} {{and is just}} an incidental finding on {{examination of}} the eye by a physician.

The most common visual field defects include an enlarged blind spot and a scotoma. Visual acuity is typically not affected by the pit but may get worse if serous detachment of the macula occurs. <b>Metamorphopsia</b> (distorted vision) may then result.|$|E
50|$|Vision {{abnormalities}} such as <b>metamorphopsia</b> (distortions) and scotoma are {{symptoms of}} retinal {{diseases such as}} Macular degeneration. In advanced stages of the disease, photoreceptor cells may be irreversibly damaged. Hence,if not treated Macular degeneration may lead to blindness. Awareness to early changes in vision, especially in high risk patients, leads to early treatment (such as intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF factors, e.g. bevacizumab or ranibizumab) and prevents loss of vision. Because of complex brain mechanisms such as Filling-in, patients with small and peripheral defects in their vision are often unaware of such changes until late stages in the disease. Another problem is that minute visual aberrations can be normal and therefore should be distinguished from genuine visual abnormalities. Preferential hyperacuity perimetry (PHP) is a technology that bypasses Filling-in and quantifies the extent of visual abnormalities.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the presence and}} extent of <b>metamorphopsia</b> using M-CHARTS TM (Inami Co., Tokyo, Japan) in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Design: Retrospective consecutive medical record review in a university hospital. Materials and Methods: We examined 33 eyes of 33 consecutive CSC patients using M-CHARTS, which yields scores reflecting the severity of <b>metamorphopsia.</b> The condition was considered present when an M-CHARTS score was 0. 3 or over. In all patients, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed, and M-CHARTS scores were calculated at {{the first and the}} 1 - and 3 -month follow-up visits. The correlation between M-CHARTS scores and BCVA values was determined. We also sought to define relationships between the level of <b>metamorphopsia</b> and specific OCT findings. Results: Of 33 CSC patients, 15 showed symptoms of <b>metamorphopsia,</b> and all 15 had M-CHARTS scores of over 0. 3. However, no correlation was evident between BCVA values and the extent of <b>metamorphopsia</b> as determined using M-CHARTS. In <b>metamorphopsia</b> patients, the incidence of focal retinal pigment epithelial detachment was notably greater than in the non-metamorphopsia group (P = 0. 03).

40|$|PURPOSE: To apply M-CHARTS for {{quantitative}} {{measurements of}} <b>metamorphopsia</b> in eyes with acute branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and to elucidate the pathomorphology that causes <b>metamorphopsia.</b> METHODS: This prospective {{study consisted of}} 42 consecutive patients (42 eyes) with acute BRVO. Both at baseline and one month after treatment with ranibizumab, <b>metamorphopsia</b> was measured with M-CHARTS, and the retinal morphological changes were examined with optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: At baseline, <b>metamorphopsia</b> was detected in the vertical and/or horizontal directions in 29 (69. 0 %) eyes; the mean vertical and horizontal scores were 0. 59 ± 0. 57 and 0. 52 ± 0. 67, respectively. The maximum inner retinal thickness showed no association with the M-CHARTS score, but the M-CHARTS score was correlated with the total foveal thickness (r = 0. 43, p = 0. 004), the height of serous retinal detachment (r = 0. 31, p = 0. 047), and the maximum outer retinal thickness (r = 0. 36, p = 0. 020). One month after treatment, both {{the inner and outer}} retinal thickness substantially decreased. However, <b>metamorphopsia</b> persisted in 26 (89. 7 %) of 29 eyes. The posttreatment M-CHARTS score was not correlated with any posttreatment morphological parameters. However, the posttreatment M-CHARTS score was weakly correlated with the baseline total foveal thickness (r = 0. 35. p = 0. 024) and closely correlated with the baseline M-CHARTS score (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001).

Methods: We studied 65 eyes undergoing vitrectomy for unilateral ERM. Self-administered questionnaires were used to examine the <b>metamorphopsia</b> in their daily life. The degree of <b>metamorphopsia</b> was determined by M-CHARTS. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the best predictor of the changes in <b>metamorphopsia</b> in daily life. To determine the reproducibility of the M-CHARTS score, another set of 56 eyes with ERM was tested twice on two different days. Results: The postoperative changes in the logarithm of the M-CHARTS score was defined as M 2 -value. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the M 2 -value as a predictor of the changes in <b>metamorphopsia</b> in daily life was larger than area under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained for any other parameter. The optimal cutoff value was - 0. 4. The 95 % limits of agreement between test and retest measurements had a reproducibility of ± 0. 3 logarithm of the M-CHARTS score. Taking into account not only the reproducibility but also the consistency with the subjective changes, we determined the criterion for clinically significant changes in the M-CHARTS scores as a change of the M 2 -value by ≥ 0. 4. Conclusion: Evaluating the changes in the M-CHARTS scores in logarithmic form is favorable not only theoretically but also from the perspective of consistency with the subjective changes.
