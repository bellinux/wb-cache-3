5|$|Historians {{believe that}} the strike, and other strikes in Africa during the period, changed the urban and <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> of the British {{government}} in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of labour migration in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved little at the time, it is seen a key moment {{in the emergence of}} African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade unionism and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and were rewarded. In 1940, there were several mine strikes in the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s, Estonians {{perceived}} their demographic change as a national catastrophe. This was a result of the <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> essential to the Soviet Nationalisation Programme aiming to russify Estonia – administrative and military immigration of non-Estonians from the USSR coupled with the deportation of Estonians to the USSR. In the decade following the reconstitution of independence, large-scale emigration by ethnic Russians and the removal of the Russian military bases in 1994 caused the proportion of ethnic Estonians in Estonia to increase from 61% to 69% in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of human}} {{trafficking}} has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased cross-border {{trade and the}} demand for cheap labor; however, <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> of the U.S. and other countries have not changed with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological advances that go hand in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations.|$|E

40|$|<b>Migration</b> <b>policy</b> in Germany {{today is}} better than its {{reputation}} would suggest. It has improved considerably over the last 20 years, though it has suffered setbacks and contradictions in the process. The improvements made have been driven less by a commitment to making <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> “fit for the future” than {{by the need to}} respond to a changing reality. In addition, Germany’s integration into the European Union also positively affected domestic realities of integration, which has sown the terrain for a more effective <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> concept. Nonetheless, instead of tackling problems directly, the <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> debate in Germany continues to languish under self-critical navel-gazing. As a result, <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> in Germany fails to seize present opportunities and – even worse – live up to Germany’s self-proclaimed standards as a modern, pluralistic society at the heart of Europe. A forward-looking <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> that anticipates challenges rather than a backward-looking, ad hoc approach to policymaking {{is part and parcel of}} such standards.

25|$|This {{decline in}} {{percentage}} was especially severe among the urban and young populations. Within 11 years between 1959 and 1970 {{the proportion of}} Estonians in Tallinn declined {{by as much as}} 4%, from 60% to 56% of the total population. Population growth throughout the existence of the Estonian SSR was mainly due to immigration from other regions of the Soviet Union. Although the percentage of Estonians in the total population of the Estonian SSR declined due to Soviet <b>migration</b> <b>policies,</b> the total number of ethnic Estonians increased over the Soviet period as a whole. This was due to a positive natural growth rate of some 1 or 2 thousand per year. As an example, in 1970, the number of live births of Estonians was 14,429 and the number of deaths was 12,356, giving natural increase of 2,073 ethnic Estonians.|$|E

40|$|We compare two {{migration}} policies: an open <b>migration</b> <b>policy,</b> {{where all}} migrants can migrate legally; and a selective <b>migration</b> <b>policy,</b> where migrants are selected according to skills. We show {{that since the}} selective <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> can create illegal migra-tion, it has the following e¤ects relatively to the open migration policy: (1) it weakens {{the chances of a}} positive self-selection of skilled migrants; (2) it reduces the possibility of a bene 8 ̆ 5 cial brain gain; and (3) it dampens the e¤ectiveness of education policies. Accordingly, since illegal migration can conduce to brain waste (i. e. : skilled workers working as unskilled), the selective <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> reduces the incentives of individuals to acquire education and of skilled workers to migrate...|$|R

40|$|The United Kingdom, {{like many}} {{developed}} world economies, has witnessed unprecedented immigration {{since the early}} 1990 s. Also in line with other developed world economies, the UK has adopted a “managed migration” policy paradigm. The paper argues that the operation of this paradigm is best understood with reference to two key concepts: <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> “venues” and <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> “filters. ” In terms of the former, the paper argues that managed <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> is associated with outward, upward, and downward rescaling and commensurate venue growth and diversification. In terms of the latter, the paper argues that six policy filters (legal, geographical, credential, transfer-based, monetary, and humanitarian) are commonly used to determine legitimate forms of migration but that one (the geographical filter) has been particularly prominent within the UK's managed <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> paradigm...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyze Russian <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> in order to {{understand}} why <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> in post-soviet Russia has become inconsistent and ineffective. The problems of Russian migration are significant because they affect the estimated ten million labor migrants currently working in the Russian Federation who suffer from human rights abuses. <b>Migration</b> <b>policy</b> is also significant because the Russian Federation is the main receiver of labor exported from Central Asian states and without a consistent <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> Russia risks endangering the social and political stability of Central Asia. By combining an analysis of <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> with research on the nature of the Russian state and a comparative migration analysis, it becomes clear that Russia is still in a state of transition from the Soviet Union. The problems of a transitioning state, such as a lack of state capacity, institutionalization of informal practices and a lack of trust in state institutions, combine with an overarching lack of national identity to prevent effective policy from being realized...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s 1, {{replacement}} immigration was advocated as {{an answer to}} the forecast population decline (in particular that of the working population). On top of this quantitative objective came, at the same time, the further ambition of qualitative control of inflows: selective immigration. One of the arguments put forward to support this change of direction in the <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> was a bigger net contribution to public finance by skilled immigrants compared with that of unskilled immigrants 2. Thus, by limiting the population ageing process, immigration could help reduce the associated tax burden, particularly if <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> is selective. Using a computable general equilibrium model, this letter assesses the contribution of <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> to the reduction in social protection financing needs, {{in the context of the}} population ageing process. Stopping immigration from 2010 would lead to an increase in these financing needs of 1. 3 % by 2050. A more proactive <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> (a doubling of the average net annual flow) would reduce the tax burden of ageing but at the expense of considerable demographic changes. The relative gain achieved by a selective <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> is temporary and disappears over the long term. MIGRATION;AGEING;PENSION FUNDS...|$|R
40|$|This paper surveys {{frameworks}} of {{labour migration}} in southern Africa and determines South Africa’s policy responses to inflows of migrants from seven neighbouring countries. Legislations, policy reports and scientific publications on migration were thoroughly reviewed and interviews and correspondence with key policymakers were conducted. Statistical analyses {{of data on}} foreign worker recruitments and permits issued by South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs were also performed. The absence of a migration protocol in southern Africa suggests SADC Members have not implemented the African Union’s <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> basic guidelines. Two systems coexist in southern Africa that complicate migration governance: a South Africa‐managed bilateral <b>migration</b> <b>policy,</b> and aspirations for a formal SADC‐managed <b>migration</b> <b>policy.</b> Bilateral agreements between South Africa and neighbours have established a labour migration system that dims prospects for a regional <b>migration</b> <b>policy.</b> SACU Members could establish a two‐tier policy to achieve free movement while maintaining managed <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> outside SACU.
