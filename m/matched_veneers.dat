50|$|The Marion Colored High School is a {{historic}} school building at {{the northwest corner of}} Arkansas Highway 77 and Gannt Street in Sunset, Arkansas. It is a single-story brick structure, roughly in an H shape, with hipped roofs on the wings. The oldest portion of the building, a U-shaped section, was built in 1924 with funding from the Rosenwald Fund, and was extended to its present shape sometime before 1940. The original construction is of load-bearing brick, while the added wings are frame construction finished in a <b>matching</b> brick <b>veneer.</b> It was the first school built for African-American students in the area, originally serving grades 1-8. In 1937 the school acquired high school status, and served students from four states in the region, prompting its enlargement. In 1955 it was remodeled for use exclusively as a high school. It is now closed, and only used for special events.|$|R

This fibreglass component weighs less than the original one, thus reducing unnecessary weight which could damage the structure. To further prevent the rainwater from getting in, the ASI also closed the portion between {{the wall and the}} superstructure by placing slanting stone slabs. In addition, the ASI placed new stone <b>veneers</b> <b>matching</b> the original ones on the northern, southern and western exterior walls of the temple. The ASI also cleaned the dirt that had accumulated on the temple walls over the past few centuries.|$|R
50|$|Techniques of wood {{marquetry}} {{were developed in}} Antwerp and other Flemish centers of luxury cabinet-making during the early 16th century. The craft was imported full-blown to France after the mid-seventeenth century, to create furniture of unprecedented luxury being made at the royal manufactory of the Gobelins, charged with providing furnishings to decorate Versailles and the other royal residences of Louis XIV. Early masters of French marquetry were the Fleming Pierre Golle and his son-in-law, André-Charles Boulle, who founded a dynasty of royal and Parisian cabinet-makers (ébénistes) and gave his name to a technique of marquetry employing tortoiseshell and brass with pewter in arabesque or intricately foliate designs. Boulle marquetry dropped out of favor in the 1720s, but was revived in the 1780s. In the decades between, carefully <b>matched</b> quarter-sawn <b>veneers</b> sawn from the same piece of timber were arranged symmetrically on case pieces and contrasted with gilt-bronze mounts. Floral marquetry came into favor in Parisian furniture in the 1750s, employed by cabinet-makers like Bernard van Risenbergh, Jean-Pierre Latz and Simon-François Oeben. The most famous royal French furniture veneered with marquetry are the pieces delivered by Jean Henri Riesener in the 1770s and 1780s. The Bureau du Roi was the most famous amongst these famous masterpieces.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} colored zirconia frameworks on the overall color <b>match</b> of zirconia- <b>veneered</b> restorations. Method and Materials: Identical natural and colored zirconia frameworks (Cercon Base, Degudent) were layered using a veneer ceramic (IPS e. max Ceram Dentin, Ivoclar Vivadent) applied either directly on the frameworks, over {{a thin layer of}} a masking liner (IPS e. max ZirLiner 1), or over a layer of a deep chroma dentin (IPS e. max Deep Dentin) of the required target color, A 1. Color parameters were obtained using a spectrophotometer (Spectro Shade Micro, MHT) and were used to calculate color difference value with the preselected required color (A 1 tab according to Vita Classical shade guide). Color difference value < 2. 2 was considered a clinically acceptable color match. Results: Only three combinations of tested variables had an acceptable color match compared with the target color: colored zirconia frameworks with liner material or deep chroma dentin and white zirconia frameworks directly layered with the veneer ceramic (P <. 001), all tested against a black background. The combination of yellow zirconia with deep chroma dentin over a white background produced a yellowish color shift, while white zirconia frameworks with either liner or deep chroma dentin were brighter and less yellow than the target color (A 1). Conclusions: When properly veneered, colored zirconia frameworks could produce clinically acceptable color match and have the capacity to mask a dark background such as a dark tooth or core buildup material...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{value and}} success of a well-fitting and anatomically correct {{prosthesis}} are compromised if the color does not match the adjoining tissues. The use of powder colors to help develop a simplified silicone shade guide {{to aid in the}} fabrication of silicone facial prostheses for Indian patients has been described here. Materials and Methods: Ten powder pigments were used to fabricate the silicone samples for three different subjects having light, medium and dark complexions who were separated into three groups depending on the value of their shades. Four-step wedge silicone samples with thickness variations of 1, 2, 4 and 6 mm were fabricated. Visual assessment of the samples was done by four evaluators to check the agreement of color match. Data was statistically analyzed using kappa coefficients. Results: The kappa values were found to be 0. 09 - 0. 44 for a light skin tone, - 0. 11 to 0. 77 for medium skin and 0. 44 to 0. 85 for dark skin tones. This study showed that the samples of dark skin tone matched the skin tone well and showed a statistically good agreement. To further test the validity of these shade guides, facial silicone veneers were fabricated for three patients having light, medium and dark complexion. The color matching showed satisfactory results. Conclusion: The silicone <b>veneers</b> <b>matched</b> the skin color of all three patients. Hence, this shade guide will help clinicians to obtain a good intrinsic shade and minimize extrinsic coloration...|$|R
50|$|Watson {{credited}} Bernard {{with the}} introduction of marquetry of trails of leaves and flowers in end-cut quartered veneers, often of purplewood, sometimes highlighted with stained horn and ivory set in plain <b>matched</b> panels of <b>veneers</b> of tulipwood. The lacquer panels on many pieces of Bernard's output, such as the commode and two pairs of corner cabinets in the Royal Collection or the commode stamped BVRB at the Victoria and Albert Museum (illustration), or the uncharacteristically box-like pair of low cabinets in the goût grec in the Frick Collection, New York will have been supplied to him by the marchand-mercier who commissioned such pieces, for expensive Japanese lacquer cabinets and screens, to be disassembled and incorporated in the furniture, were {{out of the reach of}} a craftsman acting on his own. Their market, too, was at the point of entry, Amsterdam, as trade with Japan was firmly in the hands of the Dutch VOC Opperhoofden. An even more luxurious finish, employing Sèvres porcelain plaques, was invented by Poirier, apparently, for he maintained a monopoly of the factory's production of these;, and Bernard was the first cabinetmaker to apply them to furniture: the earliest piece bearing porcelain plaques bears plaques of Vincennes porcelain, before the manufactory was taken under official royal patronage.Royal château marks and inventory numbers painted on many of his surviving works, related to corresponding entries in the daybooks of the Garde-Meuble du Roi, attest to his role in supplying ébénisterie to the Crown over more than two decades, often through intermediaries such as Thomas-Joachim Hébert and Lazare Duvaux; he also provided furniture for the marchand-mercier Charles Darnault.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Porcelain veneers {{have become}} an {{interesting}} treatment option to correct the shape and color of anterior teeth. Because of their limited thickness and high translucency, achieving a good color match is influenced by several variables. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of natural dentin and resin cement colors on final color <b>match</b> of porcelain <b>veneers.</b> Method and Materials: A preselected shade tab (A 1) was chosen as the target color for a maxillary central incisor, and its color parameters (L*a*b*) were measured using a digital spectrophotometer (SpectroShade, MHT). Nine natural dentin colors (Natural Die Material, Ivoclar Vivadent) representing a wide range of tooth colors were used to prepare resin replicas of the maxillary central incisor with a standard preparation for porcelain veneers. The prepared porcelain veneers (IPS Empress Esthetic, A 1, 0. 6 mm thick, Ivoclar Vivadent) were cemented on the resin dies (nine groups of natural dentin colors) using seven shades of resin cement (Variolink Veneers, Ivoclar Vivadent). The L*a*b* values of the cemented veneers were measured, and ΔE values were calculated against the preselected target color (A 1). ΔE greater than 3. 3 was considered as a significant color mismatch detectable by the human eye. Results: The seven shades of resin cement had no significant influence on the final color of the veneers, as the measured ΔE values were almost identical for every test group. On the other hand, the color of natural dentin was a significant factor that influenced final color match. None of the 63 tested combinations (nine natural dentin colors and seven resin cement colors) produced an acceptable color match. Conclusion: Thin porcelain veneers cannot mask underlying tooth color even when different shades of resin cement are used. Incorporation of opaque porcelain (high chroma) may improve final color match...|$|R
