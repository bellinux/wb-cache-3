5|$|Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides {{that are}} of {{interest}} to the <b>medical</b> <b>field,</b> because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T.mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, protecting against radiation, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 2003 over state Attorney General Ben Chandler. Early in his term, Fletcher achieved some savings {{to the state}} by reorganizing the executive branch. He proposed an overhaul to the state tax code in 2004, {{but was unable to}} get it passed through the General Assembly. When Republicans in the state senate insisted on tying the reforms to the state budget, the legislature adjourned without passing either, and the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by Fletcher until 2005, when both the budget and the reforms were passed. Later in 2005, Attorney General Greg Stumbo, the state's highest-ranking Democrat, launched an investigation into whether the Fletcher administration's hiring practices violated the state's merit system. A grand jury returned several indictments against members of Fletcher's staff, and eventually against Fletcher himself. Fletcher issued pardons for anyone on his staff implicated in the investigation, but did not pardon himself. Though the investigation was ended by an agreement between Fletcher and Stumbo in late 2006, it continued to overshadow Fletcher's re-election bid in 2007. After turning back a challenge in the Republican primary by former Congresswoman Anne Northup, Fletcher lost the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear. After his term as governor, he returned to the <b>medical</b> <b>field</b> as founder and CEO of Alton Healthcare. He is married and has two grown children.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months of}} {{arriving}} in Washington, D.C., Fletcher {{was selected as}} the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the <b>medical</b> <b>field</b> and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{elucidate}} {{the levels of}} knowledge and awareness regarding breast cancer in female 	undergraduates majoring in <b>medical</b> and non-medical <b>fields,</b> and their mothers, and communication between the 	daughters and their mothers regarding breast cancer. An anonymous questionnaire was mailed to both female 	undergraduates and their mothers. 	The subjects comprised 87 mother/daughter pairs in <b>medical</b> <b>fields</b> (responses: 51. 6 %, valid questionnaires: 40. 5 %), 	and 89 mother/daughter pairs in non-medical fields, (responses: 35. 0 %, valid questionnaires 29. 7 %), totaling 176 pairs. 	Students in <b>medical</b> <b>fields</b> had significantly greater knowledge and awareness regarding breast cancer compared to 	their counterparts in non-medical fields. In addition, there was significantly close communication from students in 	<b>medical</b> <b>fields</b> to their mothers about breast cancer, compared to those in non-medical fields. On the other hand, 	mothers in <b>medical</b> <b>fields</b> and those in non-medical fields showed {{no significant difference in}} knowledge and awareness 	regarding breast cancer, and in communication from mother to daughter regarding breast cancer. A comparison of 	daughters in <b>medical</b> <b>fields</b> and their mothers revealed no difference in breast cancer knowledge. In addition, there 	was no difference in their ‘Interest in breast cancer’ and ‘Intention to carry out regular breast self-examinations’. 	Furthermore, {{there was no difference in}} communication of breast cancer knowledge from mothers to daughters and 	vice versa. A comparison of daughters in non-medical fields and their mothers revealed that the mothers had 	significantly greater knowledge and awareness regarding breast cancer, and it was mostly the mothers who 	communicated breast cancer knowledge to their daughters. 	In conclusion, female undergraduates in <b>medical</b> <b>fields,</b> with higher knowledge and close communication with their 	mothers regarding breast cancer, might have ability to promote breast cancer screening to their mothers. Education 	to female undergraduates in non-medical fields and motivation for communication between mothers and daughters 	regarding breast cancer is considered to be important to raise their awareness...|$|R
