50|$|The {{eruption}} {{began in}} a sub-plinian style creating a column of volcanic gas, pyroclasts and ash about 8 km in height. The erupting N135° trending fissure had two craters of major activity emplaced at each end; the Gris Crater and El Azufral Crater. Volcanic vents of Cordón Caulle that were not in eruption produced visible steam emissions. After this explosive phase the eruption changed character to a more effusive one marked by rhyodacitic blocky and Aa type lava flows emitted from the vents along the N135° trending fissure. A third phase followed {{with the appearance of}} short north-north west (N165°) oriented vents transverse to the <b>main</b> <b>fissure</b> which also erupted rhyodacitic lava. The third phase ended temporarily with viscous lava obstructing the vents, but continued soon with explosive activity restricted to the Gris and El Azufral craters. The eruption came to an end on 22 July.|$|E

40|$|The {{diamonds}} {{associated with}} the 148 Ma Group II Klipspringer kimberlite dyke system emplaced on the Thabazimbi-Murchison Lineament are predominantly of eclogitic origin, and in a parallel study have been demonstrated to have a late Archean origin. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) analysis of diamond plates demonstrates complex intergrowth of N-rich and N-poor diamond. Two groups of diamonds occurring in both the <b>Main</b> <b>Fissure</b> and the Sugarbird Blow have been recognised with time averaged mantle residence temperatures (MRT) based on nitrogen aggregation of approximately 1090 °C (low-T) and 1170 °C (high-T) respectively. In some cases a core of high-T diamond is enclosed within an envelope of low-T diamond. At Marsfontein, a third diamond population with an MRT < 1070 °C is present {{that has not been}} recorded in diamonds from the <b>Main</b> <b>Fissure</b> or the Sugarbird Blow. Observed lamination lines attest to a deformation event having affected most of the high-T diamonds. A correlation between hydrogen and the ratio between nitrogen present in B aggregates and platelet peak intensity suggests that the presence of hydrogen affects the formation of platelets. Mineral inclusions in the diamonds are predominantly eclogitic (sulfide, garnet, clinopyroxene, kyanite, coesite and rutile). The garnets and clinopyroxenes have a wide range in compositions, extending the worldwide fields for diamond inclusions. The garnets define four groups, one of which is grospyditic and the individual groups display inter-element correlations, which are consistent with magmatic fractionation. The clinopyroxenes include a high aluminium group exhibiting cation site deficiencies (7 to 28...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sedimentary dykes in the Permian reef {{complexes}} of the Russian platform {{are well}} preserved and important in providing information about reef growth, the reef biota and, par-ticularly, cavity-dwelling organisms and sediment sources. Two <b>main</b> <b>fissure</b> assemblages are recognized with N 80 ~ and N 170 ~ (late Asselian-early Sakmarian) and N 130 ~ 176 and N 60 ~ (Sakmarian-Artinskian) orientations. These contemporaneous rthogonal dyke sets present orientations {{corresponding to the}} regional tectonic fabric and a tectonic origin for fracturing associated with the foreland basin development. The largest dykes record eight lithofacies and several stages of fracture opening. Stromatoids and centimetre-thick deposits of peloidal grainstones-packstones (thromboids), which form in situ within microbial laminae on the fissure walls, preceded filling by skeletal and terrigenous sediments. The fissures contain a well-preserved biota similar to the Lower Permian cavity-dwelling organisms observed within the reef. The coelobiontic habitat was episodically enlarged by successive synsedimentary fracturing episodes reflecting several phases of encrustation a d infill of recurrent lithofacies. The pioneer microbialites grew when nothing else was deposited in the fissures immediately after fracturing. Gastropods and ostracods occur as dense clusters, probably indicating insit...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the marginal integrity and microleakage of standardized Class I resin composite restorations when placed with either "total" or "selective bonding" techniques. Sixty standardized Class I cavities comprising the <b>main</b> <b>fissure</b> system were prepared (9 mm length and 7 mm width). Cavity depth {{was set at}} 2. 5 mm. In cavities where a glass ionomer liner was placed, the cavity was deepened by an additional 0. 5 mm. In "total bonding" specimens, enamel and dentin were conditioned using a four-step adhesive system (Syntac Classic). In teeth with "selective bonding," a chemical curing conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC; Ketac Fil) and light-curing resin-modified glass ionomer liner (RMGI; Vitrebond) or three-step adhesive bonding liner (Syntac) were applied. The cavity margins of the latter specimens were finished with water-spray, acid-etched and a bonding agent was applied. All restorations were placed in two oblique increments. Totally bonded ceramic inlays (Cerec) served as the control. All specimens were subjected to thermo-mechanical loading (1. 2 Mio cycles) and marginal quality and microleakage were assessed. The highest percentage of margins rated as "perfect" was found in selective bonding samples with glass ionomer liners and totally bonded inlay restorations. All the other groups showed significantly decreased marginal quality (p < 0. 05). The same results were found for the microleakage assessment. The authors {{of the current study}} concluded that the application of a GIC liner significantly improved the overall marginal adaptation of direct Class I restorations.

40|$|Item of Tackle Key Problems of Guangdong Province [A 302020401]The {{complexity}} of liver reconstruction has limited partial right lobe living donor liver transplantation. It is {{largely due to}} the difficulty of dealing with the middle hepatic vein. We sought to define the anatomic features of hepatic veins. Forty-one fresh adult livers, 43 formalin-fixed adult cadaver livers, and 91 adult liver corrosion casts were used for the study. We determined the number of branches, the maximum diameter, the whole length, the extrahepatic length of the hepatic veins, and the deviation of the middle hepatic vein from the <b>main</b> portal <b>fissure.</b> Nakamura and Tsuzuki's classification of hepatic vein types was used. Type A, B, and C accounted for 59. 4, 27. 8, and 12. 8 % of all specimens in this study, respectively. The middle and left hepatic veins formed a common trunk in 60. 3 % of the specimens, and the length of the common trunk was 1. 12 +/- 0. 62 cm. The degree of deviation {{to the right of the}} middle hepatic vein from the <b>main</b> portal <b>fissure</b> was 14. 11 degrees +/- 12. 65 degrees. The frequency of hepatic vein types and the degree of deviation to the right of the middle hepatic vein in this study is markedly different from that reported in other literature.

40|$|This thesis descnbes the afferent, efferent and {{intrinsic}} connections of the vestibular nuclei in the Dutch belted rabbit. Different anatomical tracing {{techniques were}} used to study these projections. A description of the vestibular complex was added, since recent data for the rabbit are scarce (Chapter 2). A comparison between cytoarchitecture and staining for acetylcholinesterase and cytochromoxidase supported the subdivision of the central magnocellular area of the vestibular complex into a dorsal region comprising the lateral vestibular nucleus of Deiters and the ventrally located magnocellular portion of the medial vestibular nucleus. Additional evidence supporting this distinction came from {{a detailed analysis of}} the primary vestibular input in the rabbit (Chapter 3). The central projections of the vestibular nerve were investigated with anterograde axonal transport of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and tritiated leucine following injection in the vestibular ganglion. Labeled fibers and terminal ramifications were observed throughout the vestibular complex, including the magnocellular part of the medial vestibular nucleus, but they were absent from lateral vestibular nucleus. The absence of a projection of the vesnbular nerve to lateral vestibular nucleus is in accordance with the findings in other mammals (Voogd, 1964, Korte, 1979, Carleton and Carpenter, 1984). Termination in the cortex was restricted to the vermis. Small numbers of mossy fiber terminals were present bilaterally, close to the midline in lobules I and II, and in the depth of the <b>main</b> <b>fissures</b> separating the lobules II- VI. In the posterior vermis labeled mossy fiber terminals were found in lobule X and the ventral aspect of lobule IXd.

Piton de la Fournaise erupted three times during 1989 - 1997 with fissures opening near Dolomieu summit crater. During this period no Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry data were available and only few geodetic points surveyed the summit crater. We therefore, apply {{for the first time the}} subpixel image-correlation technique on airborne images for monitoring ground deformation on Piton de la Fournaise volcano. Correlogram analysis reveals cumulative deformation in the summit area. We observe ESE spreading of the summit caused by the inflation-deflation cycle during 1989 - 1997.

40|$|Two strong flank eruptions {{occurred}} in July–August 2001 and from late October 2002 to late January 2003 at Mt. Etna volcano. The two eruptions mainly involved the upper southern {{flank of the}} volcano, a particularly active area during the last 30 years, damaging several tourist facilities and threatening some villages. The composite eruptive activity on the upper southern flank of Mt. Etna during 2001 – 2003 has confirmed “a posteriori” {{the results of a}} multidisciplinary study, started well before its occurrence by combining geological, seismic and geochemical data gathered {{in this part of the}} volcano. We were able, in fact, to highlight fractured zones likely to be re-activated in the near future in this area, where the largest majority of eruptive fissures in the recent past opened along N 120 ° to N 180 ° ranging directions. The spatial distribution of earthquake epicentres during the period June 30 th 2000 –June 30 th 2001 showed the greatest frequency in a sector compatible with both the direction of the <b>main</b> <b>fissures</b> of the pre- 2001 period and that of the 2001 and 2002 lateral eruptions. Soil CO 2 and soil temperature surveys carried out in the studied area during the last 3 years have revealed anomalous release of magmatic fluids (mainly CO 2 and water vapour) along some NNW–SSE-trending volcano-tectonic structures of the area even during inter-eruptive periods, indicating persistent convective hydrothermal systems at shallow depth connected with the main feeder conduits of Etna. The temporal changes in both seismic and geochemical data from June 30 th, 2000 to June 30 th, 2001 were compared with the evolution of volcanic activity. The comparison allowed to recognize at least two sequences of anomalous signals (August to December 2000 and April to June 2001), likely related to episodes of step-like magma ascent towards the surface, as indicated by the following eruptive episodes. The N 120 ° to N 180 ° structural directions are in accord with one of the main structural lines affecting eastern Sicily; they would be important pathways for magma uprise to the surface that will keep on feeding the eruptive activity of Etna in the near future. This study also pointed out the high instability of the southern slope of Etna, a sector where the potential hazard by lava flow invasion will remain high also in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Results from seismic {{surveys in}} Fogo and Brava Islands (Cape Verde) before, {{during and after}} the April 1995 Fogo {{eruption}} are combined with structural, historical and petrogy data. The analysis of seismic data from the first trimester of 1994 shows clear evidence of magma movements under the channel between the two islands, and suggests a possible connection between the two plumbing systems. During the 1995 eruption, the seismic monitoring inside the caldera allowed the identification of a sub vertical dyke, with the strike of the <b>main</b> eruptive <b>fissure</b> (060 deg C). The local stress field is estimated from several joint focal mechanisms and indicates a spatial and temporal interplay between two distinct contributions. Besides the expected #omega#_ 3 direction normal to the dyke, a group of local solutions point to a stress field with nearly dyke parallel #omega# 3. The latter is interpreted to have controlled the post eruptive reactivation (with magma transport) of a 120 deg C oriented structure, also defined by the hipocentral distribution. Together, the seismic and structural data suggest that gravity {{played a significant role in}} the re-adjustment of the edifice following the eruption. The data set from the surveys of 1994, 1995 and 1999 allowed the classification of the volcanic seismicity in different categories.

40|$|Background: The {{conventional}} treatment of chronic anal fissure is lateral sphincterotomy (LAS). The alternative options of tailored sphincterotomy (TS) and chemical sphincterotomy using medication such as nifedipine have recently become available. Methods: A prospective randomized trial {{was conducted to}} compare LAS with TS and oral nifedipine. The <b>main</b> endpoints were <b>fissure</b> healing, symptom relief, recurrence and continence. Results: One hundred and thirty-two patients were treated and followed up for 4 months. LAS was significantly more effective than TS in providing pain relief (P = 0 · 004) and better patient satisfaction (P = 0 · 020) at 4 weeks. Surgery (LAS and TS) was associated with significantly better fissure healing rates (both P < 0 · 001 at 16 weeks) and less recurrence (both P = 0 · 003) than nifedipine. There were substantial problems with compliance in the nifedipine group (17 of 41 patients), related to side-effects and slow healing. There were no differences in continence between the three treatment groups. Conclusion: LAS was most effective in providing pain relief and allowing rapid fissure healing, with minimal recurrence and no increased risk of incontinence, in patients with good anal sphincter function...|$|R

Design: Evaluation of diagnostic technology. Participants and Controls: Monocular palpebral fissure images of 35 patients with Graves' upper eyelid retraction and of 30 normal subjects. Methods: Custom software was used to measure the conventional midpupil upper lid distance (MPLD) and 12 oblique MPLDs on each 15 degrees across the temporal (105 degrees, 120 degrees, 135 degrees, 150 degrees, 165 degrees, and 180 degrees) and nasal (75 degrees, 60 degrees, 45 degrees, 30 degrees, 15 degrees, and 0 degrees) sectors of the lid <b>fissure.</b> <b>Main</b> Outcome Measures: Mean, standard deviation, 5 th and 95 th percentiles of the oblique MPLDs obtained for patients and controls. Temporal/nasal MPLD ratios of the same angles with respect to the midline. Results: The MPLDs increased from the vertical midline in both nasal and temporal sectors of the fissure. In the control group the differences between the mean central MPLD (90 degrees) and those up to 30 degrees in the nasal (75 degrees and 60 degrees) and temporal sectors (105 degrees and 120 degrees) were not significant. For greater eccentricities, all temporal and nasal mean MPLDs increased significantly. When the MPLDs of the same angles were compared between groups, the mean values of the Graves' patients differed from control at all angles (F = 4192; P< 0. 0001). The greatest temporal/nasal asymmetry occurred 60 degrees from the vertical midline. Conclusions: The measurement of radial MPLD is a simple and effective way to characterize lid contour abnormalities.

40|$|Abstract Mount Etna in Sicily (Italy) shows {{more than}} 2, 500 years of {{interactions}} between volcanic eruptions and human activity, {{and these are}} well documented in historical sources.

In this paper a detailed field and historical reconstruction of the 1928 eruption is presented which allows three themes to be discussed: the evolution of the flow field, lava volume and average magma discharge rate trend; the eruption's human impact, particularly the destruction of the town of Mascali; and the recovery of the region with re-construction of Mascali in a new location. Detailed mapping of lava flows allowed the following dimensions to be calculated: total area, 4. 38 x 106 m 2; maximum length, 9. 4 km; volume, 52. 91 ± 5. 21 × 106 m 3 and an average effusion rate of 38. 5 m 3 s- 1. Time-averaged discharged rates are calculated allowing the reconstruction of their temporal variations {{during the course of the}} eruption evidencing a high maximum effusion rate of 374 m 3 s- 1. These trends, in particular with regard to the Lower <b>Fissure</b> <b>main</b> phase of the eruption, are in accordance with the ‘idealized discharge model’ of Wadge (1981), proposed for basaltic eruptions driven by de-pressurization of magma sources, mainly through reservoir relaxation (i. e. elastic contraction of a magma body). The eruption took place when Italy was governed by Mussolini and the fascist party. The State response both, during and in the immediate aftermath of the eruption and in the years that followed during which Mascali was reconstructed, was impressive. This masked a less benign legacy, however, that can be traced for several subsequent decades of using responses to natural catastrophes to manufacture State prestige by reacting to, rather than planning for, disasters...|$|R

A identificação foi realizada através de PCR duplo com iniciadores específicos e análises de RFLP com as enzimas de restrição AluI, RsaI, KpnI, MseI, HhaI, HpaII, HinfI e MboI. Em 23 plantas amostradas, fitoplasmas foram detectados em 10 delas, através da amplificação do 16 S rDNA, visualizado em gel de agarose na forma de bandas de 1, 2 Kb. A identificação por PCR demonstrou que os fitoplasmas associados ao amarelo da videira pertenciam aos grupos 16 SrI e 16 SrIII. As análises dos perfis eletroforéticos obtidos com o uso da técnica de RFLP revelaram a presença de fitoplasmas afiliados ao subgrupo 16 SrI-B. A constatação de fitoplasmas pertencentes a estes dois grupos nas plantas amostradas demonstraram a ocorrência da doença conhecida como amarelo da videira nos Estados de São Paulo e Paraná.
