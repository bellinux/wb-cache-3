40|$|Abstract: The work {{described}} {{here has been}} carried out to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} tooth root cracking failure mode of timing belts. Previous work has demonstrated the close dependence of this on the tooth deflections of fully <b>meshed</b> <b>teeth,</b> generated by torque transmission, but has not considered the additional distortions generated in the partially meshed conditions at entry to and exit from a pulley groove. Approximate compatibility and constitutive equations are combined with a rigorous consideration of tooth equilibrium in partial meshing to show how bending moments are generated at both exit from a driven pulley and entry to a driving pulley. Experimentally determined belt lives correlate very well with a combined measure of fully <b>meshed</b> <b>tooth</b> strain and strain due to bending at entry or exit. The analysis also shows that this strain measure reduces with increasing belt tooth stiffness, confirming the importance of a high tooth stiffness for a long belt life. Tooth force variations through the partial meshing cycle have also been predicted and compared with measurements obtained from a special strain gauge instrumented pulley. A greater pulley rotation than is predicted is required for a belt tooth to seat in a pulley groove. There is room for improvement in the modelling...|$|R

50|$|Hypoid gears {{resemble}} {{spiral bevel}} gears except the shaft axes do not intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. Hypoid gears are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between hypoid gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral bevel pinion, with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of hypoid gears. This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does. Bringing hypoid gears to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{article has}} carried out {{systematic}} {{research on the}} multi-tooth meshing problem of involute internal gear pairs with small tooth number difference of normal gear. It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of internal gear pairs with precise tooth profile, then determines the number of multi-tooth <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the number of <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs. In the range of tooth number of internal gear equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth number difference equal to 1 the number of effective <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth number difference equal to 5 the number of effective <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the number of <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs are tooth number and tooth number difference. The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth number difference is, the fewer the number of <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth number difference is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease {{of the number of}} <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pairs. Within the normal value scope of modification coefficient difference of involute internal gear pairs with small tooth number difference, the influence of modification coefficient difference and modification coefficient is very small. When the torque increases, the number of effective contacting teech pairs will keep unchanged. The research in this article provides reference for the calculation of loading capacity of multi-tooth meshing of internal gear pairs with small tooth number difference of normal gear...|$|E

A tribo-dynamics {{model of a}} {{differential}} hypoid gear pair is presented, integrated with lubricated contact of <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> pair with lubricants of varying rheological properties.

The influence of gear torsional dynamic response is taken into account in a 4 -Degree of Freedom (DoF) model. The contact geometry and kinematics of the hypoid gear pair are estimated, using Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA). Two fully formulated gear lubricants of the same viscosity grade (SAE 75 W- 90) blended with the same additive pack, but with different types and concentration of viscosity modifier (VM) are considered. Conjunctional friction is predicted for viscous shear of fully characterised lubricants as well as boundary interaction of rough surfaces.

40|$|Abstract: Spur and {{helical gears}} {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} very large power between two parallel shafts. However in spur gears the engagement between two <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> is sudden line contact over entire face width which results in generation of noise and higher dynamic load. In helical gears the engagement between two <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> begins with point contact and gradually extends diagonally along the gear tooth surface, resulting in quiet operation. Hence normally spur gears are used for low speed power transmission (20 m/s) and helical gears are preferred for high speed. A considerable {{research in the area of}} bending stress analysis of involute spur gear has been carried out. However it is seen that a very little work has been carried out on stress analysis of involute helical gears. For finding stress concentration & stress pattern in the body, experimental stress analysis is very useful & is employed extensively. In Eco Board Industries Limited., Islampur (Maharashtra), spreading machine is used to spread bagasse in the formation of particle board. Positive Infinite Variable (PIV) gear box is used to transmit the power to belt conveyor of spreading machine which contains helical gears. The power transmitted by gear box is 2. 2 kW at 760 rpm while speed reduction is 1 : 70. In working condition of gear box it has been observed that helical pinion mounted on motor shaft fails due to load coming on the teeth. It seems that the failure is due to stress concentration and bending stresses at tooth root of gear. The crack is initiated just near to high stress concentration region of gear. The calculation of maximum tensile stress of helical gear at tooth root is three dimensional problem. The accurate evaluation of stress state and distribution of stress i...|$|E

The results show that the effect of a pair of gears relief is better than one gear relief for linear and conic relief curve, and the effect of one gear relief is better than a pair of gears relief for cubic and sine relief curve. So dynamic simulation on modified involute gears has great significance for reducing contact force of teeth face of gears...|$|R

40|$|Sliding {{friction}} between <b>meshing</b> <b>teeth</b> {{can be a}} very important of noise and vibration excitation source in geared systems. This study presents a single degree of freedom torsional model for a FZG type C single gear pair. Starting from a base dynamic model with time varying mesh stiffness as the only internal excitation, the influence of additional effects is gradually considered, namely, constant friction coefficients and time varying output torques. In particular, sliding friction is modeled as external and internal linear time varying excitation. On the other hand, time varying output torques are also considered as alternative of constant driven torque. The gear’s rotational vibrations are calculated by Runge-Kutta method for different combinations of rational speeds, input torques and friction coefficients. The results indicate that dynamic transmission errors calculated from modeling the friction force as external and internal excitation are quite different, especially when contact point moves ahead of pitch point. However the influence of time variations on output torque is very reduced. 1...|$|E
