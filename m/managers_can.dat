5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

25|$|RBV {{presumes that}} firms are bundles of {{heterogeneous}} resources and capabilities that are imperfectly mobile across firms. This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources. McWilliams and Siegel (2001) examined CSR activities and attributes as a differentiation strategy.

25|$|Large {{negative}} earnings surprises {{may have}} legal and reputational costs to managers. Firstly, <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> be held personally liable if shareholders sue the firm {{for failing to}} disclose negative earnings news promptly. Secondly, money managers may choose not to hold, and analysts may choose not to follow, the stocks of firms whose managers have reputations for withholding bad news. This may contribute to managers' voluntary disclosure of information related to negative earnings surprises: quarterly earnings announcements containing large negative earnings surprises are preempted by voluntary disclosures more frequently than are other earnings announcements.|$|E

High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), small-business owners and families who desire the assistance of a credentialed financial advisory specialist call upon wealth managers to coordinate retail banking, estate planning, legal resources, tax professionals and investment management. Wealth <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> have backgrounds as independent Chartered Financial Consultants, Certified Financial Planners or Chartered Financial Analysts (in the United States), Chartered Strategic Wealth Professionals (in Canada), Chartered Financial Planners (in the UK), or any credentialed (such as MBA) professional money managers who work to enhance the income, growth and tax-favored treatment of long-term investors.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonable}} compromise {{for using}} {{large numbers of}} passwords is to record them in a password manager program, which include stand-alone applications, web browser extensions, or a manager built into the operating system. A password manager allows the user to use hundreds of different passwords, and only have to remember a single password, the one which opens the encrypted password database. Needless to say, this single password should be strong and well-protected (not recorded anywhere). Most password <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> automatically create strong passwords using a cryptographically secure random password generator, as well as calculating the entropy of the generated password. A good password manager will provide resistance against attacks such as key logging, clipboard logging and various other memory spying techniques.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund {{management}} {{firms are}} usually owned by their portfolio managers, who are therefore entitled to any profits {{that the business}} makes. As management fees are intended to cover the firm's operating costs, performance fees (and any excess management fees) are generally distributed to the firm's owners as profits. Funds do not tend to report compensation and so published lists of the amounts earned by top managers tend to be estimates based on {{factors such as the}} fees charged by their funds and the capital they are thought to have invested in them. Many managers have accumulated large stakes in their own funds and so top hedge fund <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> earn extraordinary amounts of money, perhaps up to $4 billion in a good year.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes a {{strategy}} gives a positive return {{but it is}} a very tiny one. Therefore, a <b>manager</b> <b>can</b> use leverage to magnify his return.

2500|$|Relative value {{arbitrage}} strategies {{take advantage}} of relative discrepancies in price between securities. The price discrepancy can occur due to mispricing of securities compared to related securities, the underlying security or the market overall. Hedge fund <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> use various types of analysis to identify price discrepancies in securities, including mathematical, technical or fundamental techniques. Relative value is often used as a synonym for market neutral, as strategies in this category typically have very little or no directional market exposure to the market as a whole.

2500|$|Since island {{ecosystems}} are self-contained, {{it should be}} possible to mitigate many of the threats to species. [...] Ecologists and managers are working together to prioritize areas for conservation and to quickly design and implement action plans. [...] Not everything can be put into a reserve, so it is important to first compile pertinent information and prioritize areas of concern. [...] Once an area has been chosen, managers must then acquire ownership and gain support. [...] Local experts and indigenous populations should also be involved in this process. [...] Having clearly defined goals will facilitate the many necessary interactions between people and agencies. [...] Once a reserve is in place, <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> then practice adaptive management and do continued community education.|$|E
2500|$|Project {{management}} {{can apply}} to any project, but it is often tailored to accommodate the specific [...] needs of different and highly specialized industries. [...] For example, the construction industry, which focuses on the delivery of things like buildings, roads, and bridges, has developed its own specialized form of project management that it refers to as construction project management and in which project <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> become trained and certified. [...] The information technology industry has also evolved to develop its own form of project management that {{is referred to as}} IT project management and which specializes in the delivery of technical assets and services that are required to pass through various lifecycle phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. Biotechnology project management focuses on the intricacies of biotechnology research and development. Localization project management includes many standard project management practices even though many consider this type of management to be a very different discipline. It focuses on three important goals: time, quality and budget. Successful projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and according to previously agreed quality standards.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oil palm}} (Elaeis guineensis) {{provides}} {{another example of}} the potential of reconciliation ecology. [...] It {{is one of the most}} important and rapidly expanding tropical crops, so lucrative because it is used in many products throughout the world. Unfortunately, oil-palm agriculture is one of the main drivers of forest conversion in Southeast Asia and is devastating for native biodiversity, perhaps even more so than logging. However, attempts are being made to foster the sustainability of this industry. [...] As a monoculture, oil palm is subject to potentially devastating attacks from insect pests. Many companies are attempting an integrated pest management approach which encourages the planting of species that support predators and parasitoids of these insect pests, as well as an active native bird community. Experiments have shown that a functioning bird community, especially at higher densities, can serve to reduce insect herbivory on oil palms, promoting increased crop yields and profits. [...] Thus, oil palm plantation <b>managers</b> <b>can</b> participate in reconciliation ecology by promoting local vegetation that is beneficial to insectivorous birds, including maintaining ground plants that serve as nesting sites, thereby protecting natural communities. [...] Additionally, steps such as maintaining riparian buffer zones or natural forest patches can help to slow the loss of biodiversity within oil palm plantation landscapes. [...] By engaging in these environmentally friendly practices, fewer chemicals and less effort are required to maintain both plantation productivity and ecosystem services.|$|E
