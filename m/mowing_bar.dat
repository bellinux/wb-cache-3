The engine has a decompression system and a crank for starting. The torque is transmitted to the gearbox with a clutch of the type Renak 16K. As well as the engine, the gearbox is licensed. It is a ZF Friedrichshafen four-speed gearbox with a reverse gear. For braking, drum brakes are used, the hand brake is a gearbox brake. For power take-off, the tractor has a belt-pulley and an engine speed dependent PTO. Some tractors were equipped with a cab, some tractors also have a <b>mowing</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

The paint is RAL 3002 Karminrot for the body and RAL 1014 or 1015 Elfenbein for the rims. The Standard 218 doesn't have a fuel tap due to tightness problems.|$|E
