This work evaluated the use of three different fossil liquid fuels, i. e., diesel, <b>mineral</b> <b>lubricant</b> oil and synthetic lubricant oil in a 1 kWth CLC continuous unit working with a Fe-based oxygen carrier prepared by impregnation method. The effect of key parameters of the CLC process behavior was studied with the same batch of oxygen carrier particles for a total of 150 operation hours. With regard to the results obtained, every fuel tested was able to achieve 90 % combustion efficiency being synthetic lubricant oil the most reactive fuel studied. Hydrocarbon reactivity seems to depend on the nature of the chemical bonds, being higher for alkenes (synthetic lubricant oil) than for alkanes (diesel and <b>mineral</b> <b>lubricant</b> oil). CH 4 was revealed as a relatively stable intermediate combustion product for these liquid fuels. Therefore, oxygen carrier’s reactivity towards this gas becomes crucial for the overall conversion. The characterization carried out to the oxygen carrier after operation revealed no evidence of changes derived from the sulphur or impurities present in the fuel. Therefore, the Fe-based material herein used seems to be suitable for conversion of fossil liquid fuels.

40|$|The {{development}} of Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (EALs) {{and their use}} has been gaining momentum over the last decade. It {{has been shown that}} raw EALs degrade in the environment in about one tenth the time of an equivalent mineral based lubricant. Estimates and findings such as these serve to highlight the potential benefits of the EAL products, it is also important however to investigate the by-products of their use to ensure that the benefits are not cancelled by an increase of, for instance, combustion by-products. This thesis compares the emissions from a two-stroke outboard engine when using an EAL and an equivalent <b>mineral</b> <b>lubricant,</b> where the primary objective of the study is to characterise and quantify the pollutants that remain within the water column after combustion. To accomplish this, tests were conducted both in the laboratory (freshwater) and in the field (seawater) for a range of throttle settings. A 1. 9 kW two-stroke outboard engine was set-up in a test tank and water samples were taken from the tank after the engine had been run for a period at each of the throttle settings. The tests were repeated for a 5. 9 kW four-stroke engine, however, the experiments were only conducted in the laboratory (freshwater) and using only a standard <b>mineral</b> <b>lubricant.</b> Statistical analyses of the results were conducted using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A simple dilution model was used to estimate the initial outboard engine emission concentrations, which was extended to determine the concentrations at distances of 1, 10 and 100 metres from the source. An investigation of the Total Toxicity Equivalence of the PAH pollutant concentrations (TEQPAH) was conducted using Toxicity Equivalent Factors (TEFs). Results for both types of engine and in both fresh and seawater showed that even the initial concentrations at the source, in almost all instances, were well below the ANZECC water quality guidelines trigger levels. At a distance of 1 metre from the source all concentrations were well below, and therefore, the Total Toxicity Equivalents of the PAHs were found to be even lower. It is concluded that the emissions from a single outboard engine when using either an EAL or a mineral based lubricant are similar. However, the use of EALs has further reaching advantages in that spilt raw lubricants will degrade in the environment up to 10 times faster than a <b>mineral</b> <b>lubricant.</b> Also EALs are less toxic to aquatic and marine organisms and therefore the benefits of using them has to be viewed from a wider perspective. The results in this thesis for a single outboard engine now form the basis for a more detailed environmental assessment of their impacts...|$|E

30|$|Lubricant is a {{substance}} (often a liquid) reduces the friction and wear when introduced between two moving surfaces. A lubricant provides a protective film {{which allows for}} two touching surfaces to be separated and thus lessening the friction between them. Hence, in internal combustion engines lubricant is very essential for longer life of the engine. Lubricants are generally composed {{of a majority of}} base oil plus a variety of additives to impart desirable characteristics. The types of the lubricant depend upon the types of base oils. The base oils may be mineral (petroleum originated), synthetic (polyalphaolefins, polyalkylene glycols, synthetic esters, silicones etc.) or vegetable (sunflower oil, soybean oil, palm oil etc.). When the base oil is a vegetable oil, then the lubricant is known as biolubricant, in case of synthetic oil it is called synthetic lubricant and when the base oil is mineral or petroleum based then the lubricant is known as <b>mineral</b> <b>lubricant.</b> Most of the lubricants used today are mineral or petroleum based and are a mixture of paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Nowadays, with increasing environmental pollution although it is essential to use vegetable oils as base fluid rather than mineral oil or synthetic ester based oils, but due to the poor oxidative and hydrolytic stability, high temperature sensitivity of tribological behavior, poor cold flow properties and high cost vegetable oils are very limitedly used as base oils for industrial lubricants [1, 2]. So, the petroleum-based fluids are still now dominated in the lubricant market due to its ease availability and lower cost.|$|E

Apparently, the reaction temperature has more significant effect on the conversion of OA as compared to molar ratio of reactant, verifying that the reaction is controlled by surface reaction. The catalyst synthesized in this work is expected to provide a simpler and cheaper separation process with the catalyst reuse, reduced waste generation, and increase in yield of TMP oleate at optimum parameters...|$|R
40|$|Micropitting {{is a form}} {{of surface}} contact fatigue encounteredin bearingsa nd gears, under {{lubricating}} conditions, which lead to their premature failure. All gears are susceptible to micropitting, including spur, helical and bevel. Micropitting can occur with all heatt reatmentsa ppliedt o gearsa nd with both, synthetica nd <b>mineral</b> <b>lubricants.</b> It can occur after {{a relatively short period of}} operation and, after a certain number of cycles,g earsn eedt o be replacedd ue to the increasedn oisea nd vibrations causedb y the deviations of the tooth profile. Continuing operation of affected gears can lead to a catastrophic type of failure (i. e., tooth breakage). These considerations explain the increasing current interest in micropitting. It has been reported that micropitting in bearings is associated with a specific microstructural transformation in steel, i. e. martensite decay. However, to the authoes knowledge, this transformation has not been reported in gears. In the present work, extensive metallurgical investigations have been carried out and they revealed that the same transformation occurs in gears. The aim of this project was to describe the mechanism of micropitting by taking into account the influence of several controlling factors such as, material, surface finish, lubricant, load, temperature,s peeda nd, slide-to-roll ratio. Their influence is assessed with a fractional factorial experimentadl esign. S everaln on-destructivete chniquesh ave been used in order to monitor the specimen condition during and after running, such as X-ray diffraction, optical profilometry, light microscopy. The mechanical properties of the products of martensite decay, known as dark etching regions, white etching bands and butterflies are highly relevant to the fatigue behaviour of the steel.

40|$|Abstract. The {{push-through}} {{bending process}} {{can be regarded as}} a bending mechanism with two fixed diepoints and two movable diepoints, resulting in a total of four points. It can also be regarded as acontinuous four-points bending. As compared to other bending processes, there is severe friction at the contact area betweenthematerial and die in push-through bending. In this paper, we clarify different aspects of lubrication and research excellent lubrication oil in push-through bending. Based on theresultsobtained, it was found that adhesion occursdepending on the lubricant used and the occurring force. It was also confirmed, that olefin is effective as a remedy for oiliness, in case of using a <b>mineral</b> oil-based <b>lubricant.</b> In addition, it was confirmed that excellent lubrication oil could be obtained by increasing the alcohol content and adjusting the content of synthetic ester. This is a good alternative to the more expensive olefin...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{environment}} concern, {{the current}} <b>lubricant</b> such <b>mineral</b> oil-based <b>lubricant</b> is not environmentally friendly {{as it were}} not readily biodegradable and toxic. Therefore, the vegetable oil-based lubricant has been promoted in order to replace mineral oil-based. In this study, the performance of lubricant for six different ratios between RBD Palm Olein and Semi-Synthetic oil were tested in different loads and been discussed in different parameters including coefficient of friction, wear scar diameter, surface roughness, flash temperature parameter and wear worn surface. Four-ball tribotester machine used to evaluate performance of sample lubricants using ASTM D 4172 standard. From the results, {{it shows that the}} sample lubricants for engine oil mixing with RBD Palm Olein reduce in 38 % of coefficient of friction compared to pure engine oil. From overall of the results, the performance of lubricant was improved as RBD Palm Olein mixing with engine oil...|$|R
