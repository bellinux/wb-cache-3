25|$|Shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels), {{account for}} two-thirds of <b>marine</b> <b>aquaculture</b> production, {{followed}} by salmon (25 percent) and shrimp (10 percent). Production occurs mainly on land, in ponds, and in coastal waters under state jurisdiction. As {{a result of}} recent advances in offshore aquaculture technology, commercial finfish and shellfish operations have been established in more exposed, open ocean locations in state waters in New Hampshire, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Intensive <b>marine</b> <b>aquaculture</b> in {{the last}} decade has {{increased}} considerably and resulted in considerable adverse environmental impacts. Large discharge volumes of organic matter from uneaten feed and excretory waste from aquacultured species has resulted in high levels of nutrients within coastal waters. Large quantities of nitrogen (~ 75%) excreted from bivalves, salmon and shrimp, enter into the coastal environment, with the potential to develop algal blooms, and reduce dissolved oxygen in the water.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{combination}} {{of all of these}} properties – antifouling, high strength, and corrosion resistance – that has made copper alloys a desirable material for such marine applications as condenser tubing, water intake screens, ship hulls, offshore structure, and sheathing.

The industry is now actively deploying copper alloy netting and structural materials in commercial large-scale fish farming operations around the world.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasingly}} popular aquarium hobby is fueling {{the rapid growth}} of the aquatic ornamental industry, particularly the trade of marine ornamental species. However, currently there is a heavy reliance on wild caught marine ornamentals to satisfy consumer demand. As public awareness of the plight of marine ecosystems grows, the often destructive and unmanaged exploitation of coral reefs for the marine ornamental trade has raised concerns. Therefore, there is consensus that urgent actions need to be taken to limit destructive exploitation of coral reefs, and to ensure the sustainability of the marine ornamental industry. An obvious and vital action of such efforts would be the development of captive breeding techniques for marine ornamental species, in particular, coral reef fish. Research efforts towards captive breeding of marine ornamental species, also known as <b>marine</b> ornamental <b>aquaculture,</b> stand to supplement or replace the supply of wild caught specimens for the marine ornamental trade, and potentially help boost reef recovery efforts through restocking. However, unfortunately, the <b>marine</b> ornamental <b>aquaculture</b> sector is still in its infancy, receiving limited research attention,and, in turn, has experienced very slow development compared to the technical and industrial advances made in foodfish aquaculture. While it is true that at present, multiple bottlenecks have severely limited the progress of <b>marine</b> ornamental <b>aquaculture,</b> through careful appraisal and adaptation of culture techniques developed for foodfish, and by addressing the specific needs of <b>marine</b> ornamental <b>aquaculture,</b> significant progress could be made for the <b>marine</b> ornamental <b>aquaculture</b> industry. With this objective in mind, this review attempts to summarize the major bottlenecks facing the <b>marine</b> ornamental <b>aquaculture</b> industry, and to highlight weaknesses in the current state of research. Major areas in need of increased research efforts include broodstock management, such as the development of specific broodstock diets and broodstock husbandry, spawning induction via hormone technologies that are tailored to the size and sensitivity of small broodstock ornamentals, and comprehensive, species-specific larval rearing techniques, including system design and larval culture conditions as well as larval feeds and nutrition...|$|R

25|$|Blue runner {{are easily}} {{attracted}} to any large underwater or floating device, either natural or man made. Several {{studies have shown}} the species congregates around floating buoy-like fish aggregating devices (FADs), both in shallower waters, {{as well as in}} extremely deep (2500 m) waters, indicating the species may move around pelagically. In these situations, blue runner always form small aggregations at the water surface, while other larger species tend to congregate slightly deeper. A number of investigations around oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have found blue runner congregate in large numbers around these in the warmer months, where they modify their feeding behavior {{to take advantage of the}} structure. Purpose built artificial reefs and <b>marine</b> <b>aquaculture</b> cage structures are also known to attract the species, with the former having the added benefit of dispersing wayward food scraps.|$|E
2500|$|Because Salicornia bigelovii can {{be grown}} using {{saltwater}} and its seeds contain high levels of unsaturated oil (30%, mostly linoleic acid) and protein (35%), {{it can be used}} to produce animal feedstuff and as a biofuel feedstock on coastal land where conventional crops cannot be grown.
