2500|$|The {{sequential}} elimination {{method used}} by IRV {{is described in}} Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised {{as an example of}} [...] "preferential voting", a term covering [...] "any of a number of voting methods by which, on a single ballot when there are more than two possible choices, the second or less-preferred choices of voters can be taken into account if no candidate or proposition attains a majority. While it is more complicated than other <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> in common use, and is not a substitute for the normal procedure of repeated balloting until a majority is obtained, preferential voting is especially useful and fair in an election by mail if it is impractical to take more than one ballot.

6000|$|Before {{giving the}} {{essential}} features of that system, {{it may be}} well to state in its simplest form the evils at which the reform aims. An election, the reformers point out, is not the simple matter {{it appears to be}} at the first blush. <b>Methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> can be manipulated in various ways, and nearly every method has its own liability to falsification. We may take for illustration the commonest, simplest case--the case that is the perplexity of every clear-thinking voter under British or American conditions--the case of a constituency in which every elector has one vote, and which returns one representative to Parliament. The naive theory on which people go is that all the possible candidates are put up, that each voter votes for the one he likes best, and that the best man wins. The bitter experience is that hardly ever are there more than two candidates, and still more rarely is either of these the best man possible. Suppose, for example, the constituency is mainly Conservative. A little group of pothouse politicians, wire-pullers, busybodies, local journalists, and small lawyers, working for various monetary interests, have [...] "captured" [...] the local Conservative organization. They have time and energy to capture it, because they have no other interest in life except that. It is their [...] "business," [...] and honest men are busy with other duties. For reasons that do not appear these local [...] "workers" [...] put up an unknown Mr. Goldbug as the official Conservative candidate. He professes a generally Conservative view of things, but few people are sure of him and few people trust him. Against him the weaker (and therefore still more venal) Liberal organization now puts up a Mr. Kentshire (formerly Wurstberg) to represent the broader thought and finer generosities of the English mind. A number of Conservative gentlemen, generally too busy about their honest businesses to attend the party [...] "smokers" [...] and the party cave, realize suddenly that they want Goldbug hardly more than they want Wurstberg. They put up their long-admired, trusted, and able friend Mr. Sanity as an Independent Conservative.|$|E

50|$|Deliberative {{assemblies}} - {{bodies that}} use parliamentary procedure {{to arrive at}} decisions - use several <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> on motions (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Legislatures may have their own voting methods.|$|E

However, this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting,</b> which permits a member to cast multiple votes for a single candidate, must be viewed with reservation since it violates the fundamental principle of parliamentary law that each member is entitled to one and only one vote on a question".|$|R

40|$|Although Spitzer (et al.), in {{the sixth}} chapter of their book Essentials of American Politics, are able to explain {{elections}} and the election process very well, {{there are a few}} things that are missing.

Also, the authors do not explain the downsides of the current system of voting, save a brief paragraph about the downsides of current campaign financing methodology. It is important to know how elections are currently run, but it may also prove helpful to know ways to possibly improve our system of voting. Spitzer, et al., does not discuss the other possibilities. Text added to the chapter may look something like the following. Alternative <b>Methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>Voting</b> There are three <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> that are different from our current system in national elections.
