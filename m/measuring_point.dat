[...] By measuring the time of local solar noon compared {{to the time of}} noon at a reference point the difference in longitude can be directly found. [...] For this system to work, a timepiece showing the time at the reference point must be carried to the <b>measuring</b> <b>point.</b> [...] A timepiece intended to remain accurate while subjected to the motions of a ship at sea and through extreme changes in environment, especially temperature, is called a chronometer. [...] These were first built in the 18th century and were used extensively by mariners in the 19th century and into the 20th century, even after the widespread use of radio for time signals – the time signal was used to set the chronometer, but the instrument was still necessary to display the time.|$|E

40|$|Thermal error {{compensation}} is considered {{as an effective}} and economic method to improve the machining accuracy for a machine tool. The performance of thermal error prediction mainly depends on the accuracy and robustness of predictive model and the input temperature variables. Selection of temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> is the premise of thermal {{error compensation}}. In the thermal error compensation scheme for heavy-duty computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, the identification of temperature-sensitive points still lacks an effective method due to its complex structure and heat generation mechanisms. In this paper, an optimal selection method of temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> has been proposed. The optimal <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> are acquired through three steps. First, the degree of temperature sensitivity is defined and used to select the <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> with high sensitivity to thermal error. Then, the first selected points are classified with fuzzy clustering and grey correlation grade. Finally, the temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> are selected with analysis of location of temperature sensors. In order to verify the method above, an experiment is carried out on the CR 5116 of flexible machining center. A novel temperature sensor, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor, is used to collect the surface temperature of the machine. A thermal error compensation model is developed to analyze the prediction accuracy based on four sequences of <b>measuring</b> <b>points,</b> which are generated by different selection approaches. The {{results show that the}} number of the <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> is reduced from 27 to 5 through the proposed selection method, and the thermal error compensation model based on the optimum temperature-sensitive <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> has the best performance of prediction effect...|$|R

Crucial is {{the distribution of the}} external <b>measuring</b> <b>points.</b> We suggest a procedure how to systematically optimize this distribution viz, to increase the precision (i. e. to shrink error bars) of the reconstruction by detecting the important and by eliminating the irrelevant <b>measuring</b> <b>points.</b> In a realistic numerical example we apply our scheme to magnetotomography of fuel cells. The result is striking: Starting from a smooth distribution of <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> on a surface of a cuboid around the fuel cell, the number of <b>measuring</b> <b>points</b> can systematically be reduced by more than 90 %. At the same time the precision increases by a factor of nearly 3. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|An {{accurate}} and efficient measurement for unknown rotor profile of screw compressor {{has been a}} nodus {{in the field of}} coordinate measuring machine (CMM) measurement because of its complexity of 3 D helical surface, whose normal vectors vary with different <b>measured</b> <b>points,</b> while conventional 2 D measuring methods have the inevitable radius compensation. If <b>measured</b> <b>points</b> and corresponding normal vectors are known, a 3 D radius compensation then could be applied without a theoretical error. In this paper, a double-measurement method based on Reverse Engineering (RE) is proposed to solve this problem. The first measurement focused on constructing a 3 D CAD model as accurate as possible. So, according to the structure characteristics of the unknown rotor, a reasonable WCS is established firstly. Then a DRCH method is presented to eliminate the outliers of <b>measured</b> <b>points.</b> Finally, an indirect method is presented to measure the screw pitch with projection and transformation of <b>measured</b> <b>point</b> sets. In second section, a 3 D measurement is planned by DIMS language with setting <b>measured</b> <b>points</b> and corresponding normal vectors, which are calculated according to 3 D CAD model constructed in first section.
