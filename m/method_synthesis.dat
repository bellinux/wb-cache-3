30|$|In this study, NiO/SBA- 15 was {{prepared}} by both direct and post <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods.</b> TEM images revealed that NiO particles aggregated in NiO/SBA- 15 obtained with post <b>synthesis</b> <b>method,</b> regardless of NiO loading. However, NiO particles were monodispersed in NiO/SBA- 15 with a NiO loading {{of less than}} 15  wt% by using the direct <b>synthesis</b> <b>method.</b> In this case, NiO particles aggregated when NiO loading was over 20  wt%. TPR analysis verified that with direct <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> the location boundary of NiO particles on outer and pore surface could be observed clearly, whereas that could not observed {{in the case of}} post <b>synthesis</b> <b>method.</b> This indicates that the type of <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> displays significant effect on the location of NiO particles dispersed into the SBA- 15. Producer gas conversion was carried out using NiO/SBA- 15 as catalysts, which were synthesized with different <b>synthesis</b> <b>methods.</b> The gas conversion including methanation occurred at low temperature (i.e., 300 – 400  °C) and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction at high temperature (i.e., 400 – 900  °C). High temperatures facilitated CO 2 conversion to CO with CO selectivity close to 100  %, regardless of the <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> of the used catalyst. At low temperatures the dispersion type of NiO particles affected the CO 2 conversion reaction, i.e., monodispersed NiO particles gave a CO selectivity of close to 100  %, similar to that obtained at high temperature. The aggregated NiO particles resulted in a CO selectivity of less than 100  % owing to CH 4 formation, regardless of <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> of catalyst. Therefore, NiO/SBA- 15 obtained with direct <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> favored RWGS reaction because of high CO selectivity. NiO/SBA- 15 obtained with post <b>synthesis</b> <b>method</b> is suited for methanation because of high CH 4 selectivity, and the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 through methanation increased with increasing NiO loading.|$|R

This result indicates the PVD-grown NWs exhibit a higher efficiency for photocarrier transport and photocurrent generation than the hydrothermal ones. The PVD (or thermal evaporation) approach usually provides better control for crystal growth, and the growth temperature at 550 °C is also relatively high in comparison with that in the hydrothermal <b>method</b> (<b>synthesis</b> at 205 °C).
