40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cells}} (PEFCS) are under widespread development to produce electrical power {{for a variety}} of stationary and transportation applications. To date, the bipolar plate remains the most problematic and costly component of PEFC stacks (1). In addition to meeting cost constraints, bipolar plates must possess a host of other properties, the most important of which are listed in Table 1. The most commonly used material for single cell testing is machined graphite, which is expensive and costly to machine. The brittle nature of graphite also precludes the use of thin components for reducing stack size and weight, which is particularly important for transportation applications. Other stack designs consider the use of metal hardware such as stainless steel (2, 3). But a number of disadvantages are associated with stainless steel, including high density, high cost of machining, and possible corrosion in the fuel cell environment. In light of these difficulties, much of the recent work on fuel cell bipolar plate materials has concentrated on graphite/polymer composites (4 [...] 8). Composite materials offer the potential advantages of lower cost, lower weight, and greater ease of manufacture than traditional graphite and metal plates. For instance, flow fields can be molded directly into these composites, thereby eliminating the costly and difficult <b>machining</b> <b>step</b> required for graphite or metal hardware...|$|E

The laser beam was scanned parallel to the specimen surface, which resulted in laser ablation using {{the tail of the}} Gaussian beam distribution, near the ablation threshold for each of the materials. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) were utilized to investigate damage in the bulk and at the surface of the laser ablated samples in cross-sections that were extracted by FIB-SEM. In contrast to normal incidence, post-ablation damage in the glancing incidence configuration was extremely limited across a wide range of laser pulse energies. Elevated dislocation densities were observed within 150 - 200 nm of the ablated surface in the Cu, STO, and R 88 samples. An amorphized Si layer as thin as 30 - 50 nm was observed with no dislocations near the surface or in the bulk.

The stamper surface contains a negative image of the CDs more than 1 billion, submicrometer features embossed in a spiral pattern on a 138 -ram diameter substrate. In conventional mastering, nickel submaster stampers are generated by electroforming from a glass master. In the proposed process, submaster stampers are not required, and a ceramic master is used directly as a stamper for injection molding. In the new process, ceramic substrates are ion machined through a photoresist mask, resulting in improved productivity, reduced hazardous waste, and lower production costs.

To contribute to the knowledge of the fatigue behavior of this material under such high deformation conditions is the aim of this work. Cyclic load- unload tensile tests were performed on NiTi superelastic wires employed in the manufacture of ProFile endodontic instruments. Fatigue tests of new ProFile instruments simulating the geometrical conditions found in their clinical use to format curved root canals were employed to evaluate their fatigue behavior. The NiTi wires, taken from the production line of ProFile instruments just before the final <b>machining</b> <b>step,</b> were tensile-tested to rupture in the as-received condition and after 100 load-unload tensile cycles in the superelastic regime (4 % elongation). It was found that only small changes took place in the parameters describing the mechanical behavior of the wires after 100 load-unload cycles. The stress at maximum load and the plastic strain at breakage remained practically the same, while the critical stress to induce martensite decreased by about 26. 5 %. Analysis of the fracture surface of the cycled wires indicated that the failure of these specimens in tension involved pre-existing fatigue cracks, developed during load-unload cycling. The fatigue tests of ProFile instruments demonstrated that the maximum tensile strain amplitude at the instrument’s surface determines the average number of cycles to failure. The characteristics of the fracture surfaces of the instruments and wire specimens indicate that the nucleation of secondary cracks is the dissipation mechanism responsible for the relatively high fatigue resistance of superelastic NiTi alloys. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{finishing}} of precise bores is {{an important}} <b>machining</b> <b>step,</b> especially in the automotive industries. Bores can vary in diameter and form, from bigger piston bores in motor cylinders to rather small bores in fuel injection systems. Quality parameters for these bores are form- and geometric accuracy as well as surface roughness and structure. All requirements can economically be met by using the honing process as the final finishing operation for readymade bores. Honing is an abrasive machining process using abrasive grains usually made of diamond or Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) in metallic bonding. During the process three movement components, namely an axial movement along the bore axis, a rotational movement around the bore axis and the feeding movement of the honing stone, are combined. The feeding movement of the honing stone is induced by an axial movement of the feeding cone, which is translated into a radial movement of the honing stone at the interface between honing stone and work piece. The feeding movement is decisive {{for the results of}} the honing process. For a regulation of the process that enables high process stability and repeatability as well as good quality results from the first part {{it is important to know}} about the forces in the feeding system of the tool. The following paper describes the static and dynamic correlation of the process forces in order to give a basis for a new regulation approach especially for bores with smaller diameters (below 20 mm) where the direct measurement of the process forces with a tool- integrated sensor is difficult.

40|$|The current ongoing {{evolution}} towards mass customization, {{resulting in}} the production of small lots or prototypes and single unique items, requires a different strategy compared to classic high volume manufacturing. In order to deal with the increasing product range and decreasing time to market, the flexibility of current manufacturing process chain needs to increase. A conventional manufacturing process of a high quality component consists of an initial <b>machining</b> <b>step,</b> for example a milling and/or turning operation, starting from bulk material (block, cylinder). In a next step, the part is unclamped, transported to a heat treatment facility in order to attain the required material properties (hardness, residual surface stresses, microstructure,…). This step introduces inevitably deformations to the component, which is why a finishing operation is performed after the component is transported, re-clamped and re-aligned. In this PhD thesis 2 alterations to this conventional process flow are investigated. A first innovation investigated in this thesis, is combining the machining, heat treatment and if required a hard finishing operation in 1 single machine and setup. This omits the need for logistics {{back and forth to the}} hardening facility. Re-clamping and re-aligning of the component is no longer needed for the hard finishing operation, which reduces the total lead time and errors introduced during these labor intensive operations. This is realized by integrating a laser into a machining center, allowing to perform both the machining operations as the heat treatment in one setup. In this thesis, 2 different setups are developed and described. The first setup, uses a 500 W Nd:Yag laser as a heat source. A fixed spot optical design is made using basic optics calculus and is updated using ray tracing simulation. A mechanical design is made and realized. The integration of the laser as a tool is done into a 5 -axis milling machine. A spotsize of 1. 2 mm diameter or more (if out of focus) is moved across the surface of the component by moving the machine’s axis. The process of integrated laser hardening is investigated on C 45 steel by performing a Design of Experiment, using 3 different feed rates and 4 different spotsizes. High hardness values, above 750 HV and a hardening depth of about 0. 2 mm are achieved. Thanks to the high cooling rate during the heat cycle in laser hardening, the hardness exceeds hardness values achieved by conventional hardening techniques. A second design of experiment, investigating multiple laser tracks next to each other, in order to cover a larger area, is performed. From these experiments, it is concluded it is impossible, no matter what overlap/inter-track distance is used, to achieve a uniform hardness along the cross section of multiple scan tracks. This effect is identified as a tempering/softening effect, in which the second track tempers a part of the first track. Finally, a die and mold component, prone to rapid wear, made of a high alloyed steel, is laser hardened using the developed setup, proving the industrial relevance of this work. In order to achieve a uniform hardness across a larger area, a new setup is developed on a 11 -axis machining center. Instead of using a fixed spot hardening strategy as in the previous setup, a very small spot (0. 8 mm in diameter) is scanned across the surface at high speed using a rotating mirror, while moving slowly in the feed direction by moving the machine’s axis. The optical and mechanical design and realization of this setup are described. A control system, controlling laser source (500 W diode laser), mirror actuator and auxiliary equipment, while monitoring the actual temperature and machine position, is developed. A software tool which allows to program the hardening operation of complex shaped components, is developed and the strategy is illustrated on an example. The process of integrated scanning laser hardening is investigated on a low alloyed steel (C 45) and a highly alloyed steel (40 CrMnMo 7). The samples showed no tempering effects, resulting in a uniform hardness across the scan width. The robustness of the process and control is verified by testing contaminated samples (oil, steel/aluminum chips, emulsion) and samples with varying scanning width. Two cases are described as an example of industrial applications for this technology. The second innovation tackles the machining of near net shapes, which is significantly different to machining from bulk material. In this thesis, 2 types of near net shape machining are investigated: the machining of gears from forgings and the finishing of large assemblies built by additive manufacturing. The machining of gears using the conventional processes requires dedicated, design specific tools. The lead time and cost of these tools are high, which is an issue for prototypes and small batch production. Three different alternative production technologies are investigated. A multi-axis milling strategy using standard end mills is developed and an automotive gearbox gear is made to high quality grinding specifications in less than 24 hours, while the lead time for conventional production is in the order of 13 weeks. This machining process is ideal to combine with the integrated laser hardening. Since the distortions introduced by laser hardening are limited, a hard finishing operation might be omitted, resulting in a hardened high accuracy gear manufactured in hours/days instead of weeks. The finishing of large assemblies, built using additive manufactured components, to a very high accuracy is quite different to machining a small component from bulk to the same accuracy. By investigating and reducing errors introduced by CAD/CAM, machining, in-machine mounting (clamping and aligning) and machine condition (position accuracy, flatness table and thermal stability), the achieved tolerance is reduced significantly. This is verified on a demonstrator part. nrpages: 254 status: publishe...|$|E
