500|$|As he {{had with}} [...] "Something", Harrison {{composed}} the melody on a piano, part-way through a recording session – in this case, while working on his first post-Beatles solo album, All Things Must Pass (1970). As reproduced in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison's original lyrics carried the title [...] "WHENEVER (by Shirley Bassey)". He recalls in the book: [...] "I got the chord sequence, and 'When every song is sung' were the first words {{to come out of}} <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> it developed from there." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1996 through 2001, Downey {{was arrested}} {{numerous}} times on drug-related charges including cocaine, heroin and marijuana and went several times through {{drug treatment programs}} unsuccessfully, explaining in 1999 to a judge: [...] "It's like I have a shotgun in <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like {{the taste of the}} gun metal." [...] He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, {{due to the fact that}} his father, also an addict, had been giving them to him.|$|E
500|$|Monet {{submitted}} The Magpie and Fishing Boats at Sea (W 126) to the Salon of 1869. Both {{paintings were}} rejected in April. Critic Paul Richard {{said that the}} jurors rejected the painting as [...] "too common and too coarse". Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury. Monet told French novelist Arsène Houssaye (18151896), [...] "This rejection has taken the bread from <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> {{in spite of my}} low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me." [...] A century later, The Magpie was acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1984. It {{became one of the most}} popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E
500|$|From 1842 onwards, Chopin {{showed signs}} of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: [...] "I have to lie in bed all day long, <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> tonsils are aching so much." [...] He was forced by illness to decline a written {{invitation}} from Alkan {{to participate in a}} repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Érard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, Charles Hallé visited Chopin and found him [...] "hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E

500|$|Since her {{breakout}} with Pink Friday, Minaj {{has been}} involved in a feud with rapper Lil' Kim, who accused Minaj of copying her style. Although Minaj's [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] was thought to be directed at Kim, she said she was [...] "talking about everyone who has been in interviews talking ... no one is worth being singled out. No one is worth having their name mentioned out of <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> they never will get that." [...] Kim escalated the feud with her mixtape, Black Friday (2011), whose title and artwork mimic Pink Friday; a fragment from Minaj's diss track, [...] "Tragedy", previewed that April. Their conflict sparked a feud between Minaj and rapper Foxy Brown, who said Minaj misrepresented their conversation about Kim. Brown released the diss tracks [...] "Hold Yuh" [...] and [...] "Massacre" [...] (directed at Kim and Minaj) in November 2010 and January 2011, respectively, but Brown and Minaj settled their dispute in June 2012.|$|E
500|$|Ken Griffey, Jr. did not {{understand}} his line [...] "there's a party in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> everyone's invited" [...] and got quite frustrated when he was recording it. He was directed by Mike Reiss, and his father Ken Griffey, Sr. was also present, trying to coach his son. Roger Clemens, who made his own chicken noises, was directed by Jeff Martin, as was Wade Boggs. Mike Reiss directed {{most of the other}} players. Mike Scioscia accepted his guest spot in [...] "half a second," [...] while Ozzie Smith has stated {{that he would like to}} guest star again [...] "so [...] can get out [...]" [...] Don Mattingly, who was forced to shave off his [...] "sideburns" [...] by Mr. Burns during the episode, would later have an actual [...] "haircut controversy", while he was playing for the New York Yankees. The coaching staff forced him to cut his long hair, and was briefly dropped from the team line-up for not doing so. Many people believed the joke in the episode to be a reference to the incident, but [...] "Homer at the Bat" [...] was recorded a year before it happened. Many of the guest stars, including Terry Cashman, Wade Boggs and Darryl Strawberry all admit that they are more well known because of their appearance in the episode, Cashman having [...] "Talkin' Softball" [...] requested more often than [...] "Talkin' Baseball".|$|E

2500|$|On May 19, 1936, Abe went {{shopping}} {{and saw a}} movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Omiya, a friend, and Ishida. She planned to commit suicide {{one week after the}} murder, and practiced necrophilia. [...] "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> even tried to insert it inside me... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, love, independence, and {{maturity}} became reoccurring themes throughout the album. With {{songs such as}} [...] "'I'm Still in Love with My Ex" [...] and [...] "Better Without You" [...] inspired by Rowland's former relationship with American football player Roy Williams, most of the tracks Rowland recorded were relationship-driven, something {{she said she was}} not hesitant about discussing. [...] "I just went in the studio and just did me, because I think that's when you get your best product. That's when it's just natural. It just flew out of <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> came out in lyrics [...] I had great writers involved." [...] While recording her vocals, Rowland was inspired by several singers, citing former bandmate Beyoncé Knowles, and singers Brandy and Whitney Houston as major inspirations, [...] "I listened to a lot of Whitney Houston for her vocals. I love her. I love Beyoncé's voice, and I love Brandy. Those are three vocalists who inspire me. I love how different they are. I love how they take themselves to the next level." ...|$|E

60|$|To be {{suddenly}} aroused {{out of a}} sound sleep, {{and immediately}} afterwards to find yourself struggling in deep, dark water is not an experience to be desired.

5000|$|Tehillat Hashem ( [...] , [...] "praise of God" [...] in Hebrew) is {{the name}} of a prayer-book (known as a siddur in Hebrew) used for Jewish {{services}} in synagogues and privately by Hasidic Jews, specifically in the Chabad-Lubavitch community.

60|$|But not to sleep. My {{mind was}} in a whirl, and I could not think clearly. <b>My</b> <b>mouth</b> was parched, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> tongue so thick that when I tried to utter some words in reverie I could not, a thing that frightened me still more.|$|R
