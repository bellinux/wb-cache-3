50|$|Anti-magnetic (non-magnetic) watches {{are those}} that are able to run with minimal {{deviation}} when exposed to a certain level of magnetic field. The International Organization for Standardization issued a standard for <b>magnetic-resistant</b> watches, which many countries have adopted.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} standard ISO 764 Horology—Magnetic resistant watches defines {{the resistance of}} watches to magnetic fields. According to ISO 764 or its equivalent DIN 8309 (Deutsches Institut für Normung - German Institute for Standardization) a watch must resist exposition to a direct current magnetic field of 4 800 A/m. The watch must keep its accuracy to ±30 seconds/day as measured before the test {{in order to be}} acknowledged as a <b>magnetic-resistant</b> watch.Annex A of ISO 764 deals with watches designated as magnetic resistant with an additional indication of intensity of a magnetic field exceeding 4 800 A/m.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{measurement of}} timing properties of <b>magnetic-resistant</b> fine mesh R 7761 - 70 and ordinary fast R 2083 photomultipliers is presented together with preliminary {{results on the}} operation of R 7761 - 70 PMs in magnetic field up to 1100 Gauss. The results were obtained using the proton beam of the MC 50 Cyclotron of Korea Institute of Radilogical and Medical Sciences. The ratio of the effective R 7761 - 70 and R 2083 TOF (or timing) resolutions was extracted by using two different methods. The results are 1. 05 ± 0. 066 and 1. 07 ± 0. 062. The gain of R 7761 - 70 PMs is not affected by magnetic field. The R 7761 - 70 TOF/timing resolution becomes ∼ 8...|$|E
