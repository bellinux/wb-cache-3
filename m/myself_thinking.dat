25|$|The {{morning that}} his {{resignation}} took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said {{farewell to the}} White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, “As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> not of the past, but of the future. What could I do now?” At Andrews, {{he and his family}} boarded Air Force One to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{led him to}} write a novel {{centered}} on two Afghan women, Hosseini responded:"I had been entertaining the idea of writing a story of Afghan women for some time after I'd finished writing The Kite Runner. That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many of those women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> about those resilient women over and over. Though no one woman that I met in Kabul inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible stories of survival were always with me, and a good part of my inspiration for this novel came from their collective spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{has said}} she was a fan of the works of C. S. Lewis as a child, and cites the {{influence}} of his Narnia chronicles on her work: [...] "I found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross station – it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jealous of his brother! There is {{something}} unnatural, something degrading in such jealousy as that. I am ashamed of <b>myself</b> for <b>thinking</b> it of him. And yet {{what else could}} his conduct mean? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, I {{have kept}} you waiting shamefully, but I have been consoling <b>myself</b> by <b>thinking</b> {{you must be}} well entertained, as I heard no Harmonious Blacksmith. Papa will be {{wondering}} where we are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{need not}} worry <b>myself</b> by <b>thinking</b> of it, now. It will all come some day, and I dare say I shall find it {{pleasant}} enough, when I once get accustomed to it." ...|$|R
2500|$|She {{appeared}} in the premiere of the Nicky Silver play The Lyons at the Off-Broadway Vineyard Theatre, beginning in September 2011, through November 11. Ben Brantley, The New York Times reviewer, commented: [...] "Watching Ms. Lavin, I found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> of Nora from Ibsen's Doll's House – well, a pursed-lipped, lemony-sour, older Nora in pseudo-Chanel, one who's never {{at a loss for}} what to say and when to say it. Rita may be a little behind schedule in discovering herself, but no one can fault the hair-trigger timing of the actress playing her or the surprising dimensions she finds within one-liners." [...] She reprised her role in the Broadway production, which opened at the Cort Theatre on April 23, 2012 and closed on July 1, 2012.|$|E
2500|$|He {{believes}} that British Muslims {{have a duty}} to integrate into British culture, but noted in an article published in 2007 that the Muslim community finds aspects such as high divorce rates and drug use uninspiring, and that [...] "Not for the first time, I found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around." [...] In his first speech as PM on radicalisation and the causes of terrorism in February 2011, Cameron said that 'state multiculturalism' had failed. In 2010 he appointed the first Muslim member of the British cabinet, Baroness Warsi, as a minister without portfolio, and in 2012 made her a special minister of state in foreign affairs. She resigned, however, in August 2014 over the government's handling of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Trump recalls {{some of his}} romantic exploits, [...] "Beautiful, famous, successful, married — I’ve {{had them}} all, secretly, the world’s biggest names." [...] Trump {{reflects}} on how such exploits made him feel at the time, [...] "Oftentimes when I was sleeping {{with one of the}} top women in the world I would say to <b>myself,</b> <b>thinking</b> about me as a boy from Queens, 'Can you believe what I am getting?'" [...] He explained that he was successful in his endeavors with women due to some unknown quality he possessed, [...] "The women I have dated over the years could have any man they want; they are the top models and most beautiful women in the world. I have been able to date (screw) them all because I have something that many men do not have. I don’t know what it is but women have always liked it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, oh, no," [...] replied Peter Rabbit in disgust. [...] "I {{was talking}} to <b>myself,</b> just <b>thinking</b> out loud. I was {{wondering}} how many nuts a Jay could steal {{if he had the}} chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do, and I'll {{tell you}} how I mean to get it. I've planned everything; for, though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused <b>myself</b> by <b>thinking</b> how I could manage if I did get invited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is just {{breaking}} Sara's {{heart that}} she can't," [...] said Cecily compassionately. [...] "I'm almost afraid I won't enjoy <b>myself</b> for <b>thinking</b> of her, home there alone, most likely reading the Bible, while we're at the party." ...|$|R
2500|$|J. K. Rowling, {{author of}} the Harry Potter series, has {{said that she was}} a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the {{influence}} of The Chronicles on her work: [...] "I found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station— it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts." [...] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal." [...] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan.|$|E
6000|$|I {{stared at}} her and my jaw dropped. Then I {{recovered}} <b>myself,</b> <b>thinking</b> she must {{have made a mistake}} and meant to say [...] "week." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, a {{thousand}}, thousand pardons! I {{ought to}} be ashamed of myself, and I am ashamed of <b>myself</b> for <b>thinking</b> that {{a little bit of a}} circumstance like sending a shark to England to fetch back a market report----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most {{remarkable}} man," [...] said Dr. Boomer. [...] "I heard him preach in his present church. He gave utterance to thoughts that I have <b>myself</b> been <b>thinking</b> for years. I never listened to anything so sound or so scholarly." ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{the whole}} of my scanty news. I was in {{wonderful}} voice last night, but croak a little this morning, after so much speaking in so very large a place. Otherwise I am all right. I find <b>myself</b> constantly <b>thinking</b> of Plorn.|$|R
60|$|I {{am aware}} that I {{anticipate}} a little,--that he was still, {{at the last}} accounts, alive {{in the hands of}} his foes; but that being the case, I have all along found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> and speaking of him as physically dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Arthur {{is still}} away," [...] she explained, [...] "and I {{feel that he}} wants me. I should be {{worrying}} <b>myself,</b> <b>thinking</b> of him all alone {{with no one to}} look after him. It's the mother instinct I suppose. It always has hampered woman." [...] She laughed.|$|E
60|$|Suppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose Mr. Jellyby were {{to relieve}} his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, would Mr. Pardiggle, in return, make any {{confidential}} communication to Mr. Jellyby?

60|$|DAISY. [Good-humouredly.] Oh, {{you know}} I'm {{not the sort}} of woman to grouse because you're a little late. I can always occupy <b>myself</b> by <b>thinking</b> how {{wonderful}} it will be to see you. And if I get bored with that I read your letters again.|$|R
6000|$|... "A horrible nuisance," [...] {{the officer}} went on. [...] "This {{is one of}} Gordon's old steamers; she has broken down twice. Still, I console <b>myself</b> by <b>thinking</b> that, even if I had been in time, very likely {{she would not have}} been taken up.|$|R
6000|$|I {{walked on}} sadly enough, {{you may be}} sure. However, I comforted <b>myself</b> with <b>thinking</b> [...] "It's been a very {{wonderful}} afternoon, so far. I'll just go quietly on and look about me, and I shouldn't wonder if I were to come across another Fairy somewhere." ...|$|R
60|$|Even at {{the moment}} I was {{surprised}} when I found <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> of the danger to which Jacob must be exposed, rather than of my own desperate plight. While on the alert for a living target, I speculated whether he was yet free, {{and if he had}} discovered the whereabouts of his father.|$|E
6000|$|... 'After my father's death I {{opened it}} <b>myself,</b> <b>thinking</b> there might be, for {{anything}} I knew, some memorandum there. However, as I need not tell you, mother, {{there was nothing}} but the old silk watch-paper worked in beads, which you found (no doubt) in its place between the cases, where I found and left it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why didn't {{you speak}} to each other until we left Deimos?" [...] He leaned toward Erickson, smiling at him. [...] "Two men and a woman. Three of you. Sitting apart in the ship. Not speaking, not until the check-station was past. I find <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> over what the Martian said. Three saboteurs. A woman and two men." ...|$|E
60|$|While he was {{hitching}} up I set <b>myself</b> to <b>thinking.</b> While I {{was perfectly}} willing that Mr. Woodward {{should return to}} Darbyville, I {{did not wish to}} allow John Stumpy out of my sight. Once away, and I {{might not be able to}} lay hands on him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, scarcely," [...] said Ravenswood, [...] "unless {{you show}} me better reason for <b>thinking</b> <b>myself</b> mistaken than you are now producing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The main {{difficulty}} is, of course, {{to secure}} a supply of really competent teachers. George, Edward, Henry, Robert, and some three or four others are trustworthy.

6000|$|... "I cannot help it, madame. Each {{time his}} lips touch my fingers I find <b>myself</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of the last}} object that they touched. I at once retire to wash my hands.

6000|$|... "It was well, for you, that I noticed you. I was, <b>myself,</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of making}} for the shore although, in {{so large and}} well-manned craft as this, there is little fear upon the lake.

60|$|For {{what seemed}} a long time, I sat and thought and thought. It was a wild medley of thoughts, as might have been {{expected}} from the experiences of the previous day and night.

The respirator was doing its work.|$|E
60|$|Now when I {{heard this}} amazing {{sentence}} I gasped within <b>myself,</b> but <b>thinking</b> {{it better to}} keep up my rôle of understanding nothing of their talk, I preserved an immovable countenance and left Marût to answer.
