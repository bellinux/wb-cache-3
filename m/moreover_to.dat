5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents {{argue that the}} zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, <b>moreover,</b> <b>to</b> have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the rate of recovery seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E

25|$|The {{culture of}} private {{universities}} in Bangladesh {{started in the}} early 1990s.

25|$|The modernist {{influence}} {{went beyond}} mere aesthetics: urbanisation tied to modern building techniques {{and the introduction}} of regulations both in building and town planning, and <b>moreover,</b> <b>to</b> the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the Nordic welfare state, and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the Beckomberga Hospital in western Stockholm (1927-1935) by Carl Westman) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925–27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the Puu-Käpylä Garden Town, Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau-riche).|$|E

25|$|After sitting the HKCEE {{and having}} their {{examination}} results announced, candidates could {{apply for a}} place in sixth form in local schools in Hong Kong. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), students had to pass certain requirements of HKCEE as a prerequisite. The Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS), including the EAS system under JUPAS, also considered students' HKCEE results as a requirement and as a decisive factor of admission in the admission processes. Thus, students' results in HKCEE affected their application to sixth form but also directly affected the chance of entering the universities after seventh form, which was commonly ignored by students until they entered sixth form. In JUPAS, most admissions programs gave HKCEE results about a 10–30% weight, and some as much as 50%; the HKALE results provided the other 50%. Thus, HKCEE was the initial stage of University Entrance Examination.|$|E
25|$|The Office of Vespers is {{the only}} one which has {{remained}} popular (excepting, of course, the Holy Sacrifice, which is not consider here as an Office) among Roman Catholics up to the present day. Matins and Lauds, on account of the hour at which they are celebrated, have always been more or less inaccessible to the faithful; likewise the little hours, except, perhaps, Terce, which serves as an introduction to the Mass. Vespers, on the contrary, occupies a privileged place {{towards the end of the}} day. On Sundays it is the Office most likely to bring the faithful together in church for the second time and thus becomingly completes the Divine Service for that day. It is quite conformable to tradition, <b>moreover,</b> <b>to</b> invest this Office with a particular solemnity. The Vesper psalms, as well as the hymns and antiphons, are well calculated to edify the faithful. Lastly, the ancient custom of having a lection or reading from the Old, or New Testament, or from the homilies of the Fathers, might well in certain cases and to a certain extent be re-adopted, or serve as the subject matter for the sermon which is sometimes delivered at this service.|$|E

Although the work was based on the same Nietzsche work as Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra, Delius distanced himself from the Strauss work, which he considered a complete failure. Nor was Strauss an admirer of Delius, as he was of Elgar; he told Delius that he did not wish to conduct Paris: [...] "the symphonic development {{seems to me to be}} too scant, and it seems <b>moreover</b> <b>to</b> be an imitation of Charpentier".|$|E

Grimm says that the evidence for this [...] "is plain from the figure itself.

2500|$|The {{main focus}} of {{attention}} after insulin were the potential profit makers in the pharmaceutical industry: human growth hormone and what promised to be a miraculous cure for viral diseases, interferon. Cancer was a central target in the 1970s because increasingly the disease was linked to viruses. [...] By 1980, a new company, Biogen, had produced interferon through recombinant DNA. The emergence of interferon {{and the possibility of}} curing cancer raised money in the community for research and increased the enthusiasm of an otherwise uncertain and tentative society. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>to</b> the 1970s plight of cancer was added AIDS in the 1980s, offering an enormous potential market for a successful therapy, and more immediately, a market for diagnostic tests based on monoclonal antibodies. [...] By 1988, only five proteins from genetically engineered cells had been approved as drugs by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA): synthetic insulin, human growth hormone, hepatitis B vaccine, alpha-interferon, and tissue plasminogen activator (TPa), for lysis of blood clots. By the end of the 1990s, however, 125 more genetically engineered drugs would be approved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} passage {{referring to}} [...] "dyed leather" [...] (parchment) is iii. 13, {{although it is}} possible, in view of ii. 10, that originally בעורות צבאים stood in place of בעורות צבועים. Even if that be true, however, this is still the first reference to colored parchment for synagogal scrolls; for nothing else could be implied by these words in the received reading. The skin of game was a favorite writing-material; so that while it was forbidden to use half leather and half parchment, half leather and half skin of game were allowable (ii. 10). It was forbidden, <b>moreover,</b> <b>to</b> cut the edges of books (v. 14). A scribal term which does not occur elsewhere is found in v. 1, 2 (מעכב, variant reading מחטב). There were generally seventy-two lines to the column in a scroll of the Law (xii. 1). The passage xiii. 1 refers to the stichic writing of the Psalms; Book of Job, and Proverbs; and the remark [...] "A good scribe will note" [...] shows that the passage was written {{at a time when}} this detail was no longer generally observed (comp.

2500|$|Aeschylus gained {{thirteen}} victories as a dramatist, Sophocles {{at least}} twenty, Euripides only four in his lifetime, {{and this has}} often been taken {{as an indication of}} the latter's unpopularity with his contemporaries, and yet a first place might not have been the main criterion for success in those times (the system of selecting judges appears to have been flawed) and merely being chosen to compete was in itself a mark of distinction. <b>Moreover,</b> <b>to</b> have been singled out by Aristophanes for so much comic attention is proof of popular interest in his work.
