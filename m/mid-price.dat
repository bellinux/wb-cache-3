30|$|We {{recover the}} implied {{volatility}} surface from closing <b>mid-prices</b> of plain vanilla calls and puts written over the S&P 500 every Tuesday from December 5 th 2007 until December 3 rd, 2008, using the Heston model (93) and the linear model. We filtered the database to leave options showing a daily trading volume greater than 1.000 transactions {{per day and}} expiration between 0.1 and 0.8 years. The latter will avoid illiquid option that will distort the calibration results.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, Ford Canada hand-built 40 Mercury Sables {{powered by}} SHO V6 engines {{as part of}} their AIV (Aluminum Intensive Vehicle) program and {{released}} 20 to the public. Using aluminum suspension elements and aluminum body panels, held together with a spot welding process and adhesive joining process developed specifically for this vehicle, the end result was a car that was 400 pounds lighter than a SHO Taurus. In 1995, Multimatic Motorsports entered one of these vehicles in the One Lap of America event, finishing 15th overall and 1st in the <b>Mid-Priced</b> Sedan class.|$|R
40|$|Deep neural {{networks}} (DNNs) are powerful types of artificial {{neural networks}} (ANNs) that use several hidden layers. They have recently gained considerable {{attention in the}} speech transcription and image recognition community (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) for their superior predictive properties including robustness to overfitting. However their application to algorithmic trading has not been previously researched, partly because of their computational complexity. This paper describes the application of DNNs to predicting financial market movement directions. In particular we describe the configuration and training approach and then demonstrate their application to backtesting a simple trading strategy over 43 different Commodity and FX future <b>mid-prices</b> at 5 -minute intervals. All results in this paper are generated using a C++ implementation on the Intel Xeon Phi co-processor which is 11. 4 x faster than the serial version and a Python strategy backtesting environment {{both of which are}} available as open source code written by the authors...|$|R
25|$|Rim brakes are inexpensive, light, {{mechanically}} simple, easy to maintain, and powerful. However, {{they perform}} relatively poorly when the rims are wet, and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped. Because rims can carry {{debris from the}} ground to the brake pads, rim brakes {{are more prone to}} clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes (where braking surfaces are higher from the ground), particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces. The low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to <b>mid-price</b> commuter bikes, where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions. The light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified framework for examining the general equilibrium effects of transactions costs and trading constraints on security market trades and prices. The model uses a discrete time/state framework and Kuhn- Tucker theory {{to characterize the}} optimal decisions of consumers and financial intermediaries. Transaction costs and constraints give rise to regions of no trade and to bid-ask spreads: their existence frustrate the derivation of standard results in arbitrage-based pricing. Nevertheless, {{we are able to}} obtain as dual characterisations of our primal problems, one-sided arbitrage pricing results and a personalised martingale representation of asset pricing. These pricing results are identical to those derived by Jouini and Kallal (1995) using arbitrage arguments. The paper's framework incorporates a number of specialised existing models and results, proves new results and discusses new directions for research. In particular, we include characterisations of intermediaries who hold optimal portfolios; brokers who do not hold portfolios, and consumer-specific transactions costs and trading constraints. Furthermore we show that in the special case of equiproportional transaction costs and a sufficient number of assets, there is an analogue of the arbitrage pricing result for European derivatives where prices are interpreted as <b>mid-prices</b> between the bid-ask spread. We discuss the effects of non-convex transaction technologies on prices and trades...|$|R
2500|$|Lear {{released}} Back in Your Arms {{in spring}} 1998, an album consisting of re-recorded 1970s disco hits and remixed versions of tracks from the 1995 album Alter Ego. The album {{failed to make}} much impact on the market, but the re-recordings have since been featured on many <b>mid-price</b> compilations in Europe. Back in Your Arms was soon re-released with a slightly different track list and title, and a new remix of [...] "Blood and Honey" [...] was released on a single. Her next acting and television ventures were a French movie Bimboland, in which she starred alongside Gérard Depardieu, and an Italian makeover TV show Il Brutto Anatroccolo. On the set of Il Brutto Anatroccolo Lear met male model and actor Manuel Casella, some thirty years her junior.
