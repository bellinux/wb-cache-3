5|$|In 1961, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth {{into three}} {{categories}} according {{to the amount of}} precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least twelve consecutive months without precipitation, arid lands have less than 250mm (10in) of annual precipitation, and semiarid lands have a <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>precipitation</b> of between 250 and 500mm (10–20in). Both extremely arid and arid lands are considered to be deserts while semiarid lands are generally referred to as steppes when they are grasslands.|$|E
5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. <b>Mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>precipitation</b> totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|Patagonia, in the south, {{is mostly}} arid or semi–arid {{except in the}} extreme west where {{abundant}} precipitation supports dense forest coverage, glaciers, and permanent snowfields. Its climate is classified as temperate to cool temperate with the surrounding oceans moderating temperatures on the coast. Away from the coast, areas on the plateaus have large daily and annual temperature ranges. The influence of the Andes, in conjunction with general circulation patterns, generates {{one of the strongest}} precipitation gradients (rate of change in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>precipitation</b> in relation to a particular location) in the world, decreasing rapidly to the east. In much of Patagonia precipitation is concentrated in winter with snowfall occurring occasionally, particularly in the mountainous west and south; precipitation is more evenly distributed in the east and south. One defining characteristic is the strong winds from the west which blow year-round, lowering the perception of temperature (wind chill), while being a factor in keeping the region arid by favouring evaporation.|$|E

25|$|The {{water content}} of the {{atmosphere}} {{as a whole is}} constantly depleted by precipitation. At the same time it is constantly replenished by evaporation, most prominently from seas, lakes, rivers, and moist earth. Other sources of atmospheric water include combustion, respiration, volcanic eruptions, the transpiration of plants, and various other biological and geological processes. The mean global content of water vapor in the atmosphere is roughly sufficient to cover the surface of the planet with a layer of liquid water about 25mm deep. The <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>precipitation</b> for the planet is about 1 meter, which implies a rapid turnover of water in the air – on average, the residence time of a water molecule in the troposphere is about 9 to 10 days.|$|E

Edoardo Costantini, Maria Fantappie´, and Giovanni L’Abate explore the potential strong influence of climate on soil nature and distribution. In spite of being placed {{in the middle of the}} temperate zone of the boreal hemisphere, the elongated shape of the Italian peninsula, stretching along 11 parallels in the middle of the Mediterranean sea, and the presence of two morphological barriers, the Alps and the Apennines, cause great local climatic variations, to an extent that they are much more important than means. In fact, long-term <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> air temperature for the whole country is 12. 6 C and total <b>annual</b> <b>precipitation</b> 932. 5 mm, but the differences between minima and maxima span 30 C and 1, 800 mm, respectively.

40|$|Foredunes {{are formed}} and {{developed}} {{in association with}} vegetation. A bare sand area has been viewed {{as a measure of}} dune mobility or activity and researched in association with climate controls: particularly wind power, <b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> <b>precipitation,</b> and temperature, expressed in <b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> potential evapotranspiration. There has been no research that utilized the patterns of bare sand areas to classify foredune areas in coastal dune systems and investigated climate controls related to sand patch patterns, or ?foredune textures? such as size, number, and distribution of sand patches Four foredune types were classified based on four landscape metrics (PLAND: percentage of bare sand area, PLADJ: proportion of like-adjacencies, NLSI: normalized landscape shape index, and ENN_RA: range of Euclidean nearest neighbor), by applying the concepts and methodologies of landscape ecology. Four climate variables (<b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> <b>precipitation,</b> <b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> potential evapotranspiration, Lancaster?s mobility index, and the standard deviation of <b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> <b>precipitation)</b> were found to affect the foredune types and help in distinguishing one foredune type from another. The amount of bare sand area on coastal foredune areas can be explained by <b>annual</b> <b>mean</b> <b>precipitation</b> (R^ 2 is 0. 52 at the 99 % confidence level), standard deviation of precipitation (R^ 2 is 0. 51 at the 99 % confidence level), and Lancaster?s mobility index (R^ 2 is 0. 37 at the 99 % confidence level) but wind variables such as drift potential do not explain much (R^ 2 is 0. 04 at maximum). This suggests that dune activity or stabilization in coastal dune systems is mainly controlled by vegetation cover, which is in turn affected by precipitation. Foredune textures can be a useful tool to predict foredune types in association with future climate change, and the optimal averaging period of precipitation for each bare sand area was seven years...|$|R
