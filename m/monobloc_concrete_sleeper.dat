40|$|The {{development}} of <b>concrete</b> <b>sleeper</b> becomes very important due {{to increase in}} train speed and {{development of}} the long welded rails. Due to this, it is necessary to increase the weight and the strength of the <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> to resist track buckling and reduce vibration in ballast. Modem high speed trains impart considerable amount of impact energy to the track and this also generates high frequency vibrations in the rails. Sleeper should be able to absorb the impact energy and damp vibrations to a considerable extent and transmit the balance safely to the ballast. At higher speed, the stress component of the Prestressed <b>Concrete</b> <b>Sleeper</b> developed on quasi-static response to dynamic force.

40|$|Railway sleeper is a {{main part}} of railway track structures. Its role is to {{distribute}} loads from the rail foot to the underlying ballast bed. There is a widespread suspicion based on the industry experience that railway <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> have reserves of strength that are untapped. It is thus important to ascertain the spectrum and amplitudes of forces applied to the railway track, to understand more clearly {{the manner in which}} track components respond to those forces, and to clarify the processes whereby <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> in particular carry those actions. Cracks in <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> have been visually observed by many railway organizations. The principal cause of cracking is the infrequent but high-magnitude wheel loads produced by a small percentage of “bad” wheels or railhead surface defects. Those loads are of short duration but of very high magnitude. For instance, the typical loading duration produced by wheel flats is about 1 - 10 msec, while the force magnitude can be over 400 kN per rail seat. Current design philosophy for prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> is based on permissible stress principle, which are unrealistic to the actual dynamic loads on tracks. In order to devise a new limit states design concept, the research efforts are required to perform comprehensive studies of the loading conditions, the static behaviour, the dynamic response, and the impact resistance of the prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers.</b> This paper presents the results of experimental and numerical studies aimed at predicting the dynamic responses of railway <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Experimental data also convey the exact failure modes for railway prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> under static and impact loadings.

Up until recently, a new limit states design approach, whereas the dynamic effects are included, has been adopted in European countries, and has been proposed for the revision of Australian Standard AS 1085. 14. This paper presents the experimental investigations aimed at understanding the progressive collapse of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> in railway track structures under incremental impact loading, in order to form {{the state of the art}} of the impact damage classification for prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Series of repeated impact tests for the in-situ prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> were carried out, ranging from a low drop height to the ultimate drop height where the ultimate failure occurred.

The conducted research showed: 1) a cement rock near the sand particles of high concentration of chlorine and alkali metals exceeding permissible in existing standards; 2) different grained cement crystals indicates excess {{of water in the}} concrete mixture; 3) the presence in the cement rock structure of wood fibers, which are due to the additional moisture absorption accelerate chemical reactions in the operated concrete sleepers; 4) speed of alkaline-silicic-acidic reaction in <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> is 5 microns per year; 5) availability of wood fibers indicates unsatisfactory purity of aggregates screening, including crushed stone; 6) chlorine ions further accelerate structural transformation reaction of cement. Originality. The paper found the rate of corrosion processes in <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> of Ukrainian producer. The influence on the corrosion rate of contamination of large aggregates of organic substances, including wood fibers was shown in the article.

The dynamic interaction between <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> and ballast bed has rarely been studied because of the main emphasis placed on global track dynamics. Until recently, the health monitoring of track components becomes compulsory in order to develop the optimal maintenance model. Since railway tracks are normally subjected to dynamic loading, it is crucial therefore to evaluate the dynamic properties of their components.

40|$|Rail {{operators}} are consistently demanding higher axle loads to compete effectively with other modes of transport, particularly for heavy haul freight of minerals. However, high axle loads {{can only be}} achieved by ensuring that the existing rail infrastructure can cope with the greater static and dynamic loads associated with the wheel-rail interactions. Premature cracking of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> is often the result of high-intensity dynamic loading caused by wheel or rail irregularities. The high-magnitude wheel loads produced by {{a small percentage of}} “bad” wheels or rail head surface defects are crudely accounted for in the Australian Standard AS 1085. 14 by a single load amplification factor. In addition, there is a widespread perception within the railway engineering community that the carrying capacity of the existing track infrastructure is not fully utilised, and <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> possess significant amounts of untapped reserve strength. This {{can be attributed to the}} current design philosophy for <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers,</b> outlined in AS 1085. 14. This is based on the assessment of permissible stresses resulting from quasi-static wheel loads and essentially the static response of <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers,</b> making it unduly conservative and very costly for the railway organisations. This thesis addresses the identified deficiencies of the current design method through an in-depth analysis of the dynamic response of <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> under realistic loading conditions and proposes a more rational design procedure. In order to shift the conventional methodology to a more rational design method that involves more realistic dynamic response of <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> and performance-based design methodology, a significant research effort within the framework of the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Railway Engineering and Technologies has been carried out to perform comprehensive studies of the loading conditions, the dynamic response, and the dynamic resistance of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers.</b> The collaborative research between the University of Wollongong (UoW) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has addressed such important issues as the spectrum and amplitudes of dynamic forces applied to the railway track, evaluation of the reserve capacity of typical prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> designed to the current code AS 1085. 14, and the development of a new limit states design concept. The comprehensive literature review highlighted the extremely limited research work that previously had been done in this field of research. In order to enhance an understanding of the dynamic performance of railway tracks, the first part of this thesis investigates the dynamic characteristics of the global railway track and its individual components with particular reference to rail pads and prestressed <b>concrete</b> (PC) <b>sleepers.</b> The experimental techniques for extracting dynamic properties of track components, developed in the laboratory, have been successfully applied in field trials. Moreover, this thesis provides an intensive review aimed at predicting wheel impact loads due to the wheel/rail irregularities at different return periods (based on the field data from wheel impact detectors). The experimental and numerical investigations into the dynamic behaviour of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> subjected to severe impact loading are then presented. The impact tests were carried out using the prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> manufactured in Australia. A track test bed was simulated in the laboratory and calibrated against the frequency response functions obtained for real tracks. A series of incremental impact loading tests for the prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> was performed, ranging from a typical design load to a severe wheel load. The cumulative impact damage and crack propagation in <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> were identified. The effects of track environment together with the relationship between the bending moment of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> and the applied impact force are also presented. The later part of this thesis identifies the responses of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> in railway track structures under both single and repeated impact loads associated with different probabilities of occurrence. The residual capacities of the damaged prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> are studied in order to clarify the notion about the reserve strength of the <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers.</b> The numerical investigations of the static and impact behaviours of railway prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> under static and dynamic loads were also undertaken to supplement the experimental findings in this thesis. A proposal for the reliability-based design concepts and rationales associated with the development of limit states design procedures for the conversion of AS 1085. 14 to a limit states design format is one of the key outcomes of this thesis. The new limit states design concepts and procedures for railway prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>sleepers</b> are presented as the design guidelines for the railway engineers.
