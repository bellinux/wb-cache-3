50|$|Most modern MCP {{detectors}} {{consist of}} two <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> with angled channels rotated 90° {{from each other}} producing a chevron (v-like) shape.

The advantage of the chevron MCP over the straight channel MCP is significantly more gain at a given voltage. The two MCPs can either be pressed together or have a small gap between them to spread the charge across multiple channels.|$|E

The effects of storage in poor vacuum, high vacuum and desiccated air are presented as is the stability of CsI photocathodes under prolonged X-ray bombardment. One consequence of the use of CsI is that a degree of energy resolution can be conferred upon a <b>microchannel</b> <b>plate</b> detector. We present further research in this field, including measurements performed on detectors with eight micron diameter channels.

40|$|AbstractAs {{part of a}} {{collaborative}} program between University of California, Berkeley, the Argonne National Laboratory, University of Chicago, and several commercial companies, a 20 cm square sealed tube microchannel plate detector scheme with a proximity focused bialkali photocathode is being developed. Sealed tube microchannel plate deviceshave good imaging and timing characteristics, but large areas have been previously unavailable. We have madeb considerable progress in fabricating large size <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates.</b> A key feature is the novel implementation of low cost <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> using borosilicate micro-capillary arrays with hollow core tubes. The resistive and secondary electron emissive surfaces are then applied by atomic layer deposition, eliminating the wet etch and thermal reduction processes for normal glass <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates.</b> Initial results with 33 mm format <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> for gain, pulse width, imaging performance and lifetime are comparable to conventional MCPs. Large 20 cm square microchannel plate prototypes with 20 μm and 40 μm pores have been fabricated and initial tests show operational gain. Design and fabrication of a 20 cm sealed tube assembly is well advanced and comprises a borosilicate entrance window, a proximity focused bialkali photocathode, a pair of <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> and a stripline readout anode. The design employs a brazed ceramic walled enclosure and a transfer tube type photocathode with an indium seal. We have adopted a baseline bialkali photocathode to match the anticipated input spectrum, and have {{made a number of}} test cathodes with > 20 % peak quantum efficiency on borofloat- 33 window material. Stripline anodes are also being developed which will give less than 1 mm spatial resolution using custom ASIC amplification and timing electronics...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} work on both {{microchannel plate}} X-ray detectors and X-ray polarimetry, which although essentially distinct, {{have a common}} link through X-ray photocathodes. The source(s) of the background noise count rate in <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> are investigated. Various noise mechanisms assessed include outgassing, cosmic rays, field emission, internal radioactivity, ion feedback and thermal emission. Experimental measurements are compared with calculations from a Monte Carlo model {{based on the assumption}} that radioactive decay (by beta emission) of elements within the microchannel plate glass is the major source of dark noise. The performance of Caesium Bromide as an X-ray photocathode for enhancing the quantum detection efficiency of <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> is reported and compared with that of Caesium Iodide. A new type of microchannel plate configuration, a Sandwich Plate, consisting of three standard <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> bonded in permanent contact is examined for use as an X-ray photon counting detector. This investigation includes a study of the correlation between gain reduction with increased count rate and the size of the illuminated area. An evaluation is made of Galileo Long Life (L 2) <b>Microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> operated in pulse counting mode with special emphasis on the stability of the gain as a function of abstracted charge. Further evidence for radioactivity as the major source of background noise is obtained; L 2 plates contain different radioactive isotopes compared to the 'standard' (Mullard) microchannel plate glass. The design and performance of a new type of polarimeter, a Photoemission Polarimeter, for use in soft X-ray astronomy is presented. The polarimeter utilises the linear polarisation sensitivity in the photoemission from a CsI photocathode. Possible sources of instrumental modulation are evaluated by comparing experimental measurements with calculations from a Monte Carlo model.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles by the Electron Reflectometer instrument aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft from May of 1999 to the mission conclusion in November 2006. Originally designed to detect low-energy electrons, the Electron Reflectometer also measured particles with energies > 30 MeV that penetrated the aluminum housing of the instrument and were detected directly by <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> in the instrument interior. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental results, we show how the Electron Reflectometer <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates</b> recorded high energy galactic cosmic rays with ∼ 45 % efficiency. Comparisons of this data to galactic cosmic ray proton fluxes obtained from the Advanced Composition Explorer yield agreement to within 10 % and reveal the expected solar cycle modulation as well as shorter timescale variations. Solar energetic particles were detected by the same mechanism as galactic cosmic rays; however, their flux levels are far more uncertain due to shielding effects and the energy-dependent response of the <b>microchannel</b> <b>plates.</b> Using the solar energetic particle data, we have developed a catalog of energetic particle events at Mars associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which includes the identification of interplanetary shocks.
