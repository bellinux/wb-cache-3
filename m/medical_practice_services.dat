A study of the background of such children, compared with age and admission controls, suggests that the disease symptomatology in this group of children differs in no way from children who are successfully treated. The factors leading to the death of these children appear to lie in the general lack of ability of some parents to recognize the importance of symptoms, their negative attitude and inability to avail themselves of health services, and the amount of drive and persistence required to obtain general <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> <b>services</b> in some areas.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1978. MedicineBibliography : leaves 133 - 148 The Family Practice Nurse Education Program of Memorial University of Newfoundland was {{established}} to prepare experienced, diploma- and degree-holding nurses to assume an expanded nursing role in primary health care settings. The topic of this thesis is {{the evaluation of the}} impact of six graduates of this program on private <b>medical</b> <b>practices</b> in St, John's and Corner Brook, Newfoundland. The evaluation component of the family practice nurse project began in 1973 with the development of instruments to measure the family practice nurse’s impact on the effectiveness of patient care, patient and health professional satisfaction, quality of care, <b>practice</b> <b>service</b> output and organization, and financial aspects of the practices. [...] Effectiveness of Patient Care: In order to assess the effectiveness and safety of the primary care provided by a family practice nurse, a randomized clinical trial was conducted in one of the St. John's practices between June 1975 and May 1976. Before and after the trial, standardized measurements of physical, social, and emotional function were administered by lay interviewers to 572 patients who received conventional care by the family physician and to 296 patients who received care mainly from the family practice nurse. At the start of the study, statistical analyses revealed the comparability of the two groups of patients with respect to all three health outcome measurements. At the end of the study, the health outcomes of the two groups of patients were found comparable. These results corroborate the evidence derived from other controlled trials that family practice nurses/nurse practitioners provide effective care. [...] Satisfaction: Satisfaction and acceptance of family practice nurses was found high for patients, physicians and allied health professionals. [...] Quality of Patient Care: Quality of patient care standards were maintained after the introduction of family practice nurses. Before and after evaluations were achieved by using the indicator condition method. Minimal explicit process criteria for the management of patients with 12 indicator conditions and the use of 14 drugs were approved by an ad hoc peer group of community physicians. These criteria were applied to the practices using a single blind design and abstracting unaltered medical records. A standardized score for each practice was used to compare management of indicator condition scores and clinical use of drug scores before and after attachment of the family practice nurses. For each of the indicator conditions and the drugs assessed similar levels of adequacy were observed between study periods. These explicit (objective) audit results agreed with the implicit (subjective) assessments of the family practice nurses by their physician colleagues. [...] <b>Practice</b> <b>Service</b> Output and Organization: The addition of a family practice nurse to an urban <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> increased <b>service</b> output in four out of six cases. Physician/family practice nurse teams were studied using daily logs of family practice nurse activity, physician claims to the provincial Medical Care Plan, time study sheets, and function delegation questionnaires. Practices using family practice nurses had a mean increase of 14 % in the number of patient services {{during the first year of}} family practice nurse attachment; the mean increase for all physicians in the province was 9 %. The number of patients in the six study practices changed only slightly while services per patient increased by 15 %. Family practice nurses provided total care in 4 % of office services, and participated with physicians in a further 26 %. [...] No consistent changes were noted in the age and sex of patients seen or in the amount of time the physician spent in the office. [...] Financial Aspects: Estimated losses were experienced by four of six fee-for-service family physicians in a study of revenues generated and expenses incurred by the six family practice nurses who had held salaried positions for one year in private <b>medical</b> <b>practices.</b> Daily <b>service</b> diaries were used to make annual estimates of family practice nurse generated revenues. Data from these diaries were linked by computer to yearly physician service data maintained by the provincial Medical Care Plan. [...] During the year of family practice nurse attachment, the six physicians experienced a mean increase in gross Medical Care Plan revenue of $ 11, 350 with an additional extimated mean increase of $ 2, 690 when solo family <b>practice</b> nurse <b>services</b> were included. Physicians' subjective appraisals and actual financial statements from the practices were used to estimate annual expenses related to the employment of the family practice nurses. The first procedure indicated average costs of employment were $ 14, 700 and the other $ 19, 770. [...] The estimated physician losses in net income, though real, were not substantial given (1) this was the first year of the family practice nurse attachment, (2) the purposes of the family practice nurse attachment were exploratory to determine the family practice nurse's role in the practice and not primarily to demonstrate the profitability of employing family practice nurses, (3) the fee-for- service method of payment on the whole discourages delegation of tasks and allocation of time for teaching, factors not present with physicians on salary...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is {{the second}} leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. CRC {{screening}} allows for prevention through the removal of precancerous lesions and early detection of cancer. Community ContextRide for Life Alaska (RFL), {{a nonprofit organization that}} raises funds to fight cancer, and the Anchorage Neighborhood Health Center (ANHC), which is Alaska’s largest community health center, joined efforts to provide CRC screening and outreach to an ethnically diverse group of low-income underinsured or uninsured patients residing in and around Anchorage, Alaska. MethodsRFL and ANHC worked with gastroenterologists, <b>medical</b> <b>practices,</b> and pathology <b>services</b> to contribute pro bono and reduced-fee services for CRC screening. Information to patients was distributed through signs in the clinic, flyers, and the ANHC website. OutcomesCRC screening was increased in this population. During 2007 - 2009, there were 2, 561 immunochemical fecal occult blood tests given to patients, and 1, 558 were completed (61 %); 24 % were positive. Sixteen gastroenterologists, 4 <b>medical</b> <b>practices,</b> and 2 laboratories provided 111 follow-up colonoscopies and pathology services to patients identified through the CRC screening program who did not have other funding resources available for follow-up care. InterpretationThis program provides a model for leveraging scarce screening resources by drawing on multiple partners to increase CRC screening. Recommendations for those seeking to initiate similar programs are to have memoranda of agreement in place and a clear scope of work for all participating people and organizations to avoid delays in program implementation; hire a screening care coordinator to manage patient care and collaborate with medical practices; and identify program champions who have the energy and persistence to craft such partnerships...|$|R
40|$|We use a three-equation {{model to}} {{estimate}} a health production function for Australia using population data for 1996.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I will explore a {{conflict}} that <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> is faced with, when dealing with {{patients who suffer from}} anorexia nervosa. These patients are primarily concerned with losing weight, in order to achieve their ultimate aim of being thin. This aim is in common perception and in <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> considered as unreasonable. Therefore, <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> is aimed at treating these patients to regain a healthy weight and prevent them from death {{as a result of their}} underweight. In <b>medical</b> <b>practice,</b> competent patients are allowed to make autonomous decisions with regards to their treatment. Although patients with anorexia nervosa hold a rather unusual balance in their values, they satisfy the required criteria for competence. <b>Medical</b> <b>practice</b> is legally required to take the decisions of these patients seriously. Since their decisions can threaten their health and their life, it is unclear how <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> should deal with this issue. This study illustrates an ethical analysis of this conflict, and offers three lines of reasoning <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> can accept to deal with this matter. My main aim is to illustrate which options there are for <b>medical</b> <b>practice,</b> in order to support the wellbeing of patients with anorexia nervosa. This analysis will provide an answer to the question whether or not <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> should accept that people with anorexia nervosa value being thin as more important than their health or their life...|$|R

40|$|The non-contractual-contractual divide {{represents}} the basic criterion of qualification in private law liability. The essential {{difference between them}} is that whereas tortious obligation arises as a liability obligation i. e. as an obligation to pay damages, contractual obligation arises as a duty of performance which changes itself into an obligation of damages only in case of non-performance. What is true is that both contractual and extracontractual liability have damage in common, the objective element of every private law liability. The question is not always one of alternative between contractual and non-contractual liability. On the contrary, both {{can be thought of}} as being simoultaneously apt to rule single types of fact. A coincidence between contractual and non-contractual liability is typically the case when performance is so to say applied directly to the person or a good of the creditor, as in cases of <b>medical</b> <b>practice</b> or <b>services</b> in general. The counterway of a possible overlap is that in which conduct of debtor is not in itself non performance but infringes some other protected interest of creditor, giving rise to a tort. The judicial trend shows that courts talk of possible concurrence of tortious liability with the contractual one when this ends up in favour of the victim; on the other hand they opt for a purely contractual approach if this produces the only or most effective remedy for the victim. Through a analytical appraisal of the courts' attitude, the author concludes that the rule of concurrence in Italian law has only a sectorial range. This explains the idea manifested in literature, according to which concurrence between contractual and non contractual liability hardly can be justified in dogmatic terms, whereas it appears to find only reasons of «pure equity and contingent empiricism»...|$|R
