5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, shrimps, mantis shrimps, bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with shrimps and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. <b>multiparous,</b> and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
5|$|The age {{of first}} {{breeding}} in gray wolves {{depends largely on}} environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages {{in order to better}} exploit abundant resources. This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average. Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches reproductive senescence. Estrus typically occurs in late winter, with older, <b>multiparous</b> females entering estrus 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females. During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely. Old females usually whelp in the den of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace. The gestation period lasts 62–75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period.|$|E
25|$|Livestock breeders {{commonly}} bank colostrum {{from their}} animals. Colostrum {{can be stored}} frozen but it does lose some of its inherent quality. Colostrum produced on a breeder's own premises {{is considered to be}} superior to colostrum from other sources, because it is produced by animals already exposed to (and, thus, making antibodies to) pathogens occurring on the premises. A German study reported that <b>multiparous</b> mares produced on average a liter (quart) of colostrum containing 70grams of IgG.|$|E
25|$|Elephant seals {{are among}} the seals that can stay on land for the longest periods of time, as they can stay dry for several {{consecutive}} weeks each year. Males arrive in the colonies earlier than the females and fight for control of harems when they arrive. Large body size confers advantages in fighting and the agonistic relationships of the bulls {{gives rise to a}} dominance hierarchy, with access to harems and activity within harems being determined by rank. The dominant bulls (“harem masters”) establish harems of several dozen females. The least successful males have no harems, but may try to copulate with a harem male's females when the male is not looking. The majority of primiparous females and a significant proportion of <b>multiparous</b> females mate at sea with roaming males away from harems.|$|E

500|$|Typically, as a {{dead body}} decomposes, body tissues become {{depleted}} of oxygen and the body begins to putrefy; anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract proliferate {{and as a result}} of increased metabolic activity, release gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide. These bacteria secrete exoenzymes to break down body cells and proteins for ingestion which thus weakens organ tissues. Increasing pressure forces the diffusion of excessive gases into the weakened tissues where they enter the circulatory system and spread to other parts of the body, causing both torso and limbs to become bloated. These decompositional processes weaken the structural integrity of organs by separating necrotizing tissue layers. Bloating usually begins from two to five days after death, depending on external temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions. As the volume of gas increases, the pressure begins to force various body fluids to exude from all natural orifices. It is at this point during the decomposition of a pregnant body that amniotic membranes become stretched and separated, and intraabdominal gas pressure may force the [...] and prolapse of the uterus, which would result in the expulsion of the fetus through the vaginal canal. It has been observed that the bodies of <b>multiparous</b> women are more likely to spontaneously expel the fetus during decomposition than those who died during their first pregnancy, because of the more elastic nature of the cervix.|$|E
2500|$|Typical meadow vole litters {{consist of}} four to six young, with {{extremes}} of one and 11 young. On average, 2.6 young are successfully weaned per litter. [...] Litter size is not significantly correlated with latitude, elevation, or population density. [...] Fall, winter, and spring litters tend to be smaller than summer litters. Litter size {{was positively correlated with}} body size, and is not significantly different in primaparous and <b>multiparous</b> females. Primaparous females had fewer young per litter than <b>multiparous</b> females. Litter size was constant in summer breeding periods at different population densities. [...] Female meadow voles reach reproductive maturity earlier than males; some ovulate and become pregnant as early as three weeks old. [...] Males are usually six to eight weeks old before mature sperm are produced. One captive female produced 17 litters in one year for a total of 83 young.

2500|$|The active {{stage of}} labour (or [...] "active phase of first stage" [...] if the {{previous}} phase is termed [...] "latent phase of first stage") has geographically differing definitions. In the US, {{the definition of}} active labour was changed from 3 to 4cm, to 5cm of cervical dilation for <b>multiparous</b> women, mothers who had given birth previously, and at 6cm for nulliparous women, {{those who had not}} given birth before. This has been done in an effort to increase the rates of vaginal delivery.|$|E
2500|$|Associated {{terms for}} {{pregnancy}} are gravid and parous. Gravidus and gravid {{come from the}} Latin for [...] "heavy" [...] and a pregnant female is {{sometimes referred to as}} a gravida. Gravidity is a term used to describe the number of times that a female has been pregnant. [...] Similarly, the term parity is used for the number of times that a female carries a pregnancy to a viable stage. Twins and other multiple births are counted as one pregnancy and birth. [...] A woman who has never been pregnant is referred to as a nulligravida. [...] A woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time is referred to as a primigravida, and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a multigravida or as <b>multiparous.</b> Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. [...] In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as nulliparous.|$|E

A gynecologist may come across this type of hernias as a secondary finding during gynecological open surgery or laparoscopy [...] The Howship-Romberg sign is suggestive of an obturator hernia, exacerbated by thigh extension, medial rotation and abduction. It is characterized by lancilating pain in the medial thigh/obturator distribution, extending to the knee; caused by hernia compression of the obturator nerve.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cause of}} TRALI is {{currently}} not fully understood. TRALI {{is thought to}} be immune mediated. Antibodies directed toward human leukocyte antigens (HLA) or human neutrophil antigens (HNA) have been implicated. Women who are <b>multiparous</b> (conceived more than one child) develop these antibodies through exposure to fetal blood; transfusion of blood components obtained from these donors is thought to carry a higher risk of inducing immune-mediated TRALI. Previous transfusion or transplantation can also lead to donor sensitization. To be at risk of TRALI via this mechanism, the blood recipient must express the specific HLA or neutrophil receptors to which the implicated donor has formed antibodies. A two-hit hypothesis has been suggested [...] wherein pre-existing pulmonary pathology (i.e. the first-hit) leads to localization of neutrophils to the pulmonary microvasculature. The second hit occurs when the aforementioned antibodies are transfused and attach to and activate neutrophils, leading to release of cytokines and vasoactive substances that induce non-cardiac pulmonary edema.|$|E
