500|$|Ede Teller {{was born}} on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family. His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. Yet <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>said</b> prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in his head for fun.|$|E

[...] "My father piled all our {{belongings}} into an old jalopy, with our bedding on top", Adams recalled. [...] "We didn't know where we were going. He started driving, and ran out of gas and money in Jersey City, New Jersey at Audubon Park. A man came over and started talking to us, a Mr. Cohn. He said to my father 'You look like you need a job,' and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>said</b> 'I do'." [...] Adams' father was given a job as janitor of an apartment building along with living quarters in the basement. Eventually, they moved to Van Nostrand Avenue between Ocean Avenue and Rutgers Avenue. His mother worked for Western Electric in Kearny, New Jersey.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, Jackson {{released}} her self-titled debut album. In order to distinguish herself from her famous brothers, The Jacksons, La Toya only wanted {{her first name}} on the album. [...] "I begged just to have it 'La Toya'. But <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>said,</b> 'It's your last name. You got to use it.' But I {{wanted to see what}} I could do as an individual." [...] The first single [...] "If You Feel the Funk", became a modest hit, climbing into the Top 40 of the US R chart. Her second single, [...] "Night Time Lover", was produced by younger brother Michael, who provided backing vocals. In turn, she provided the opening scream on her brothers', The Jacksons, 1980 hit, [...] "This Place Hotel" [...] as well as backing vocals on brother Michael's 1984 solo hit [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)".|$|E

2500|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets IV is the {{grandson}} of Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., the pilot of the aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945. He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and was inspired to join the United States Air Force (USAF) not by his famous grandfather but by his father, Paul W. Tibbets III, a pharmacist and hospital administrator {{who served in the}} United States Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel. [...] "When I was in 9th grade," [...] he recalled [...] "I became involved in youth service projects. It was a passion of mine to serve. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>said</b> 'You seem to be very interested in serving – {{what do you want to}} do with your life?' I told him I was interested in serving, and he told me to look into something like the ROTC or service academies." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Colored {{people lived}} in three neighborhoods that were clearly demarcated, as if by ropes or turnstiles," [...] wrote Harvard {{professor}} Henry Louis Gates, Jr. {{about growing up in}} segregated West Virginia in the 1960s. [...] "Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said.... Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence." [...] "For most of my childhood, we couldn't eat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores," [...] recalls Gates. His mother retaliated by not buying clothes that she was not allowed to try on. He remembered hearing a white man deliberately calling his father by the wrong name: [...] "'He knows my name, boy,' <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>said</b> after a long pause. 'He calls all colored people George.'" [...] When Gates's cousin became the first black cheerleader at the local high school, she was not allowed to sit with the team and drink Coke from a glass but had to stand at the counter drinking from a paper cup. Professor Gates also wrote about his experiences in his 1995 book, Colored People: A Memoir.|$|E
