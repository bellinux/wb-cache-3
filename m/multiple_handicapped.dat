40|$|Little {{attention}} has been directed toward abuse and neglect {{in children and adolescents}} with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicaps.</b> This population, however, may be at especially high risk for maltreatment. Factors contributing to added risk include: (a) disruption in mother-infant attachment, (b) greater stress related to care needs and difficult to manage behavior problems, and (c) increased vulnerability due to communication and/or cognitive limitations. Five cases are presented involving abuse and neglect in psychiatrically referred children with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicaps.</b> Cases are discussed in terms of: (a) difficulties in identifying maltreatment in those with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicaps,</b> (b) the need for multidisciplinary intervention with families who engage in maltreatment, and (c) suggestions for future directions that research might take...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} called "Coordinated support to pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> in Příbram region"and it {{is divided into}} two main parts. The first part is theoretical and here I define the term health and <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap,</b> which is further on classified. Then I deal with the possibilities of education of pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> and I examine the methods of work used in this area. Since these individuals often have limited possibilities in communication, I also mention the communication systems of AAC. In the second chapter of the theoretical part I describe one important part of care for people with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> - means of the comprehensive system of rehabilitation: medical, social, educational and working means of rehabilitation. In the practical part I discuss the aims, the methodology and the analysis of gathered data. At first I analyse the coordinated support of pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> at schools in Příbram region. I have mapped institutions which educate pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> and also other institutions cooperating with them. After that I analyse the interviews which I carried out and which are attached in the annexes. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to find out the amount and distribution of institutions educating pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap.</b> I also try to determine whether the amount of these institutions is sufficient. Finally, I wanted to create an information leaflet about these schools. The question that I set to fulfil the main objective is: "What is the amount and distribution of institutions educating pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> in Příbram region?" and a sub-question: "Is this amount sufficient?". During the research I determined another question, which should help me with mapping these institutions, gaining important information about them and creating the leaflet: "How is the education of pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> carried out at schools in Příbram region?" and a sub-question: "Do these institutions provide a coordinated support for these pupils?". I performed the research using semi - standardized interviews with specialists from these schools, the consulting organization (SPC) and with parents of children with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap.</b> Interviews were executed by asking some pre-prepared questions and were recorded on a dictaphone, with the consent of respondents. For better interpretation of the results, I have divided the questions into three categories. The data from the interviews was supplemented with information from relevant websites I have analyzed. The result of this work is the mapping of coordinated care for pupils at schools of Příbram region and a creation of the information leaflet about institutions educating pupils with <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> (where I mention also some nonprofit institutions providing care for primary school graduates and for adults with disabilities). Whether there are enough such institutions in Příbram region is not totally certain but a slightly prevailing opinion says that there are not. There is a lack of primary schools and specialists dealing with pupils with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), who would have some work experience with these individuals. The atmosphere in the examined schools is friendly, the pedagogues and educators generally like their job and the cooperation with parents is usually without problems. However, the classroom equipment needs to be modificated including teaching tools. Teachers do not use rehabilitation techniques very much and these schools hardly ever offer any therapies. On the other hand, these activities are offered by cooperating organizations (Alka, Krok, Pessos) that help these schools provide the means of comprehensive rehabilitation system and thus the coordinated support is secured...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is designed to}} find out relationship between manipulation and posture of <b>multiple</b> <b>handicapped</b> children. From the functional perspective, {{the key to understanding}} posture control is to determine how posture is related to action. This means treating posture as a component of voluntary acts and analyzing the role posture plays in support of action. Without considerable and precise support, <b>multiple</b> <b>handicapped</b> children do not, for example, reach very accurately or rotate their heads to manipulate objects with real precision. When <b>multiple</b> <b>handicapped</b> children are engaged in a goal-directed manual task there is always anticipatory postural activity that functions in a specific way to balance the body for the intended movement andfor the direction and intensity of forces it will bring to play upon the body. Such phenomena reflect the necessity of postural control for the facilitation of many movements. Thus posture plays a very important {{role in the development of}} truely voluntary action...|$|E

Potential explanations for the lack of such evidence are offered, including the relative lack of research attention given to this issue, the possible ineffectiveness of the components of the technology applied, and possible ineffective application of the potentially effective technology. Suggestions for future research are discussed in terms of developing more effective educational and habilitative services for persons with profound <b>multiple</b> <b>handicaps.</b> In particular, we suggest research on a wider variety of behavioral teaching procedures, providing more comprehensive evaluations of the applications of procedures and developing treatment programs that do not focus solely on traditional skill acquisition...|$|R

For sedative purposes, increasing doses of alimemazine were administered to a 4 -year-old <b>multiple</b> <b>handicapped</b> girl, with cerebral damage of the basal ganglia. She developed extra-pyramidal motor disturbances, an autonomic disorder, lowered consciousness and hyperthermia, characterising NMS. Alimemazine was stopped and dantrolene and supportive measures, including ventilation under sedation and paralysis with midazolam and vecuronium, were started. As clinical symptoms remained unabated, increasing doses of bromocriptine were administered. Two days after maximal bromocriptine dosage, her clinical condition improved and paralysis and ventilation were stopped. Midazolam and bromocriptine could be gradually decreased and suspended during the following months. A few days after bromocriptine cessation NMS recurred and was complicated by a fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. CONCLUSION: caution must be exercised when prescribing alimemazine, especially to children with basal ganglia damage {{and in the case}} of inexplicable fever and restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be considered. Long-term therapy with bromocriptine combined with dantrolene and midazolam may be a successful medical treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ten {{patients}} (five {{males and}} five females, 8 - 27 years of age) diagnosed cases of Usher's syn-drome were tested for their gustative and olfactory functions. The tasting of these <b>multiple</b> <b>handicapped</b> patients {{was carried out}} by elicitation of innate reflex-like distinct facial expressions in response to gustatory and nasal stimulation. Findings indicate normal gustatory and olfactory function as well as adequate hedonic responses to presented stimuli. In view of the reported findings it can be stated that Usher's syndrome affect selectively the senses of vision, hearing and often also labyrinth, while taste and smell functions are not affected. Key words: Usher's syndrome, taste, smell, facial expressions. The inherited autosomal recessive condition, known as Usher's syndrome, is characterized by congenital hearing loss and by tapetoratinal dystrophy. The association of retinitis pigmentosa and deafness was first reported by von Graefe (1858) (1.). Since the hereditary nature of this syndrome was pointed out by Usher (1914) (11.), the condition was termed after this author. Searching the relevant literature no sufficient evidence could be found about the assessment of the function of the two major chemical senses (taste and smell) i...|$|E

Umezu (1980) classified sign system from the angle of genesis and construction principle of signs. The sign system activity plays the central role in the self regulation activity of behaviors. Sign system consists of aboriginal sign system and constructive sign system. Constructive sign system consists of symbolic sign system and non-symbolic sign system. Symbolic sign system is constituted on similarity to the event. Non-symbolic sign system consists of gestalt-qualitative sign system and molecule-synthetic sign system. Non-symbolic sign system is constituted on the next principle. Though there are difference between the sign system and the event system, while children consider the sign system and the event system as the same thing, they operate the sign system. Symbolic sign system is more readily learned as a sign in a child due to its similarity to the event system. Non-symbolic. sign system is difficult to learn due to its constructive principle. It is usually most difficult to establish the molecular-synthetic sign system as signs, as there are many steps of learning to operate the molecular-synthetic sign system freely...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{critical}} need for comprehensive residential living facilities, in other than large institutional environments, for persons with both mental and physical disabilities. In an automated small-group home, these people could achieve a quality of life derived from having some control over their living and learning environments. Technology could be the answer to help the <b>multiple</b> <b>handicapped</b> individual. The purpose of this dissertation project was to design specifications and requirements for a training methodology to prepare multiple and severely disabled people to use a computerized environmental-control system. A residential facility for mentally retarded individuals in Broward County served as the 2 ̆ 2 Project Center 2 ̆ 2. The primary objectives for the project were: (1) to determine the category of individual {{with the ability to}} use a computerized environmental-control system; and (2) to design an appropriate training methodology. Training candidates were carefully chosen to select individuals who represented a cross-section of people with multiple handicaps and who were potentially able to derive benefit from an automated small-group home environment. Baseline evaluation, formative evaluation, and summative evaluation procedures were studied and applied, as appropriate, to learners, to lessons (objectives), and to the total program. The product of this project was a prototype of a training program to be used {{as the basis for the}} formative revision of future expanded training. Expectations for using a standard or semi-standard keyboard for computer input were not reasonable; therefore, an alternative input device was developed. It consisted of two large-format, recessed, push-button keypads that were distinctly color-coded and permitted trainees with limited hand control to sequence through the menu options and select the desired choice. Consistent with previous experience of the trainees in the use of communication aids, menu choices for control-action functions were represented as easily recognized pictures (2 ̆ 2 icons 2 ̆ 2) instead of words. Target goals (performance objectives) designed to teach the general skills required to accomplish desired functions using the computer and related input and output devices were written to be meaningful, measurable, and referenced to the broad goals initially established. When Target Goals were successfully achieved, the trainee had acquired the knowledge necessary to make menu choices and use the computer system, including input and output devices. Pre-training evaluation was conducted by a team of observers. Evaluation of training sessions followed; during which the trainer applied Training session Procedures developed specifically for this project to teach trainees to accomplish the Target Goals. Post-training evaluation was conducted by the same team that conducted pre-training evaluation The overall increase for all trainees, who when totaled together completed 64 of the maximum possible 80 rounds (8 trainees x 10 rounds per trainee). Trainees as a group were able to accomplish an average of 76. 04 percent of the maximum possible goals. They were able to accomplish an average of 95. 05 percent of goals tried. The broad program goals were effectively transformed into educationally sound performance objectives. The training session procedures were appropriate to accomplish the Target Goals for 5 of the 6 training candidates who were not classified as being in the severe to profound level of mental retardation, even though their physical disabilities were classified as severe.

40|$|Sexual {{displays}} often involve {{several different}} ornamental traits. Yet most indicator models of sexual selection {{based on a}} single receiver (usually a choosy female) find that <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> signals should be unstable. Here we study reasons for this contradiction, analyzing signal function, signal content, and trade-offs between signals in the polygynous red-collared widowbird Euplectes ardens. Males have both a long, graduated tail and a red carotenoid collar badge. Territory-holding "residents" have slightly shorter tails than the nonbreeding "floaters," but their carotenoid collars are 40 % larger, and they have (on the basis of reflectance spectrometry and objective colorimetry) a 23 -nm more long-wave ("redder") hue than floaters. This corroborates experimental evidence that the red collar is selected by male contest competition, whereas female choice is based almost exclusively on male tail length. Tail length is negatively correlated with the carotenoid signal, which together with body size and condition explains 55 % {{of the variation in}} tail length. The trade-off in tail length and carotenoid investment is steeper among residents, suggesting an interaction with costs of territory defense. We propose that the "multiple receiver hypothesis" can explain the coexistence of <b>multiple</b> <b>handicap</b> signals. Furthermore, the trade-off between signal expressions might contribute to the inverse relation between nuptial tail elongation and coloration in the genus Euplectes (bishops and widowbirds) ...|$|R
