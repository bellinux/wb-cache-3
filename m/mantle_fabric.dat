40|$|International audienceA central {{target in}} Earth {{sciences}} {{is the study}} of deformation at various depth levels within the Earth. Seismology has offered a remarkable tool for doing this via seismic anisotropy. It is however not always clear how to interpret those observations. A question of interest is to understand the relation between the deformation of the mantle and the crust, and in studying the relation between the two. Mantle deformation is expressed in seismic anisotropy. In this paper we seek an objective way of extracting information about crustal fabric as well, to be able to compare with seismic anisotropy. The magnetization of crustal rocks offers an attractive possibility for doing this. We thus explore the use of magnetic data, and we compare magnetic crustal fabric orientation with <b>mantle</b> <b>fabric</b> observations from seismic anisotropy. We apply our technique to the North American craton for which we have an excellent magnetic dataset, and we show that there is a clear relation between crustal and <b>mantle</b> <b>fabric</b> for the cratonic region. This has important implications for crustal formation, and for interpreting seismic anisotropy observations...|$|E

30|$|To use <b>mantle</b> <b>fabrics</b> to {{decipher}} plate movements, {{it is important}} to understand the timing of fabric development. This issue is closely linked to understanding mantle anisotropy, where studies of this topic generally assume that seismic anisotropy developed during a single tectonic event. Lindås Nappe, located in western Norway, contains rocks exposed to eclogite-facies conditions, and the anorthosites in this area possess two fabrics. Grenvillian granulite facies rocks are transected by eclogite-facies shear zones that developed during the Caledonian collision between Baltica and Lurentia. Lindås Nappe contains numerous small peridotite lenses that allow us to investigate fabric development in peridotites exposed to two high-grade metamorphic events with different amounts of fluid. Fluids may also promote metamorphic reactions, like transformation from spinel peridotite to garnet peridotite. Metamorphic reactions and changes in mineral assemblages can be associated with a change in fabric.|$|R

The azimuthal variations at most stations can be explained as the results of present SW ward asthenospheric flow and NNE trending lithospheric fabrics formed during past orogenic events. In the NMSZ, rift-parallel fast directions (potentially related to a long-rift flow) and rift-orthogonal fast directions from small-scale mantle convection are not observed.

40|$|Structural {{and fabric}} {{analysis}} of the well-exposed Hilti mantle section, Oman ophiolite, suggests that shear zone development, which may have resulted from oceanic plate fragmentation, was influenced by pre-existing <b>mantle</b> <b>fabric</b> present at the paleo-ridge. Detailed structural mapping in the mantle section revealed a gently undulating structure with an east [...] -west flow direction. A NW [...] -SE strike-slip shear zone cuts across this horizontal structure. The crystal preferred orientation (CPO) of olivine within the foliation is dominated by (010) axial patterns rather than more commonly observed (010) [100] patterns, suggesting that the horizontal flow close to the Moho involved non-coaxial flow. Olivine CPO within the shear zone formed at low tem-perature is characterized by (001) [100] patterns and a sinistral sense of shear. The olivine CPO becomes weaker with progress-ive mylonitization and accompanying grain size reduction, and ultimately develops into an ultra-mylonite with a random CPO pattern. The olivine [010]-axis is consistently sub-vertical, even where the horizontal foliation has been rotated to a sub-vertical orientation within the shear zone. These observations suggest that the primary mechanical anisotropy (<b>mantle</b> <b>fabric)</b> has been readily transformed into a secondary structure (shear zone) with minimum modification. This occurred {{as a result of}} a change of the olivine slip systems during oceanic detachment and related tectonics during cooling. We propose that primary olivine CPO fabrics may play a significant role in the subsequent structural development of the mantle. Thus, the structural behavior of oceanic mantle lithosphere during subduction and obduction may be strongly influenced by initial mechanical anisotropy developed at an oceanic spreading center.

40|$|International audienceAs {{previously}} {{suggested by}} many authors, shear wave splitting rneasurernents certainly {{provide the best}} insights on the tectonic structure (or fabric) of the upper mantle. Shear wave splitting pararneters are correlated with the flow fabric developed in the deforming upper mantle. Petrophysical analysis of peridotites [e. g., Kem et al., 1996; Mainprice and Silver, 1993] shows that the largest anisotropy is recorded for shear waves propagating close to the Y structural direction (i. e., normal to the lineation in the foliation plane) and that the fast split shear wa ve is polarized in a plane parallel to the X structural axis (i. e., the lineation, marked by the olivine a axis concentration).

40|$|Anisotropy is {{a common}} {{property}} of the Earth's crust and the upper mantle; it {{is related to the}} strain field of the medium and therefore to geodynamics. In this paper we describe the different possible origins of anisotropic behavior of the seismic waves and the seismological techniques used to define anisotropic bodies. In general it is found that the fast polarization direction is parallel to the absolute plate motion in cratonic areas, to the spreading direction near rifts or extensional zones, and to the main structural features in transpressive regimes. The delay times between fast and slow waves reflect the relative strength and penetration at depth of the deformation field. The correspondence between surface structural trends and anisotropy in the upper mantle, found in many regions of the world, strongly suggest that orogenic processes involve not only the shallow crust but the entire lithosphere. Recently in Italy both shear wave splitting analysis and Pn inversion were applied to define the trend of seismic anisotropy. Along the Northern Appeninic arc fast directions follow the strike of the arc (i. e., parallel to the strike of the Miocene-Pleistocene compressional features), whereas in the Tyrrhenian zone fast directions are about E-W SW-NE; parallel to the post-Miocene extension that is thought to have reoriented the <b>mantle</b> minerals <b>fabric</b> in the astenosphere...|$|R
40|$|The E-W running Salem-Attur {{shear zone}} {{demarcates}} the tectonic boundary between Archaean Dharwar Craton {{in the north}} and Proterozoic Southern granulite terrane in the south. This study reveals that the shear zone is a low angle thrust. The thrust zone is around 10 m thick and it merges with the main shear zone along the strike. The thrust is developed on charnockite near Odyarpatti, which is retrograded into schists. Further, it is marked by gently dipping mylonitic foliation and subhorizontal lineation. The S-C <b>fabric,</b> <b>mantled</b> porphyroclasts and intragranular faults indicate northeasterly slip along the thrust. Recumbent shear folds SF 1 are developed within the thrust zone. The thrust has been folded by late stage F 2 fold which has brought variation in the orientation of the mylonitic foliation from subhorizontal to vertical attitude; the mylonitic lineations have been rotated to subvertical orientation also. Additionally, the F 2 crenulations and shear cleavages and intersection lineations are superimposed on the mylonitic fabric. Thrusting along the Salem-Attur shear zone is probably the cause for upliftment of the charnockites to the upper crust. Post-upliftment stage has witnessed brittle deformation in the form of development of shear fractures in NNE-SSW and E-W directions. Pseudotachylites are emplaced along these fractures...|$|R
40|$|With time, {{convective}} {{processes in}} the Earth's mantle will tend to align crystals, grains and inclusions. This <b>mantle</b> <b>fabric</b> is detectable seismologically, as it produces an anisotropy in material properties—in particular, a directional dependence in seismic-wave velocity. This alignment is enhanced at {{the boundaries of the}} mantle where there are rapid changes in the direction and magnitude of mantle flow, and therefore most observations of anisotropy are confined to the uppermost mantle or lithosphere and the lowermost-mantle analogue of the lithosphere, the D" region. Here we present evidence from shear-wave splitting measurements for mid-mantle anisotropy {{in the vicinity of the}} 660 -km discontinuity, the boundary between the upper and lower mantle. Deep-focus earthquakes in the Tonga–Kermadec and New Hebrides subduction zones recorded at Australian seismograph stations record some of the largest values of shear-wave splitting hitherto reported. The results suggest that, at least locally, there may exist a mid-mantle boundary layer, which could indicate the impediment of flow between the upper and lower mantle in this region...|$|E
40|$|International audienceReactivation of {{structures}} inherited from previous collisional or rifting events, especially lithospheric-scale faults, {{is a major}} feature of plate tectonics. Its expression ranges from continental break-up along ancient collisional belts(1, 2) to linear arrays of intraplate magmatism and seismicity(3, 4). Here we use multiscale numerical models to show that this reactivation can result from an anisotropic mechanical behaviour of the lithospheric mantle due to an inherited preferred orientation of olivine crystals. We explicitly consider an evolving anisotropic viscosity controlled by the orientation of olivine crystals in the mantle. We find that strain is localized in domains where shear stresses on the inherited <b>mantle</b> <b>fabric</b> are high, and that this leads to shearing parallel to the inherited fabric. During rifting, structural reactivation induced by anisotropy results in oblique extension, followed by either normal extension or failure. Our results suggest that anisotropic viscosity in the lithospheric mantle controls the location and orientation of intraplate deformation zones that may evolve into new plate boundaries, and causes long-lived lithospheric-scale wrench faults, contributing to the toroidal component of plate motions on Earth...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{studies on}} {{deformation}} of olivine {{in response to}} applied stress suggest two distinct deformation mechanisms in the earth's upper mantle: diffusion creep through diffusion of atoms along grain boundaries and dislocation creep by slipping along crystallographic glide planes. Each mechanism has very different and important consequences on the dynamical evolution of the mantle {{and the development of}} <b>mantle</b> <b>fabric.</b> Due to the lack of in situ observations, it is unclear which deformation mechanism dominates in the upper mantle, although observed seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle suggests the presence of dislocation creep. We examined the thermo-mechanical erosion of the lithosphere by thermal boundary layer instabilities in 3 -D dynamical models. This study demonstrates that the seismically derived thermal structure of the Pacific lithosphere and upper mantle imposes an important constraint on the upper mantle deformation mechanism. The predominant deformation mechanism in the upper mantle is dislocation creep, consistent with observed seismic anisotropy. The acceptable activation energy range of 360 &# 8211; 540 kJ/mol is consistent with, although at the lower end of, those determined from laboratory studies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCrucial to our {{understanding}} of melt migration and segregation from source rocks beneath mid-ocean ridges and volcanic provinces is the intimate relationship with ductile mantle deformation. For this reason, numerous experiments and theoretical studies have been performed to simulate the process of melt extraction from deforming mantle rocks, with the emerging view that segregation occurs into melt-rich bands that are inclined relative to the direction of deformation. This is seemingly in contrast, however, to observations made on mantle rocks exposed at the Earth’s surface, which display evidence for melt migration in bands that were originally parallel to the direction of deformation. Here, we present experimental evidence that reconciles these contradictory observations. Olivine aggregates containing 10 wt% of a melt that reacts with olivine to precipitate orthopyroxene were deformed at 2 GPa and 1150 °C in simple shear experiments. In agreement with previous studies, we observe the development of a melt-preferred orientation that is inclined (∼ 30 °) with respect to the main compression axis σ 1. However, the alignment of newly crystallized orthopyroxene aggregates defines a fabric that develops perpendicular to σ 1 and rotates toward the shear direction with increasing shear strain (γ of 0. 3 – 2). This misalignment significantly changes the interpretation of evidence for melt channeling and transport in exposed upper <b>mantle</b> rocks: the <b>fabric</b> formed by the phases that have crystallized from a melt during deformation cannot be used directly as a marker for the melt migration direction...|$|R
40|$|The Carpathian-Pannonian region (CPR) is {{the northeastern}} {{end of the}} Alpine {{mountain}} belt. In the Western Alps, available results of anisotropy investigations (SKS splitting) show clear belt-parallel anisotropy. In the Eastern Alps this pattern not only is broken but also does not follow the strike of Carpathians and Dinarides. This study is aimed at evaluating the seismic anisotropy of the upper mantle beneath the Pannonian Basin concentrating on the eastward elongation of the fast anisotropic pattern of the Eastern Alps. We use data recorded by the temporary stations, {{set up for the}} Carpathian Basin Project (CBP) extending from the Vienna basin through Hungary into Serbia, together with the petrological indicator of deformation in basalt-hosted upper mantle xenoliths from Szentbékkála analyzed with the EBSD system at Geosciences Montpellier, France (Kovács et al., 2012). We reprocess data from 45 temporary CBP stations consisting of recorded waveform of teleseismic events. The minimum energy method is applied to measure the splitting delay time and fast axis orientation. The dominant fast polarization orientation is NW-SE for the Hungarian part of the stations {{as well as at the}} stations located in the easternmost of the Pannonian Basin. This orientation matches well with the anisotropy structure under the Eastern Alps, which has already been attributed to the asthenospheric flow (Qorbani et al., 2015). The NW-SE trend turns more into WNW-ESE at the stations situated in Austria, mostly NW of the Vienna basin. Apart from predominately NW-SE fast orientation, there are a few measurements showing NE-SW and almost E-W trend. The lithospheric thickness in the CPR region is estimated about 60 km, the SKS measurements thus most likely originate mainly from the asthenosphere. Lattice preferred orientation of xenoliths from the deeper lithospheric <b>mantle</b> show A-type <b>fabric</b> of olivine, in which the fast axis azimuth may correspond to the shear direction, possibly present-day asthenospheric flow in the upper mantle.

Hansen. 1 PDF (xi, 117 pages) + 1 PDF {{containing}} 14 oversize {{images and}} zipped GIS data. This dissertation is a multi-scale structural and kinematic {{analysis of the}} Shagawa Lake shear zone in northeastern Minnesota (USA). The Neoarchean Shagawa Lake shear zone is an ~ 70 km long ~ 7 km wide subvertical package of L-S tectonites located within the Wawa Subprovince of the Archean Superior Province. In this dissertation, I (1) discuss a new method for mapping regional tectonic fabrics using high-resolution LiDAR altimetry data; (2) examine the geometric relationships between metamorphic foliation, elongation lineation, vorticity, and non-coaxial shear direction within individual L-S tectonites; and (3) incorporate LiDAR, field, and microstructural data sets into a comprehensive structural and kinematic analysis of the Western Shagawa Lake shear zone. Lastly, I discuss implications for assembly of the southern Superior Province. In Chapter one I examine an Archean granite-greenstone terrane in NE Minnesota to illustrate the application of high-resolution LiDAR altimetry to mapping regional tectonic fabrics in forested, glaciated areas. I describe the recognition of lineaments and distinguishing between tectonic and glacial lineament fabrics. I use a 1 -m posted LiDAR derived bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) to construct multiple shaded-relief images for lineament mapping with sun elevation of 45 &# 730; and varying sun azimuth in 45 &# 730; intervals. Two suites of lineaments are apparent. Suite A has a unimodal orientation, mean trend of 035, and consists of short (> 2 km long) lineaments within sediment deposits and bedrock. Suite B lineaments, which are longer (1 - 30 km) than those of suite A, have a quasi-bimodal orientation distribution, with maximum trends of 065 and 090. Only one lineament suite is visible in areas where suites A and B are parallel. I interpret suite A as a surficial geomorphologic fabric related to recent glaciation, and suite B {{as a proxy for}} the regional tectonic fabric. Field measurements of regional tectonic foliation trajectories are largely consistent with suite B lineaments across the study area. Although not all suite B lineaments correlate to mapped structures, our analysis demonstrates that high-resolution LiDAR altimetry can be useful in mapping regional tectonic fabrics in glaciated terrane. In Chapter two I present a detailed kinematic study of seven Neoarchean L-S tectonite samples in order to determine vorticity and non-coaxial shear direction relative to foliation and elongation lineation. Samples are from L-S tectonites of the Wawa Subprovince, more specifically the Vermilion District of NE Minnesota, a NE-trending belt of greenschist grade supracrustal rocks and granitoid bodies. Supracrustal rocks host multiple L-S tectonite packages with a well-developed sub-vertical metamorphic foliation and elongation lineation; elongation lineation generally plunges steeply to obliquely although rare zones of shallow plunge occur locally. The Wawa Subprovince is widely interpreted as a transpressional margin with shear zones recording unidirectional dextral strike-slip, an interpretation held up as fundamental evidence for Archean plate-tectonic processes. However vorticity and shear direction within the Vermilion District L-S tectonites remain unconstrained. I compare data from thin-sections, x-ray computed tomography, and quartz crystallographic fabric analysis to monoclinic shear models to determine vorticity and better understand geometric relationships between vorticity, non-coaxial shear direction, foliation, and elongation lineation. Kinematic indicators in thin-section and image slices from X-ray computed tomography consistently record asymmetric microstructural fabrics in foliation-normal lineation-parallel planes, whereas planes normal to foliation and elongation lineation display dominantly symmetric microstructural <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Mantled</b> porphyroclast 3 D-shapes and star-volume distribution analyses indicate that porphyroclast short-axes are normal to foliation and long-axes parallel elongation lineation. Quartz crystallographic preferred orientation data show a-axes maxima sub-parallel to foliation-normal lineation-parallel planes. Kinematic data are consistent with a vorticity axis within the foliation plane and normal to elongation lineation; thus non-coaxial shear direction is sub-parallel to elongation lineation. Data are inconsistent with shear models in which non-coaxial shear direction is normal to lineation, or vorticity axis is normal to foliation. Data indicate that tectonites record non-coaxial shear broadly parallel to elongation lineation regardless of lineation geographic orientation. In Chapter three I present a detailed structural and kinematic study of the eastern Shagawa Lake shear zone. A subvertical metamorphic foliation strikes NE; elongation lineation forms a splayed orientation distribution; however 70 % of elongation lineations pitch &# 8805; 60 ° to the NE or SW. Strike-parallel elongation lineations occur within localized zones. Non-coaxial shear direction is sub-parallel to elongation lineation. Kinematic indicators record N-side-up and S-side-up shear, and local strike-slip shear [...] with both right-lateral and left-lateral shear sense recorded. Elongation lineation and kinematic indicators appear consistent within individual outcrops, but can vary significantly between outcrops. I recognize no strain partitioning, crosscutting relationships between multiple shear events, or metamorphic overprinting within the study area. L-S tectonites record roughly isobaric/isothermal greenschist facies metamorphic conditions across the Shagawa Lake shear zone. The Shagawa Lake shear zone records a broad deformation event characterized by dominantly dip-slip shear in varying directions with multiple shear-senses. Structural and kinematic data indicate that the Shagawa Lake shear zone records deformation within a rheologically weak crust. These data are inconsistent with existing sagduction-diapirism/crustal overturn models and with plate-tectonic/terrane accretion scenarios for assembly of the southern Superior Province. Channel flow induced collapse and exhumation of high-grade crustal material during regional shortening provides a plausible mechanism for assembly of the southern Superior Province and is consistent with the rheological implications of this study...|$|R

The line crossed the North Pyrenean Fault (NPF), which probably represents the plate boundary between the European and the Iberian plates. We observed large delay times δt (1. 3 to 1. 5 s) and uniform fast polarization directions ϕ (N 100 E) at three stations located on the Iberian plate. On the other hand, δt are smaller (0. 5 – 1. 0 s) and the ϕ scattered at stations located north of the NPF. The small scale variability, the relation with surface geology and the correlation of the δt with lithospheric thickness suggest that the anisotropy could be predominantly of lithospheric origin. However, an asthenospheric contribution cannot be ruled out. In the North Pyrenean Zone, an important thermal event before the Pyrenean compression has likely erased the former <b>mantle</b> <b>fabric.</b> The observed anisotropy is then likely related to the Pyrenean orogeny.
