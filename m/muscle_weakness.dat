5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> {{caused by}} the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{isolated}} acute sensory loss can {{be regarded}} as a form of Guillain–Barré syndrome is a matter of dispute; this is a rare occurrence compared to GBS with <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> but no sensory symptoms.|$|E

50|$|The nicotinic {{effects are}} those that are related to the {{acetylcholine}} receptors in the nervous system. These effects contain fasciulation (uncontrollable twitches) of the <b>muscles,</b> <b>weakness</b> and paralysis.|$|R
30|$|Safety {{outcomes}} included occurrence up to 90  days of superinfection, new sepsis, new septic shock, {{gastrointestinal bleeding}} and neurological sequalae (cognitive impairment and <b>muscles</b> <b>weakness)</b> at ICU and hospital discharge, at day 90 and at day 180.|$|R
5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{assessing}} nerve conduction {{of electrical}} impulses can exclude other causes of acute <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> {{as well as}} distinguish {{the different types of}} Guillain–Barré syndrome. Needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies may be performed. In the first two weeks, these investigations may not show any abnormality. Neurophysiology studies are not required for the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia, a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, {{can be fatal}} if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (diuresis). Deficiency symptoms include <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{deficiency}} of copper in pregnant mothers {{increases the risk}} of health problems in their fetuses and infants. Health effects noted include low birth weights, <b>muscle</b> <b>weaknesses,</b> and neurologic problems. However, copper deficiencies in pregnant women can be avoided with a balanced diet.|$|R

Girls did not meet standards and less than half of them (on average 51.2  %) achieved an acceptable level of upper body strength and endurance. Progressive <b>muscle</b> <b>weaknesses</b> in upper body may reflect in health quality and cause several muscle imbalances and disorders like upper crossed syndrome.|$|R
5|$|The first {{successful}} {{removal of the}} parathyroid may {{have been carried out}} in 1928 by medical doctor Isaac Y Olch, whose intern had noticed elevated calcium levels in an elderly patient with <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness.</b> Prior to this surgery, patients with removed parathyroid glands typically died from muscular tetani.|$|E
5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, sleepiness, <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness.</b> This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
40|$|The present paper aims {{to report}} cases of equine {{motor neuron disease}} in {{different}} breeds and ages. The main clinical signs were progressive weight loss, <b>muscle</b> atrophy, generalized <b>weakness,</b> <b>muscle</b> fasciculation and trembling, frequent shifting of support hindlimbs, feet under body, excessive recumbency and death. Clinical diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological studies of the spinal cord, which revealed degeneration and loss of neurons in the ventral horn, particularly cervical and lumbar intumescence. Muscle biopsy revealed neuromuscular disorders with denervation atrophy. The progressive <b>muscle</b> atrophy, <b>weakness</b> and motor neuron degeneration {{are similar to those}} in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, as described in human beings...|$|R

5|$|There may be {{symptoms}} of thyroid overactivity, such as weight loss, a fast heart rate, tremor, and perspiration; but such symptoms occur in {{only half of}} all cases. The {{most common type of}} hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease, may additionally cause eye problems (Graves' ophthalmopathy) and skin changes of the legs (pretibial myxedema). Thyroid disease may also cause <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> in the form of thyrotoxic myopathy, but this is constant rather than episodic.|$|E
5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring attacks of <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> {{in the presence of}} hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland). Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.|$|E
5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E

50|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} is a {{long term}} genetic disorder that affects muscle function. Symptoms include gradually worsening <b>muscle</b> loss and <b>weakness.</b> <b>Muscles</b> often contract and are unable to relax. Other symptoms may include cataracts, intellectual disability, and heart conduction problems. In men there may be early balding and an inability to have children.|$|R
40|$|Morvan {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autoimmune disease named after the French physician Augustin Marie Morvan. It is characterized by multiple, irregular contractions of the long <b>muscles,</b> <b>weakness,</b> pruritus, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, and delirium. Here, we describe a 17 -year-old young man, previously diagnosed with B-cell lymphoma, who presented with multiple asynchronous fasciculations of the long muscles of his lower extremities accompanied by numbness. The patient responded initially to pulse corticosteroids with diminution of the fasciculations. He achieved complete remission following 7 consecutive, monthly intravenous immunoglobulin injections. The present case is described {{in the context of}} the available literature...|$|R
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (<b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness</b> of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E

30|$|Rhabdomyolysis is {{a severe}} {{syndrome}} {{characterized by the}} destruction of the skeletal muscle cells, leading to the leakage of muscle components into the blood vascular system [3]. Its symptoms depend on the severity of kidney failure, which may include <b>muscle</b> pain, <b>weakness,</b> vomiting, and confusion. When the condition of rhabdomyolysis is mild, muscle symptoms may not be detected, and abnormal blood tests in the context of other problems might be used for the diagnosis. A more severe form is characterized by <b>muscle</b> pain, tenderness, <b>weakness,</b> and swelling of the affected muscles [3 – 7].|$|R

5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
5|$|The {{autonomic}} or involuntary nervous system, {{which is}} involved in the control of body functions such as heart rate and blood pressure, is affected in two thirds of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome, but the impact is variable. Twenty percent may experience severe blood-pressure fluctuations and irregularities in the heart beat, sometimes {{to the point that the}} heart beat stops and requiring pacemaker-based treatment. Other associated problems are abnormalities in perspiration and changes in the reactivity of the pupils. Autonomic nervous system involvement can affect even those who do not have severe <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to {{some people}} who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>weakness,</b> and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E
40|$|Electromyostimulation (EMS) {{therapy is}} widely used {{as a part of}} {{physiotherapy}} for all patterns of skeletal <b>muscle</b> <b>weaknesses</b> like paresis, paralysis, neuropathies, and myopathies. To our knowledge, burns caused by the use of an electrotherapy device have not been reported earlier. We report the case of a 21 -yearold man who suffered full thickness burns by electrical stimulation with electrode implanted on the anterior side of his left thigh. The burn area was treated consevatively within five weeks without any surgery. The burn injuries due to electrotherapy device are preventable and therefore, some basic measures may reduce the incidence of accidental burn injury. We hope that this case report will raise awareness about the dangers involved in the ever-increasing use of electrotherapy devices...|$|R
