In {{the early days}} of the conflict the trail was used strictly for the infiltration of manpower. This was due to the fact that Hanoi could supply its southern allies much <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> by sea.|$|E

5|$|The public roads {{from the}} Indianapolis corner to the Porsche Curves were re-surfaced. Run-off areas at the Dunlop Chicane, Tertre Rouge, Indianapolis, and Ford Chicanes were also {{partially}} asphalted {{in order to}} avoid gravel being brought back onto the circuit by cars which had gone off course. This also increased safety by allowing the cars to slow themselves <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> using their brakes and tyres on tarmac.|$|E

5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, especially in the transport sector. Using transportation fuels <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E
5|$|Dark Forces was ported from DOS to Apple Macintosh. This {{presented}} several {{challenges for}} the developers. LucasArts requested the game to be produced for both DOS and Macintosh with the same system requirements, specifically the random-access memory (RAM). The Mac OS runs a graphical user interface which uses up RAM while DOS does not, meaning the Macintosh version has less RAM available for Dark Forces to use. Aaron Giles, who was the Macintosh programmer for Dark Forces, explained that to resolve this problem the memory had to be managed <b>more</b> <b>efficiently.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite these grand designs Domitian was {{determined}} to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. According to Suetonius, the imperial bureaucracy never ran <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among provincial governors and elected officials.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian {{vultures}} roost communally {{on large}} trees, buildings or on cliffs. Roost sites are usually chosen {{close to a}} dump site or other suitable foraging area. In Spain and Morocco, summer roosts are formed mainly by immature birds. The favourite roost trees tended to be large dead pines. The number of adults at the roost increases towards June. It is thought that breeding adults {{may be able to}} forage <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> by joining the roost and following others to the best feeding areas. Breeding birds that failed to raise young may also join the non-breeding birds at the roost during June.|$|E
5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to gaining levels, Guardian Forces earn Ability Points (AP) after battles, which are automatically allocated to special abilities that Guardian Forces can learn. When a Guardian Force has learned an ability, that ability becomes available for any character or the character party, {{as is the}} case with field abilities. These abilities allow characters to attack <b>more</b> <b>efficiently,</b> refine magic spells from items, receive stat bonuses upon leveling up, access shops remotely and use additional battle commands.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E
5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E
5|$|Once war was declared, Voorhis {{supported}} the internment of Japanese-Americans, though {{he suggested that}} the evacuations be done in as voluntary a manner as possible and that officials be appointed to administer their property to avoid forced sales at bargain prices. During the war, Voorhis advocated <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> taxing higher incomes and war profits, planning against postwar unemployment, and planning for the nutritional needs of Americans. Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E

5|$|Relief {{efforts were}} {{initiated}} by Japanese and American governments immediately following Typhoon Vera. Due to the inundation {{caused by the}} typhoon, localized epidemics were reported, including those of dysentery and tetanus. The spread of disease and blocking debris slowed the ongoing relief efforts. Due to the unprecedented damage and loss of life following Vera, the National Diet passed legislation in order to <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> assist affected regions and mitigate future disasters. This included {{the passage of the}} Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act in 1961, which set standards for Japanese disaster relief, including the establishment of the Central Disaster Prevention Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of a three-field rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The {{development of}} the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed <b>more</b> <b>efficiently,</b> aided by {{the spread of the}} horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate <b>more</b> <b>efficiently</b> (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Publish/subscribe systems {{allow for}} an {{efficient}} filtering of incoming information. This filtering {{is based on}} the specifications of subscriber interests, which are registered with the system as subscriptions. Publishers conversely spec-ify advertisements, describing the messages they will send later on. What is miss-ing so far is the support of arbitrary Boolean advertisements in publish/subscribe systems. Introducing the opportunity to specify these richer Boolean advertise-ments increases the accuracy of publishers to state their future messages com-pared to currently supported conjunctive advertisements. Thus, the amount of subscriptions forwarded in the network is reduced. Additionally, the system can <b>more</b> time <b>efficiently</b> decide whether a subscription needs to be forwarded and <b>more</b> space <b>efficiently</b> store and index advertisements. In this paper, we introduce a publish/subscribe system that supports arbitrary Boolean advertisements and, symmetrically, arbitrary Boolean subscriptions. We show the advantages of supporting arbitrary Boolean advertisements and present an algorithm to calculate the practically required overlapping relationship amon...|$|R
