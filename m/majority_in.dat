5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the state Senate and a 61–39 <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the House. The pro-Relief <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the state Senate {{subsequently}} elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, which had the inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, {{economic}} prosperity {{was beginning to}} return to the state. The Old Court party augmented their <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the House and gained a <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E
