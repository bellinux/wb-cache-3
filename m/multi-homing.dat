50|$|The current Internet {{architecture}} has {{an incomplete}} naming and addressing schema, which {{the reason why}} mobility and <b>multi-homing</b> require ad-hoc solutions and protocols tailored to different operational environments. The only names provided are Point of Attachment (PoA) names (IP addresses), which are usually confused to be node names. The {{result is that the}} network has no way to understand that the two or more IP addresses of a multi-homed node belong to the same node, making <b>multi-homing</b> hard. The same choice, naming the interface and not the node, forces the Internet to perform routing on the interface level instead of the node level, resulting in having much bigger routing tables than they really need to be. Mobility, which can be seen as dynamic <b>multi-homing,</b> is the next feature that suffers from having an incomplete naming schema.|$|E
5000|$|Since IPv6 didn't {{solve the}} <b>multi-homing</b> problem and naming the node was not accepted, the major theory {{pursued by the}} field is that the IP address {{semantics}} are overloaded with both identity and location information, and therefore {{the solution is to}} separate the two, leading to the work on Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP). However all approaches based on LISP have scaling problems [...] because i) it is based on a false distinction (identity vs. location) and ii) it is not routing packets to the end destination (LISP is using the locator for routing, which is an interface address; therefore the <b>multi-homing</b> problem is still there).|$|E

5000|$|This repeating {{structure}} scales indefinitely, thus it avoids {{current problems}} of growing routing tables, and supports {{features such as}} <b>multi-homing</b> and mobility, {{with little or no}} cost.

5000|$|... 1992. Second {{opportunity}} to fix addressing missed. In 1992 the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) produced {{a series of}} recommendations to resolve the scaling problems of the IPv4-based Internet: address space consumption and routing information explosion. Three types of solutions were proposed: introduce Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) to mitigate the problem, design the next version of IP (IPv7) based on CLNP (ConnectionLess Network Protocol) and continue the research into naming, addressing and routing. CLNP was an OSI-based protocol that addressed nodes instead of interfaces, solving the old <b>multi-homing</b> problem introduced by the ARPANET, and allowing for better routing information aggregation. CIDR was introduced but the IETF didn't accept an IPv7 based on CLNP. IAB reconsidered its decision and the IPng process started, culminating with IPv6. One of the rules for IPng was not to change the semantics of the IP address, which continues to name the interface, perpetuating the <b>multi-homing</b> problem.|$|E
5000|$|The {{network has}} no notion of {{application}} names, {{and has to}} {{use a combination of}} the interface address and transport layer port number to identify different applications. In other words, the network uses information on where an application is located to identify which application this is. Every time the application changes its point of attachment, it seems different to the network, greatly complicating <b>multi-homing,</b> mobility, and security.|$|E
5000|$|... 1972. <b>Multi-homing</b> not {{supported}} by the ARPANET. In 1972 the Tinker Air Force Base wanted connections to two different IMPs (Interface Message Processors, the predecessors of today's routers) for redundancy. ARPANET designers realized that they couldn't support this feature because host addresses were the addresses of the IMP port number the host was connected to (borrowing from telephony). To the ARPANET, two interfaces of the same host had different addresses, therefore it {{had no way of knowing}} that they belong to the same host. The solution was obvious: as in operating systems, a logical address space naming the nodes (hosts and routers) was required on top of the physical interface address space. However, the implementation of this solution was left for future work, and it is still not done today: “IP addresses of all types are assigned to interfaces, not to nodes”. As a consequence, routing table sizes are orders of magnitude bigger than they would need to be, and <b>multi-homing</b> and mobility are complex to achieve, requiring both special protocols and point solutions.|$|E
50|$|Attracted by the {{prospects}} of large margins, platforms can try to compete to be the winner-take-all in two-sided markets with strong network effects. That means that one platform serves the mature networked market. Examples of the standards battles include VHS vs Betamax, Microsoft vs Netscape and the DVD market.Not all two-sided markets with strong positive network effects are optimially supplied by a single platform. Markets must have high <b>multi-homing</b> costs and similar consumers' needs.|$|E

50|$|The Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (RINA) is a {{computer}} network architecture that unifies distributed computing and telecommunications. RINA's fundamental principle is that computer networking is just Inter-Process Communication or IPC. RINA reconstructs the overall structure of the Internet, forming a model that comprises a single repeating layer, the DIF (Distributed IPC Facility), which is the minimal set of components required to allow distributed IPC between application processes. RINA inherently supports mobility, <b>multi-homing</b> and Quality of Service {{without the need for}} extra mechanisms, provides a secure and programmable environment, motivates for a more competitive marketplace, and allows for a seamless adoption.|$|E
50|$|With this naming structure, {{support for}} {{mobility}} and <b>multi-homing</b> is inherent, if the properties for {{the names are}} chosen with care: application names are location-independent to allow an application to move around, node addresses are location-dependent but route-independent. PoA addresses are by nature route-dependent. Applying this naming scheme to RINA, with recursive layers, an interesting observation can be made: mapping application names to node addresses is the same mapping than mapping node addresses to PoAs. In other words, for any layer N, nodes at the layer N+1 are applications and nodes at the layer N-1 are points of attachment, making this relationship relative.|$|E
50|$|Provider Independent Address Space (PI) is {{available}} in IPv6. This technique {{has the advantage of}} working like IPv4, supporting traffic balancing across multiple providers, and maintaining existing TCP and UDP sessions through cut-overs. Critics say that the increased size of routing tables needed to handle <b>multi-homing</b> in this way will overwhelm current router hardware. Proponents say that new hardware will be able to handle the increase due to cheaper memory, which drops in price according to Moore's law. Proponents also say this is the only viable solution right now, and the worse is better philosophy supports the idea that it is better to deploy an imperfect solution now than a perfect solution after it is too late.|$|E
50|$|Saltzer {{took his}} model from {{operating}} systems, {{but it was}} not completely correct for internetworks, since there may be more than one path between the same pair of nodes (even whole networks!). The obvious solution is that routes are sequences of nodes, and at each hop each node chooses the most appropriate PoA (path) to forward the packet to the next node. Therefore, routing is a two-step process: First the route as a sequence of node addresses is calculated, and then, for each hop, an appropriate PoA to select the specific path to be traversed is chosen. These are the steps to generate the forwarding table, forwarding is still performed with a single lookup. Moreover, the last step can be performed more frequently in order to exploit <b>multi-homing</b> for load-balancing.|$|E
5000|$|... 1983. First {{opportunity}} to fix addressing missed. The need for application names and distributed directories that mapped application names to internetwork addresses was well understood since mid-1970s. They {{were not there}} at the beginning {{since it was a}} major effort and there were very few applications, but they were expected to be introduced once the “host file” was automated (the host file was centrally maintained and mapped human-readable synonyms of addresses to its numeric value). However, application names were not introduced and DNS, the Domain Name System, was designed and deployed, continuing to use well-known ports to identify applications. The advent of the web and HTTP caused the need for application names, introducing URLs. However the URL format ties each application instance to a physical interface of a computer and a specific transport connection (since the URL contains the DNS name of an IP interface and TCP port number), making <b>multi-homing</b> and mobility very hard to achieve.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of <b>multi-homing</b> {{consumers}} on content provision by media firms. We develop a model where media firms compete on content provision and advertising revenues, and consumers enjoy network effects from consuming content that other consumers also consume. Media firms have to choose if they are single-content or multi-content, and {{in the latter case}} how much content to offer. Competition for advertising revenues gives a two-sided market nature to our model, since advertisers prefer media firms with more demand. As such, media firms would like to increase demand to increase advertising revenues. Offering more content increases demand because more consumers can consume their ideal variety without paying transport costs. We show that, relatively to the case with single-homing consumers, media firms provide less content with <b>multi-homing</b> consumers. The reason is that with <b>multi-homing</b> consumers, competition between media firms is weakened. <b>Multi-homing</b> consumers consume from all media firms, and therefore media firms have lower incentives to provide content to attract demand, and advertising revenues. As a result, social welfare tends to be higher under the <b>multi-homing</b> case relatively to the single-homing case, when the advertising market is large, and when the network effects are large relative to the intensity of consumers’ preferences...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{designing}} the Stream Control Protocol (SCTP) was tooffer a robust transfer of traffic between the hosts over the networks. For this reasonSCTP <b>multi-homing</b> feature was designed, in which an SCTP sender can access destinationhost with multiple IP addresses in the same session. If the primary path between the sourceand the destination is down, the traffic may still {{be sent to the}} destination by utilizingredundant path.
