40|$|<b>Multimodal</b> {{transportation}} means <b>transporting</b> goods from a pickup point, where the operator receives the goods, {{all the way}} to the delivery location, using at least two different means of transportation, covered under the same <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> contract and by only one document, regardless of the number or type of transportation vehicles used. The key factor to the optimal operation of multimodal transportation is the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operator. It is up to this individual to compensate for various unpredictable circumstances, the complexity of the business processes, nature’s whims and carelessness. He must also organize and execute <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> in all stages. Due to the above mentioned dangers and the fact that the area of liability insurance for <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operators is still being neglected, this article raises some valid points in favour of a proposal that would cover all of the {{transportation means}} as well as all the accompanying activities with a single insurance policy. The model includes 17 elements of liability insurance for a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operator and all values which quantify the insurance elements in 2009 as well as the projected values for 2015, when progress is expected in the areas pertaining to the implementation of economical processes concerning transit development, as well as values for 2025, representing a period of innovation, reconstruction, optimization and modernization. With this supposed model for liability insurance of a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operator, the foundation is laid for a liability insurance which would be used by a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operator.

40|$|<b>Multimodal</b> <b>{{transport}},</b> that {{is using}} {{two or more}} transport modes for a trip between which a transfer is necessary, seems an interesting approach to solving today's transportation problems {{with respect to the}} deteriorating accessibility of city centres, recurrent congestion, and environmental impact. Combining private transport and public transport in a truly <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system offers opportunities to capitalise on the strengths of the various systems while avoiding their weaknesses. The requirements for such a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, however, are high. Travellers have {{to be aware of the}} possibilities to change modes and the related benefit. Thus high quality travel information is crucial. Transfers between transport modes and services should be seamless, setting new standards for the design of transfer nodes and for the synchronisation of time-tabled <b>transport</b> services. <b>Multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> requires new organisational and financial arrangements between all actors involved. The most fundamental component of a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, however, is the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> network that consists of networks for private transport, public transport, and other transport services that are part of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, including of course the transfer possibilities between these networks. This thesis investigates the consequences of multimodal travelling for designing <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> networks. It describes the characteristics of multimodal travel today and assesses its future potential. The analysis focuses on the way transport networks are organised in hierarchical network structures and determines the main mechanisms leading to these hierarchical network structures. Furthermore, an analysis is made of the role in a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system of transport services other than private transport or public transport. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms determining hierarchical transport network structures. They show the potential impact of <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> especially on the capacity requirements for public transport, and they show the possible roles of the various transport services that may be part of a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system.

As {{bridges and}} ties that {{interlink}} the system elements in modern military logistics, military transportation directly determines the orientation, flow rate and throughput of military supplies. The application of <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> in military transportation will significantly improve the transportation performance, optimize the transportation structure {{and promote the}} reasonableness and cost efficiency in transportation. This paper carries out a SWOT(Superiority Weakness Opportunity Threats) analysis on development of <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> in Chinese military transportation, builds the information flow and supply management mode for <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> in military transportation, and proposes the requirements by <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> on support capacity of transportation equipments. General <b>Multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> came into being in the United States in the 1960 s.

40|$|Each mode of {{transport}} has their limitation but <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> which combines various transport modes is an alternative solution to breakthrough such limitation by way of synergy. To achieve such synergy, containerization and electronic commerce are, inter alia, the two indispensible factors for the rapid development of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> In the modern supply chain operation, containerization facilitates the interchange of goods among different transport modes whereas electronic commerce expedites the documentation flow in a more efficient and secured manners. As a result, <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> has become more efficient than ever so as to create a room for lower transportation cost and shorter travelling time. Nevertheless, {{it is observed that}} the prevailing liability system of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport,</b> in which, not a single and uniform convention for the international <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> has been in place, is unable {{to keep pace with the}} astonishing growth of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> This results in unpredictability and uncertainty as to the obligation and liability of all the parties including shippers, <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operators, carriers and insurance companies. This paper discusses the effectiveness of the Rotterdam Rules which is a maritime-plus convention in <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> to which many attempts such as the <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> Convention 1980 and the UNCTAD/ICC Rules have been taken. To evaluate such effectiveness, a comparative study has been adopted that incorporates three aspects, namely the horizontal comparison with the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules, the vertical comparison with the <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> Convention 1980 and the UNCTAD/ ICC Rules and the harmonization comparison with the multimodal aspects of other unimodal conventions. Regarding the first two horizontal and vertical comparisons, they are made on the basis of five multimodal parameters including door-to-door delivery, intermodality, just-in-time delivery, containerization and electronic commerce. Furthermore, a common law case “Quantum Corp Inc and others v Plane Trucking Ltd and another” is selected for the case study on how well the Rotterdam Rules tackled the typical issues of unspecific or optional carriage contracts in the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> if they were put in the real operation. The results show that the “Outward Approach” adopted in the Rotterdam Rules is a feasible alternative different from the traditional “Inward Approach” to regulate the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> Besides, in view of the recourse action for unlocalized damages, the use of maritime-basis liability amount is seen as the fair balance of interest and risk among the stakeholders. In the comparative and case studies, it is found that the general results are Expand, Possess, Harmonize and Apply (EPHA) in the respective areas of the comparisons and case analysis. On the whole, the Rotterdam Rules are viewed as an effective convention in <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport.</b> published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|R

40|$|International <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> {{continues}} to grow exponentially, while the relevant international legal framework becomes increasingly fragmented and complex. The establishment of a widely acceptable uniform international legal framework for <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> contracts {{has proven to be}} extremely difficult, in spite of the various attempts initiated by some international organizations. Owing to the increasing use of containers to consolidate cargo, <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> practice has become inevitable in the field of international trade based on its numerous advantages over the traditional unimodal carriage practices. Therefore, the urgent need of an internationally legal instrument to govern liability issues arising from multimodal carriage transactions is highly requested by trading parties. This research, however, present the difficulties involve when trying to establish liability issues arising from multimodal carriage claims and the impact it has on contracting parties who are never certain on which regime their contracts are based, instead depends on already existing unimodal liability regimes to sort out their disputes. The strengths and weaknesses of the two most recent attempts at producing a uniform legal regime for <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> namely: The United Nations Convention on International <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> of Goods 1980 (The UN Convention of 1980) and The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (The Rotterdam Rules) are also examined in this research as none of these attempts appears to be a tenable solution. However, {{in the absence of a}} truly accepted international uniform legal regime for <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> contracts, some nations, regional and sub-regional laws and regulations on <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> contracts have been initiated. Despite the recognition of the Rotterdam Rules in certain jurisdictions, it will probably fail to achieve the aim of uniformity as intended because it’s merely a “maritime-plus” Convention.

The complexity of <b>multimodal</b> (passenger) <b>transport</b> systems and the involvement of many organizations with their own interests and priorities make it difficult to design a transport system that produces competitive chain mobility services. A design approach for improving <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> systems from a chain perspective is developed in this research. It appeared that 'chain thinking' is not foremost in the thoughts of organizations when working on improving <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> systems. In practice more obstacles than opportunities are seen. The design approach takes a chain perspective as an 'a priori' and aims to communicate, promote and stimulate chain thinking. For this purpose a set of object-oriented chain modelling concepts is developed and design guidelines are formulated. The chain modelling concepts and the design guidelines support describing, visualizing and understanding <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> systems from a chain perspective. Elements and notions from a process-oriented approach to design and manage decision making processes in networks of actors have been adopted in order to deal with the inter-organizational context in which designing <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> takes place.
