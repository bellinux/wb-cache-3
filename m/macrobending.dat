40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a pose-sensing system for soft robot arms integrating {{a set of}} <b>macrobend</b> stretch sensors. The <b>macrobend</b> sensory design in this study consists of optical fibres {{and is based on}} the notion that bending an optical fibre modulates the intensity of the light transmitted through the fibre. This sensing method is capable of measuring bending, elongation and compression in soft continuum robots and is also applicable to wearable sensing technologies, e. g. pose sensing in the wrist joint of a human hand. In our arrangement, applied to a cylindrical soft robot arm, the optical fibres for <b>macrobend</b> sensing originate from the base, extend to the tip of the arm, and then loop back to the base. The connectors that link the fibres to the necessary opto-electronics are all placed {{at the base of the}} arm, resulting in a simplified overall design. The ability of this custom <b>macrobend</b> stretch sensor to flexibly adapt its configuration allows preserving the inherent softness and compliance of the robot which it is installed on. The <b>macrobend</b> sensing system is immune to electrical noise and magnetic fields, is safe (because no electricity is needed at the sensing site), and is suitable for modular implementation in multi-link soft continuum robotic arms. The measurable light outputs of the proposed stretch sensor vary due to bend-induced light attenuation (<b>macrobend</b> loss), which is a function of the fibre bend radius as well as the number of repeated turns. The experimental study conducted as part of this research revealed that the chosen bend radius has a far greater impact on the measured light intensity values than the number of turns (if greater than five). Taking into account that the bend radius is the only significantly influencing design parameter, the <b>macrobend</b> stretch sensors were developed to create a practical solution to the pose sensing in soft continuum robot arms. Henceforward, the proposed sensing design was benchmarked against an electromagnetic tracking system (NDI Aurora) for validation...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of macrobend losses in Single Mode Fibre (SMF) and Multimode Fibre (MMF) is presented. The increased demand on information has seen optical fibres slowly replacing {{the use of}} copper coaxial cables for signal transmission, and this, {{largely due to the}} high bandwidth and speed of transmission, large carrying capacity and security offered by optical fibres. Signal attenuation however remains a limitation to efficient and quality signal transmission and <b>macrobending</b> is one of the loss mechanisms that contributes to this signal attenuation. Appreciating the responses of the different optic fibres in use to <b>macrobending</b> is therefore instrumental in ensuring <b>macrobending</b> contribution to overall attenuation in optic fibres is minimum at all times. In this study the macrobend losses trends with bending diameter were investigated for the SMF and MMF in similar experimental setups. To do this improvisions were done for a light source using 555 timer astable multivibrator powering a green LED, a light detector using an LDR in a Wheatstone bridge circuit and optic fibres off-cuts. Optic power was measured at the input and output points of the optic fibres using the light detector in bend and straight conditions for determination of signal attenuation in each case. The experimental measurement results show that <b>macrobending</b> losses are more pronounced in a SMF than in a MMF. Characteristic values for <b>macrobending</b> loss are 1268 dB/km for SMF compared to 1155 dB/km for MMF for bending diameter value 4. 19 cm. In the SMF <b>macrobending</b> loss trend showed an exponential variation which agrees with work by previous authors. The contribution of <b>macrobending</b> loss in multimode fibre attenuation was however minimal and therefore difficult to quantify. Results also showed that MMF have a higher overall signal attenuation than SMF which justifies the use of SMF in long distance signal transmission. Research findings confirm the significant contribution of <b>macrobending</b> to optic fibre signal attenuation hence the need for careful iv consideration in installations for optimal operation of optic fibres. This would mean the choice of optic fibre in any particular instance should consider the high attenuation in MMF not neglecting the insignificant <b>macrobending</b> contribution of MMF to attenuation at any preferred wavelength in order to obtain required transmission characteristics.,University of Zimbabwe,DAAD and the Research Council of Zimbabw...|$|E

Investigations assume that a scissor blade can be approximated as a uniformly tapered cantilever beam. A replica of the scissor blade is produced and strain characterization {{has been carried out}} using an FBG sensor system. Results are validated against measurements obtained using conventional electrical resistance strain gauges. The scissor blade experiences both direct and lateral forces during cutting, hence the system is characterized for a direct load range of 0 - 30 N and a lateral load range of 0 - 10 N. The results show a very good linear response for direct loading and some sensitivity to lateral loading. An actual sensorized scissor blade prototype is also characterized and results compared with that of the replica blade. The FBG interrogation system used was a macro-bend fiber filter-based ratiometric system. The use of FBGs together with macro-bend fiber-based interrogation system eliminates the influence of temperature on the sensing system and hence temperature independent strain information from the blade is obtained.

40|$|Economic {{modeling}} {{of the business}} cases for FTTH has revealed that it is most cost ef-fective to concentrate initial deployments in densely populated areas. That fact, coupled {{with the realization that}} in such dense ar-eas the majority of subscribers live in mul-tiple dwelling units (MDUs), is driving a strong need for FTTH systems optimized for MDU installations. The shared experiences of many leading service providers around the world indi-cate that there are several common goals that must be attained to optimize FTTH deployments to MDUs: reduce up-front in-stallation costs; increase the speed of making a subscriber connection; reduce lifetime op-erating costs; and maximize the reach, split ratio, and subscriber penetration of the network. To achieve the first two goals, operators need hardware that increases the speed and ease of inside wiring installation and reduces labor and material costs as well as the number of loss-related rework events during cable instal-lation. In short, the FTTH industry needs op-tical cables that can be installed and handled in the same robust manner as copper cables. However, as shown in Fig. 1, optical ca-bles treated in this manner can be subjected to tight bends, compression points in con-gested ducts, and stapling.
