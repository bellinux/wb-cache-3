40|$|Pluripotent mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are {{considered}} ideal therapeutic targets in regenerative medicine, as they hold {{the capacity to}} differentiate into higher order connective tissues. The potential to harness MSCs for disease treatment and acceleration of repair will ultimately depend on an improved understanding of how physical and/or chemical signals regulate their activity, {{and the ability of}} exogenous stimuli to enhance MSC proliferation and define MSC fate. Recent appreciation that bone marrow osteoprogenitors are inversely proportional to adipocyte precursors suggests that their shared progenitor, the MSC, will commit to one lineage at the cost of the other. This interrelationship may contribute to the phenotype of sedentary subjects who have more fat and less bone, while conversely, to the outcome of exercise being less fat and more bone. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>biasing</b> of MSC lineage selection suggests that physical signals may influence the quantity of both fat and bone through developmental, as well as metabolic or adaptive pathways. Considered with the recent finding that low magnitude mechanical signals (LMMS) suppress the development of subcutaneous and visceral fat without elevating energy expenditure, this indicates that MSCs are ideally positioned as mechanosensitive elements central to musculoskeletal adaptation, but that the signals needn’t be large to be influential. The biasing of MSC differentiation b...|$|E
40|$|Smart hydrogels {{are three}} {{dimensional}} cross linked polymers which alter their properties in presence of external stimuli. One such property is reverse volumetric change, in which change in external stimuli causes the hydrogel to swell/shrink. The {{goal of this}} research is to develop highly sensitive biochemical sensors using smart hydrogels. This research takes advantage of the reverse swelling ability of hydrogels and the ability of diffraction gratings to detect nanoscale motion. Interferometric analysis of optical diffraction intensity produced by illuminating a laser beam on fabricated hydrogel gratings is used to calibrate the swelling/shrinking of hydrogel. In this study, a biasing technique which can further increase the sensitivity of the system as well as facilitate signal calibration is also introduced. ^ The second chapter describes the details of fabrication of the hydrogel diffraction gratings. Although pH sensitive hydrogel is used as an exemplary model, however, this concept is generic and can be applied to any other volumetric change hydrogels to detect stimuli other than pH. Theory of operation is mentioned in the third chapter. It also describes the experiment setup and introduces the design of the biasing system. The fourth chapter highlights the experimental results and minimum detection limit of around 1. 5 X 10 - 4 pH is observed. It is also observed that although the translation stage, optical components, electronics and fluidics contribute to the noise, hydrogel is major contributor to the noise in the results. It can also be observed that, since pH sensitive hydrogel is used and number of hydrogen ions in a solution is extremely high and hence the response is larger. But when this setup will be used with other hydrogels to detect far scarcer entities, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>biasing</b> will enhance the sensitivity further to detect low concentrations of these stimuli. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{exercise}} to decrease fat mass and increase bone mass may occur through <b>mechanical</b> <b>biasing</b> of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) away from adipogenesis and toward osteoblastogenesis. C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 MSCs cultured in highly adipogenic medium express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adiponectin mRNA and protein, and accumulate intracellular lipid. Mechanical strain applied for 6 h daily inhibited expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and adiponectin mRNA {{by up to}} 35 and 50 %, respectively, after 5 d. A decrease in active and total β-catenin levels during adipogenic differentiation was entirely prevented by daily application of mechanical strain; furthermore, strain induced β-catenin nuclear translocation. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β by lithium chloride or SB 415286 also prevented adipogenesis, suggesting that preservation of β-catenin levels was important to strain inhibition of adipogenesis. Indeed, mechanical strain inactivated glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β, which was preceded by Akt activation, indicating that strain transmits antiadipogenic signals through this pathway. Cells grown under adipogenic conditions showed no increase in osteogenic markers runt-related transcription factor (Runx) 2 and osterix (Osx); subsequent addition of bone morphogenetic protein 2 for 2 d increased Runx 2 but not Osx expression in unstrained cultures. When cultures were strained for 5 d before bone morphogenetic protein 2 addition, Runx 2 mRNA increased more than in unstrained cultures, and Osx expression more than doubled. As such, mechanical strain enhanced MSC potential to enter the osteoblast lineage despite exposure to adipogenic conditions. Our results indicate that MSC commitment to adipogenesis can be suppressed by mechanical signals, allowing other signals to promote osteoblastogenesis. These data suggest that positive effects of exercise on both fat and bone may occur during mesenchymal lineage selection...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{association}} with low bone density and skeletal fractures, marrow adipose tissue (MAT) remains poorly understood. The marrow adipocyte originates from the {{mesenchymal stem cell}} pool (MSC) that gives rise also to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and myocytes among other cell types. To date, the presence of MAT {{has been attributed to}} preferential biasing of MSC into the adipocyte rather than osteoblast lineage, thus negatively impacting bone formation. Here we focus on understanding the physiology of MAT in the setting of exercise, dietary interventions and pharmacologic agents that alter fat metabolism. The beneficial effect of exercise on musculoskeletal strength is known: exercise induces bone formation, encourages growth of skeletally-supportive tissues, inhibits bone resorption and alters skeletal architecture through direct and indirect effects on a multiplicity of cells involved in skeletal adaptation. MAT is less well studied {{due to the lack of}} reproducible quantification techniques. In recent work, osmium-based 3 D quantification shows a robust response of MAT to both dietary and exercise intervention in that MAT is elevated in response to high fat diet and can be suppressed following daily exercise. Exercise-induced bone formation correlates with suppression of MAT, such that exercise effects might be due to either calorie expenditure from this depot, or from <b>mechanical</b> <b>biasing</b> of MSC lineage away from fat and toward bone, or a combination thereof. Following treatment with the anti-diabetes drug rosiglitazone - a PPARγ-agonist known to increase MAT and fracture risk - mice demonstrate a 5 -fold higher femur MAT volume compared to the controls. In addition to preventing MAT accumulation in control mice, exercise intervention significantly lowers MAT accumulation in rosiglitazone-treated mice. Importantly, exercise induction of trabecular bone volume is unhindered by rosiglitazone. Thus, despite rosiglitazone augmentation of MAT, exercise significantly suppresses MAT volume and induces bone formation. That exercise can both suppress MAT volume and increase bone quantity, notwithstanding the skeletal harm induced by rosiglitazone, underscores exercise as a powerful regulator of bone remodeling, encouraging marrow stem cells toward the osteogenic lineage to fulfill an adaptive need for bone formation. Thus, exercise represents an effective strategy to mitigate the deleterious effects of overeating and iatrogenic etiologies...|$|E

I show that existing treatments of this bias are inadequate and underestimate peer effects.

Effort and behavior may account for part of this large peer effect: the presence of high achieving peers lowers absence rates and the incidence of discipline violations.

Observing the acquired measurement data with high-precision devices - such as laser-based instruments - {{it is not surprising}} that the error data follows patterns or have a structure because, in many cases, the greatest error comes from a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bias</b> introduced by manufacturing issues.

40|$|In this work, novel {{experimental}} setups {{were developed}} that {{are capable of}} automatically and simultaneously measuring the small signal piezoelectric and dielectric properties of ferroelectrics as a function of frequency, temperature, and compressive uniaxial mechanical stress. In addition, ferroelectric and ferroelastic experiments served to characterize the large-signal properties of ferroelectric materials. The phase transition behavior of single crystal and polycrystalline BaTiO 3 was investigated between - 150 °C and 250 °C as a function of uniaxial <b>mechanical</b> <b>bias</b> stresses up to - 30 MPa (single crystal BaTiO 3) and - 500 MPa (polycrystalline BaTiO 3). An increase of the Curie point and a decrease of the Curie-Weiss temperature with increasing mechanical stress were revealed by the experiments. These observations lead to the conclusion that a mechanical load results in an increase in the first order nature of the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition in BaTiO 3. By introducing stress-dependent coefficients in the phenomenological LGD theory, a prediction of this change {{in the nature of the}} phase transition as well as a qualitative reproduction of the stress-induced shift of the Curie point was achieved. The low-temperature phase transitions could be correlated with anomalies in the temperature-dependent ferroelastic properties of BaTiO 3. Ferroelectrically soft and hard commercial lead-containing PZT compositions were investigated with regards to their stress- and temperature-induced depolarization and phase transition behavior up to a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bias</b> stress of - 300 MPa between room temperature and 350 °C (soft PZT) or 450 °C (hard PZT). The hard PZT showed higher resistance against stress-induced and thermal depolarization due to the pinning of domain walls by polar defects, but with the drawback of lower piezoelectric properties if compared to soft PZT. With increasing mechanical stress, the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of both materials was found to increase. Stress-dependent measurements of the piezoelectric coefficient up to - 400 MPa performed on slow cooled and air quenched samples indicated that the polar defects in the hard PZT could be realigned by a compressive uniaxial mechanical stress. In addition, temperature- and stress-dependent measurements of the piezoelectric properties of PIN-PMN-PT single crystals revealed a stabilization of the high-temperature tetragonal phase, experimentally observed by a decreasing rhombohedral-tetragonal phase transition temperature. Lead-free materials based on the NBTxBT system are of current interest for replacing lead-containing materials in electronic devices. In this work, the piezoelectric and dielectric properties NBT- 3 BT, NBT- 6 BT, NBT- 9 BT, and NBT- 12 BT were characterized as a function of temperature (up to 400 °C) and uniaxial mechanical compression (up to - 300 MPa).

The MPB materials NBT- 6 BT and NBT- 9 BT possessed mixed rhombohedral and tetragonal phases after electrical poling and showed the highest stress sensitivity. NBT- 6 BT was investigated in more detail and a stress-induced phase transition from an initially relaxor to a ferroelectric phase was observed.

We offer a theoretical reconstruction of the geometrically regular structure of the blastula resulting from the sequential subdivision of the egg, followed by mechanical deformations of the blastula in subsequent stages of gastrulation. We suggest that the formation of the vertebrate bauplan during development, as well as fixation of its variants over the course of evolution, have been constrained and guided by global <b>mechanical</b> <b>biases.</b> Arguably, the role of such biases in directing morphology—though all but neglected in previous accounts of both development and macroevolution—is critical to any substantive explanation for the origin of the archetypal vertebrate bauplan. We surmise that the blastula inherently preserves the underlying geometry of the cuboidal array of eight cells produced by the first three cleavages that ultimately define the medial-lateral, dorsal-ventral, and anterior-posterior axes of the future body plan. Through graphical depictions, we demonstrate the formation of principal structures of the vertebrate body via mechanical deformation of predictable geometrical patterns during gastrulation.

For many applications, these resonators are influenced by <b>biasing</b> fields, with <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>biasing</b> fields {{among the most important}} ones. The reason the character of a resonator changes under a biasing field is primarily due to the inherent nonlinear material properties of the piezoelectric material. Among commonly used piezoelectric materials for resonators, langasite single crystals are very new and promising. They combine many of the advantages of quartz and lithium niobate—having high electromechanical coupling, as well as good frequency-temperature characteristics. Thus, langasite is a potential material to substitute for current applications dominated by quartz. ^ In this dissertation, the influence of <b>mechanical</b> and electrical <b>biasing</b> fields on resonators made of langasite is investigated systematically.

A new experimental method to determine the third-order elastic constants of langasite single crystals through the force-frequency effect is then discussed. Results from experimental measurements of the electroelastic effect for langasite resonators are also presented for several langasite resonator samples. The results of this research are expected to be fundamentally important to the piezoelectric resonator research community. ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryUnderstanding the {{proximate}} {{mechanisms of}} caste development in eusocial taxa can reveal how social species evolved from solitary ancestors [1]. In Polistes wasps, the current paradigm holds that differential amounts of nutrition during the larval stage cause the divergence of worker and gyne (potential queen) castes [2]. But nutrition level alone cannot {{explain how the}} first few females to be produced in a colony develop rapidly yet have small body sizes and worker phenotypes [3,  4].

The frequency of AD occurrence is high early in the colony cycle, when larvae destined to become workers are being reared, and low late in the cycle, when gynes are being reared [6]. Subjecting gyne-destined brood to simulated AD-frequency vibrations caused them to emerge as adults with reduced fat stores, a worker trait [7].

40|$|The {{upper part}} of the figure depicts an {{actuator}} that comprises two mechanically biased piezoelectric benders hinged together at their ends and equipped with tabs at their mid-length points for attachment to the relatively moving objects that are to be actuated. In the example of the figure, the attachment tabs are labeled to indicate that the actuator is used to drive a pump piston relative to a base plate. Actuators of this type could be used to drive low-power, small-volume pumps in consumer, medical, and aerospace applications, and to generate and measure linear displacements in such robotic applications as teleoperation and tactile feedback. Each bender is a bimorph a unitary plate that comprises an upper and a lower piezoelectric layer plus electrode layers. Benders may also be made of several layers arranged to produce the same effect at the lower operating voltages. As stated above, each bender is mechanically biased; it is fabricated to have a small permanent curvature (the bias curvature) in the absence of applied voltage. As on other bimorphs, the electrical connections on each bender are arranged so that an applied voltage of suitable polarity causes the upper layer to expand and the lower layer to contract. In this case, the net effect of applying the voltage is that the plate becomes more concave as viewed from below. Conversely, an applied voltage of the opposite polarity causes the plate to become less concave as viewed from below. The benders in a hinged pair are oriented with their bias curvatures concave inward, so that there is a bias distance between the attachment tabs. The two benders are connected electrically in parallel, with their connection polarities chosen so that an applied voltage of one polarity causes both benders to become more convex inward (more bent), while an applied voltage of the opposite polarity causes both benders to become less convex inward (less bent). An increase or decrease in bend is accompanied by an increase or decrease in distance between the attachment tabs; this increase or decrease is the linear displacement desired for actuation. Because the displacement can be either positive or negative relative to the bias distance, depending on the polarity of the applied voltage, the overall stroke achievable for a given magnitude of applied voltage is double the stroke achievable in the absence of <b>mechanical</b> <b>bias.</b> Each hinged pair can be regarded as a unit cell that can serve as a building block for a larger actuator: Multiple unit cells can be stacked (mechanically connected in series), as shown in {{the lower part of the}} figure, and electrically connected in parallel to multiply the overall stroke achievable at a given applied voltage...|$|R

The linear coefficients appearing in the equations are expressed analytically in terms of the thermodynamic parameters describing the magnetoelastic interaction of the underlying chiral magnet.

We also find that besides <b>mechanical</b> loads, <b>bias</b> magnetic field, spatially periodic magnetic field, spatially periodic mechanical loads, and emergent stresses can all lead to deformation of the skX. When homogeneous stresses are applied only, the emergent elastic strains are linearly related to the elastic strains through the emergent strain ratio matrix λ.

In particular, we find that all components of λ are sensitive to variation of magnetic field b, such that they change sign as b increases. Moreover, as b approaches the critical magnetic field of the skX-ferromagnetic phase transition, the dominant components of λ diverges.

40|$|Magnetostrictive {{actuators}} are {{the focus}} of many research and development activities, especially for high frequency applications. A key component of these actuators is the magnetic field driving system. In this research work, magnetic field drivers for magnetostrictive actuators are studied and a detailed methodology to build a low cost, power efficient, High Frequency High Amplitude (HFHA) magnetic field driver system is developed. The detailed study of magnetic field drivers suitable for magnetostrictive actuators revealed that the design of the driver must be done at a system level. Changes in geometry of the magnetostrictive material and the mechanical structure have significant effect on the efficiency of the driver. For the purposes of the research work, the magnetostrictive material was limited to two forms, viz. bulk rod and thin film. First, a suitable mechanical structure must be selected based on the amplitude and frequency requirements. For purposes of this work, a cantilever beam was chosen so that large amplitude can be achieved with proper sizing. Simple vibration analysis was used to size the beam so that the designed actuator frequency is within the third bending mode. Second, the magnetostrictive actuator was designed so that a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bias</b> and a magnetic bias can be applied to maximize the output of the actuator. The driver design primarily consists of a coil, a least resistant magnetic return path, a power source, and a command signal generator. Power drawn by the magnetic field driver increases with the frequency of operation due to increases in its inductance, skin effect losses, and eddy current losses. The magnetostrictive material with its low resistivity, when used as a core, therefore requires system level approach in designing the driver. Methodology developed to drive a magnetostrictive actuator includes determining optimal values of diameter of the magnetic wire, number of turns, length of the coil, and overall geometry. This methodology also accounts for the skin effect losses in the driving coil wire and the eddy current losses in magnetostrictive material. The power consumption is further reduced by creating an electrical resonance at the desired operating frequency by adding a capacitor in series with the driver. The least resistance magnetic return path is ensured by using a high magnetic permeability material and custom geometry permanent magnets. In this research work, response of the system comprising a well known model of cantilever beam with mirror and 1 - d model of actuator with nonlinear magnetostrictive rod is measured empirically. The developed methodology is validated experimentally using a custom fabricated magnetostrictive mirror deflector for rapidly tunable laser system. The fabricated mirror deflector is capable of producing a deflection of 6. 1 mrad at 5. 28 kHz with a power consumption of 0. 8 W and a deflection of 3. 8 mrad at 10. 8 kHz with 0. 65 W. The electrical resonance circuits used have further reduced the power consumption by as much as 32 %. The methodology is extended to MEMS thin film mirror deflectors.

Here, we show that an Arabidopsis mutant lacking the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) shows severely altered Ca 2 + signaling and growth responses to different forms of mechanical perturbation. Ca 2 + signals are either abolished or exhibit qualitatively different signatures in feronia (fer) mutants exposed to local touch or bending stimulation. Furthermore, mechanically induced upregulation of known touch-responsive genes is significantly decreased in fer mutants. In addition to these defects in mechanical signaling, fer mutants also exhibit growth phenotypes consistent with impaired <b>mechanical</b> development, including <b>biased</b> root skewing, an inability to penetrate hard agar layers, and abnormal growth responses to impenetrable obstacles. Finally, high-resolution kinematic analysis of root growth revealed that fer mutants show pronounced spatiotemporal fluctuations in root cell expansion profiles with a timescale of minutes. Based on these results, we propose that FER is a key regulator of mechanical Ca 2 + signaling and that FER-dependent mechanical signaling functions to regulate growth in response to external or intrinsic mechanical forces...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of giant magnetostrictive, Terfenol-D transducers {{in a wide variety}} of applications has led to a need for greater understanding of the materials performance. This dissertation attempts to add to the Terfenol-D transducer body of knowledge by providing an in-depth analysis and modeling of an experimental transducer. A description of the magnetostriction process related to Terfenol-D includes a discussion of material properties, production methods, and the effect of mechanical stress, magnetization, and temperature on the material performance. The understanding of the Terfenol-D material performance provides the basis for an analysis of the performance of a Terfenol-D transducer. Issues related to the design and utilization of the Terfenol-D material in the transducers are considered, including the magnetic circuit, application of mechanical prestress, and tuning of the mechanical resonance. Experimental results from two broadband, Tonpilz design transducers show the effects of operating conditions (prestress, magnetic bias, AC magnetization amplitude, and frequency) on performance. In an effort to understand and utlilize the rich performance space described by the experimental results a variety of models are considered. An overview of models applicable to Terfenol-D and Terfenol-D transducers is provided, including a discussion of modeling criteria. The Jiles-Atherton model of ferromagnetic hysteresis is employed to describe the quasi-static transducer performance. This model requires the estimation of only six physically-based parameters to accurately simulate performance. The model is shown to be robust with respect to model parameters over a range of <b>mechanical</b> prestress, magnetic <b>biases,</b> and AC magnetic field amplitudes, allowing predictive capability within these ranges. An additional model, based on electroacoustics theory, explains trends in the frequency domain and facilitates an analysis of efficiency based on impedance and admittance analysis. Results and discussion explain the importance of the resonance of the electromechanical system, as distinct from the mechanical resonance. Conclusions are drawn based on the experimental work, transducer analysis, and modeling approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of graphene in 2004 {{has led to}} an explosion in research efforts towards other 2 D materials. 2 D materials not only represent the ultimate scaling in the vertical direction, but also show a variety of novel and useful electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. This thesis presents computational studies which can be categorized in four areas; first, the study of ripples in graphene, second the {{discovery of}} structure and properties of 2 D materials, specifically, group-IV monochalcogenides; third, the substrate assisted synthesis routes for the synthesis of 2 D materials, specifically group-III-V materials and hexagonal GaN; and lastly, the application of 2 D materials as photocatalyst for water splitting. First, we show using Molecular Dynamics simulations that thermally induced dynamic ripples in graphene lead to angular deviations of the surface normal that agree with previous electron diffraction experiments (from static ripples), settling a long-standing debate about the nature of ripples in graphene and multi-layer graphene. The ripples can be both dynamic and static in nature and the magnitudes of both types of ripples are similar as they are controlled by the same energetics. Primarily, the static ripples correspond to the low-energy deformation modes of graphene, which are most easily formed due to small strains. These low-energy deformation modes are equivalent to static longwavelength out-of-plane phonon modes, typical of dynamic ripples. We also discover scaling relationships for the average angular deviations as a function of size of the graphene sheet L and averaging radius R and show that temperature, strain, and layer numbers can be used to manipulate these deviations. Our work provides guidance to the optimization of properties that are sensitive to out-of-plane distortions. Second, we use Density Functional Theory calculations to determine the structure, stability and electronic properties of 2 D materials in family of groupIV monochalcogenides. The computational screening approach undertaken in this study provides a generic approach for a broader discovery and characterization of, as yet, hypothetical 2 D materials using computational methods. To assess their potential in electronic applications, we also predict their electronic properties, such as band gaps, bandedge positions and effective masses using the HSE 06 functional which accurately predicts the electronic structure of materials by including some fraction of exact exchange and correct part of the selfinteraction error. The 2 D group IV-monochalcogenides materials show useful electronic properties suited for optoelectronics and solar energy conversion Third, the discovery of a novel material requires not only the identification of the materials composition, but also suitable synthesis conditions. We present a generic computational approach to identify suitable substrates for the stabilization of 2 D materials and apply the method to the recently predicted 2 D III-V compounds. We identify several lattice-matched substrates for their epitaxial growth, stabilization, and functionalization. These substrates make the 2 D materials thermodynamically stable and lead to charge doping due to the workfunction difference. Our approach allows to select substrates which not only stabilize the 2 D materials, but results in the smallest distortion of their structure and control over the electronic doping of the 2 D materials. And lastly, we summarize recent successes in the field of solar water splitting using 2 D materials. We review a computational-based screening approach to rapidly and efficiently discover many more 2 D materials that possess properties ideal for solar water splitting. Computational tools for the determination of intrinsic properties of potential photocatalyst, such as electronic properties, optical absorbance and solubility in aqueous solutions are discussed. Further possibilities of enhanced photocatalytic activity of these 2 D materials is explored by use of <b>mechanical</b> strain, <b>bias</b> potential, dopants and pH. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, laboratory-housed {{dogs are}} {{primarily}} {{used as a}} non-rodent species in the safety testing of new medicines and other chemical entities. The use of animals in research is governed by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986, amended 2012) and legislation is underpinned by the principles of humane experimental technique: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement. A link between animal welfare {{and the quality of}} data produced has been shown in other species (e. g. rodents, nonhuman primates), however, no established, integrated methodology for identifying or monitoring welfare and quality of data output previously existed in the laboratory-housed dog. In order to investigate the effects of planned Refinements to various aspects of husbandry and regulated procedures, this project sought to integrate behavioural, physiological and other measures (e. g. cognitive <b>bias,</b> <b>mechanical</b> pressure threshold) and to provide a means for staff to monitor welfare whilst also establishing the relationship between welfare and quality of data output. Affective state was identified using an established method of cognitive bias testing, before measuring welfare at ‘baseline’ using measures of behaviour and physiology. Dogs then underwent ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ behavioural challenges to identify the measures most sensitive to changing welfare and most suitable for use in a framework. The resulting Welfare Assessment Framework, developed in three groups of dogs from contrasting backgrounds within the facility, found a consistent pattern of behaviour, cardiovascular function, affect and mechanical pressure threshold (MPT). Dogs with a negative affective state had higher blood pressure at baseline than those with positive affective states, and the magnitude of the effect of negative welfare suggests that welfare may act as a confound in the interpretation of cardiovascular data. The responses to restraint included increases in blood pressure and heart rate measures which approached ceiling levels, potentially reducing the sensitivity of measurement. If maintained over time this response could potentially have a negative health impact on other organ systems and affecting the data obtained from those. Dogs with a negative welfare state also had a lower mechanical pressure threshold, meaning they potentially experienced greater stimulation from unpleasant physical stimuli. Taken together with the behaviours associated with a negative welfare state (predominantly vigilant or stereotypic behaviours) the data suggest that dogs with a negative welfare state have a greater behavioural and physiological response to stimuli in their environment; as such, data obtained from their use is different from that obtained from dogs with a positive welfare state. This was confirmed by examining the effect size (Cohen’s d) resulting from the analysis of affective state on cardiovascular data. An increase in variance, particularly in the small dog numbers typical of safety assessment studies, means a reduction {{in the power of the}} study to detect the effect under observation; a decrease in variation has the potential to reduce the number of dogs use, in line with the principle of Reduction and good scientific practice. The development of the framework also identified areas of the laboratory environment suitable for Refinement (e. g. restriction to single-housing and restraint) and other easily-implemented Refinements (e. g. feeding toy and human interaction) which could be used to improve welfare. As a result of this, a Welfare Monitoring Tool (WMT) in the form of a tick sheet was developed for technical and scientific staff to identify those dogs at risk of reduced welfare and producing poor quality data, as well as to monitor the effects of Refinements to protocols. Oral gavage is a common regulated procedure, known to be potentially aversive and was identified as an area in need of Refinement. A program of desensitisation and positive reinforcement training was implemented in a study also comparing the effects of a sham dose condition versus a control, no-training, condition. A number of the measures used, including home pen behaviour, behaviour during dosing, MPT and the WMT showed significant benefits to the dogs in the Refined condition. Conversely, dogs in the sham dose condition showed more signs of distress and took longer to dose than dogs in the control condition. The welfare of control dogs was intermediate to sham dose and Refined protocol dogs. This project identified a positive relationship between positive welfare and higher quality of data output. It developed and validated a practical and feasible means of measuring welfare in the laboratory environment in the Welfare Assessment Framework, identified areas in need of Refinement and developed practical ways to implement such Refinements to husbandry and regulated procedures. As such it should have wide implications for the pharmaceutical industry and other users of dogs in scientific research...|$|R
