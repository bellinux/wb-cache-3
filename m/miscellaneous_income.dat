The Northern Ireland Family Expenditure Survey (NIFES) was conducted in Northern Ireland from 1967 - 1998, and was the counterpart to the Family Expenditure Survey (FES), which was conducted annually in Great Britain from 1957 - 2001 (see under GN 33057). The FES/NIFES provided reliable data on expenditure and income in relation to household characteristics. The results of the survey show how expenditure patterns {{of different kinds of}} households vary, {{and the extent to which}} individual members of a household contribute to the household income. Although originally commissioned to provide expenditure details for the calculation of weights for the Retail Price Index, the FES/NIFES collected much additional information was also collected on the characteristics of co-operating households and the incomes of their members. It thus became a multi-purpose survey, and provided a unique fund of important economic and social data. From 1968 the Great Britain FES incorporated a sample drawn from the NIFES to become the UK FES. The FES was replaced in 2001 by a new survey series, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS) (see under GN 33334), covering the whole of the UK. The EFS is an amalgamation of the previous National Food Survey (NFS) (see under GN 33071) and UK FES. Main Topics : Household Schedule: This schedule was taken at the main interview. Information for most of the questions was obtained from the head of household or housewife, but certain questions of a more individual character were put to every spender aged 15 or over (or 16 or over from 1973 onwards). Until the introduction of the community charge, information on rateable value and rate poundage was obtained from the appropriate local authority, as was information on whether the address was within a smokeless zone. Information was collected about the household, the sex and age of each member, and also details about the type and size of the household accommodation. The main part of the questionnaire related to expenditure both of a household and individual nature, but the questions were mainly confined to expenses of a recurring nature, e. g. : Household: housing costs, payment to Gas and Electricity Boards and companies, telephone charges, licences and television rental Individual: motor vehicles, season tickets for transport, life and accident insurances, payments through a bank, instalments, refund of expenses by employer, expenditure claimed by self-employed persons as business expenses for tax purposes, welfare foods, education grants and fees Income Schedule: Data were collected for each household spender. Apart from page 1, the schedule was concerned with income, National Insurance contributions and income tax. Income of a child not classed as a spender was obtained from one or other of his parents and entered on the parent's questionnaire. Information collected included: employment status and recent absences from work, earnings of an employee, self-employed earnings, National Insurance contributions, pensions and other regular allowances, occasional benefits - social security benefits and other types, investment <b>income,</b> <b>miscellaneous</b> earnings of a 'once-only' character, tax paid directly to Inland Revenue or refunded, income of a child. Diary Records Each diary covered fourteen days. Each household member aged 15 or over (or 16 or over from 1973 onwards) was asked to record all expenditure made during the 14 days. The NIFES was identical to the UK FES and therefore used the same questionnaires and documentation. However, starting in 1988, a voluntary question on religious denomination was asked of those aged 16 and over in Northern Ireland. <br...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. This study aimed to collect comprehensive information on all forms of resources (including income and assets) and indicative information on deprivation and style of living in order to define and measure poverty among {{a representative sample of}} the population of the United Kingdom. This major study was the result of fifteen years research. In 1964 the Joseph Rowntree Memorial Trust agreed to finance pilot studies on fatherless families, large families and unemployed and disabled people which were then to be followed by a national survey of poverty. In 1967 - 68, following pilot work, interviews were completed with 2, 052 households (6, 045 people), in 630 parliamentary constituencies throughout the United Kingdom. Another 1, 514 households (3, 539 people), were later interviewed in a poor area of Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales to secure information about the populations of the poorest areas. There were mixed reactions to the book's publication in 1979. The concept of relative deprivation provoked much discussion but the issue of multiple deprivation experienced by individuals and families was largely ignored. Comparatively little attention was paid to certain forms of deprivation - such as deprivation at work and environmental or locational deprivation - although the report gave data about multiple deprivation drawn from 60 indicators. Nearly 50 years later this study was reanalysed in a project funded by Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). The 'Advancing Paradata' project looked at shifts and continuities in the social process of gathering household survey data about poverty. In part it does this through analysis of survey paradata from the 1968 Poverty in the UK survey. Paradata captures the gamut of by-products of the collection of survey data and is of interest in understanding and improving survey quality and costs. The main focus has been on automatically captured macro items, but this is now expanding to include interviewer-generated observations. For the 'Advancing Paradata' project, information available only on paper questionnaires at the UK Data Archive was converted into digitised form and related metadata was created. A sample of 100 survey booklets has been selected for this collection. These booklets were chosen because they have significant quantities of marginalia written on the booklets. These booklets are available via the UK Data Service QualiBank, an online tool for browsing, searching and citing the content of selected qualitative data collections held at the UK Data Service. Names of survey respondents have been removed to protect confidentiality. Main Topics : Variables: (i) Housing and living facilities: exact composition of household; adequacy of basic facilities; degree of overcrowding; deficiency of bedrooms; overall household facilities; degree of satisfaction with facilities and environment. (ii) Employment: 'work record' of each individual over previous twelve months; educational background. (iii) Occupational facilities and fringe benefits: type of facilities provided for indoor and outside employment; eligibility for fringe benefits (e. g. sick pay, occupational pension); value of fringe benefits in kind received during the year (e. g. meal vouchers, subsidised meals, use of vehicles). (iv) Current Monetary Income: information on total cash income in (a) previous week, (b) previous twelve months, from any source of each income unit in the household. Questions on earnings, income of self- employed, government social security benefits, and <b>miscellaneous</b> sources of <b>income.</b> Also questions on housing costs and house value. (v) Savings and assets: information on the value of savings and assets owned by the household, including housing and household or personal possessions. (vi) Health and disability: general assessment of health of household members; details of any illnesses or disabilities; capacity to undertake ordinary personal and household activities; (vii) Social services: utilisation of services including periods in hopital and visits to doctors and dentists. Information on welfare benefits received e. g. free school meals, educational maintenance allowances. (viii) Income in kind: questions on goods and services received in the previous twelve months from relatives and friends. (ix) Style of living: leisure time activities including holidays; questions on diet, clothing and fuel supply; assessment of own financial situation; arrangements for payment of housekeeping and bills; whether manage to have savings; feelings about 'poverty'. In addition to the questionnaire and data codebook, the documentation for this study also includes qualitative information of various kinds about the original survey, including interviewers' documents, sampling information, survey documents (including meeting notes), reports and papers. These items were originally held separately by Qualidata, and have been added to the study during 2002 to enhance the available documentation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Family Expenditure Survey (FES), which closed in 2001, was a continuous survey with an annual sample of around 10, 000 households. They provided information on household and personal incomes, certain payments that recurred regularly (e. g. rent, gas and electricity bills, telephone accounts, insurances, season tickets and hire purchase payments), and maintained a detailed expenditure record for 14 consecutive days. The original purpose of the FES was to provide information on spending patterns for the United Kingdom Retail Price Index (RPI). The survey was a cost-efficient way of collecting a variety of related data that the government departments required to correlate with income and expenditure at the household, tax unit and person levels. The annual FES began in 1957 (with an earlier large scale survey conducted in 1953 / 54) {{and was one of}} the first Department of Employment (DE) systems to be computerised in the early 1960 s. The UKDA holds FES data from 1961 - 2001. The Northern Ireland Family Expenditure Survey (NIFES), which ran from 1967 - 1998, was identical to the UK FES and therefore used the same questionnaires and documentation. However, starting in 1988, a voluntary question on religious denomination was asked of those aged 16 and over in Northern Ireland. The UKDA holds NIFES data from 1968 - 1998, under GN 33240. Significant FES developments over time include: 1968 : the survey was extended to include a sample drawn from the Northern Ireland FES and a new computer system was introduced which was used until 1985 1986 : DE and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) converted the FES into a new database system using the SIR package 1989 : the Central Statistical Office (CSO) took over responsibility for the survey 1994 : in April, computerised personal interviewing was introduced using lap-top computers, the database system changed to INGRES and the survey changed from a calendar year to financial year basis 1996 : in April, OPCS and CSO were amalgamated into the Office for National Statistics (ONS), who assumed responsibility for the FES 1998 : from April onwards information from expenditure diaries kept by children aged 7 to 15 was included in data, and grossing factors were made available on the database From 2001, the both the FES and the National Food Survey (NFS) (held at the UKDA under GN 33071) were completely replaced by a new survey, the Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS). Prior to the advent of the EFS, there had previously been considerable overlap between the FES and NFS, with both surveys asking respondents to keep a diary of expenditure. Thus, the 2000 - 2001 FES was the final one in the series. The design of the new EFS was based on the previous FES; further background to its development may be found in the 1999 - 2000 and 2000 - 2001 Family Spending reports. From 2008, the EFS became the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) (see under GN 33334). Main Topics : Household Schedule: This schedule was taken at the main interview. Information for most of the questions was obtained from the head of household or housewife, but certain questions of a more individual character were put to every spender aged 15 or over (or 16 or over from 1973 onwards).

He it was who first showed the way to produce malleable platinum on a com-mercial scale- incidentally the first successful example of powder metallurgy- {{and he was the}} discoverer of two new elements in native platinum which he named palladium and rhodium (I, 2). Fortunately he left a considerable quantity of notebooks and memoranda recording both his experiments and his financial transactions, most of these still preserved in the care of the University of Cambridge and others in the Science Museum, and it was in the course of examining his <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>income</b> and expenditure accounts that the writer came across an entry of particular interest. This records a payment to one Malacrida of the sum of 19 s for two platinum thermometers (3). It appears that one of these two thermo-meters was intended for the use of Wollaston’s scientific and financial partner Smithson Tennant, the discoverer of iridium and osmium, for among the miscellaneous Wollaston papers preserved at Cambridge there exists a loose sheet of paper on which is written “Platina Thermometer, for Mr Tennant”. The other was presumably employed by Wollaston himself. So far as the writer is aware no reference has been made in the literature to such a thermometer, nor has any description of it been given. There is some reason to suppose, however, that it was of the bimetallic type, with platinum as one of the compound metals and that it was a forerunner of the many kinds of thermostatic element’s that are now so widely employed.
