While the AOD, AODE and early 4R70W share some basic components like oil pans, gear sets (AODs and AODE can be retrofitted with 4R70W gear sets), most of the internals are not interchangeable because the 4R70W and AODE use electronic solenoids to shift instead of conventional hydraulics.

40|$|Previous {{studies by}} the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium (CVDC) have {{suggested}} that, by improving the control bandwidth of conventional Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) brake actuators and using a ‘slip control’ braking strategy, HGV stopping distances could be reduced by up to 30 % over existing systems. The work covered in this thesis looks to: validate the CVDC’s previous braking performance predictions through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation, investigate how in-plane tyre dynamics may influence such a system’s performance, develop and build a next generation high-bandwidth braking system for vehicle implementation and carry out comparative back-to-back vehicle tests between the new system and commercially available HGV ABS. An introduction to HGV brake hardware and control is presented in Chapter 1. This is followed by straight-line braking simulations of a HGV using a HiL test rig in Chapter 2. In these tests, a conventional ABS is compared to a prototype braking system consisting of highspeed pneumatic valves (designed by a previous CVDC researcher) and a sliding mode slip controller. Results indicate that the novel system could reduce stopping distances and air consumption by 21 % and 17 % respectively. Chapter 3 considers the influence of longitudinal tyre dynamics on the straight-line braking performance of a HGV slip control system. A novel, HGV specific, dynamic tyre model is presented. Two vibration modes involving the tyre tread band and wheel hub (an in-phase mode at 20 Hz, and an anti-phase mode at 55 Hz) are identified that can influence {{the performance of a}} slip control system. It is shown that a gain scheduled sliding mode slip controller can be designed to be robust to oscillations in wheel speed associated with these modes. Overspinning of the wheel hub during brake release (a phenomenon seen in conventional ABS vehicle test data) is also correctly predicted by the novel tyre model. Chapter 4 focuses on the design of a next generation high-speed ABS <b>modulator</b> <b>valve</b> suitable for installation on a test vehicle. Prototype valve blocks are built and shown to meet the requirements of a typical UK semi-trailer. Frequency response tests with the new valves indicate that the system can achieve a pressure control bandwidth of 10 Hz, significantly higher than the previous generation high-speed valve system (6 Hz) and conventional ABS hardware (1. 5 Hz). Chapter 5 discusses the installation of high-speed ABS <b>modulator</b> <b>valves</b> on a tri-axle semi-trailer. Straight-line braking tests are then carried out in Chapter 6 – comparing the new valve system with conventional ABS. On average, stopping distance and air use are reduced by 15 ± 3 % and 50 ± 10 % respectively. An increase in Mean Fully Developed Deceleration (MFDD) of 16 ± 4 % is also achieved by the new system...|$|R

5000|$|In 1990, the Turbo Hydra-Matic 700R4 {{was renamed}} the 4L60. Under the new designation, the [...] "4" [...] {{stands for the}} number of forward gears, the [...] "L" [...] for {{longitudinal}} applications (rear-wheel-drive), and the [...] "60" [...] is the strength rating (less than the 4L80). [...] "60" [...] is the relative torque value. For example, 80 is stronger than 60, which is stronger than 40, etc. A 4L80-E can handle more torque than a 4L60-E. The [...] "E" [...] denotes electronically controlled shifting. The 4L60 however is hydraulically shifted based on governor pressure and throttle <b>valve</b> (TV) <b>cable</b> position. 1992 was the last year of widespread usage of the 700R4 (4L60).The 1993 Camaro, Corvette and Typhoon were equipped with the last production 700R4.

50|$|The {{governor}} {{is connected to}} the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum <b>modulator.</b> The <b>valve</b> body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of spring-loaded valves, check balls and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle <b>valve</b> or <b>modulator)</b> to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic engine control unit (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM).|$|R

The cause was eventually traced to gas bubbles in the unit, which remained non-functional until a Progress resupply mission in October 2004. In 2005 ISS personnel tapped into the oxygen supply of the recently arrived Progress resupply ship, when the Elektron unit failed.

A leak of corrosive, odorless potassium hydroxide forced the ISS crew to don gloves and face masks. It has been conjectured that the smell came from overheated rubber seals. The incident occurred shortly after STS-115 left and just before arrival of a resupply mission (including space tourist Anousheh Ansari). The Elektron did not come back online until November 2006, after new <b>valves</b> and <b>cables</b> arrived on the October 2006 Progress resupply vessel.

40|$|VSC HVDC {{systems have}} a lot of {{interesting}} properties of which the most interesting is the possibility to make connections in or between networks by low weight extruded cables. These connections can be made at a cost that can even be comparable with overhead ac lines. In addition to full power flow control in both directions, the VSC HVDC systems can prevent fault propagation, increase low frequency stability, reduce network losses and increase voltage stability. These attractive features open interesting markets and applications where power shall be transported over long distances at large depths under demanding circumstances and where network stability, safety and reliability are of the highest priority. Today a maximum power handling of the system of at least 1000 MW at ± 300 kV dc is attainable, thanks to synchronized development in four major technical areas: IGBT <b>valves,</b> DC <b>cable</b> system, main circuit of converter station and control system. This paper presents the development in those four areas. The VSC valves have increased current handling, lower losses, better cooling and more even voltage sharing so they may be built for drastically higher power rating than previously. A new larger presspack IGBT gives higher converter current handling. The cable system has been expanded in voltage and laying depth. Robust flexible and stiff joints have been developed for the polymeric extruded cables. Testing has proved 300 kVdc capability of the cable syste...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a steady}} state control strategy, {{that can be}} used to ensure the {{stability}} (cable thermal power limit in this case) of a meshed HVDC grid consisting of wind power plants, is proposed. The control strategy involves power flow control. The objective of a power flow control in a DC grid, as in a point-to-point DC transmission, concerns controlling the DC voltage in the system within its limits and fulfilling the power input/output at the PCC (Point of Common Coupling) to the AC system, without exceeding maximum currents through the <b>valves,</b> lines or <b>cables.</b> The best power flow control can be achieved with the use of DC-DC converters in between the nodes of the meshed HVDC grid. However, the use of DC-DC converters in such a DC grid is quite costly, especially if implemented in an offshore environment. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how the power flow in the DC grid, consisting of wind power plants, can be achieved without using DC-DC converters. Instead, it is achieved by controlling the bus power(s) injected into the DC grid, without curtailing the power from the wind power plants...|$|R
40|$|Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) {{are highly}} heritable, {{clinically}} significant congenital heart malformations. Genetic and environmental modifiers of risk {{are thought to}} work in unknown combinations to cause AVSD. Approximately 5 – 10 % of simplex AVSD cases carry a missense mutation in CRELD 1. However, CRELD 1 mutations are not fully penetrant and require interactions with other risk factors to result in AVSD. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) is a well-characterized <b>modulator</b> of heart <b>valve</b> development. A functional VEGFA polymorphism, VEGFA c. - 634 C, which causes constitutively increased VEGFA expression, {{has been associated with}} cardiac septal defects suggesting it may be a genetic risk factor. To determine if there is an allelic association with AVSD we genotyped the VEGFA c. - 634 SNP in a simplex AVSD study cohort. Over-representation of the c. - 634 C allele in the AVSD group suggested that this genotype may increase risk. Correlation of CRELD 1 and VEGFA genotypes revealed that potentially pathogenic missense mutations in CRELD 1 were always accompanied by the VEGFA c. - 634 C allele in individuals with AVSD suggesting a potentially pathogenic allelic interaction. We used a Creld 1 knockout mouse model to determine the effect of deficiency of Creld 1 combined with increased VEGFA on atrioventricular canal development. Morphogenic response to VEGFA was abnormal in Creld 1 -deficient embryonic hearts, indicating that interaction between CRELD 1 and VEGFA has the potential to alter atrioventricular canal morphogenesis. This supports our hypothesis that an additive effect between missense mutations in CRELD 1 and a functional SNP in VEGFA contributes to the pathogenesis of AVSD...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{development}} of Russian offshore {{oil and gas}} fields is relevant and perspective. A lot of Russian and foreign oil and gas companies tend to get an experience in offshore field development by establishing pilot projects even in the Arctic. Although oil price is rather low, deal with offshore projects more attractive compare to an onshore, because of higher reservoir productivity of offshore oil fields. It allows us to open new horizons and gather required experience for the future projects. Sometimes, one oil platform derives more oil than subsidiary oil company may. Presence characterized by high leasehold price for an oil platform, marine vessels, and equipment. Therefore, oil companies aim at an operating cost reduction, ensuring the reliability and integrity of all platform systems, and their downtime reduction. The problem, which will {{be considered in the}} thesis, is an artificial oil production system failure (namely upper completion and ESP). Sometimes oil platforms have one drilling rig and sometimes even do not have and in a case of failure of any main module of the upper completion, the oil production stops and it will be continued only after replacement of broken equipment and pulling a new one, But what we have in a case while drilling? We cannot replace the upper completion till drilling of the well is done or we have to stop drilling in order to renew our well with the broken upper completion. Anyway, in both cases company loses money and time. In the thesis will be considered the upper completion assembly with two ESP in series, for ensuring work of one of them in case of another failure (pumps work alternately, for their guaranteed start). With the help of the special program required pumps and their operational characteristics will be chosen. This concept may reduce well downtime, but only in case of trouble-free operation of other modules of the upper completions, that also may stop production (circulation <b>valve,</b> X-tree, power <b>cable,</b> reservoir control <b>valve</b> and others).

40|$|The Modular Pebble Bed Reactor {{is a small}} high {{temperature}} helium cooled reactor that is being considered for both electric power and hydrogen production. Pebble bed reactors are being developed in South Africa, China and the US. To make smaller 120 Mwe reactors economically competitive with larger 1500 Mwe traditional light water reactors {{changes in the way}} these plants are built are needed. Economies of production need to be sufficiently large to compete with economies of scale. MIT (Berte) has been working on developing a modular design and construction strategy for several years. This thesis builds on that work by demonstrating the technical feasibility of implementing the modularity approaches previously developed. The MIT approach uses "space frames" containing all the components, piping, <b>valves</b> and needed <b>cables,</b> instrumentation in a specified volume. These space frames are built in a factory to assure high quality in manufacture. They are then shipped by train or truck to the site and assembled "lego" style. It is expected that with the improved quality in the factory setting, and rapid assembly at the site that the total time and cost of construction of the plant will be greatly reduced (Kadak). To make this process work, it is vitally important to assure that when the space frames and internal components are manufactured, they are done to rigid tolerances to assure line up when assembled in the field. By using many advanced three dimensional measurement technologies, including the use of digital photography, lasers, and photogrammetry, companies are now capable of fabricating pieces to extremely precise specifications at a relatively affordable cost. This thesis evaluates the feasibility of manufacture of space frames and internal components to the required tolerances, the accuracy control needed and how the plant can be assembled with details of each space frame interfaces. (cont.) A global reference system was determined and a basic plant map for space frame placement developed. Deviations from exact placement from this map due to tolerance allowances were factored in and methods and techniques for overcoming any variations was developed. In order to enable each frame and it's respective components to be accurately fabricated to ensure interfacing parts will mate, a local coordinate system was developed for each frame and used to describe the exact location of the required interfaces for each specific frame. Crucial concepts of accuracy control and "best fit" are outlined and incorporated. Based on independent verification of the processes and the design proposed, this modularity approach appears to be feasible. A comparative economic analysis was also performed to assess the potential cost savings of the modularity approach compared to traditional "stick build" approaches presently being used in nuclear construction. Manhour, learning curve and overall cost savings of over 30 % can be expected which suggests that if modularity approaches as those proposed are used, smaller reactors can compete with larger economies of scale plants. by Jaime E.
