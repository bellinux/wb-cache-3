5|$|Many fire temples, {{with their}} four axial arch openings, were usually turned into mosques simply by setting a mihrab (prayer niche) {{on the place}} of the arch nearest to qibla (the {{direction}} of Mecca). Zoroastrian temples converted into mosques in such a manner could be found in Bukhara, as well as in and near Istakhr and other Persian cities. Urban areas where Arab governors made their quarters were <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> such religious persecution, great fire temples were turned into mosques, and the citizens were forced to conform or flee. Many libraries were burnt and much cultural heritage was lost.|$|E
5|$|Painted turtles are <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> predators when young. Nests are {{frequently}} ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings {{fall prey to}} water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles' armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, ospreys, crows, red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.|$|E
5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who have crossed an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|The cockroach's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} radiation better than {{human beings can}} be explained through the cell cycle. Cells are <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> the effects of radiation when they are dividing. A cockroach's cells divide only once each time it molts, which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach. Since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time, many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation, but lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful.|$|E
5|$|The right whales' two known predators are {{humans and}} orcas. When danger lurks, {{a group of}} right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which {{sometimes}} proves to be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, {{the sheer size of}} this animal is its best defense, although young calves are the <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> orca and shark attacks.|$|E
5|$|Upon his ascension, Playford {{headed a}} {{minority}} government; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 {{seats in the}} lower house. The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. Many had gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives.

5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires burn more than , {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate {{guarding}} {{during the period}} females are <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly {{on the side and}} following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The guarding behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate guarding over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate guarding reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is guarding it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male guarding.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E

40|$|Asia is {{recognized}} as one of the <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> regions <b>to</b> climate change on the planet. With approximately 60 per cent of world’s population residing in Asia, this phenomenon presents serious concerns for policymakers in the region. The present study analyses the impacts of climate change on economic growth for selected Asian countries during the period 1972 - 2009. A growth model has been developed by incorporating temperature and precipitation as proxies for climate change in the production function and a fixed effect model (FEM) and seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) have been used to estimate the model. The results reveal that economic growth is negatively affected by changes in temperature, precipitation and population growth whereas urbanization and human development stimulates economic growth. The results also indicate that agriculture is the <b>most</b> <b>vulnerable</b> sector <b>to</b> climate change and manufacturing is the least affected sector...|$|R
