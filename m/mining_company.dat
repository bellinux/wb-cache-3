5|$|Arctic Bulk Minerals {{bought the}} mining rights, and {{operated}} a train once to {{twice a year}} to keep the track and rolling stock maintained. This company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. The <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> was then bought by the local power company Varanger Kraft and Sør-Varanger Municipality. In 2006, they sold the <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> to Tschudi Group for 102million Norwegian krone (NOK). The Tschudi Group established Northern Iron, registered in Perth, Australia, as a holding company to own the <b>mining</b> <b>company.</b> Operations in the mine and on the line resumed in 2009, after the price of iron had risen dramatically since {{the closing of the}} mine. With the opening of the mine, production is estimated at 3million tonnes of export per year. The Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line was the northern-most railway in the world until 2010, when Russia's Obskaya–Bovanenkovo Line was opened.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{toxicity}} of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning. In China, prison labor was used by a private <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> {{as recently as the}} 1950s to develop new cinnabar mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> to establish new tunnels. Worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.|$|E

5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, {{built by the}} <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the <b>mining</b> <b>company.</b> After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the {{residents}} to vacate the property {{so that it could}} reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies. In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began stripping the overburden from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{comments}} on the regulatory regime {{at the heart of}} the environmental movement in Canada and focuses on the implications for <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> arising from increased environmental regulation. A survey of senior environmental representatives from major <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> is presented to identify management approaches that are used to reduce environmental risk and a typology is developed of Canadian <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> based on the environmental structures in place. Finally, a checklist of structures essential to the success of any mining environmental program is discussed. The paper concludes that regulatory and public pressures have forced Canadian <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> to considerably enhance their environmental performance. It is expected that these pressures will not abate in the foreseeable future...|$|R

5|$|In 1931, Stojanović was {{contracted}} to the Prijedor {{branch of the}} state railway company to provide healthcare for its employees. In 1936, he was {{contracted to}} an iron ore <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> in Ljubija, a town near Prijedor, and would visit the <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> clinic twice a week. He also taught hygiene at the gymnasium in Prijedor. Together with other intellectuals from the town, he gave lectures to the miners at their club in Ljubija. His lectures were usually about medical issues, but he also described {{the economic and social}} position of workers in more advanced countries. He socialised with the miners and treated their family members for free. He was very active socially, and also participated in sports. In 1932, he founded the tennis club of Prijedor, which continues to bear his name. Stojanović once bought new kit for all members of the Rudar Ljubija football club. His contracts with the railway company and the <b>mining</b> <b>company</b> were both terminated in 1939. The railway employees protested in Prijedor, and Stojanović's contract with that company was subsequently renewed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new sustainability index {{for evaluating the}} sustainability performance of <b>mining</b> <b>companies.</b> The index indicates a <b>mining</b> <b>company’s</b> overall performance level, relative to other companies {{in terms of its}} sustainability performance. To facilitate the use of the index as a sustainability performance management tool, three most important criteria for measuring the sustainability-related performance of <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> are identified. With the use of linguistic terms, subjective assessments of qualitative performance measures are represented with fuzzy numbers. Based on the concept of optimality, a fuzzy multicriteria decision making approach is developed to obtain a sustainability performance index for each company. This sustainability performance index helps <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> to understand their strengths and weaknesses in terms of sustainability performance criteria, and identify relevant areas for sustainability improvement...|$|R
40|$|The {{privatisation}} of Zambia's copper mines has {{paved the}} way for increased levels of foreign direct investment in the economy. The incentives provided to the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> have been very attractive to investors. However, the weakness of the Zambian state is clearly demonstrated in the development agreements it signed with the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> {{at the expense of the}} welfare of the Copperbelt communities. The major outcome of privatisation has been a considerable loss in welfare as the new <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> have been following to the letter the terms of the development agreements. Despite the upturn of copper prices on the international market, the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> have continued to provide reduced services to the communities, compelling civil society to pressure the government to renegotiate the agreements. ...|$|R

50|$|Mine owners went a {{step further}} and formed a Mine Owners' Association in {{response}} to union organizing in the mining district of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho during the 1880s. A violent confrontation between local miners' organizations and <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> in Coeur d'Alene in 1892 served as the impetus for formation of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) in 1893. The <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> of Colorado similarly joined together during a labor struggle with the WFM in 1894, and during the Colorado Labor Wars of 1903. However, the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> of the Cripple Creek District were not completely united, even during the 1903-04 strike. As in Coeur d'Alene, <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> in the Cripple Creek District that made agreements with unions were shut down by military force.|$|R

The sample was drawn from the catchment com-munities of gold <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> who had commercial membership, level A, with the Ghana Chamber of mines. The research established that there was indeed the existence of some health, education, community aid, and livelihood related CSR activities in the communities. The research revealed that most people, especially, in the Eastern region and the Western region had concerns about the lack of frequent medical screening by the <b>mining</b> <b>companies.</b> They are of the view that the operations of the <b>mining</b> <b>companies</b> {{have a negative effect on}} them (local community).

5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont <b>Mining</b> <b>Company</b> and the Barbee & Walker <b>Mining</b> <b>Company</b> had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont <b>Mining</b> <b>Company</b> discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered everyone out.|$|E
