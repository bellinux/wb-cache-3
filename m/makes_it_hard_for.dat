5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E

However, often {{there is no clear}} grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.|$|E
25|$|The 2005 {{election}} figures {{revealed a}} {{trend of the}} Lib Dems replacing the Conservatives as Labour's main opponents in urban areas. Many gains came in previously Labour-held urban constituencies (for example, Manchester Withington, Cardiff Central, Birmingham Yardley), many of which the Conservatives had held in the 1980s, and Lib Dem aspirants had over 100 second-place finishes behind Labour candidates. The British electoral system <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the Conservatives to form a government without winning some city seats outside its rural heartlands, such as the Lib Dem Bristol West constituency, where the Conservatives came third in 2005 after holding the seat until 1997.|$|E

25|$|Harold Bishop {{visits and}} admits to having {{reservations}} about Amber and the wedding, causing Daniel to rescind his invitation. Paul also tries to stop Daniel from getting married by inviting Des Clarke (Paul Keane) {{to talk to}} him about his failed first wedding. On the day of the wedding, Daniel tries to persuade Imogen to attend, but she admits that she is in love with him. Daniel learns the whereabouts of Agnes Robinson's ring and Imogen goes with him to retrieve it from an old well. They become trapped in the well after the ladder breaks, causing Daniel to miss the wedding. The situation in the well grows worse when Imogen's asthma <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> her to breathe and water is pumped in. Josh manages to work out where they are, leading to their rescue. Amber and Daniel reunite, and Amber learns she is pregnant. Amber admits that she had a one-night stand with Josh and a DNA test shows he is the father. Daniel tries to support Amber financially and sells some of his Off Air shares to Karl Kennedy. He and Amber later break-up.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them to leave.|$|E

At the 2015 Television Critics Associations Summer Press Tour, Chopra said that she chose the series as her first television project because of the character's appeal, comparing her to [...] "the female Jason Bourne". Chopra chose to depict the character as tough but also feminine, saying [...] "She's as smart as that, but she is also vulnerable and soft. I didn't want to make Alex extremely macho, I wanted to celebrate femininity. You can be an absolute woman and also be smart and tough and not lose your femininity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Gram-negative bacteria, the {{secretary}} pathway {{is very different}} from that of eukaryotes or Gram-positive bacteria, mainly due to the difference in cell wall structure. Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins use a particular secretion pathway, named type V secretion system (T5SS). Gram-negative bacteria must secrete adhesins, since they have an outer membrane that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them to stick to and infect the host. The outer membrane is useful, as it allows the bacteria to colonize, and adds another layer of protection. However, the outer membrane is a barrier for the secretion of proteins, and it requires energy to transport proteins across the outer membrane. [...] Hence, the T5SS pathway overcomes this problem.|$|E
2500|$|Fearing a Nazi uprising, U.S. {{occupation}} {{forces were}} under strict orders not {{to share their}} food with the German population, and this also applied to their wives when they arrived later in the occupation. The women were under orders not to allow their German maids {{to get hold of}} any leftovers; [...] "the food was to be destroyed or made inedible", although in view of the starving German population facing them many housewives chose to disregard these official orders. Nevertheless, according to a U.S. intelligence survey a German university professor reportedly said: [...] "Your soldiers are good-natured, good ambassadors; but they create unnecessary ill will to pour twenty litres of left-over cocoa in the gutter when it is badly needed in our clinics.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to skyglow, light trespass can impact observations when artificial light directly enters the tube {{of the telescope}} and is reflected from non-optical surfaces until it eventually reaches the eyepiece. This direct form of light pollution causes a glow across {{the field of view}} which reduces contrast. Light trespass also <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a visual observer to become sufficiently dark adapted. The usual measures to reduce this glare, if reducing the light directly is not an option, include flocking the telescope tube and accessories to reduce reflection, and putting a light shield (also usable as a dew shield) on the telescope to reduce light entering from angles other than those near the target. Under these conditions, some astronomers prefer to observe under a black cloth to ensure maximum dark adaptation. In one Italian regional lighting code this effect of stray light is defined as [...] "optical pollution", {{due to the fact that}} there is a direct path from the light source to the [...] "optic" [...] – the observer's eye or telescope.|$|E
2500|$|Heinrich Isaac's career spanned {{well over}} thirty years and allowed him to travel far from his {{homeland}} of Flanders into Germany, Italy, and Austria, {{as well as other}} parts of central Europe. [...] While the absence of plentiful primary sources <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> us to map out Isaac's life, piecing together the sources we do have along with the works he wrote gives us a good picture of just how popular this Franco-Flemish composer was in his time. [...] Isaac was probably writing music by the 1470s, and the first document mentioning his name dates back to 15 September 1484, placing him in Innsbruck as a singer for Duke Sigismund of Austria, of the House of Habsburg. [...] The following year Isaac migrated to Florence, since documents show that by July 1485 Isaac had become employed as a singer at the church Santa Maria del Fiore. [...] By the middle of 1491, he was designated as a singer at Santissima Annunziata, a position that he held until 1493.|$|E
