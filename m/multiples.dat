5|$|Therefore, {{the set of}} all numbers ua + vb is {{equivalent}} to the set of <b>multiples</b> m of g. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer <b>multiples</b> of two numbers (a and b) {{is equivalent}} to the set of <b>multiples</b> of gcd(a, b). The GCD {{is said to be the}} generator of the ideal of a and b.

5|$|The {{variables}} a and b alternate {{holding the}} previous remainders r'k−1 and r'k−2. Assume that a {{is larger than}} b {{at the beginning of}} an iteration; then a equals r'k−2, since r'k−2 > r'k−1. During the loop iteration, a is reduced by <b>multiples</b> of the previous remainder b until a is smaller than b. Then a is the next remainder r'k. Then b is reduced by <b>multiples</b> of a until it is again smaller than a, giving the next remainder r'k+1, and so on.|$|E

5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All <b>multiples</b> are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo- denotes a multiple of a thousand and milli- denotes a multiple of a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. <b>Multiples</b> of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement, now known as base units.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities had their own system of measurement.

5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement.

The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic number}} system {{consists}} of a dot to represent one, and a bar to represent five. By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used. The Maya could write any number from 0 to 19 {{using a combination of}} these symbols. The precise value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty. In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent <b>multiples</b> of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent <b>multiples</b> of 400, and so on. For example, the number 884 would be written with four dots on the lowest level, four dots on the next level up, and two dots on the next level after that, to give 4x1, plus 4x20, plus 2x400. Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers. Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.|$|E
