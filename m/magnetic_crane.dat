5000|$|By {{turning a}} dial the player must pick {{the ball up}} from the {{platform}} using the <b>magnetic</b> <b>crane</b> and deposit it on the parallel bars.|$|E
50|$|When Cleo {{returns to}} LA {{to arrest the}} police {{responsible}} for the raid, she continues to take apart Mommyâ€™s underworld drug business, thwarting her minions along the way. Cleo and Mommy face off in a showdown, in which she is trapped by Mommy in a car crusher but is saved by her friends from the B&S House. In the final showdown, Cleo chases Mommy {{to the top of}} a <b>magnetic</b> <b>crane</b> where the two women fight. Mommy proves to be no match for Cleo, who hurls Mommy over the side of the crane to her death, while Cleo's friends defeat her henchmen. At the end of the film, as Reuben and the members of the community celebrate victory, Cleo departs the scene. She sets off to complete her mission of stemming the tide of drugs that flow into her community.|$|E
50|$|At Murmansk, Conrad plants {{the bomb}} on a {{submarine}} using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>crane.</b> One of Sarov's men handcuffs Alex to a handrail {{close to the}} submarines, Sarov approaches him and bids him farewell before leaving. Alex sets himself free by using expanding bubble gum (again supplied by Smithers). Conrad immediately notices and lowers {{himself out of the}} crane to engage Alex. During their fight, the Russian army arrives and starts fighting Sarov's men. In their fight, Conrad outmatches Alex and comes dangerously close to killing him. However, Conrad (who has numerous pieces of metal inside his body) is caught by the crane's electromagnet passing overhead, lifting him into the air and breaking his back. Alex takes control of the crane, dropping Conrad's body into the sea and removing the nuclear bomb from the submarine. He then removes the detonation card from the bomb, only to be told to put it back by a reappearing Sarov; Alex instead throws the card into the ocean When Alex tells Sarov that he would rather die than become Sarov's son, Sarov commits suicide.|$|E
60|$|The men stopped, watching. Leadys {{operating}} the little carts moved past them, signaling silently to each other. Guns and parts were being hoisted by <b>magnetic</b> <b>cranes</b> and lowered gently onto waiting carts.|$|R
50|$|Bio Dragon (Baio Doragon): A carrier {{ship for}} Bio Jets One and Two. The {{fuselage}} side carries two laser guns. With its <b>magnetic</b> force <b>crane,</b> it {{can pick up}} an inert Bio Robo. It can transport a fully formed Bio Robo {{to the scene of}} battle. The Bioman can either pilot it out of the hangar, fly up to it, or board it from the ground with an tube-shaped escalator device.|$|R
50|$|He then {{developed}} magnetic multiaperture devices (MADs) at RCA Laboratories (now Sarnoff Corporation). In {{order to}} develop <b>magnetic</b> logic, <b>Crane</b> controlled the direction of bit flow in magnetic ferrite memory cores. Ferrite logic circuits are inherently more stable than vacuum tubes and transistors, draw no power when unused, and are impervious to electromagnetic interference. In 1959, Crane introduced the all-magnetic logic approach at the Fall Joint Computer Conference, eventually leading to {{a demonstration of the}} world's first all-magnetic computer in 1961. The technology was soon commercialized by Aircraft Marine Products (AMP) Inc., under license from SRI, and used primarily in the rapid transit system of New York City and at railroad switching yards, where electro-magnetic interference made electronic computers unfeasible. The development and growth of planar transistors in silicon chips and integrated circuits displaced magnetic core logic, although it may still be useful for extended space missions and other extreme conditions, but using integrated circuit manufacturing techniques (e.g. etching and deposition of a substrate, and not an assembly of discrete magnetic cores). The prototype of the first all-magnetic computer now resides at the Computer History Museum, in Mountain View, California.|$|R
50|$|Jerry is now {{traveling}} {{across the}} floor in his vehicle, his eyes on a large wheel of cheese on the counter. Tom comes from behind in a <b>magnetic</b> <b>crane</b> and attracts Jerry's vehicle up to the magno-pad. Jerry exits his vehicle in a parachute, unplugs the crane's magno-pad from its power source sending his own vehicle falling and then Tom comes out with a hammer, ready to squash the mouse. Jerry then plugs the magno-pad back in and the hammerhead comes off the handle and sticks to the pad, and then he unplugs it and it falls on Tom's head. Tom brims with anger as a bump forms on his head, but then Jerry repeats this before Tom can throttle him. Jerry does it for a third time, and Tom pleads with the mouse not to follow through, but Jerry unplugs the pad anyway and Tom gets bumped again. Jerry uses his new-found attack in a sequence until Tom is seen crushed to the floor, 1/3 of Jerry's height and crying at the mouse's feet. Jerry lets the cat go, and then shrugs.|$|E
