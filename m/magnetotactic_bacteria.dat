5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic polyphosphate. These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes.

2500|$|Biomineralization is {{the process}} by which living organisms produce minerals, often to harden or stiffen {{existing}} tissues. Such tissues are called mineralized tissues. It is an extremely widespread phenomenon; all six taxonomic kingdoms contain members that are able to form minerals, and over 60 different minerals have been identified in organisms. [...] Examples include silicates in algae and diatoms, carbonates in invertebrates, and calcium phosphates and carbonates in vertebrates. These minerals often form structural features such as sea shells and the bone in mammals and birds. Organisms have been producing mineralised skeletons for the past 550 million years. Other examples include copper, iron and gold deposits involving bacteria. Biologically-formed minerals often have special uses such as magnetic sensors in <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Fe3O4), gravity sensing devices (CaCO3, CaSO4, BaSO4) and iron storage and mobilization (Fe2O3•H2O in the protein ferritin).|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, three fluid {{dynamical}} {{problems are}} studied. First in chapter 2 we investigate, via both theoretical and experimental methods, the swimming motion of a <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacterium</b> having {{the shape of}} a prolate spheroid in a viscous liquid under the influence of an imposed magnetic field. The emphasis of the study is placed on how the shape of the non-spherical <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacterium,</b> marked by the size of its eccentricity, affects the pattern of its swimming motion. It is revealed that the pattern/speed of a swimming spheroidal <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacterium</b> is highly sensitive not only to the direction of its magnetic moment but also to its shape. Secondly, an important unanswered mathematical question in the theory of rotating fluids has been the completeness of the inviscid eigenfunctions which are usually referred to as inertial waves or inertial modes. In chapter 3 we provide {{for the first time a}} mathematical proof for the completeness of the inertial modes in a rotating annular channel by establishing the completeness relation, or Parseval’s equality, for any piecewise continuous, differentiable velocity of an incompressible fluid. Thirdly, in chapter 4 we investigate, through both asymptotic analysis and direct numerical simulation, precessionally driven flow of a homogeneous fluid confined in a fluid-filled circular cylinder that rotates rapidly about its symmetry axis and precesses about a different axis that is fixed in space. A particular emphasis is placed on the spherical-like cylinder whose diameter is nearly the same as its length. An asymptotic analytical solution in closed form is derived in the mantle frame of reference for describing weakly precessing flow in the spherical-like cylinder at asymptotically small Ekman numbers. We also construct a three-dimensional finite element model, which is checked against the asymptotic solution, in attempting to elucidate the structure of the nonlinear flow...|$|R
5000|$|Magnetotactic {{organisms are}} prokaryotic, {{with only one}} example of giant-magnetofossils, likely {{produced}} by eukaryotic organisms, having been reported. <b>Magnetotactic</b> <b>bacteria,</b> {{the source of the}} magnetofossils, are magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4) producing bacteria found in both freshwater and marine environments. These magnetite bearing magnetotatic bacteria are found in the oxic-anoxic transition zone where conditions are such that oxygen levels are less than those found in the atmosphere (microaerophilic).

50|$|There {{are many}} methods for {{detecting}} and measuring magnetofossils, {{although there are}} some issues with the identification. Current research is suggesting that the trace elements found in the magnetite crystals formed in <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacteria</b> differ from crystals formed by other methods. It has also been suggested that calcium and strontium incorporation can be used to identify magnetite inferred from <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Other methods such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of samples from deep boreholes and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy are being used. FMR spectroscopy of chains of cultured <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacteria</b> compared to sediment samples are being used to infer magnetofossil preservation over geological time frames. Research suggests that magnetofossils retain their remanent magnetization at deeper burial depths, although this is not entirely confirmed. FMR measurements of saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) in some samples, compared with FMR and rainfall measurements taken over the past 70 years, have shown that magnetofossils can retain a record of paleorainfall variations on a shorter time-scale (hundreds of years), making a very useful recent history paleoclimate indicator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sensitivity}} of <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacteria</b> to the Earth's magnetic field {{arises from the}} fact these bacteria precipitate chains of crystals of magnetic minerals within their cells; to date, all <b>magnetotactic</b> <b>bacteria</b> are reported to precipitate either magnetite or greigite.

The oldest unambiguous magnetofossils come from the Cretaceous chalk beds of southern England, though less certain reports of magnetofossils extend to 1.9 billion years old Gunflint Chert.
