5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank <b>move</b> <b>and</b> focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to <b>move</b> <b>and</b> fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|Galbraith, Eide and Kerestedjiants {{agreed to}} deliver the plan to Croatia and the RSK on 21 October, opposed by Owen and Stoltenberg. Owen also asked Vitaly Churkin to {{instruct}} his envoy to oppose the delivery. As instructed by Moscow, Kerestedjiants {{pulled out of the}} <b>move</b> <b>and</b> Galbraith accused Owen of sabotaging the Z-4 Plan.|$|E

5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the <b>move,</b> <b>and</b> must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the <b>move,</b> <b>and</b> argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|According to Jones family tradition, Jones's father lost a {{significant}} amount of his wealth while in Virginia, which brought about his family's return to England in 1727. Jones's father's death prior to 1727 also precipitated the family's <b>move,</b> <b>and</b> following their relocation to England, Elizabeth raised Jones and his siblings in London where she had Jones's sister baptized at St Giles in the Fields on February 20, 1727.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to <b>move</b> <b>and</b> act. Characters <b>move</b> <b>and</b> attack within the same turn, {{and in a few}} cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing strengths and weaknesses of weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the land}} was {{required}} for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced to <b>move</b> <b>and</b> the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened by the Mayor of Birkenhead, Councillor George Proudman, on 9 March 1912. Their first match was played against Lancaster Town in the Lancashire Combination. There were stands (also known as bleachers) {{on both sides of}} the pitch, a paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first <b>move,</b> <b>and</b> the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for {{different versions of the}} rule).|$|E
5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure game, requiring the player to <b>move</b> <b>and</b> guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player {{characters in the}} scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.|$|E

Citing the precedent set by the Browns' relocation, NFL owners used the threat of a move to convince their cities to build new stadiums with public funds.|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not <b>move,</b> <b>and</b> are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the Bucareli area, and the {{settlers}} chose to move further {{east to the}} old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name.
