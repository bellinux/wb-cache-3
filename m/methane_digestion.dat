However, due to higher efficiency of sewage treatment, more sludge is produced after the treatment process. In the examined sludge treatment plant, primary sludge is gravitationally thickened {{to the content}} of about 5 % of dry matter, and the excessive is thickened in mechanical compactors up to 6 % of dry matter. Settlements preliminary and excessive after compaction is discharged to the sludge tank where a pump is forced into two closed digesters. Each digester has the capacity of 5069 m 3. At a temperature of about 37 °C a mesophilic digestion is performed. Biogas, that is produced in the chamber, is stored in two-coat tanks with the capacity of 1500 m 3 each and after desulphurization with the biosulfex method (which results with obtaining elemental sulphur) it is used as fuel in cogeneration units. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine amount of energy given by sewage sludge in the form of heat during the process of <b>methane</b> <b>digestion</b> (primary and excessive). These amounts were determined on the basis of chemical energy balance of sewage carried into and out of Separate Sludge Digesters and produced biogas within 24 h.

However, an algal facade could also produce electricity if coupled to a photovoltaic (PV) module. Experiments were conducted with a PV module situated behind a flat plate, algal bioreactor to determine the relative power output for such a hybrid facade compared to a PV module without the algal layer. Two container materials were tested (polypropylene and acrylic), for two algal species (a green algae and a coccolithophore), at 4 biomass concentrations. The containers were two rectangular boxes with a volume of 0. 4 liters and 1 liter, corresponding to path lengths (i. e. thicknesses) of 0. 9 cm and 2. 8 cm, respectively. Experimental results were presented as attenuation coefficients versus algal biomass, photovoltaic power output versus scalar irradiance, and modeled power output based on biomass concentration and container thicknesses. The acrylic container transmitted more light than the polypropylene and had statistically lower attenuation coefficients. Water in the both container types had a minor contribution to attenuation while algal concentrations gave high attenuation. The highest attenuation occurred for the green algae and {{was a result of}} increased pigments. The highest coccolithophore concentration, in combination with the shorter path length, produced 95 % of the maximum PV power output. Generally, as attenuation decreased and power output increased with decreasing algal concentration and path length. The amount of light transmitted through the container to the PV module was modeled based on light attenuation by algal biomass and container thickness. Using the model for full sunlight, we determined that with high algal concentrations and realistic facade thicknesses, high power output can be achieved from PV modules in parallel with algal growth. The next step is to build a prototype facade to assess the effect of full sunlight under these design criteria, as well as the effect of heat dissipation by the facade...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} New York through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has {{developed}} a suite of digester projects throughout the state to assess the potential for anaerobic digestion systems to improve manure management and concurrently produce energy through the production of heat and electrical power using the biogas produced from the digesters. Dairies comprise {{a significant part of}} the agribusiness and economy of the state of New York. Improving the energy efficiency and environmental footprint of dairies is a goal of NYSERDA. SUNY Morrisville State College (MSC) is part of a collection of state universities, dairy farms, cooperatives, and municipalities examining anaerobic digestion systems to achieve the goals of NYSERDA, the improvement of manure management, and reducing emissions to local dairy animal sites. The process for siting a digester system at the MSC’s free-stall Dairy Complex was initiated in 2002. The project involved the construction of an anaerobic digester that can accommodate the organic waste generated at Dairy complex located about a mile southeast of the main campus. Support for the project was provided through funding from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. The DOE contribution to the project provided additional resources to construct an expanded facility to handle waste generated from the existing free-stall dairy and the newly-constructed barns. Construction on the project was completed in 2006 and the production of biogas started soon after the tanks were filled with the effluent generated at the Dairy Complex. The system has been in operation since December 17, 2006. The generated biogas was consistently flared starting from December 20, 2006, and until the operation of the internal combustion engine/generator set were first tested on the 9 th of January, 2007. Flaring the biogas continued until the interconnect with the power grid was approved by NYSEG (the electrical power provider) and the combined heat and power generation (CHP) system was authorized to start on February 27, 2007. The system has been in operation since February 28, 2007, and is generating 45 to 50 kW of electrical power on continuous basis. The completed project will ultimately allow for investigating the facility of utilizing organic waste from a dairy operation in a hard-top plug-flow methane digester with the ultimate goal of reducing environmental risk, increasing economic benefits, and demonstrating the viability of an anaerobic <b>methane</b> <b>digestion</b> system. Many benefits are expected as a result of the completed project including our better understanding of the anaerobic digestion process and its management as well as the facility to utilize the methane digester as a demonstration site for dairy producers, farmers, and organic waste producers in New York State and the Northeast. Additional benefits include helping current and future students in dairy science and technology, agricultural business, environmental sciences, agricultural engineering, and other disciplines develop better understanding of underutilized biomass alternative energy technologies, environmental conservation, environmental stewardship, and sustainable agriculture...|$|E

The objective {{of this research was}} to enhance the anaerobic biodegradability and methane yields from different biowastes (food waste, yard waste, and digested biowaste already treated in a full-scale biogas plant (DRANCO, Belgium)) by assessing thermal wet oxidation. The biodegradability of the waste was evaluated by using biochemical methane potential assays and continuous 3 -L methane reactors. Wet oxidation temperature and oxygen pressure (T, 185 − 220 °C; O 2 pressure, 0 − 12 bar; t, 15 min) were varied for their effect on total <b>methane</b> yield and <b>digestion</b> kinetics of digested biowaste.

Higher oxygen pressure during wet oxidation of digested biowaste considerably increased the total <b>methane</b> yield and <b>digestion</b> kinetics and permitted lignin utilization during a subsequent second digestion.

The advantages of PEF are low energy requirement due to very short duration (100  μs) of pulse time and the treatment {{can be carried out}} at ambient conditions. Also, the PEF instrument is simple in design due to lack of moving parts (Kumar et al. 2009). Salerno et al.

Switchgrass showed higher neutral red uptake at field strength ≥ 8  kV/cm while woodchip showed similar results at 10  kV/cm. Electric field strength and pulse duration are the two interdependent processing parameters affecting electroporation through PEF.

The methane production rate reached up to 0. 0564 m(3) methane/(m(3) reactor*d) in the hybrid reactor at room temperature, which was nearly double than that of the control anaerobic reactor (0. 0259 m(3) methane/(m(3) reactor*d)) without bioelectrochemical device. Microbial community analysis revealed that hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium dominated the cathode biofilm, which was the predominant contributor to accelerate the methane production rate from WAS. While acetoclastic methanogen Methanosaeta was enriched in the sludge phase of all reactors, shifts of {{the microbial}} community structure of the biocathode was in significant correlation with the methane production. This study suggested a potential way to utilize a bioelectrochemical system with the regulated microbial community to enhance methane production from WAS...|$|R
40|$|Volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFA) {{are among the}} most {{abundant}} organic compounds found in animal manure and act as important intermediates in the production of <b>methane</b> under anaerobic <b>digestion</b> (AD). However, VFA also contribute to odor emissions from manure. Anaerobic digestion and separation of solids may help to reduce odor pollution during manure storage and subsequent land application by reducing VFA concentrations. ^ Little information about the characteristics and concentrations of VFA in dairy manure related to AD is available. This thesis presents the results of VFA production during two three-month storage studies of dairy manure collected from four different sources on a dairy: a dairy barn (raw manure), the inlet of an anaerobic digester (AD influent), the digester outlet (AD effluent), and the effluent following solids separation (SS effluent). Significant temporal and spatial variations in VFA concentrations were observed in both studies. Results showed AD significantly reduced the formation of VFA in the effluent, and additional reductions occurred from separation of solids. This study revealed that the complexity of VFA characteristics made it difficult to reliably model and predict the concentrations and compositions of VFA in dairy manure. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} conversion of biomass into <b>methane</b> during anaerobic <b>digestion</b> {{has been studied}} by many researchers in recent years. In this study, optimization of methane composition during chemical oxygen demand removal was observed in a multi-stage Anaerobic Bioreactor. Synthetic glucose {{was used as a}} feed substrate, and the reactor was operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1 – 4 d. Complementary experimental and theoretical test procedures were evaluated for methane optimization. The theoretical methane was recorded as 50. 13, 50. 02, 50. 16, and 50. 22 % for an HRT of 4, 3, 2, and 1 d, respectively. However, the quantity of methane determined experimentally was significantly lower than the theoretical predictions; this was likely due to the microorganism activity in the reactor that may have interfered with the efficiency of the biogas generation. Experimental data showed a decrease in the methane composition (35. 4, 21. 2, 19. 8, and 18. 4 % for HRT of 4, 3, 2, and 1 d, respectively) in the reactor system. Thus, the theoretical formula and experimental data together provide an alternative method for the evaluation of bioenergy potential in anaerobic digestion...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Energy Conversion and Management and the definitive published version is available at [URL] carbonisation (HTC) has the capability to convert wet biomass such as sewage sludge to a lignite-like renewable solid fuel of high calorific value. However, to date assessment of the energy efficiency of the HTC process has not been fully investigated. In this work, mass and energy balances of semi-continuous HTC of faecal waste conducted at 200 °C and at a reaction time of 30 min are presented. This analysis is based on recovering steam from the process as well as energy from the solid fuel (hydrochar) and <b>methane</b> from <b>digestion</b> of the liquid product. The effect of the feedstock solids content and the quantity of feed on the mass and energy balance were investigated. The heat of reaction was measured at 200 °C for 4 h using wet faecal sludge, and the higher heating value was determined for the hydrochar. The results indicated that preheating the feed to 100 °C using heat recovered from the process would significantly reduce the energy input to the reactor by about 59 %, and decreased the heat loss from the reactor by between 50 % and 60 %. For feedstocks containing 15 – 25 % solids (for all feed rates), after the process is in operation, energy recycled from the flashing off of steam and combustion of the hydrochar and would be sufficient for preheating the feed, operating the reactor and drying the wet hydrochar {{without the need for}} any external sources of energy. Alternatively, for a feedstock containing 25 % solids for all feed rates, energy recycled from the flashing off of steam and combustion of the methane provides sufficient energy to operate the entire process with an excess energy of about 19 – 21 % which could be used for other purposes...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} three-stage {{methane fermentation}} system {{was developed to}} digest food waste effi-ciently. This system consisted of three stages: semianaerobic hydrolysis, anaerobic acidogenesis and strictly anaerobic methanogenesis. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} temperature and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the methanogenesis. Operation temperature was adjusted from 30 °C to 55 °C, and the HRTs ranged from 8 to 12 d. The rate of soluble chemical oxygen de-mand (sCOD) removal correlated with digestion time according to the first-order kinetic model developed by Grau et al. [Water Res., 9, 637 – 642 (1975) ]. With liquor food waste, thermophilic di-gesters showed a higher rate of sCOD removal than mesophilic digesters. The rates of biogas and methane production by thermophilic digesters were higher than those by mesophilic digesters re-gardless of HRT. Although maximum biogas production occurred when an HRT of 10 d was used, the methane yield was the highest in the reactor when an HRT of 12 d was used (223 l CH 4 /kg sCODdegraded). However, digestion stability decreased when an HRT of 8 d was used. The concen-tration of NH 3 -N generated in this experiment did not inhibit anaerobic digestion.

40|$|When {{properly}} designed, pretreatment {{may enhance}} the methane potential and/or anaerobic digestion rate, allowing better digester performance. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to give guidelines and present a rationale on pretreatment techniques of the main types of waste used in biogas plants. The pretreatment strategies proposed are supported by a literature review and the experience of three research groups working on this topic: INRA-LBE, UPC and FORTH. Thermal pretreatment should be recommended for waste activated sludge as it increases its <b>methane</b> potential and <b>digestion</b> rate, it allows sludge sanitation and the necessary heat energy is produced on-site. In the case of microalgae, thermal pretreatment has shown to be the most effective in terms of biomass solubilization and methane yield improvement. As for sewage sludge, the heat needed is produced on-site, although depending on pretreatment conditions biomass thickening or dewatering could be required. Saponification is a pretreatment which is preferred to solubilize fatty residues and to increase their bioavailability in the digesters. For fatty residues originating from slaughterhouses, classified as category II waste, this pretreatment can be optimized to ensure both sterilization and solubilization in the same process. For lignocellulosic biomass, the first aim of pretreatment should be delignification, for which alkali pretreatments are effective. Postprint (published version...|$|R
