5|$|After the Iron Age {{occupation}} {{may have}} {{continued into the}} Roman era indicated by the discovery of pottery fragments, a small stone statue of Mars possibly from a Roman temple and coins of Claudius Gothicus and Valentinian II. The site <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been occupied into the Anglo-Saxon period. Several of the finds were uncovered during excavations by Harold St George Gray in 1922, although the coin dating from around 370 was discovered in 1945 and a Romano-British relief in the inner defensive ditch in 1974. The relief was given to North Somerset Museum, and loaned to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been working on this {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E

5|$|The {{outer limit}} of the Oort cloud defines the cosmographical {{boundary}} of the Solar System {{and the extent of}} the Sun's Hill sphere. The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to the Solar System, and thus is easily affected by the gravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but some <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> originated from the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|According to {{government}} surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been fairly common in 1843. Slater {{reported that he}} saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, {{have been the last}} of the species alive.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E

5|$|Like Bakerian mimicry, Dodsonian mimicry {{is a form}} of {{reproductive}} floral mimicry, but the model belongs to a different species than the mimic. The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson. By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense (Orchidaceae) resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica, and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds. Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> pollinators of its own though. For example, a lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the infection if the results are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E
50|$|Even though, Andrew Ehrenberg's work on brand {{portfolios}} {{has shown}} that consumers may regularly switch brands - for variety - they <b>may</b> <b>still</b> retain {{an image of the}} brand; which will swing the balance when their next purchase decision is taken.

5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{stabilization}} to ISS (input-to-state stability) issue for discrete-time impulsive hybrid systems (DIHS) with mixed K -dissipativity property. Firstly, the new concept of mixed K -dissipativity is proposed for DIHS. Then, {{the criteria of}} stabilization {{in the sense of}} ISS are derived for mixed K -dissipative DIHS. It shows that for a mixed K -dissipative DIHS, under the same state feedback control, even if all subsystems have no ISS, the whole DIHS <b>may</b> <b>still</b> <b>has</b> ISS property. The results are then used to study the case of network via impulsive interconnections. The linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions for K -dissipativity of every DIHS in the network under the mixed quadratic supply rate are derived. Moreover, the interconnection control is designed to stabilize the network to ISS. Finally, one example is given for illustration. © 2011 Chinese Assoc of Automati. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
