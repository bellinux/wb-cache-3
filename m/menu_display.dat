50|$|The Wordtank {{series is}} a line of Japanese {{electronic}} dictionaries manufactured by Canon. Although officially only sold in Japan, several of the multi-language models are popular among students of the Japanese language around the world. The ability to change <b>menu</b> <b>display</b> options to English {{on many of the}} Wordtank models is cited as a reason for the relatively wide foreign adoption. The ability to highlight an entire Japanese word (as opposed to just one character) and display a hiragana rendering of it is unique to the Wordtank series and is an extremely popular function for advanced learners. This function applies to all Wordtank models. One of the latest Wordtank models, the G70, offers this function for over 400,000 words.|$|E

40|$|The Control Point Library Building System (CPLBS) is an interactive, {{menu driven}} system which permits a user to {{accurately}} identify features in image data by simultaneously viewing {{a map and}} a vidicon display of the image data through a Zoom Transfer Scope, extract and store features in disk-resident libraries, and perform utility functions necessary to maintain and update the generated libraries. It was developed to permit the generation of control point libraries needed by the Master Data Processor (MDP) to perform highly accurate geometric corrections to Landsat MSS and RBV earth image data. Both CPLBS and MDP were developed by IBM under contract to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and delivered in January 1979. The CPLBS includes newly developed techniques for accurately locating control points which will perform consistently well in correlation uses, and for storing, updating, and refining sets of control points. It incorporates these techniques in a production system hosted on the MDP hardware, which includes a high-speed arithmetic processor, high-density asynchronous tape drives, and a large (1900 mbyte) on-line disk storage capacity. A Ramtek 9300 Display System and an IBM 3270 Display Station provide image and <b>menu</b> <b>display</b> capability. This paper describes the host computer and special image viewing equipment, {{as well as the}} processing, accuracy, and throughput of the CPLBS, and the structure of the generated libraries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of a project {{examining}} the impact of typeface design on glance behavior away from the roadway when a driver interacts with a multi-line <b>menu</b> <b>display</b> designed to model a text-rich automotive human machine interface (HMI). Data from two studies are considered. Across the two studies, usable data was collected from 82 participants ranging from 36 to 75 years of age in a driving simulation experiment in which participants {{were asked to respond to}} a series of address, restaurant identification, and content search menus that were implemented using two different typeface designs. The second study served as a replication of the first with the sole exception that the brightness of the display screen was changed. Across the two studies, among men, a “humanist ” typeface resulted in a 10. 6 % lower visual demand as measured by total glance time as compared to the “square grotesque ” typeface. Total response time and number of glances required to complete a response showed similar patterns. Interestingly, the impact of different typeface style was either more modest or not apparent for women on these variables. Error rates for both males and females were 3. 1 % less for the humanist typeface. This research suggests that optimizing typeface characteristics may be viewed as a simple and effective method of providing a significant reduction in interface demand and associated distractions. Future work will need to assess if other typeface characteristics can be tuned to provide further reductions in demand. 1...|$|E
40|$|As {{the twenty-first}} century approaches, {{hospital}} foodservice directors {{are faced with the}} conflicting tasks of cutting costs in response to various budgetary restraints while also providing quality service to customers with increased expectations in an increasing competitive environment. New technologies such as computerized, interactive menu systems have been developed in an attempt to offer increased customer satisfaction while also cutting costs at all levels. The focus {{of this study was to}} determine how hospitals nationwide were responding to the dilemma of cost cutting while achieving increased quality standards and in what ways technologies were being embraced to provide service excellence at cost savings. The study sought to identify the most commonly utilized menu systems in US hospitals and to identify trends in the use of recent technologies for such menu systems. Questionnaires were sent to 300 hospitals from 41 states and Washington, DC. Programs and routines in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS-X, version 2. 1, 1986, SPSS, Chicago, IL) were used for all data analyses. One hundred and thirty-five (47 %) of questionnaires sent were returned. Results indicated that 3 of the 135 respondents were utilizing automated <b>menu</b> <b>display</b> systems, the majority (70 %) of hospitals were still utilizing handwritten methods for recording menu choices. Of automated systems utilized for recording menu choices, 12. 6 % were using a computer in the diet office, 3 % were using hand-held computers, 2. 2 % were using voice activated computers, and 0. 7 % were using scanners. The question was not applicable for 9. 6 % of respondents who offered a non-select menu, and 1. 5 % of hospitals who indicated that they serve meals immediately as ordered. The majority of respondents indicated that they were somewhat satisfied with their current menu system regardless of whether or not they had an automated system in place. Most respondents indicated that they would consider automation in the future...|$|E

40|$|The aging population, one of {{the fastest}} growing age groups in the United States, is an {{audience}} that graphic designers and visual communicators often fail to address. Fast-food menu displays are just one example of a design that may not meet the needs of a senior clientele. This study consolidates and summarizes a variety of literature relevant to the design needs of an aging population.;This study then poses four research questions: (1) How can we design a fast-food menu for the aging eye? (2) How can a designer understand the functional problems associated with the visual and motor deficits of the older population? (3) What colors do elderly have difficulty seeing? What typeface is easiest to see at a distance? (4) What size does that typeface have to be in order for it to be read without any difficulty?;By considering the changes that occur as the eye ages, the fast-food industry could take a giant step forward. Two basic conditions must be met in order to make fast-food menu displays more legible and effective. The first condition is that the material (text 2 ̆ 6 photographs) on the menu should be both visible and legible. The second condition is that the items on the menu must be easily understood. To test the current fast-food menu displays, 90 individuals responded to a questionnaire. The questionnaire provided data that begins to reveal how people order food from the menus at fast-food restaurants. The same questionnaire also collected some qualitative data regarding individuals 2 ̆ 7 overall impressions of fast-food menu design. The outdoor menu displays of four drive-thru fast-food restaurants were also evaluated and analyzed based on criteria established by the literature review.;Results from the study provided some answers about what individuals like and want in the designs of fast-food menus. Speed and consistency were two suggestions that were reported by multiple respondents on the surveys. Also, there seemed to be a strong preference for pictures. The findings from the menu analysis show that there is not a universal standard in terms of outdoor fast-food <b>menu</b> <b>display</b> design.;The purpose of this line of research is to produce some preliminary guidelines for the structure, organization, and design layout of outdoor drive-thru fast-food menu displays.
