40|$|We {{calculate}} the collective charge density excitation dispersion and spectral weight in bilayer semiconductor structures including effects of interlayer tunneling. The out-of-phase plasmon mode (the “acoustic ” plasmon) develops a long wavelength {{gap in the}} presence of tunneling with the gap being proportional to the square root (linear power) of the tunneling amplitude in the weak (strong) tunneling limit. The in-phase plasmon mode is qualitatively unaffected by tunneling. The predicted plasmon gap should be a useful tool for studying many-body effects. PACS Number: 73. 20. Mf, 73. 20. Dx, 71. 45. Gm, 71. 45. -d 1 Collective charge density excitations (or, equivalently plasmon modes) in bilayer structures have attracted a great deal of theoretical and experimental attention over the last sixteen years ever since the existence of an undamped acoustic (i. e., with a long wavelength dispersion linear in wave vector) plasmon mode was predicted [1] in semiconductor double quantum well systems. In an uncoupled bilayer system, ignoring any interlayer Coulomb interaction, each layer can support a two dimensional (2 D) plasma mode [2] with a long wavelength (q → 0) dispersion ω ∼ q 1 / 2 where q ≡ |q|, and q is the 2 D wave vector. When the two layers are near each other (separated by a distance d in the z-direction with the 2 D layers in the x-y plane), the 2 D plasmons are coupled by the interlayer Coulomb interaction leading to the formation [1] of in-phase and out-of-phase interlayer density fluctuation modes ω±: an out-of-phase acoustic plasmon mode, ω − ∼ q, where the densities in the two layers fluctuate out of phase with a linear wave vector dispersion, and an in-phase optical plasmon mode, ω+ ∼ q 1 / 2, where the densities in the two layers fluctuate in phase with the usual 2 D plasma dispersion. These ω ± modes have been observed [3, 4] in double layer semiconductor quantum well systems via inelastic light scattering spectroscopic experiments, and the observation of the ω − ∼ q mode in GaAs-AlGaAs multilayer systems is, in fact, the only unambiguous direct experimental observation of an acoustic plasmon mode in solid state plasmas in spite of the theoretical literature on the subject going back <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> <b>year...</b>|$|R
40|$|For <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>forty</b> {{thousand}} <b>years</b> Aboriginal {{people of}} Australia have been confronted with major climate, ecological and geological changes {{as well as}} annual seasonal variations. Many of these changes have been captured in the cultural traditions of Maar (the people) of the south-west Victorian coast and the knowledge has been transferred {{from generation to generation}} through Dreaming stories. Many Dreaming stories recount the forming of the coastal landscape and Sea Country. Weather patterns and climate change were gauged by the occurrence of natural events such as the tidal changes, sea level rise, landscape changes, behaviour of animals, and the availability of food sources. Can this ancient knowledge provide answers for adaptation and resilience to a rapid changing climate? Drawing upon recent literature on coastal climate change in the Great Ocean Road Region (GORCC, 2012), literature review of indigenous environmental planning (Kooyang Sea Country Plan, 2004), and investigation of settlement patterns of the Wathaurong and Gadubanud people, this paper reviews the changes in the landscape due to climate change and explores traditional knowledge as input to a potential design based adaptation model for coastal settlements of the Great Ocean Road Region...|$|R
