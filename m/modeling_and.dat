In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} <b>modeling</b> <b>and</b> sampling.

Although the shifting weather conditions themselves negatively affect bees, the link between colony collapse and climate change is also {{closely tied to the}} interaction between bees’ climatic niches and food-plant reductions. Climate change affects the floral environment by stunting flower development and nectar production, which in turn directly impacts colonies’ abilities to collect pollen and sustain themselves.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{develops}} a descriptive-conceptual {{overview of the}} main <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards of processes formulated in the systems engineering (SE), software engineering (SwE) and information systems (IS) disciplines. Given the myriad of <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards reported, the convergence suggested for the SE <b>and</b> SwE <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards and the increasing complexity of the modern information systems, we argue that these ones become relevant in the information systems discipline. Firstly, we report the ratio- nale for having <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards of processes in SE, SwE and IS. Secondly, we review their main Overview of <b>Models</b> <b>and</b> Standards of Processes in the SE, SwE, and IS Disciplines characteristics. Thirdly, based on the identified aims and principles, we report and posit the concepts of process, system and service as conceptual building blocks for describing such <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards. Finally, initial theoretical and practical implications for the information systems discipline of such <b>models</b> <b>and</b> standards are discussed, as well as recommendations for further research are suggested...|$|R
