40|$|Steer-by-wire systems provide {{drivers with}} the {{opportunity}} to personalize steering settings in vehicles. Studies conducted in the past have indicated that preferences for steering effort, one of the factors which affect steering feel, vary based on individual differences that include factors such as age, gender and driving style. These differences have mostly been established by subjective evaluations and comparative studies, where participants were unable to <b>modify</b> <b>steering</b> effort actively while driving a vehicle. This paper describes an experiment conducted on a driving simulator designed with a user interface that allows participants to actively <b>modify</b> <b>steering</b> effort settings on the steering wheel, to investigate the effect of gender on preferences for desired steering effort and personalization of future steering systems. Participants in the study performed multiple driving tasks on the simulator while interacting with the user interface to vary steering effort and subsequently reported their preferred level.

50|$|The first variant from May 1937 was the {{original}} Š-IIc. It {{was supposed to be}} fitted with a new engine, built especially for it by the automobile factory branch of Škoda in Mladá Boleslav, but the engine development got delayed and the prototype was (in order to save time) fitted with a 190 hp 13-liter V6, originally intended for the Š-III breakthrough tank prototype. The prototype was also fitted with a mock weaponry (representing a 47mm gun and 2 machineguns). But the engine was not powerful enough, overheated and used a lot of fuel. In September 1937, the V6 engine was removed and {{the original}} Škoda engine intended for it was installed. The vehicle however still didn’t do too well (the engine actually seized and had to be scrapped) and the tests were stopped in November, marking the end of the 1st development stage of T-21. By that time, the Ministry of Defence committee was looking for a suitable Czechoslovak medium tank for the army, but the Š-IIc did not to make the June 1938 army tests deadline - {{and that was the end}} of the T-21 as a potential Czechoslovak army medium tank. From June to November 1938, the prototype was modified further in Pilsen, thus creating a third (and final) variant of the original Š-IIc design (not counting the further modifications, made by Hungarians - the Turán tank is basically a Š-IIc copy, with partial improvements). This third variant had (apart from the fixed engine of the same type the 2nd variant had) better tracks, improved engine cooling, improved oil pump and <b>modified</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rear-wheel drive}} K {{platform}} was based closely {{on the very}} similar 4th generation GM X platform, and 2nd generation F-bodies of the 1970s, all of which shared many components (control arms, springs, steering linkage and associated steering gear) in common. The K platform stretched the X platform to 114.3 inch wheelbase, but also improved isolation from sources of structure borne vibration in the drivetrain and suspension. While automobiles built on these three platforms had different bodies, they shared the same unibody construction technology using a separable elastomer isolated front subframe assembly, a design which first appeared in GM vehicles on the 1st generation X platform in 1962 on the Chevy II. Automobiles built on these three platforms (F, K, and X) also shared front and rear suspension systems, with tunings engineered to each application. The front suspensions used unequal length A-arms, coil springs damped with tubular hydraulic shock absorbers, ball joints, elastomer bushings, and recirculating ball steering boxes differing in ratios that were specific to the application. The rear suspension design used a live axle (solid axle - which was a GM corporate 10 bolt differential with an 8.5" [...] ring gear) located by leaf springs (shared with the 1968-74 and 1975-79 X platform) damped with tubular hydraulic shock absorbers. Rear disc brakes were standard equipment in 1977 - this design later ended up with some 1979-81 Pontiac Trans Ams with the WS6 option. At {{the same time the}} rear disc brakes were made standard equipment the front brakes received a <b>modified</b> <b>steering</b> knuckle which used a 12-inch disc brake rotor (shared with the GM B platform station wagons and C/D platform except limousines and commercial chassis) - the wheel bolt pattern was changed from the GM 5 x 4.75 (used with Chevrolets and lower end BOP automobiles) to the 5 on 5 bolt pattern used {{with the rest of the}} Cadillac RWD lineup (also with higher end BOP automobiles and Chevrolet/GMC 1/2 ton light duty trucks, vans, and SUVs).|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{performing}} accurate path maneuvering tasks in planar space is investigated in thesis. The {{purpose is to}} utilize limited knowledge about the vehicle's maneuverability constraints to output feasible reference signals. Acceleration limitations of the vehicle {{have been used in}} an algorithm that determines forward speeds in such way that a predefined path can be followed at high speeds. The algorithm ensures that the speed is reduced before acute turns. Furthermore, an existing steering law has been modified to dynamically take the limitations of the vehicle into consideration when determining the desired course. This <b>modified</b> <b>steering</b> law exhibits desirable convergence characteristics toward the desired path. A complete guidance system, which combines the path convergence algorithm with the path speed algorithm, has been proposed. This system is able to rapidly converge to the desired path and follow this path, even for paths where the curvature is large. The <b>modified</b> <b>steering</b> law has been combined with a path-tracking speed controller. The path-tracking speed controller makes sure the vehicle can track a target on a predefined path. The resulting path-tracking system is able to follow a leader vehicle's path by creating accurate paths online from periodically sampled positions. A method for creating feasible U-turns in a lawn-mower pattern has been proposed. For a given vehicle speed, the resulting path obeys angular speed and angular acceleration constraints. Finally, the proposed algorithms are tested in simulations to illustrate their behavior and usefulness. </p...|$|E

When the desired signal is strong in the auxiliary elements the amount of interference suppression decreases. The amount of degradation depends on the number of interfering signals incident on the communication system. A <b>modified</b> <b>steering</b> vector which overcomes this problem is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Turning {{the body}} towards a new {{direction}} is normally achieved via a top-down synergy whereby gaze (eye direction in space) leads the upper body segments, which in turn lead the feet. These anticipatory eye movements are observable even in darkness and constraining the initial eye movements modifies the stereotyped top-down reorientation sequence. Our aim was to elucidate the relative contributions of vision and eye movements to whole-body coordination during large standing turns by observing the effects of separately removing visual information or suppressing eye movements throughout the turn. We predicted that constraining eye movements would <b>modify</b> the <b>steering</b> synergy, whereas removing vision would have little effect. We found that preventing eye movements modified both timing and spatial characteristics of axial segment and feet rotation. When gaze was fixed, gait initiation, but not axial segment rotation, was delayed in comparison to both full vision and no vision turns. When eye movements were prevented, the predictable relationship between the extent head rotation led the body and peak head angular velocity was abolished suggesting that anticipatory head movements normally subserve gaze behaviour. In addition, stepping frequency significantly reduced during the gaze fixation condition but not during the no-vision condition, suggesting that oculomotor control is linked to stepping behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} proposed Interferometric Neighboring Fracture (INF) localization method places {{unique and}} demanding constraints on relative travel time measurement accuracy and precision, while sampling {{a function of}} relative travel times between pairs of microseismic events as measured along a linear array. Conducting two synthetic trials, I analyze the relationship between event-receiver geometry and relative travel time measurement error {{and its effect on}} the feasibility of INF localization. The results indicate that even for typical hydraulic fracturing monitoring geometries, measurement error can exceed the feasible error limits of INF localization.

Analyzing synthetic data sets with varying SNR ratios, and a field recorded microseismic data set, I compare the performance of PTE-preprocessed MAS to conventional cross-correlation (CXC). Results of both synthetic and field recorded data analysis indicate that PTE enhanced MAS outperforms CXC as a general lag measurement technique, reducing average lag error by as much as 1. 25 ms at SNRs below 10.

Our approach <b>modifies</b> the beam <b>steering</b> pattern of conven-tional sliding spotlight-mode systems and randomizes it such that with each pulse the beam illuminates a different, randomly chosen, part of the imaged area. The randomization allows the acquisition of the area of interest with a significantly larger effective aperture compared to the conventional sliding spotlight mode and, therefore, with significantly larger resolution. The reconstruction estimates the signal using a model that combines a sparse and a dense compo-nent. This model captures the structure of SAR images better than conventional sparse models, typically used in CS, and provides su-perior reconstruction performance.
