500|$|After {{returning}} to San Clemente, California, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, La Casa Pacifica, Pat Nixon rarely appeared {{in public and}} only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them. I am happy {{to tell you that}} I'm not gone—I <b>mean,</b> <b>not</b> really gone."

500|$|The Act {{gave the}} courts near-unlimited {{discretion}} to approve [...] "compromise" [...] agreements, {{for the benefit}} of infants or other incapable individuals, for individuals who may become beneficiaries, or for unborn beneficiaries. The courts are also able to approve agreements for individuals who may be beneficiaries under protective trusts, with no requirement that the alterations be for their benefit. The courts have interpreted the Act's scope fairly widely, stating that almost any [...] "variation" [...] is acceptable, and that [...] "benefit" [...] may <b>mean</b> <b>not</b> just a financial benefit, but also a social or moral one. Despite initial fears that it would allow tax planners another way to hide funds and create a back-and-forth fight between the Chancery Division and Parliament, the Act was met with general approval. The ability of the courts to alter trustees' investment powers under the Act was criticised as slow and expensive, and as a result this is now covered by the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E

[...] There is no evidence that jobs numbers under the Obama administration were manipulated. FiveThirtyEight's Ben Casselman noted that [...] "manipulating the jobs figures... would <b>mean</b> <b>not</b> just messing with one number but rather interfering with an entire ecosystem of statistics" [...] and [...] "would require a conspiracy theory of massive proportions, involving hundreds if not thousands of people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term peacemakers has {{traditionally}} been interpreted to <b>mean</b> <b>not</b> only {{those who live in}} peace with others, but also those who do their best to promote friendship among mankind and between God and man. St. Gregory of Nyssa interpreted it as [...] "Godly work", which was an imitation of God's love of man. John Wesley said the peacemakers 'endeavour to calm the stormy spirits of men, to quiet their turbulent passions, to soften the minds of contending parties, and, if possible, reconcile them to each other. They use all innocent arts, and employ all their strength, all the talents which God has given them, as well to preserve peace where it is, as to restore it where it is not.' ...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 June 2010, {{following}} England's {{departure from}} the 2010 FIFA World Cup competition in South Africa, the UK's Culture and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the England fans for their behaviour during the competition, saying [...] "I <b>mean,</b> <b>not</b> a single arrest for a football-related offence, and the terrible problems {{that we had in}} Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s seem now to be behind us." [...] He later apologised and said [...] "I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and the families of those killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence."

2500|$|Șăineanu also {{commented on}} the alleged {{oscillations}} of Tocilescu, who, after agreeing to lead the History section upon its recommended division, and supporting his Jewish colleague for chairmanship of the Letters section, threw his support behind Urechia. Nastasă, who mentions the scheming {{on the part of}} Urechia and Tocilescu, cites Moses Gaster's letter to Șăineanu, which defined Tocilescu as a double-crosser, [...] "a filthy twicer and a bloodsucker". The complications eventually led Șăineanu to present his resignation, and Maiorescu to accept it. He recalled: [...] "Every reasonable man would doubtlessly assume that [...] the resentment Mr. Urechia held against this unfortunate nomination would have been appeased. To assume thus would <b>mean</b> <b>not</b> to know the person or the Romanian social environment well enough, for barely two months had passed before grandiose patriotism again displayed the effects of its hatred." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reason for}} this {{classification}} of all Mizrahim under Sephardi rite is that most Mizrahi communities use much the same religious rituals as Sephardim proper due to historical reasons. The prevalence of the Sephardi rite among Mizrahim is partially a result of Sephardim proper joining some of Mizrahi communities following the 1492 Alhambra Decree, which expelled Jews from Sepharad (Spain and Portugal). Over the last few centuries, the previously distinctive rites of the Mizrahi communities were influenced, superimposed upon or altogether replaced by the rite of the Sephardim, perceived as more prestigious. Even before this assimilation, the original rite of many Jewish Oriental communities was already closer to the Sephardi rite than to the Ashkenazi one. For this reason, [...] "Sephardim" [...] has come to <b>mean</b> <b>not</b> only [...] "Spanish Jews" [...] proper but [...] "Jews of the Spanish rite", just as [...] "Ashkenazim" [...] is used for [...] "Jews of the German rite", {{whether or not their}} families originate in Germany.|$|E
