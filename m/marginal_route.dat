40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project was to {{investigate}} the impact of IV and PO routes difference for MDZ, a prototypical CYP 3 A substrate, and two CYP 3 A inhibitors (CYP 3 AI) -FLZ and ERY-, on the magnitude and time course of their inhibitory metabolic DDI. Individual semi-PBPK models for MDZ, FLZ and ERY were developed and validated separately, using pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters from clinical/in-vitro studies and published physiological parameters. Subsequently, DDI sub-models between MDZ and CYP 3 AIs incorporated non-competitive and mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) for FLZ and ERY, respectively, on hepatic and gut wall (GW) CYP 3 A metabolism of MDZ, using available in-vitro/in-vivo information. Model-simulated MDZ PK profiles were compared with observed data from available clinical PK and DDI studies, by visual predictive check and exposure metrics comparison. DDI magnitude and time course for CYP 3 AI (IV vs. PO) followed by MDZ (IV vs. PO) at various time points were predicted by the validated semi-PBPK-DDI models. Two hypothetical CYP 3 A substrates and four CYP 3 AI (derived from MDZ, FLZ and ERY, with GW metabolism removed, hepatic metabolism reduced, or oral bioavailability (Foral) and/or elimination half-life (t 1 / 2) modified) were also simulated to generalize conclusions. The final semi-PBPK-DDI models predict well the PK profiles for IV/PO MDZ in absence/presence of IV/PO CYP 3 AI, with deviations between model-predicted and observed exposure metrics within 30 %. Prospective simulations demonstrate that: 1) CYP 3 A substrates, e. g., MDZ, are consistently more sensitive to metabolic inhibition after PO than after IV administration, due to pre-systemic hepatic and/or GW metabolism. For substrates without GW metabolism and limited hepatic metabolism, only a <b>marginal</b> <b>route</b> difference for substrate administration is observed. 2) For high-Foral CYP 3 AIs, e. g., FLZ, no inhibitor IV-PO route DDI differences are expected, unless they are given simultaneously with PO MDZ. 3) For low-Foral CYP 3 AIs, e. g., ERY, greater inhibition is expected after IV than after PO administration for IV MDZ, but is difficult to predict for PO MDZ. 4) In addition to Foral and plasma t 1 / 2 of CYP 3 AIs, the DDI onset, peak and duration are determined by their oral absorption rate and by the resulting hepatic and/or GW concentration profiles relative to Ki for noncompetitive CYP 3 AIs, but by CYP 3 A kinetics (synthesis, degradation rate) for MBI CYP 3 AIs...|$|E

25|$|Qantas {{has stepped}} up the {{expansion}} of Jetstar, with the launch of international services (in addition to existing trans-Tasman and Jetstar Asia flights) to leisure destinations such as Bali, Ho Chi Minh City, Osaka and Honolulu having begun in November 2006. On some routes (such as Sydney–Honolulu) Jetstar supplements existing Qantas operations, but many routes are new to the network. The lower cost base of Jetstar allows the previously unprofitable or <b>marginal</b> <b>routes</b> to be operated at greater profitability.|$|R
5000|$|The Harwich to Esbjerg route ceased on 29 September 2014 due to loss of {{passenger}} traffic. DFDS Seaways {{closed the}} route to cut operating costs {{in order to make}} the company more competitive. Another reason for the closure was an increase to the size of the Sulphur Emission Control Area, which increased companies' fuel costs forcing the closure of <b>marginal</b> <b>routes.</b> The Harwich to Esbjerg route ceased having operated since 1875. This meant that there was no DFDS Seaways route connecting England to Denmark.|$|R
50|$|The Old Colony Railroad was {{acquired}} by the New Haven Railroad in 1893, and the NYY&NE {{was acquired}} two years later. Passenger service ended on the <b>marginal</b> Mansfield-Framingham <b>route</b> in 1933, but the line was retained as a freight route.|$|R
2500|$|The {{idea to have}} a county-owned bus {{company was}} {{launched}} by engineer Emil Astrup, who {{was head of the}} Public Roads Administration in Nord-Trøndelag. He wrote a letter in 1918, where he stated that it would be more operationally efficient and easier to coordinate traffic if the bus routes in the county were merged into a single entity that was controlled by a political body. He also wanted to introduce cross subsidies, where profitable routes on main roads would pay the losses suffered on <b>marginal</b> <b>routes</b> in less populated areas. Negotiations with the four incumbent operators started in 1920, and agreements were made whereby the county would purchase them for [...] The money was borrowed as county-guaranteed bonds. The purchase gave Fylkesbilene 18 cars.|$|R
50|$|Guilford's {{first few}} years were defined by abandonments, labor unrest and strikes, and a {{draconian}} management style that damaged the company's reputation for some time. The railroad struggled financially {{to turn a profit}} and implemented cost-cutting measures. Guilford then began to shrink its system by eliminating <b>marginal</b> low-density <b>routes.</b>|$|R
500|$|The A318 is {{available}} {{with a variety}} of different maximum take-off weights (MTOW) ranging from a , [...] base model to a , [...] version. When equipped with CFM56-5B8/P engines, the A318 {{is available}} with a 123,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. When equipped with CFM56-5B9/P engines, the A318 is available with a 130,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. The lower MTOW enables it to operate regional routes economically while sacrificing range and the higher MTOW allows it to complement other members of the A320 family on <b>marginal</b> <b>routes.</b> The lighter weight of the A318 gives it an operating range 10% greater than the A320, allowing it to serve some routes that the A320 would be unable to: London – New York, Perth–Auckland and Singapore–Tokyo, for instance. Its main use for airlines, however, is on short, low-density hops between medium-sized cities.|$|R
5000|$|However, Darby faced {{extensive}} challenges at LIAT. Alongside high operating costs, {{air travel}} taxes comprising more than 40% of airfares, small populations with low GDP per capita {{and the lack}} of ability to fund Public Service Obligation subsidies for <b>marginal</b> <b>routes,</b> a workforce of 900 had eleven separate trade unions and had suffered from poor morale due to the consequent threat of bankruptcy from cash-flow problems for several years prior to Darby's arrival. Furthermore, he had not anticipated the complexity of three islands with limited budgets having stakes in the airline, with resultant necessity for consensus in decision-making and [...] "lack of clear shareholder direction". However, in April 2009 Darby was dismissed from LIAT over a dispute surrounding his decision to compensate workers for going beyond the call of duty, saying the payments to staffers were not exorbitant and were in the range of EC$1,000 - EC$2,000 (US$375-US$750) a month. The board claimed he had acted above his authority; he later sued successfully for unfair dismissal. He described his three years at LIAT as [...] "fascinating and hard work, but rewarding".|$|R
5000|$|The Railways Act 1921 {{caused the}} [...] "grouping" [...] {{of the main}} line {{railways}} of Great Britain; this took effect {{at the beginning of}} 1923 and all the railways in the area became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) which at the end of February 1924 shut the Maryport carriage waggon and locomotive shops 'one of the industrial mainstays of the town'. This coincided with the steepest decline of the local mining and ironworks industries, and unemployment in Maryport reached 77% in 1931. The local railways were dependent on the prosperity of those industries, and many of the <b>marginal</b> <b>routes</b> became unsustainable. The Mealsgate to Aikbank Junction section closed on 1 August 1921, and the remaining Mealsgate to Aspatria section closed to passengers on 22 September 1930; it closed completely on 1 December 1952. The Derwent branch closed completely on 29 April 1935.Heavy industry in West Cumbria declined post-war, steel-making ceasing in the 1970s, deep-mining of coal in the 1980s, and whilst the main line between Carlisle and Maryport remains in use today the dominant traffic is the passenger service from Carlisle to Whitehaven and (less frequently) Barrow in Furness along the coast.|$|R
40|$|After {{fifteen years}} of little change, Melbourne’s bus {{services}} have altered significantly {{in the last five}} years. Underpinned by policy that supports greater public transport use, reform was driven by three major government programs; SmartBus, minimum standards upgrades and local area service reviews. This paper briefly compares the distribution of each service initiative. Minimum standards upgrades were most widespread, benefiting many middle and outer suburbs. Middle suburbs gained most from SmartBus, especially the City of Manningham where it operates on city as well as orbital routes. And the service reviews were most influential in fringe areas to the west, north and south east. Evaluating the quality of service planning in Melbourne, based on the implementation of recent reviews, is the paper’s main focus. Revised timetables were compared against good planning practice. Significant potential for improved network legibility, efficiency, connectivity with trains and scheduling of multi-route corridors was found and could warrant further work. The extent to which interplay between each program has shaped local networks is also examined. Sometimes programs worked in concert, improving both legibility and service. Other times new routes were simply overlaid on the existing network, reducing legibility and potentially wasting resources. Cases where successful lobbying for <b>marginal</b> <b>routes,</b> unsupported by any program, may have further lowered efficiency are also discussed. The paper concludes that Melbourne has seen significant recent bus service improvements. However it also finds that the quality of service planning has varied and that a more effective network may be possible within existing resources. Key words: service planning, buses, networks, patronag...|$|R
25|$|In the {{meantime}} the divided responsibility {{between the new}} National Coal Board (NCB), operating the collieries and the colliery sidings, the Wemyss Private Railway, and British Railways, led to lack of co-ordination and some railway safety shortcomings. The NCB also engaged in road haulage of pit output in some cases, and already some of the <b>marginal</b> sections of <b>route</b> closed. The mineral output of the area declined in the 1950s, {{and the decline of}} the least productive pits accelerated. Production was to be concentrated on the Michael Colliery, and the next largest producer, the Wellesley, was closed down on 22 July 1967.|$|R
5000|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of Railroads brought the canal boom to a sudden end, providing a quick, scheduled and year round mode of transportation that quickly spread to interconnect the states by the mid-19th century. During the industrialization of the United States after the Civil War, railroads, led by the transcontinental rail system in the 1860s, expanded quickly across the United States to serve industries and the growing cities. During the late 19th century, railroads often had built redundant routes to a competitor's road or built through sparsely populated regions that generated little traffic. These <b>marginal</b> rail <b>routes</b> survived the pricing pressures of competition, {{or the lack of}} revenue generated by low traffic, as long as railroads provided the only efficient economical way to move goods and people across the United States. In addition to the intercity passenger network running on Class I and II railroads, a large network of interurban (trolley or [...] "street running") rail lines extended out from the cities and interchanged passenger and freight traffic with the railroads and also provided competition.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} reading and a {{detailed}} analysis of the new plan of Stockholm (2010) that looks like a plan for sustainable growth. The title of the plan - The Walkable City - hints at some of the strategic choices made in the field to make a city creative, competitive and attractive, based on an efficient public transport system and a large number of urban roads and pedestrian paths, that revitalize <b>marginal</b> <b>routes</b> and better connect residential areas and suburbs. The city of Stockholm has long had started - the previous plan dates back to 1999 - a series of actions and strategies designed to create an urban system more integrated and better connected. The strategies implemented by the new plan will bring the city in a short time to reduce urban density through the gradual expansion of the city center in two strategic nodes located in the suburbs who will make connections to tie together different parts of the city, joining green spaces and urban parks that will bring the city to be truly sustainable. It has been crucial to coordinate the plan with other steering and policy documents that affect urban planning and to publish the planning documents that are of relevance to the detailed development plan and building permits. The aim is for the Stockholm City Plan to act {{as a starting point for}} a continued dialogue with the people of Stockholm and everyone working to develop the city. The City Plan has been drawn up in close partnership with the city’s own administrations and companies. The plan of the city is very attentive to the problems of induced global climate change that is affecting the lives of people and is one of the biggest bets of our time. The city of Stockholm has been working for a long time to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the household and has achieved good success when comparing the results with those of other cities of the world. This work has contributed to declare Stockholm European Green Capital for 2010. The new plan works in synergy with the energy plan that was drawn up in 2008 and which will be reviewed in April next year. In this context it is worth mentioning the ambitious project of the new port still under construction - Stockholm Royal Seaport - located at Norra Djurgarden, suburban area of the city that aims to establish itself as a stand-alone environment in terms of energy and sustainable development...|$|R
25|$|The Crusades {{brought a}} shift in European trade routes that {{accelerated}} the decline of Kievan Rus'. In 1204 {{the forces of the}} Fourth Crusade sacked Constantinople, making the Dnieper trade <b>route</b> <b>marginal.</b> At the same time the Teutonic Knights (of the Northern Crusades) were conquering the Baltic region and threatening the Lands of Novgorod.
