Also kegs have a simple concave bottom whilst the barrel or cask design allows sediment to be retained in the cask. This aspect of keg design means that all the beer in the keg is dispensed, which therefore requires that the beer be processed by filtration, fining or centrifuging, or some combination of these, to prevent sediment formation. Lastly, kegs have straight sides unlike the traditional barrel or cask shape. In order to get the beer out of a keg and into a customer's glass, it can be forced out with gas pressure, although if air or gas at low pressure is admitted {{to the top of the}} keg it can also be dispensed using a traditional hand pump at the bar.|$|E
40|$|OVERVIEW: Independent {{storage of}} spent fuel away from {{nuclear power plants}} is {{required}} until it can be reprocessed. We plan to use a dual-purpose dry <b>metal</b> <b>cask</b> for transport and storage for this interim storage. Regulations, guide lines, and standards are being developed to achieve this around 2010. Hitachi has developed this cask to maximize number of loaded spent fuel to reduce frequency of transportation. As economical efficiency and long-term reliability were also sought, an easy-to-fabricate structure was adopted {{in order to prevent}} deterioration. A 1 / 3 scale-model drop test was done to evaluate the integrity of elements and total function and to confirm safety. Moreover, a 1 / 1 scale-model dual-purpose transport and storage dry-type <b>metal</b> <b>cask</b> was fabricated, inspected and tested, which would be required at the actual cask fabrication stage.

Some of the testing procedures that are completed are a water spray to simulate a severe rainstorm and also dropping the container from different heights.

40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} integrity of a dual-purpose <b>metal</b> <b>cask</b> currently under development by the Korea Radioactive Waste Agency (KORAD) was evaluated, through numerical simulations {{and a model}} test, under high-speed missile impact reflecting targeted aircraft crash conditions. The impact conditions were carefully chosen through a survey on accident cases and recommendations from literature. In the impact scenario, a missile flying horizontally hits the top side of the cask, which is freestanding on a concrete pad, with a velocity of 150  m/s. A simplified missile simulating a commercial aircraft engine was designed from an impact load–time function available in literature. In the analyses, the dynamic behavior of the <b>metal</b> <b>cask</b> {{and the integrity of}} the containment boundary were assessed. The simulation results were compared with the test results for a 1 : 3 scale model. Although the dynamic behavior of the cask in the model test did not match exactly with the prediction from the numerical simulation, other structural responses, such as the acceleration and strain history during the impact, showed very good agreement. Moreover, the containment function of the cask survived the missile impact as expected from the numerical simulation. Thus, the procedure and methodology adopted in the structural numerical analyses were successfully validated...|$|E

Dry storage of fuel with zirconium alloy cladding has been licensed in Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Switzerland. In addition, dry storage demonstrations, hot cell tests, and modeling {{have been conducted}} using Zircaloy-clad fuel. The demonstrations have included irradiated boiling water reactor, pressurized heavy-water reactor, and pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assemblies. Irradiated fuel has been emplaced in and retrieved from <b>metal</b> <b>casks,</b> dry wells, silos, and a vault. Dry storage tests and demonstrations have involved {similar_to} 5, 000 fuel rods, and {similar_to} 600 rods have been monitored during dry storage in inert gases with maximum cladding temperatures ranging from 50 to 570 {sup 0 }C. Although some tests and demonstrations are still in progress, there is currently no evidence that any rods exposed to inert gases have failed (one PWR rod exposed to an air cover gas failed at {similar_to} 70 {sup 0 }C). Based on this favorable experience, it is concluded that there is sufficient information on fuel rod behavior, storage conditions, and potential cladding failure mechanisms to support licensing of dry storage in the United States. This licensing position includes a requirement for inert cover gases and a maximum cladding temperature guideline of 380 {sup 0 }C for Zircaloy-clad fuel. Using an inert cover gas assures that even if fuel with cladding defects were placed in dry storage, or if defects develop during storage, the defects would not propagate.

40|$|The US DOE {{has amassed}} over 555, 000 {{metric tons of}} {{depleted}} uranium from its uranium enrichment operations. Rather than dispose of this depleted uranium as waste, this study explores a beneficial use of depleted uranium as <b>metal</b> shielding in <b>casks</b> designed to contain canisters of vitrified high-level waste. Two high-level waste storage, transport, and disposal shielded cask systems are analyzed. The first system employs a shielded storage and disposal cask having a separate reusable transportation overpack. The second system employs a shielded combined storage, transport, and disposal cask. Conceptual cask designs that hold 1, 3, 4 and 7 high-level waste canisters are described for both systems. In all cases, cask design feasibility was established and analyses indicate that these casks meet applicable thermal, structural, shielding, and contact-handled requirements. Depleted uranium metal casting, fabrication, environmental, and radiation compatibility considerations are discussed and found to pose no serious implementation problems. About one-fourth of the depleted uranium inventory {{would be used to}} produce the casks required to store and dispose of the nearly 15, 400 high-level waste canisters that would be produced. This study estimates the total-system cost for the preferred 7 -canister storage and disposal configuration having a separate transportation overpack would be $ 6. 3 billion.

Utilizing the parameters, requirements, limitations, and controls described in the DOE/RL- 2001 - 36, ''Hanford Sitewide Transportation Safety Document'' (TSD) and the Department of Energy Richland Operations (DOE-RL) approved package specific authorizations (e. g. Package Specific Safety Documents (PSSDs), One-Time Requests for Shipment (OTRSs), and Special Packaging Authorizations (SPAS)), this evaluation concludes that polyurea coatings on packages does not impose an undue hazard for normal and accident conditions. The transportation of all packages on the Hanford Site must comply with the transportation safety basis documents for that packaging system. Compliance with the requirements, limitations, or controls described in the safety basis for a package system will not be relaxed or modified because of the application of polyurea. The inspection criteria described in facility/projects procedures and work packages that ensure compliance with Container Management Programs and transportation safety basis documentation dictate the need to overpack a package without consideration for polyurea. This {{technical report}} reviews the transportation of waste packages coated with polyurea and does not credit the polyurea with enhancing the structural, thermal, containment, shielding, criticality, or gas generating posture of a package. Facilities/Projects Container Management Programs must determine if a container requires an overpack prior to the polyurea application recognizing that circumstances newly discovered surface contamination or loss of integrity may require a previously un-overpacked package to subsequently require overpacking.

40|$|Korea {{expects a}} {{shortage}} in storage capacity for spent fuels at reactor sites. Therefore, {{a need for}} more metal and/or concrete casks for storage systems is anticipated for either the reactor site or away from the reactor for interim storage. For the purpose of interim storage and transportation, a dual purpose <b>metal</b> <b>cask</b> that can load 21 spent fuel assemblies is being developed by Korea Radioactive Waste Management Corporation (KRMC) in Korea. At first the gamma and neutron flux for the design basis fuel were determined assuming in-core environment (the temperature, pressure, etc. of the moderator, boron, cladding, UO 2 pellets) in which the design basis fuel is loaded, as input data. The evaluation simulated burnup up to 45, 000 MWD/MTU and decay during ten years of cooling using the SAS 2 H/OGIGEN-S module of the SCALE 5. 1 system. The results from the source term evaluation were used as input data for the final shielding evaluation utilizing the MCNP Code, which yielded the effective dose rate. The design of the cask is based on the safety requirements for normal storage conditions under 10 CFR Part 72. A radiation shielding analysis of the metal storage cask optimized for loading 21 design basis fuels was performed for two cases; one for a single cask and the other for a 2 × 10 cask array. For the single cask, dose rates at the external surface of the <b>metal</b> <b>cask,</b> 1 m and 2 m away from the cask surface, were evaluated. For the 2 × 10 cask array, dose rates at the center point of the array and {{at the center of the}} casks’ height were evaluated. The results of the shielding analysis for the single cask show that dose rates were considerably higher at the lower side (from the bottom of the cask to the bottom of the neutron shielding) of the cask, at over 2 mSv/hr at the external surface of the cask. However, this is not considered to be a significant issue since additional shielding will be installed at the storage facility. The shielding analysis results for the 2 × 10 cask array showed exponential decrease with distance off the sources. The controlled area boundary was calculated to be approximately 280 m from the array, with a dose rate of 25 mrem/yr. Actual dose rates within the controlled area boundary will be lower than 25 mrem/yr, due to the decay of radioactivity of spent fuel in storage...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{dry storage}} {{facilities}} for {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) were designed to remove decay heat through the natural convection of air, but this method has limited cooling capacity and a possible re-criticality accident in case of flooding. To enhance the safety and capacity of dry storage cask of SNF, hybrid heat pipe-based passive cooling device was suggested. Heat pipe is an excellent passive heat transfer device using the principles of both conduction and phase change of the working fluid. The heat pipe containing neutron absorber material, the so-called hybrid heat pipe, is expected to prevent the re-criticality accidents of SNF and to increase the safety margin during interim and long term storage period. Moreover, a hybrid heat pipe with thermoelectric module, a Stirling engine and a phase change material tank {{can be used for}} utilization of the waste heat as heat-transfer medium. Located at the guide tube or instrumentation tube, hybrid heat pipe can remove decay heat from inside the sealed <b>metal</b> <b>cask</b> to outside, decreasing fuel rod temperature. In this paper, a 2 -step analysis was performed using computational fluid dynamics code to evaluate the heat and fluid flow inside a cask, which consisted of a single spent fuel assembly simulation and a full-scope dry cask simulation. For a normal dry storage cask, the maximum fuel temperature is 290. 0 °C. With hybrid heat pipe cooling, the temperature decreased to 261. 6 °C with application of one hybrid heat pipe per assembly, and to 195. 1 °C with the application of five hybrid heat pipes per assembly. Therefore, a dry storage cask with hybrid heat pipes produces relatively low temperature inside a cask and reduces the possibility of structural failure due to thermal degradation. clos...|$|E

Under U. S. federal regulations contained in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 72. 42, the initial license term for an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) must not exceed 40 years from the date of issuance. Licenses may be renewed by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) at the expiration of the license term upon application by the licensee for a period not to exceed 40 years. Application for ISFSI license renewals must include the following: (1) Time-limited aging analyses (TLAAs) that demonstrate that structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety will continue to perform their intended function for the requested period of extended operation; and (2) {{a description of the}} aging management program (AMP) for management of issues associated with aging that could adversely affect SSCs important to safety. In addition, the application must also include design bases information as documented in the most recent updated final safety analysis report as required by 10 CFR 72. 70. Information contained in previous applications, statements, or reports filed with the Commission under the license may be incorporated by reference provided that those references are clear and specific. The NRC has recently issued the Standard Review Plan (SRP) for renewal of used-fuel dry cask storage system (DCSS) licenses and Certificates of Compliance (CoCs), NUREG- 1927, under which NRC may renew a specific license or a CoC for a term not to exceed 40 years. Both the license and the CoC renewal applications must contain revised technical requirements and operating conditions (fuel storage, surveillance and maintenance, and other requirements) for the ISFSI and DCSS that address aging effects that could affect the safe storage of the used fuel. The information contained in the license and CoC renewal applications will require NRC review to verify that the aging effects on the SSCs in DCSSs/ ISFSIs are adequately managed for the period of extended operation. To date, all of the ISFSIs located across the United States with more than 1, 500 dry casks loaded with used fuel have initial license terms of 20 years; three ISFSIs (Surry, H. B. Robinson and Oconee) have received their renewed licenses for 20 years, and two other ISFSIs (Calvert Cliffs and Prairie Island) have applied for license renewal for 40 years. This report examines issues related to managing aging effects on the SSCs in DCSSs/ISFSIs for extended long-term storage and transportation of used fuels, following an approach {{similar to that of the}} Generic Aging Lessons Learned (GALL) report, NUREG- 1801, for the aging management and license renewal of nuclear power plants. The report contains five chapters and an appendix on quality assurance for aging management programs for used-fuel dry storage systems. Chapter I of the report provides an overview of the ISFSI license renewal process based on 10 CFR 72 and the guidance provided in NUREG- 1927. Chapter II contains definitions and terms for structures and components in DCSSs, materials, environments, aging effects, and aging mechanisms. Chapter III and Chapter IV contain generic TLAAs and AMPs, respectively, that have been developed for managing aging effects on the SSCs important to safety in the dry cask storage system designs described in Chapter V.

40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringProtection of {{the public}} and the {{environment}} from undue radiation hazards is a definition of nuclear safety. Although there are various safety systems in nuclear power plants to achieve the nuclear safety, Fukushima-Daiichi accident showed the vulnerabilities of the installed safety systems. After the Fukushima accident, various passive safety systems and strategies are under development to cope with the postulated accidents. The majority of passive safety systems concentrated to inject emergency core coolant (ECC) or feedwater with the circuits comprise many pipelines and valves. In station blackout condition, the pressure of reactor vessel would be higher than the ECC injection pressure resulting in failure of ECC supply and eventually causing core damage. The reliability issues about the performance of passive safety systems have been discussed owing to their high uncertainties, low performance, and lack of experience in operation compared to active safety systems. In aspect of probabilistic safety, complex circuits which comprise many valves and pipelines have possibilities of single failure and common cause failure. Development of innovative passive safety system having differentiated working principle, significant performance, and low possibility of failure can enhance reactor safety providing solutions for the aforementioned problems. Based on these requirements, hybrid control rod which combines the functions of control rod and heat pipe was proposed for the development of passive in-core cooling system (PINCs). The control rods drop to the core using gravity and shutdown the reactor by neutron absorption. The thermosyphon heat pipe is a passive heat transfer device using phase change and convection of working fluid in a closed metal container having two different temperature interfaces (evaporator and condenser). The combination of thermosyphon and control rod, hybrid control rod can achieve reactor shutdown and decay heat removal simultaneously at accident conditions. Hybrid control rod was designed considering the aspects of neutronics (reactivity worth) and mechanical integrity. Most of the nuclear reactors operate at high temperature and high pressure environment with high power density. Thus, pressure control strategies of the hybrid control rod using non-condensable gas and expansion of the working fluid were established to achieve high decay heat removal capacity and operating conditions. The designed hybrid control rods were equipped on the experimental facility and their thermal performances were studied under various amount of working fluid, amount of non-condensable gas, and operating pressures of the test section. The experimental results showed relations between heat transfer characteristics and controlled parameters. Controlling operating condition of hybrid control rod in high pressure worked successfully, and the proportionality between maximum heat removal capacity and operating pressure of hybrid control rod design has been proven. Measured maximum heat transfer rate of single hybrid control rod was 6 kW at 20 bar. Simulations of multi-dimensional analysis for reactor safety (MARS) code were also performed to validate the experimental results and evaluate the prediction capability of the code on the hybrid control rod. The simulation results showed the limits of heat transfer models in the code analyzing the hybrid control rod in which the boiling and condensation heat transfer occurs simultaneously in a manner of countercurrent flow. The experimental results were compared with several models associated with boiling heat transfer, condensation heat transfer, and critical heat flux (CHF) of thermosyphon for the development or the selection of optimal models. The selected models could be implemented to system analysis codes in the purpose of deterministic safety assessment of PINCs against design basis accidents. Imura’s correlation, which was developed in two-phase natural convection condition and validated with experiments in wide range, was selected as boiling heat transfer model of pressurized hybrid control rod. The existing condensation models were based on Nusselt’s film condensation theory. Hence, the effect of non-condensable gas and perturbation between upward vapor flow and downward liquid film flow were not considered at the same time. The change of effective heat transfer length due to presence of non-condensable gas and effect of fluid inertia were considered for the derivation of new condensation model. The main thermal-hydraulic phenomenon which induces CHF of thermosyphon is flooding. The flooding-based CHF models for thermosyphon were derived with theories on instability of the liquid film or maximum liquid film flow rate in countercurrent flow condition. The limited prediction capabilities of the models were attributed to difference between hydraulic diameter and heated diameter as well as high operating pressure. Consequently, new model regarding the CHF of hybrid control rod was suggested to explain its unique characteristics. The hybrid control rod could be equipped on spent fuel dry storage casks for the extension of their thermal margins. The mock-up was designed to be scaled-down to 1 / 10 of <b>metal</b> dry storage <b>cask</b> developed by NAC. The effect of hybrid control rod on thermal margins of the cask was experimentally studied. The equipment of hybrid control rod with installation of heat sink lid reduced the temperature distributions inside the cask at equal power density condition.

40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} {{discharged}} from nuclear power reactors has accumulated {{to a considerable}} amount in Japan and the other countries with nuclear power generation stocks, which will lead to risks of their overflow beyond the existing management capacities at those nuclear power plants. If such overflow happens, the power plant has {{to be shut down}} until appropriate measures have been taken. Meanwhile, uncertainties have accumulated surrounding final treatment facilities, either reprocessing or geological disposal, reflecting difficulties to find appropriate sites caused by oppositions of local and/or general public and other factors. As a result, spent nuclear fuel has to be stored for the time being in interim devices for a certain time period, e. g. 20 years to 40 - 50 years, until such time that they can be moved to their final destination. The objective of this dissertation is to review theoretical background and thoughts relevant to policy considerations on spent nuclear fuel management and storage ranging from their discharge to final treatment, to obtain quantitative images, and ultimately to present desirable policies and their implications in medium and long range in Japan. Essential key questions to be addressed here include the following, to which the dissertation presents first the theoretical framework to obtain answers and then answers at the moment while encompassing underlying uncertainties://・When and to what extent spent nuclear fuel storage will be required, and which type of technology options should be applied?//・How long should it be the appropriate storage duration? How does it connect to the overall nuclear fuel cycle program?//・Which should be chosen, AR (At Reactor) storage, AFR (Away From Reactor) storage or a combination of both?//・How will it cost?//・How will the price for storage services be determined?//After presenting these objectives and key questions in Chapter 1, the dissertation first discusses in Chapter 2 the present status of spent nuclear fuel management in Japan, which clarifies where the dissertation stands at this moment. As spent nuclear fuel accumulates at all the nuclear power plants in Japan, enhancement measures of the management capacity, such as re-racking, have already been implemented by now where available. Since opportunities for further enhancement are narrow and scarce, implementation of AFR storage is justifiably needed in an appropriate time range. In fact, relevant institutional developments, namely policy formulation, such as statements in the Long-term Program of Research, Development and Utilization of Nuclear Energy, as well as legislation, especially the amendment of the Law for Regulation of Nuclear Reactors, Nuclear Facilities and Nuclear Materials, have already been completed and implemented. This clearly justifies the needs for the policy analyses in this dissertation, such as strategic planning of storage projects and their economic assessments. Chapter 2 also deals with the historical evolutionary patterns of spent nuclear fuel storage technologies. Various types of storage technique have been developed and are now available. Recently, new dry storage techniques, which are characterized as a combination of metal canisters and concrete blocks including concrete cask storage and horizontal silo storage, are receiving higher shares in the market. The analysis of the historical patterns of worldwide market penetration of various techniques, however, has found no clear sign of retirement of any technology from the global market, while each technique has comfortably found its own "niche" with its own strength and special features to form cohabitation of all. This may reflects the very characteristics of spent nuclear fuel storage market with limited number of projects for long lifetimes. This observation at this moment, meanwhile, does not rule out possibilities of different patterns of market evolution to take place in the future, since the world market will expand whilst choices of techniques will be put more on invisible hands of market economy. Chapter 3 presents the energy and nuclear fuel cycle modeling frameworks, with which the author attempts to describe optimal patterns of nuclear fuel cycle management in harmony with nuclear energy utilization pathways. Chapter 3 starts with the development of Fuel Cycle Optimization Model (FCOM) and extends to its integration with the LDNE 21 global energy model, in order to analyze spent nuclear fuel management in an overall framework of nuclear fuel cycle and the global energy system. FCOM solves a long range (90 years) cost minimization problem of the LWR (light water reactor) - FBR (fast breeder reactor) symbiotic system based on linear programming. The optimal solution provides a desirable evolutionary pattern of plutonium (Pu) economy with Pu supply from reprocessing of spent LWR fuel as its key parameter. FCOM's superb feature is, despite a compact model, to obtain an optimal solution of management of spent LWR fuel integrated with reactor mix patterns. Through numerical experiments, it is concluded that spent LWR fuel storage is chosen to adjust future uncertainty as it gives flexibility to the whole nuclear fuel cycle to allow spent LWR fuel reprocessing according to Pu demand. The illustrative simulation runs showed that, while reprocessing of spent LWR fuel is undertaken in accordance with Pu demands, storage of spent LWR fuel provides the adjustment function between Pu supply and demand. This means that storage of spent nuclear fuel should be chosen actively as a measure to cope with uncertainty towards future as it gives flexibility to the management and operation of the whole nuclear fuel cycle. Chapter 3 further extends to the integration of FCOM with the long-range global energy model LDNE 21 (Linearlized Dynamic New Earth 21). In this application, FCOM serves as a nuclear energy sub-model within the LDNE 21 framework, which analyzes optimal global energy pathways in terms of minimum discounted total system costs up to the year 2100 under a certain set of global environmental and other constraints. The illustrative simulation runs showed that, under a constraint of atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) to be kept below 550 ppm in the year 2100, the optimal global energy strategy will be chosen under competition between nuclear power generation and combined cycle generation by coal. This underscores the importance of nuclear fuel cycle and spent nuclear fuel management modeled in FCOM against global energy pictures. Meanwhile, necessity of global shift towards Pu economy does not necessarily maintain. Chaster 4 presents a theoretical analysis of optimal choice of storage duration. In this analysis, the fundamental roles and benefits of storage are understood as twofold; 1) postponement of subsequent processes, which leads to a decrease of present value of those costs, and 2) gains through R&D by earning time with storage. As the result, there could appear an optimal storage duration, which equalizes the following two indices; a) the incremental storage cost for 1 more year, in other words the marginal cost, and b) the increase of the sum of above mentioned benefits, or the marginal utility, through 1 year extension of storage. In the case of uncertainty, this optimal storage duration is prolonged accordingly through a risk-averse attitude. These findings stand also in the case of direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel. This analysis, however, omits certain factors such as specific lifetimes of storage containers and/or facilities, or societal anxieties, which may lead to additional costs when storage duration is prolonged. Chapter 5 deals with the methodologies of material balance calculation ranging discharge, storage, transportation and final processing of spent nuclear fuel. They are categorized into the following two kinds; 1) a microscopic accounting for each power station site or each power utility company, and 2) a macroscopic analysis, either simulation or optimization, in a region-wide or nationwide scale. In Chapter 5, development of a Japan-wide simulation tool SFTRACE (Spent Fuel Storage, TRAnsportation and Cost Evaluation System) is discussed. SFTRACE is mainly based on the 2 nd methodology while taking the 1 st microscopic accounting aspect fully into account. The illustrative simulation runs revealed various trade-off relations, such as the one between storage capacity to be installed and transportation requirements, the other among geographic coverage of AFR storage facilities as to whether to construct one to serve all over Japan or several to serve segmented regions. These trade-offs clearly demonstrate the necessity and usefulness of integrated analytic tools such as SFTRACE. Chapter 6 discusses the framework of economic analyses of spent nuclear fuel storage. Based on the methodological review of the following three categories, numerical applications are presented for each of them; 1) an engineering-economic cost calculation to assess levelized unit costs, 2) a total cost assessment with strategic planning, and 3) a project financing appraisal and storage price induction. Based on latest sets of data and information, the levelized unit storage costs lay in a reasonable range of 30 - 70 kJPY/kgU, which corresponds to 0. 07 - 0. 17 JPY/kWh at burnup of 49, 000 MWd/tU with no discounting applied between power generation and storage. With the strategic planning application, several key parameters are identified such as the geographic coverage of AFR centralized storage devices, economy of scale and others. Finally, the project financing appraisal method is applied to explore viable storage pricing schemes which maintain the project of 5, 000 MTU <b>metal</b> <b>cask</b> storage facility as healthy enough against financial criteria. Because of the highly investment intensive nature of the project, a combinatory pricing scheme of storage service is highly recommended with an initial payment upon receipt of spent nuclear fuel at the storage facility and annual fee payments per unit of spent nuclear fuel stored for each year of storage duration. As the conclusion of the analyses described in these Chapters, policy recommendations are presented in Chapter 7 for planning and implementation of spent nuclear fuel management in Japan. The demand of spent nuclear fuel storage will increase steadily and rapidly, to reach 7, 000 - 10, 000 MTU by the year 2020 to 2030. In 2050, uncertainties surrounding spent nuclear fuel management will also accumulate. In a most likely scenario, the storage demand will level off at around 10, 000 MTU after 2020 - 30 to 2050, which suggests storage capacity of 10, 000 MTU must be installed by the year 2020. As concerns to the storage duration as well as the long-term planning of spent nuclear fuel management, unless utility values of Pu uses will improve significantly, processes after storage should be planned with reference of lifetime expiration of the storage facility. 報告番号: 乙 15624; 学位授与年月日: 2003 - 03 - 12; 学位の種別: 論文博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 第 15624 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科システム量子工学専...|$|E
