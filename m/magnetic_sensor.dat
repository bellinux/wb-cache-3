40|$|In a tokamak, <b>magnetic</b> <b>sensors</b> are {{the primary}} {{diagnostics}} used to estimate the quantities controlled in feedback by the plasma current, position and shape controller. As a consequence, the number and position of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>sensors</b> has a large impact {{on the performance of}} the magnetic control system and on the tokamak configuration. In this paper, we consider the problem of choosing an optimal set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>sensors</b> for the ITER tokamak. As performance index we consider the capability of reconstructing the first plasma current density moments. Indeed a good reconstruction of these parameters guarantees also a good reconstruction of the parameters usually controlled by the magnetic control system (e. g. plasma-wall gaps, position of the current centroid, plasma current, etc.). The problem of choosing the best set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>sensors</b> is converted in a suitable convex optimization problem. Our approach allows us also to evaluate the level of redundancy in a given set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>sensors</b> and hence it gives information on how to behave in case of sensor faults.

50|$|The Predator was a fire-and-forget weapon {{utilizing}} a pre-launch system where the gunner tracked the target three seconds before launch {{and the internal}} system measured target speed and direction and was {{used in conjunction with}} known missile flight performance to predict where the target would be when the missile {{was in a position to}} intercept. The missile's flight path would overfly the target aim point. A dual laser and <b>magnetic</b> <b>sensor</b> would detect the target and trigger the detonation of the warhead. The laser sensor would locate the positions of the leading and trailing edges of the tank, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>sensor</b> would provide confirmation of the position of the tank. The missile also used an inertial guidance unit to guide the weapon over the predicted intercept point, compensating for crosswind and launcher motion (the launcher may be mounted on or fired from a vehicle). For direct attacks the missile acted as an unguided, flattened trajectory, line-of-sight weapon and the warhead detonates on impact.|$|E
