I {{did not lose}} interest in developing the Christian tradition so as to render it intelligible, convincing, and illuminating in a changing context. But I did reject the compartmentalization of my discipline of 'constructive theology,' especially in its separation from ethics, and more generally in its isolation from other academic disciplines... I was persuaded that no problem could be more critical {{than that of a}} decent survival of a humanity that threatened to destroy itself by exhausting and polluting its natural context." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Indiana game, Dari Nowkhah {{wrote in}} ESPN's [...] "Heisman Watch" [...] column that Robinson was [...] "running {{away with the}} Heisman Trophy" [...] and {{compared}} him to 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders:"We haven't seen this type of college football playmaker since ... Barry Sanders? [...] I'm not saying Robinson reminds me of Sanders. (How could a quarterback remind me of a running back?) But there is a shocking resemblance between the diminutive playmakers in their speed, elusiveness and quickness. So is the effect the two have on <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{what is right and}} wrong. Being that dominant on a football field somehow feels wrong. It's unfair." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1960, McGovern {{decided to}} run for the U.S.Senate and {{challenge}} the Republican incumbent Karl Mundt, a formidable figure in South Dakota politics whom McGovern loathed as an old-style McCarthyite. The race centered mostly around rural issues, but John F. Kennedy's Catholicism was a drawback {{at the top of the}} ticket in the mostly Protestant state. McGovern made careless charges during the campaign, and the press turned against him; he would say eleven years later, [...] "It was my worst campaign. I hated [...] so much I lost <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> balance." [...] McGovern was defeated in the November 1960 election, gaining 145,217 votes to Mundt's 160,579, but the margin was one-third of Kennedy's loss to Vice President Richard M. Nixon in the state's presidential contest.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} role his {{education}} had in shaping his humor, Blumenfeld said: [...] "I went to Jewish schools growing up and that's where <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor was cultivated. Everybody was funny." [...] Blumenfeld has said he is influenced by television programs that he watched while growing up, including The Simpsons, Seinfeld, and Saturday Night Live, which he says [...] "taught me how to think ... absurdly ... creatively and originally about jokes that people were making" [...] and make [...] "jokes on jokes". He has cited Larry David as an influence, and also likes Louie and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Blumenfeld has compared the NBC series The Office and Parks and Recreation to Jake and Amir, saying they [...] "have these office workplace dynamics and the situations are funny and the characters are very funny".|$|E
500|$|During his year-long {{absence from}} the screen, Khan {{actively}} looked to play different parts, saying: [...] "These are smarter movies, the interaction with them is deeply rewarding...I think I am finally beginning to understand <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> style as an actor. I am developing my craft, understanding what acting and communication is." [...] He found the role in his second collaboration with director Vishal Bhardwaj, Rangoon (2017), an epic romance set during World War II. Cast alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut, Khan drew inspirations from the mannerisms of his grandfather and the character Darth Vader to portray filmmaker Rustom [...] "Rusi" [...] Billimoria. Rajeev Masand termed the film [...] "overlong, indulgent {{to the point of}} exhaustion", but praised Khan for [...] "imbu Russi with the swagger and the arrogance of an aristocrat from the forties".|$|E

500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I have never been in a battle, but I believe that I got <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E
500|$|According to Safdie, the {{building}} [...] "is by definition the physical symbol {{of peace in}} the capital's skyline" [...] and needed to convey the spirit of peace. [...] Safdie stated: [...] "I'm not one who believes in overt symbolism, but <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a building dedicated to peace {{was a sense of}} the lightness of being,...It should be a serene building. It should not be an aggressive building. It should be full of light." [...] Safdie achieved this by designing a glass curtain wall facing the Lincoln Memorial and a billowing glass ceiling. [...] The ceiling is one of {{the building}} elements in common with Safdie's design for the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Israel. [...] The [...] thick roof is made of 1,482 white glass panels and supported by steel frames while the interior of the roof is covered by a translucent plastic film. [...] It is opaque and white during the day and glows at night.|$|E
500|$|Coward's {{distinctive}} clipped diction {{arose from}} his childhood: {{his mother was}} deaf and Coward developed his staccato style of speaking {{to make it easier}} for her to hear what he was saying; it also helped him eradicate a slight lisp. His nickname, [...] "The Master", [...] "started as a joke and became true", according to Coward. It was used of him from the 1920s onwards. Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as [...] "The Master", he replied, [...] "Oh, you know – Jack of all trades, master of none." [...] He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: [...] "My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> my own importance to myself is tremendous." [...] When a Time interviewer apologised, [...] "I hope you haven't been bored having to go through all these interviews for your [...] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself", Coward rejoined, [...] "Not at all. I'm fascinated by the subject." ...|$|E

500|$|Dougan {{dropped down}} to the Third Division to join Peterborough United for a £21,000 fee {{in the summer of}} 1963. He later {{admitted}} that [...] "I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player". The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the 1963–64 season, {{and at the end of}} the campaign manager Jack Fairbrother was replaced by Gordon Clark, who Dougan said [...] "renewed <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> vocation". He then scored seven goals in the club's 1964–65 run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2–1 win over top-flight Arsenal at London Road. Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that [...] "after playing at Stamford Bridge it was not easy to go to places like Gillingham on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with their sleeves rolled up".|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E

60|$|I {{had covered}} quite a little distance, and I was pass-ing through {{a strip of}} wood which lay {{at the foot of}} one of the flat-topped hills, when I became {{conscious}} of the sensation of being watched.

But, though I was positive that eyes were upon me, I could see no sign of any living thing within the wood other than the many, gay-plumaged birds and little monkeys which filled the trees with life, color, and action.|$|R
2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour ... But I think the man who really affected <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod.

2500|$|... "The Ferret Song". John Cleese has an {{obsession}} with ferrets throughout the show, including his famous performance of [...] "The Ferret Song". This song begins with the line [...] "I've got a ferret sticking up my nose." [...] The line is repeated, then: [...] "How it got there I can't tell, but now it's there, it hurts like hell and, what is more, it radically affects <b>my</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell," [...] – and promptly gets even worse. The song, written by John Cleese and Graham Chapman, was included in The Fairly Incomplete and Rather Badly Illustrated Monty Python Song Book, accompanied by a picture of John with a Terry Jones-shaped ferret up his nose.|$|E
