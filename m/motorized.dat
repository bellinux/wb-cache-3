5|$|By sea: Banton is {{accessible}} via wooden launches and <b>motorized</b> boats that regularly travel from Lucena City, Quezon. Tourists and visitors {{can also take}} RORO vessels that ply the Manila-Odiongan, Batangas City-Odiongan, or the Roxas-Odiongan route. From Odiongan, Banton {{can be reached by}} jeepney and <b>motorized</b> boat via Calatrava, Romblon. Another RORO route is from Lucena City to Boac or Mogpog in Marinduque. From these towns, travelers can take jeepneys to Buenavista, which is only three hours away from Banton. Another alternative route is through Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro by <b>motorized</b> boats.|$|E
5|$|After a large fire at Miss Knox's School (site of the Briarcliff Corporate Campus) in 1912, the department's {{equipment}} was upgraded {{to deal with}} larger fires. The village purchased its first <b>motorized</b> vehicle, an American LaFrance pumper truck. The existing hose-and-chemical wagon was <b>motorized</b> and became the chief's car. In 1914, the Briarcliff Manor Municipal Building was constructed to house the government and fire engines. The likeness of its garage doors {{can be seen in}} the façade of the present restaurant. Later in 1914 the department established sub-stations at Mrs. Whitson's barn on Pleasantville Road and on the Holden farm at Scarborough Road (roughly opposite the current firehouse); these were discontinued in 1921. The first major fire to involve the <b>motorized</b> vehicles was in 1916 at the central business district. In spite of the new equipment, several buildings at the northern end were destroyed. The 1908 hook-and-ladder truck was <b>motorized</b> in 1923 and two years later, the chief's car was replaced by another American LaFrance vehicle. An electric siren was installed in 1928 after a complaint that the previous alarm sounded more like a call to breakfast than an alarm of fire.|$|E
5|$|At 5a.m., Croatian special police {{advanced}} to the Mali Alan pass on the Velebit, encountering strong resistance from the ARSK Lika Corps' 4th Light Brigade and elements of the 9th <b>Motorized</b> Brigade. The pass was captured at 1p.m., and Sveti Rok village was captured at about 5p.m. The special police advanced further beyond Mali Alan, meeting more resistance at 9p.m. and then bivouacking until 5a.m. The ARSK 9th <b>Motorized</b> Brigade withdrew to Udbina after being forced out of its positions on the Velebit. In the morning, the special police captured Lovinac, Gračac and Medak.|$|E
5|$|Dominique Pinon as John Vriess, the Bettys mechanic. A paraplegic, {{he uses a}} <b>motorized</b> wheelchair. Vriess {{shares a}} close {{friendship}} with Call and an antagonistic relationship with Johner.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1942, the {{division}} was formally redesignated as the 7th <b>Motorized</b> Division. {{and transferred to}} Camp San Luis Obispo on 24 April 1942. Three months later, divisional training commenced in the Mojave Desert in preparation for its planned deployment to the African theater. It was again designated the 7th Infantry Division on 1 January 1943, when the <b>motorized</b> equipment {{was removed from the}} unit and it became a light infantry division once more, as the Army eliminated the <b>motorized</b> division concept fearing it would be logistically difficult and that the troops were no longer needed in North Africa. The 7th Infantry Division began rigorous amphibious assault training under US Marines from the Fleet Marine Force, before being deployed to fight in the Pacific theater instead of Africa. USMC General Holland Smith oversaw the unit's training.|$|E
5|$|The Bavay's {{municipality}} has erected two {{barriers to}} prohibit access to <b>motorized</b> vehicles. Volunteers and {{employees of the}} CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois manage the site regularly.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of <b>motorized</b> transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a <b>motorized</b> vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E
5|$|Buses, jeepneys, taxis, and <b>motorized</b> {{tricycles}} {{are commonly}} available {{in major cities}} and towns. In 2007, there were about 5.53million registered motor vehicles with registrations increasing at an average annual rate of 4.55%.|$|E
5|$|By air: The closest airport {{with active}} airline service is Tugdan Airport in Alcantara, Romblon. Philippine Airlines {{operates}} three weekly flights to Romblon from Manila. From Alcantara, Banton {{can be reached}} in five to six hours by jeepney and <b>motorized</b> outrigger boats from Calatrava.|$|E
5|$|From {{south to}} northeast, the North Korean units {{positioned}} opposite the UN units were the 83rd <b>Motorized</b> Regiment of the 105th Armored Division {{and then the}} 6th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 15th, 1st, 13th, 8th, 12th, and 5th Divisions and the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The HV did not advance towards Knin {{during the}} night of 4/5 August when the ARSK General Staff ordered a {{battalion}} of the 75th <b>Motorized</b> Brigade to stage themselves north of Knin. The ARSK North Dalmatian Corps became increasingly uncoordinated as the HV 4th Guards Brigade advanced south towards Knin, protecting the right flank of the 7th Guards Brigade. The latter met little resistance and entered the town at about 11a.m. Lieutenant General Ivan Čermak was appointed commander of the newly established HV Knin Corps. Sinj OG completed its objectives, capturing Kozjak and Vrlika, and meeting little resistance as the ARSK 1st Light Brigade disintegrated, retreating to Knin and later to Lika. By 8p.m., Šibenik OG units advanced to Poličnik (113th Brigade), Đevrske (15th Home Guard Regiment), and captured Drniš (142nd Home Guard Regiment), while the ARSK 75th <b>Motorized</b> Brigade retreated towards Srb and Bosanski Petrovac together with the 3rd Infantry and the 92nd <b>Motorized</b> Brigades, leaving the Zadar OG units with little opposition. The 7th Home Guard Regiment captured Benkovac, while the 112th Brigade entered Smilčić and elements of the 9th Guards Brigade reached Obrovac.|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading <b>motorized</b> disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned {{to sit next to}} the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray in place of the <b>motorized</b> tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
5|$|The entire Hawaiian Division was {{concentrated}} at {{a single}} location {{during the next few}} years, allowing it to conduct more effective combined arms training. It was also manned at higher personnel levels than other divisions, and its field artillery was the first to be <b>motorized.</b>|$|E
5|$|All <b>motorized</b> {{vehicles}} are prohibited, {{but it is}} permitted to bring canoes and other non-motorized boats, as well as skiing during winter. Walking and tenting is permitted everywhere. Berries and mushrooms can be harvested for personal use. Hunting and fishing is also permitted with a hunting or fishing license. Dogs may be brought along, but must be in a leash between 1 April and 20 August. Hikers must show special consideration regarding vegetation, animal life and cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|As seas {{surrounding}} Banton can {{be rough}} during the wet season, {{the best time}} to visit the island is from March to May during the dry (summer) season. This is also the typical time for Asi families living in Metro Manila or abroad to visit the island since it coincides with the Lenten season and barangay fiestas. Within the island, the main forms of transportation are passenger motorcycles (known elsewhere as habal-habal) and <b>motorized</b> boats. A circumferential road connects the 17 barangays of Banton to each other.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{set aside}} about 89 {{percent of the}} park in a highly {{protected}} wilderness area through passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. No roads, <b>motorized</b> vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a <b>motorized</b> pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942 heavy Guards mortar battalions {{were formed}} around the new M-30 static rocket launch frames, {{consisting}} of 96 launchers in three batteries. In July, {{a battalion of}} BM-13s {{was added to the}} establishment of a tank corps. In 1944, the BM-31 was used in <b>motorized</b> heavy Guards mortar battalions of 48 launchers. In 1943, Guards mortar brigades, and later divisions, were formed equipped with static launchers.|$|E
5|$|Initially it {{was planned}} to use the Sd.Kfz. 10 as a towing vehicle for various light guns and trailers, but it was {{authorized}} {{as a substitute for}} the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored personnel carrier in 1939. The Ausf. B model saw its use broadened to tow heavier weapons like the 5 cm PaK 38 as well as their ammunition trailers. They also served in the maintenance and supply companies of <b>motorized</b> and tank units. Nine were delivered to Romania in 1942 as tractors for anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July the Soviets {{launched}} Operation Kutuzov, their counter-offensive {{upon the}} Orel salient, which threatened the flank and rear of Model's 9th Army. The 12th Panzer Division, thus far held in reserve and {{slated to be}} committed to the northern side of the Kursk salient, along with the 36th <b>Motorized</b> Infantry, 18th Panzer and 20th Panzer Divisions were redeployed to face the Soviet spearheads.|$|E
5|$|Rivers in Boise National Forest {{offer the}} {{opportunity}} for rafting and kayaking through rapids up to class four, with the most difficult sections on the South Fork and main stems of the Payette River. Numerous developed boat launch sites provide access to rivers for whitewater enthusiasts, and Dagger Falls is the primary launching site for visitors to the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. <b>Motorized</b> boating is permitted on Anderson Ranch Reservoir, Deadwood Reservoir, and Warm Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{deployed}} one independent regiment, one separate <b>motorized</b> training brigade and 153 divisions for Barbarossa, {{which included}} 104 infantry, 19 panzer and 15 <b>motorized</b> infantry divisions in three army groups, nine security divisions {{to operate in}} conquered territories, four divisions in Finland and two divisions as reserve under the direct control of OKH. These were equipped with about 3,350 tanks, 7,200 artillery pieces, 2,770 aircraft (that amounted to 65 percent of the Luftwaffe), about 600,000 motor vehicles and 625,000–700,000 horses. Finland slated 14 divisions for the invasion, and Romania offered 13 divisions and eight brigades {{over the course of}} Barbarossa. The entire Axis forces, 3.8 million personnel, deployed across a front extending from the Arctic Ocean southward to the Black Sea, were all controlled by the OKH and organized into Army Norway, Army Group North, Army Group Center and Army Group South, alongside three Luftflotten (air fleets, the air force equivalent of army groups) that supported the army groups: Luftflotte 1 for North, Luftflotte 2 for Center and Luftflotte 4 for South.|$|E
5|$|The JNA forces {{consisted}} of 70 officers and 200 soldiers garrisoned at the Stanko Opsenica barracks {{and four other}} smaller JNA facilities in Gospić. The garrison was supported by 128 Serbian Guard paramilitaries led by Đorđe Božović, which deployed to Gospić from Serbia using JNA transportation, according to {{an interview with the}} commanding officer of the southern Lika Territorial Defence in 1991. Following a reorganization in 1991, the JNA units based in Gospić were the 236th <b>Motorized</b> Brigade and the 1st Brigade of the 35th Partisan Division, both subordinated to the Rijeka Corps. Prior to this, the 10th Proletarian Infantry Regiment, a B-class unit required to maintain only 15% of wartime troop levels, was stationed in Gospić, but was amalgamated with the 9th Proletarian Infantry Regiment to form the 236th <b>Motorized</b> Brigade. The JNA garrison in Gospić was formally commanded by Colonel Petar Čavar, however effective command was taken over by his chief of staff, Yugoslav Counterintelligence Service Major Relja Tomić.|$|E
5|$|The JNA tasked the 2nd Titograd Corps and the 9th Boka Kotorska Military-Maritime Sector (VPS)both {{of which}} were {{elements}} of the 2nd Operational Groupwith cutting off and capturing the Dubrovnik area. The 2nd Titograd Corps deployed the 1st Nikšić Brigade while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS employed the 5th and the 472nd <b>Motorized</b> Brigades. The Corps boundary running north-to-south near Dubrovnik was set. The 2nd Operational Group also commanded the 16th Border Patrol Detachment and 107th Coastal Artillery Group, and mobilised Territorial Defence units from Herceg-Novi, Kotor, Tivat, Budva, Bar, Mojkovac, Bijelo Polje and Trebinje. Strugar was in overall command of the 2nd Operative Group while the 9th Boka Kotorska VPS was commanded by Vice Admiral Miodrag Jokić. Jokić replaced Admiral Krsto Đurović, {{who had died in}} uncertain circumstances hours before the offensive began. Major General Nojko Marinović, once commanding the 472nd <b>Motorized</b> Brigade and subordinate of Đurović, said that the JNA had killed the admiral because he opposed the offensive. Marinović resigned his post on 17 September and joined the Croatian ZNG. The JNA 2nd Operational Group initially deployed 7,000 troops and maintained similar troop levels throughout the offensive.|$|E
5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special <b>motorized</b> vehicle) was a German {{half-track}} {{that saw}} widespread use in World War II. Its main role {{was as a}} prime mover for small towed guns such as the 2 cm FlaK 30, the 7.5 cm leIG, or the 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank gun. It could carry eight troops in addition to towing a gun or trailer.|$|E
5|$|The Wilderness Act {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or mining, and logging, and also prohibits the use of <b>motorized</b> equipment and bicycles. The ways people may enter wilderness areas are on foot or on horseback.|$|E
5|$|The {{company had}} five Di 3 diesel locomotives, {{and a single}} El 13 {{electric}} locomotive. Ofotbanen had 22 B3 passenger carriages, used for charter trains. These were supplemented by three two-car Class 68 electric multiple units. The 48 freight cars the company used were owned by Nord-Norsk Spedisjon. Of these, 19 were timber cars. All stock was painted dark green. All <b>motorized</b> stock was used stock that NSB has chosen to take out of service.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} toolkit for the Motorola CPU {{included a}} compiler for the C programming language, {{which the two}} programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language. Cerny and Flanagan's decision to program Marble Madness in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in assembly language. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of 30Hz instead of the normal 60Hz frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a trackball system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and he chose a <b>motorized</b> trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari's design department informed Cerny that the <b>motorized</b> trackball's design had an inherent flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and {{the use of a}} regular trackball was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow RAM-based sprites to be animated by the CPU, but the available hardware was a less-advanced system using ROM-based, static sprites.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no <b>motorized</b> boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|All four {{receiver}} antennas {{were connected}} via separate {{leads to a}} <b>motorized</b> switch that selected {{each one of the}} inputs in turn, sending it into the amplifier. The output was then switched, using the same system, to one of four inputs into the CRTs. The entire radar dipole aerial setup for the AI Mk.IV was simple in comparison to the 32-dipole Matratze (mattress) transceiving array fitted to the noses of the earliest German night fighters to use AI radar, for their own UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C airborne radar design from 1942–43.|$|E
5|$|Bond then {{travels to}} Bangkok to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Siamese {{entrepreneur}} suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured {{and placed in}} Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping {{with the aid of}} Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a <b>motorized</b> sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.|$|E
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a <b>motorized</b> switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} wapiti), mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the Sawtooth Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to <b>motorized</b> use to protect the elk winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the coyote, moose, bobcat, beaver, yellow-bellied marmot, pika, and badger.|$|E
5|$|Four <b>motorized</b> {{companies}} from the Negev Brigade left Be'er Tuvia. They {{set up a}} position of 4.2 inch mortars and medium machine guns about midway between Isdud and Beit Daras, to shell Isdud from the southeast. A reinforced company also left Be'er Tuvia and took up positions between Hill 69 and the military base near Nitzanim to cut off Egyptian reinforcements coming from Majdal. The 57th Battalion (consisting of Irgun veterans) left Hatzor to assault Isdud from the northeast. The 53rd Battalion {{was accompanied by a}} reinforced platoon of 44 soldiers from the temporary 58th Battalion (a new recruit unit), which made its way to Nitzanim in order {{to be replaced by a}} more experienced platoon from the 53rd.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where <b>motorized</b> vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the various}} Belgian ground forces {{units in the}} United Kingdom were amalgamated into the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, more often known as the Brigade Piron after its {{commanding}} officer, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Piron. The unit not only included <b>motorized</b> infantry, armoured cars and artillery but also various logistics and medical support units. In March 1944, an artillery battery of four 25 pounder guns operated by troops from Luxembourg {{was added to the}} brigade's artillery unit. 80 Luxembourgers were serving with the Brigade Piron by August 1944 when the Brigade landed in Normandy.|$|E
