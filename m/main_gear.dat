5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to lose all three hydraulic systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 hydraulic systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three hydraulic systems {{in the event of an}} exploding <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> tire.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{changes of}} the -200 over the -100 are wingtip fences and {{increased}} fuel capacity for increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway condition which a single-bogie <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> could not manage.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{evaluation}} of an active load-control landing gear computer program (ACOLAG) for predicting the landing dynamics of airplanes with passive and active <b>main</b> <b>gears</b> are presented. ACOLAG was used in an analytical investigation of the landing dynamics of a large airplane with both passive and active <b>main</b> <b>gears.</b> It was concluded that the program is valid for predicting the landing dynamics of airplanes with both passive and active <b>main</b> <b>gears.</b> It was shown that the active gear reduces airframe-gear forces and airplane motions following initial impact, and {{has the potential for}} significant reductions in structural fatigue damage relative to that which occurs with the passive gear...|$|R
50|$|Improved landing gear: While the {{nosewheel}} {{from the}} C-123B was retained, both <b>main</b> <b>gears</b> {{were given a}} third wheel to improve weight distribution.|$|R
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was easily recognisable by its inverted gull wings and fixed spatted undercarriage. Upon the leading edges of its faired <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> legs were mounted the Jericho-Trompete (Jericho trumpet) wailing sirens, becoming the propaganda symbol of German air {{power and the}} blitzkrieg victories of 1939–1942. The Stuka's design included several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings {{to ensure that the}} aircraft recovered from its attack dive even if the pilot blacked out from the high g-forces.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the <b>main</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Suzuki TC-90 is a 90cc, 2-Stroke, oil {{injected}} motorcycle. The TC, {{as opposed}} to the TS, has a HI-LOW range along with the 4 <b>main</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{deal with}} the design of a shock {{absorber}} variant for the type of <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> design of the aircraft WT 10 Advantic. Then we focus on the design of the selected variant of the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear.</b> Next, we follow regulation CS- 23 demands to calculate the load cases for the selected <b>main</b> lending <b>gear.</b> Then we design shock absorber based on the load during landing. We compile the equation of motion of the aircraft, which describes motion of the aircraft during landing, then we compute the equation. Finally, we focus on a stress analysis of the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> and the shock absorber...|$|R
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|A second {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} 40 aircraft were ordered, which featured four 12.7mm machine guns, a relocated air cooler and <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> doors.|$|E
25|$|During {{the impact}} and short ground roll, the nose gear collapsed, the right <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> {{separated}} from the aircraft, penetrating the central fuel tank and cabin space, and the left <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> was pushed up through the wing. The aircraft {{came to rest on}} the threshold markings {{at the start of the}} runway. A significant amount of fuel leaked, but there was no fire. Four crew members and eight passengers received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries (concussion and a broken leg).|$|E
50|$|The {{tricycle}} {{landing gear}} consisted of hydraulically retracting nose and <b>main</b> <b>gears</b> with twin wheels and brakes on the mainwheels, with the nose gear retracting into {{the nose of the}} aircraft and the main legs retracting into extended inboard engine nacelles.|$|R
40|$|A {{universal}} multi-function {{leaf spring}} <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> {{was designed for}} light aircraft. The <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> combined with the leaf spring, skidding, and wheels enables it {{to have a good}} takeoff and landing performance on various grounds such as the hard, snow, grass and sand grounds. Firstly, the characteristics of different landing sites were studied in this paper in order to analyze the load of the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> on different types of grounds. Based on this analysis, the structural design optimization along with the strength and stiffness characteristics of the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> has been done, which enables it to have good takeoff and landing performance on different types of grounds given the relevant regulations and standards. Additionally, the impact of the skidding on the aircraft during the flight was also taken into consideration. Finally, a universal multi-function leaf spring type of the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> suitable for light aircraft has been developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} seals for the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> {{doors of}} the Shuttle Orbiters were raised by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board as a potential safety concern. Inspections of seals installed on the Shuttle Discovery revealed that they were permanently deformed and no longer met certified seal compression requirements. Replacement of the seals led to the inability to fully close the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> doors. Johnson Space Center requested that Glenn Research Center conduct tests on the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> door environmental seals to assist in installing the seals in a manner to allow the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> doors to fully close. Further testing was conducted {{to fill out the}} seal performance database. Results from the testing indicated that the method of bonding the seals was important in reducing seal loads on the <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> doors. Also, the replacement seals installed in Shuttle Discovery were found to have leakage performance sufficient to meet the certification requirements...|$|R
25|$|A-4: Seventeen BT-2BRs and BT-2BGs {{converted}} in 1940 as radio-controlled aerial target drones. These had tricycle gear (a steerable nosewheel was added) with <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> moved aft, faired-over rear cockpit, and single controls, allowing the aircraft to be test-flown.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneer II {{is similar}} to the SX, but with a wider hull to {{accommodate}} two seats, in side-by-side configuration. The ailerons are 2/3 span. The landing gear is repositioned by a lever control and moves the tailwheel in concert with the main wheels. The <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> includes mechanical brakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft, {{which was}} designed by {{a team led by}} Ed Heinemann resembled a scaled-down Northrop Delta. It was a low-winged monoplane, of all-metal stressed skin construction. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with its <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> fitted with streamlining trouser fairings. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit with a sliding canopy. It was powered by a single Wright R-1510 radial engine.|$|E
50|$|As per October 2007, ICAO {{revised the}} alpha factor for four wheel undercarriages. Based on recent {{findings}} of full scale pavement tests, ICAO {{agreed to the}} following revisions concerning the alpha factor values:a. change the alpha factor value for all four-wheels per <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> from the current 0.825 to 0.80;b. retain the alpha factor for six-wheels per <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> at 0.72; andc. change the alpha factors for other <b>main</b> landing <b>gears</b> so that the ranking of the damaging effect remains consistent.|$|R

25|$|The SA-5 is a mid-wing, {{tricycle}} {{landing gear}} design with folding wings. The aircraft {{was intended to be}} towed by a vehicle by the (lowered) tail on its <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> with wings folded along its sides. The cockpit can be open, or covered with a bubble canopy. The fuselage is constructed from welded steel tubing with aircraft fabric covering. The wings use spruce wooden spars with fabric covering.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses retractable tricycle type {{landing gear}} by Messier-Dowty, with twin nosewheels {{and a single}} wheel on each <b>main</b> <b>gear.</b> A runway tailhook or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate {{in conjunction with the}} landing gear's carbon brakes to shorten landing distances. A removable refueling probe can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.|$|E
25|$|Alon {{produced}} 245 A-2s from 1964 to 1967, with peak {{production of}} 137 in 1966. The last 25 A-2s produced by Alon had spring-steel landing gear {{in place of}} the original <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> struts, light alloy castings and trailing links. The base price in 1967 was up to $7975. Production of the A-2 ceased in September 1967, and on October 9, 1967, Alon was purchased by, and became a division of the Mooney Airplane Company of Kerrville, Texas.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{equipped}} with a new experimental TsIAM supercharger powered by exhaust fumes.

25|$|May 23, 2001: The right <b>main</b> landing <b>gear</b> of an American Airlines Fokker 100, {{registration}} number N1419D, operating as AA Flight 1107, collapsed upon landing on runway 17C after a scheduled flight from Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. The pilot {{was able to}} maintain directional control and bring the aircraft to {{a stop on the}} runway. The incident was attributed to metal fatigue caused by a manufacturing flaw in the right <b>main</b> <b>gear's</b> outer cylinder; there were no serious injuries to the 88 passengers or 4 crew, but the aircraft was written off.|$|R

25|$|The P-2J had {{accommodations}} {{for up to}} 12 crewmen. The forward fuselage was extended , with the tail surfaces being enlarged and their shape modified. AN/APS-80 search radar was fitted in a smaller radome. Updated avionics systems were installed, and these systems were much more compact than those used in other versions of the Neptune. The lighter avionics load permitted greater fuel capacity. The P-2J's <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> was fitted with two wheels each, rather than the one large wheel of the earlier models.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 2007, a Canadian North De Havilland Canada Dash 8, {{en route}} from Gjoa Haven to Cambridge Bay made an {{emergency}} landing at Yellowknife Airport after the landing gear indicator showed the nose gear as failing to lock on extension while on approach to Cambridge Bay Airport. The pilot {{made the decision to}} re-route to Yellowknife, as the airport was better equipped for emergency landings. The aircraft landed safely in Yellowknife on its <b>main</b> <b>gear</b> and there were no injuries.|$|E
25|$|On 23 August 2008, AIRES Flight 051 {{sustained}} substantial damage {{following the}} collapse of the right hand main landing gear on landing at Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz Airport (BAQ), Colombia. None of the 31 occupants were injured. The Bombardier Dash 8-301, registered HK-3952, operated on an international flight from Curaçao-Hato International Airport (CUR). The approach and landing were normal, touching down about 770 metres past the threshold of runway 23. The crew noticed a vibration of the right hand <b>main</b> <b>gear.</b> The undercarriage leg collapsed. There was no fire.|$|E
