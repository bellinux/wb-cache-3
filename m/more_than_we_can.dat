500|$|Guitar Hero {{and other}} rock music-based games work with record {{companies}} to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of $25,000 {{for the rights}} to use a master recording and $10,000 {{for the rights to}} make a cover. [...] The impact of Guitar Hero and Rock Band has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games. The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica's Death Magnetic album and as playable Guitar Hero tracks. [...] However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games. [...] Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group, stated that [...] "The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small." [...] Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, to {{want to be part of}} the success: [...] "The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get into the game." [...] Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the Guitar Hero games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they [...] "should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse." [...] Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes, and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights. [...] Michael Pachter, an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that Guitar Hero is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti-trust measures. [...] Patcher also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge. [...] However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations.|$|E

An all-merciful God stands there with His arms open, waiting to receive us into His glory. I also see, however, that the divine presence is so pure and light-filled – much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> imagine – that the soul that has but the slightest imperfection would rather throw {{itself into a}} thousand hells than appear thus before the divine presence.

2500|$|From 10 until 24 November 1947, Rajagopalachari {{served as}} Acting Governor-General of India {{in the absence}} of the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten, who was on leave in England to attend the {{marriage}} of Princess Elizabeth to Mountbatten's nephew Prince Philip. Rajagopalachari led a very simple life in the viceregal palace, washing his own clothes and polishing his own shoes. Impressed with his abilities, Mountbatten made Rajagopalachari his second choice to succeed him after Vallabhbhai Patel, when he was to leave India in June 1948. Rajagopalachari was eventually chosen as the governor-general when Nehru disagreed with Mountbatten's first choice, as did Patel himself. He was initially hesitant but accepted when Nehru wrote to him, [...] "I hope you will not disappoint us. We want you to help us in many ways. The burden on some of us is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> carry." [...] Rajagopalachari then served as Governor-General of India from June 1948 until 26 January 1950, and was not only the last Governor-General of India, but the only Indian national ever to hold the office.|$|E
