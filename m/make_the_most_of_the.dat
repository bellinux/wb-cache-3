5|$|The recruits' {{indoctrination}} {{period at}} Palm Beach was six weeks. It covered instruction on subjects such as: activities, organization, personnel, current events, and social hygiene. The physical education aspects consisted of: body mechanics, swimming, games, and drill. Another {{important part of}} recruit training was the testing, classification, and selection process. This was designed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recruit's abilities, background and interests. The results of the testing were usually the basis for general assignments or the opportunity for specialized training.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E

25|$|In early October 1943, Hitler {{was persuaded}} by his Army Group Commander in Southern Italy, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, that the defence of Italy should be {{conducted}} {{as far away from}} Germany as possible. This would <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural defensive geography of Central Italy, whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields; each one being ever closer to Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with a springboard for an invasion of the Balkans with its vital resources of oil, bauxite and copper.|$|E
25|$|Not {{content with}} {{creating}} a large first innings lead, the Australian's {{were determined to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining overs of the day, and set about the English top order. Two minutes into the English innings, Terry Alderman again bamboozled Graham Gooch with the inswinging yorker, trapping him LBW for a third ball duck. Kim Barnett followed a few overs later for 3, caught off the bowling of Alderman, and Chris Broad was clean bowled by Geoff Lawson for 20.

25|$|Producer Joel Silver soon {{joined the}} project. Although the project had key {{supporters}} like Silver and Di Bonaventura {{to influence the}} company, The Matrix was still a huge investment for Warner Bros, which had to invest $60million to create a movie with deep philosophical ideas and difficult special effects. The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film. The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and {{it was decided to}} film in Australia to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> budget.

His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought {{all the way from}} England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.|$|E

500|$|Poels {{therefore}} {{entered the}} descent off the Crispiero alone, with several seconds lead over the main group. The main favourites {{for the general}} classification hesitated before taking up the chase, allowing Poels to build a lead. Eventually, Katusha attempted to chase him down, but Poels was able to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> difficult descent and built a 20-second lead. Although this was reduced {{on the way to}} the finish, Poels held on to take the win, his first for [...] He also moved into the overall lead of the race, with a 17-second advantage over Rigoberto Urán (...) , who had won the sprint for second place in the group behind.|$|E
500|$|Cambridge won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Oxford. [...] The weather {{on the day of the}} race was good, but the tide was poor. [...] Willan got the race {{underway}} at 12:58 p.m. and the crews remained reasonably level until the Mile Post, where Oxford held a quarter of a length lead. [...] Cambridge began to reduce the deficit, so Oxford stroke Gold increased the rate in an attempt to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> favourable bend in the river. [...] The spurt had little effect, and the Light Blue stroke John Houghton Gibbon responded in kind with a burst of his own.|$|E
500|$|Rain {{threatened}} {{during the}} second part. Although it did not materialise, all the drivers posted quick laps early on {{to avoid having to}} set a time on a wet track. Alonso was again fastest with a 1:34.057. Hamilton, both Ferraris, BMW Saubers, and Toyotas, as well as Rosberg (Williams) and Webber (Red Bull) also passed through to the final part. Kovalainen (Renault), Fisichella (Renault), Coulthard (Red Bull), Sato (Super Aguri), Button (Honda) and Liuzzi (STR) were eliminated. 2006 champions Renault failed to get either car into the final part.

500|$|Austin Pilkington was aggrieved at Horne's {{failure to}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} he had provided, and decided against offering {{the young man}} a post in the family firm. Despite the disappointment, through his contacts within the industry, he secured for the young Horne {{an interview with the}} Triplex Safety Glass Company at King's Norton, a district of Birmingham. Horne's sporting record commended him to the manager of the Triplex factory, and he was taken on as a management trainee on a modest salary. In September 1930, despite his unimpressive finances, he married Lady Mary Pelham-Clinton-Hope, daughter of the 8th Duke of Newcastle. The marriage was happy at first, but had broken down by 1932. Mary applied for an annulment in November 1932; she declared the reason was [...] "the incapacity of the respondent [...] to consummate the marriage", which was dissolved in 1933, although the two remained on friendly terms thereafter.|$|E
500|$|As a continuation, [...] "Red Dead Redemption elegiac tone knits {{incredibly}} {{well with}} [...] arch Gothic horror", wrote Dan Whitehead (Eurogamer). Critics found the expansion's story {{to be much}} more lighthearted in comparison to the main game, with a different overall feel. IGN marked the title's exaggerated theatricality and overtones of horror B movie panache. At the time, zombies were a recurring motif in video games. Whitehead added that Rockstar's ability to use the [...] "most played-out and over-exposed cultural meme" [...] in their [...] "epic Western" [...] without the product appearing silly or gimmicky was a testament to their design acumen. For instance, a talk with Sasquatch was both absurd and poignant. The expansion's script, he wrote, understood the spirit of its characters and balanced sardonicism and honest pathos. Whitehead felt that its nuanced treatment of Marston made him [...] "one of gaming's great characters". On the other hand, Whitehead considered the expansion's mission design lackluster and complained of too many quests in which the player fetches items for other people and traveling between points only to initiate cutscenes. GameSpot praised the story's humor but felt that it was less interesting and varied compared to the main game. Reviewers recommended finishing the base game before starting the downloadable content, not for spoilers but to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's references to the original story.|$|E
500|$|After the race, Andrew Hampsten told El Mundo Deportivo that he {{believed}} this was the biggest win of his career so far and thought he could win the upcoming Tour de France. Hampsten stated that Jean-François Bernard and Pedro Delgado both lacked awareness when attacking {{in the mountains and}} did not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time trials, but believed they would be more active in the Tour de France. In addition, Hampsten thought Bernard and Roberto Visentini did not perform to their expectations. He did not go on to win the Tour de France, but placed fifteenth overall. Runner-up Erik Breukink commented that he was satisfied with his second-place finish, but [...] "Hampsten was simply better at the decisive moments." [...] In addition, Breukink stated he came to the race in order to prepare for the Tour de France in July. At the Tour, he finished in twelfth overall and won the young rider classification for being the highest ranked rider in the general classification under the age of 25. Third place finisher Urs Zimmermann reflected on the race and stated that his chance of winning the overall race were gone after the Gavia stage. l'Unita writer Gino Sala looked back on the race and believed Delgado did not perform well and was not a serious threat to win the race. Luis Gómez, a writer for El País, thought Delgado did not prepare properly for the Giro.|$|E
