5|$|The {{syndication}} {{deal for}} Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older {{horses in the}} Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen {{in part because of}} long-time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Unfortunately, Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.|$|E

25|$|By {{the second}} week of September 1863, {{it was clear that the}} regiment’s defense of Little Rock was {{becoming}} futile. Major General Price was ordered to leave the city after a failed attempt to plead with the citizens to defend their town.

25|$|Now in the 21st century, the Polo Field {{is split}} into two divisions: the inner soccer field, and the flat-style cycling velodrome found around the field itself. Today many sports are played in the polo fields, {{including}} soccer, cross country running, and various types of cycling. The cycling track is still alive, with {{a large amount of}} time-trial races held every cycling season. Recently a cyclist in 2013 has set a record in the park by riding a total of 188.5 <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Polo Field velodrome, circling it 279 times for a total of 10 hours moving.|$|E
25|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} named for Hiawatha Avenue, {{also known as}} Minnesota State Highway 55, which runs parallel to the train tracks for much of its distance. The line also runs for a few <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> former Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Short Line roadbed which brought Hiawatha passenger trains to the downtown depot. To integrate the light rail route {{with the rest of}} the area's bus system, it was also given the name Route 55. In extremely heavy travel periods and when the rail line is out of service for any reason, buses use that route number. Before the second phase was completed, a temporary bus line known as Route 155 provided a link to the destinations south of Fort Snelling station.|$|E

25|$|Morse was {{designed}} by French naval engineer Gaston Romazotti, who was chief engineer at the Arsenal de Cherbourg and an early submarine pioneer, having worked with Gustave Zédé on both Gymnote and Sirene (later renamed for Zédé after his death). Morse {{was designed}} to combine the best features of both vessels. Morse was laid down at Cherbourg in June 1897 and launched two years later in July 1899. She was of single-hulled construction, and built of Roma-bronze, a copper alloy of Romazotti's devising, which {{was intended to be}} more flexible than an all-steel hull, and which would interfere less with the vessels magnetic compass. Morse was powered by a 284cv electric motor, which gave her a range of 90 nautical <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface at an average speed of 4.3 knots.|$|E
25|$|Cadland ran {{six times}} at Newmarket {{in the early}} part of 1830. His first race saw him matched against Zinganee yet again in the Craven Stakes on 12 April. He started 3/1 second {{favourite}} with Zinganee on 6/1. On this occasion neither horse ran to his best form, with Cadland unplaced behind the filly Seraph. At the next Newmarket meeting Cadland walked over for a £50 race over three <b>miles.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> following day Cadland ran in a one-mile match race in which he failed to concede seven pounds to the six-year-old Maresfield. Later that afternoon he collected £100 without having to race as he walked over for a King's Plate. On 10 May Cadland carried top weight of 128 pounds in a Handicap in which he finished third to Navarin, a four-year-old carrying 98 pounds. Cadland's spring campaign ended with another walkover in the Jockey Club Plate three days later.|$|E
25|$|Cross a brook, and {{you lose}} the King of England; but you have some comfort in coming again under his Majesty, though 'shorn of his beams,' {{and no more than}} Prince of Wales.

Travel a few <b>miles</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E

25|$|Meade's {{infantry}} {{had been}} marching hard since {{the morning of}} July 7. Slocum's wing marched 29 <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day from Littlestown, Pennsylvania, to Walkersville, Maryland. Parts of the XI Corps covered distances estimated between 30 and 34 miles from Emmitsburg to Middletown. By July 9 most of the Army of the Potomac was concentrated in a 5-mile line from Rohrersville to Boonsboro. Other Union forces were in position to protect the outer flanks at Maryland Heights and at Waynesboro. Reaching these positions was difficult because of the torrential rains on July 7 that turned the roads to quagmires of mud. Long detours were required for the III and V Corps, although the disadvantage of the additional distance was offset by the roads' proximity to Frederick, which was connected by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Union supply centers, and by the superior condition of those roads, including the macadamized National Road.|$|E
25|$|The {{responsibility}} for Maya Pass lay with Stewart's 2nd Division. That morning, Stewart {{decided that the}} French would not attack, left the brigades of Major General William Pringle and Lieutenant Colonel John Cameron in the valley and rode to Elizondo, ten miles to the south. Some French soldiers were seen and light companies were sent up {{in support of the}} picket. When the French attacked in force, the British forces in the valley had to climb to the pass in full kit. By the time they got up, the picket force was wiped out and 10,000 of d'Erlon's men occupied the pass. In the Battle of Maya, Pringle opposed Darmagnac's division, while Cameron faced the rest of the French corps. The 4,000 British tried manfully to retake the pass, but they were unable to do so. On the other hand, the narrowness of the defile helped the British to hold off d'Erlon's immensely superior force. When Stewart returned at 2:00 pm, he pulled the redcoats back to a second position. By 3:00 pm, the British {{were on the verge of}} disaster. At this point, Major General Edward Barnes's brigade of Dalhousie's 7th Division arrived from the west to strike d'Erlon in the flank and the battle died down. The British lost 1,610 men and four cannons out of 6,000, while French losses numbered 2,100 out of 20,900. That evening, Lieutenant General Rowland Hill authorized a retreat to Elizondo. D'Erlon worried about Barnes's incursion and pursued very cautiously the next day. He only advanced six <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 26th.|$|E
500|$|Opportunistic {{hunting of}} lorises {{has been a}} {{traditional}} practice, for example, when a tree in which the primate is living is cut down. When forests are cleared to create oil palm (Elaeisguineensis) plantations or for housing, the lorises are collected from the trees and then sold to the [...] "loris man", who in turn sells them in the cities. Timber merchants in Kalimantan and Aceh also sell slow lorises to traders, and since the primates cling to branches instead of fleeing, they are often transported hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original tree branches to which they clung.|$|E

500|$|Boeing {{has worked}} with General Electric to offer a 2% {{improvement}} in fuel efficiency to new aircraft beginning in 2016. [...] GE will improve the fan module and the high pressure compressor stage-1 blisk in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduce clearances between {{the tips of the}} turbine blades and the shroud during cruise. [...] These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the 787, will, GE says, lower fuel burn by 0.5%. [...] Boeing's wing modification will deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another 75 nautical <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or 2,400lb of cargo to a [...] "load limited" [...] flight.|$|E
500|$|On October 8, {{just nine}} {{days after the}} Woodward, Secretariat was moved to turf for the Man O' War Stakes at a {{distance}} of [...] miles.

[...] Secretariat went to the lead early, followed by Tentam, who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch. Tentam got to within a half-length before Secretariat responded, pulling away by three lengths. Tentam made another run around the far turn, but Secretariat again drew away, eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam, with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third. Secretariat set a course record time of 2:24. After the race, Ron Turcotte explained that [...] "when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him and he pulled away".|$|E
500|$|The band {{traveled}} to 47 {{of the lower}} 48 states in a unique 1955 Greyhound Scenicruiser, identified as #472.

Quist has stated that they put about two million <b>miles</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. [...] The bus was sold in an estate sale following the Montana Band plane crash, and later obtained by a collector in Great Falls, Montana who refurbished it and states that, , it still ran. [...] The same could not be said of the bus during the band's touring years, when breakdowns and maintenance issues were frequent, possibly because of the Montana altitude, irregular driving habits of band personnel, or simply the mileage the bus accumulated.|$|E
