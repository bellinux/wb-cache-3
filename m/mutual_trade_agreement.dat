40|$|The {{literature}} {{measuring the}} impact of Preferential <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreements</b> (PTA) and WTO membership on trade flows has produced remarkably diverse results. Rose''s (2004) seminal paper reports a range of specifications that show no WTO effects, but Subramanian and Wei (2007) contend {{that he does not}} fully control for multilateral resistance (which could bias WTO estimates). Subramanian and Wei (2007) address multilateral resistance comprehensively to report strong WTO trade effects for industrialized countries but do not account for unobserved bilateral heterogeneity (which could inflate WTO estimates). We unify these two approaches by accounting for both multilateral resistance and unobserved bilateral heterogeneity, while also allowing for individual trade effects of PTAs. WTO effects vanish and remain insignificant throughout once multilateral resistance, unobserved bilateral heterogeneity, and individual PTA effects are introduced. The result is robust to the use of alternative definitions and coding conventions for WTO membership that have been employed by Rose (2004), Tomz et al. (2007), or by Subramanian and Wei''s (2007).

40|$|Thesis (MCom (International Trade)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. <b>Trade</b> <b>agreements</b> play a {{big part}} in {{international}} trade and have existed for as long as countries have been trading internationally. Countries often agree to sign a <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> with their <b>trading</b> partners because <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> can stimulate international trade by removing barriers. <b>Trade</b> <b>agreements</b> can also {{have a negative impact on}} a country, such as social injustice and economic inequality. South Africa has numerous <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> with various countries, one important agreement that South Africa is part of is the regional <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> between the European Union (EU) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries which originated in 1976. The Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) is a preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> which evolved from the Cotonou Agreement which came into force in 2000 and envisioned the creation of <b>mutual</b> <b>trade</b> <b>agreements.</b> When this agreement expired in 2007, the (EPA) was created. The main objective of the EPA’s is to integrate the ACP countries into the world economy. The EU aims to combine trade, politics and development and enhance the political dimension of ACP countries by addressing issues such as corruption, poverty and inadequate development policies. The EU is in favour of the EPA because it will reduce the number of negotiations with various countries, which it currently holds simultaneously. South Africa had some reservations regarding the EPA. South Africa is currently governed by the Trade, Development and Co-operation Agreement (TDCA), which was created with specific goals and also acts as a strategic partnership between the EU and South Africa. If the EPA is implemented in South Africa, it will replace certain elements of the TDCA agreement. South Africa has characteristics of both a developed and developing economy and will be excluded from several of the general trade arrangements of the EPA. The EU is offering duty-free and quota-free access for all the countries except for South Africa. This will result in two different SACU tariffs for imports from the EU. South Africa also argues that various discrepancies will arise between the EPA and TDCA which will cause various challenges regarding political, legal and technical aspects between Southern African countries and this will hinder regional integration amongst these countries. There are various opinions as to which agreement will be more beneficial for South Africa. Where the EPA aims to create a single agreement for all ACP countries, the TDCA is an exclusive agreement between South Africa and the EU, and addresses issues specific to South Africa. The underlying problem is that South Africa has qualities of both a developed and a developing nation and is being excluded from some of the benefits that the EU is offering the other members. This rings some alarm bells, as South Africa and its neighbouring countries are working towards better regional integration. The EPA might have a negative influence on this regional integration because various African countries will benefit differently under the EPA. This Study analyses the possible effects the EPA could have on South Africa’s trade with the EU and South Africa’s neighbouring countries by means of a literature study and an empirical analysis. The first part of literature study gives an overview on trade theories and <b>trade</b> <b>agreements,</b> advantages of free trade, trade barriers and the likeliness of countries to trade with each other. The second part provides an in depth overview of regional and preferential <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> and economic integration. The Third section of the literature study gives a complete overview of South Africa and the EU’s economic and trade situation. The Fourth and final section of the literature study provides an overview of the TDCA and the EPA and compares the two agreements. The literature study is followed by an empirical analysis and an overview of the gravity model. The empirical analysis studied the impact of trade barriers on the historic trade between South Africa and the EU using a gravity model as a basis. The gravity model was used as a base for the regression models, because it has proven to give accurate estimations in previous studies done with similar trade data. This study used data for each variable for the time period 2000 to 2010 and was sourced from the World Bank and the International Trade Centre but there are data limitations. Separate models were estimated for exports from South Africa to the EU and imports to SA from the EU. From the import regression results, it was clear that the coefficients were very small and should all tariffs be eliminated, there will not be a significant increase in imports to South Africa from the EU. The export regression results were similar to the results of imports and indicated that if all tariffs should be eliminated with the implementation of the EPA, there will not be a significant increase in exports from South Africa to the EU. However the EPA stretches beyond only trade benefits and because the EU remains one of South Africa’s biggest trade and development partners, it is vital to consider the effects of the EPA. It does appear that the EPA’s main motivator is not international trade, but that it is rather political and development orientated. Master...|$|R

40|$|The Balkan {{states are}} engaged in a complex and {{contradictory}} process of simultaneous regional integration and disintegration. The main instrument of regional integration has been a network of bilateral Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Agreements</b> which the Balkan countries have adopted under the guidance of the Stability Pact for South East Europe, and more recently the extension of the CEFTA free trade area to the region. The bilateral FTAs have been criticised for creating a ‘spaghetti bowl’ of differentiated trade relations, and creating risks of trade deflection and trade diversion. At the same time other arrangements, including the contractual relations of individual countries with the EU, cut across the region and fragment their <b>mutual</b> <b>trade</b> relations. Moreover, Croatia is likely to become an EU member within the next few years, at which point it will suspend its <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> with the non-member Balkan states. Therefore, soon after having established a new mechanism of integration, the region will once again be split apart, leaving a rump association of five or six poverty-stricken and politically unstable countries to pursue the vision of regional cooperation.

In order to {{increase}} the chances of success of their Perestroika, the reformers, especially those from Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union, are striving for closer links between their countries and the economically-advanced Western, Europe. Thus, an economic reunification of the divided continent has become a real possibility - unless a misconceived Internal Market 1992 dashes this chance and leads instead to an isolation of Western Europe from the East. The purpose of this article is, firstly to demonstrate the importance of the economic relations with the West for the East European reform states, secondly to describe the dangers of a Single Market 1992 limited to the EC only and thirdly to show a way to a pan-European economic integration. The proposal to overcome the economic division of Europe consists of three keypoints : (1) the European Community refrains from the construction of a Fortress EC and gives a liberal character to its Internal Market 1992; (2) the EC and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) extend their current <b>mutual</b> free <b>trade</b> <b>agreements</b> for industrial products to the trade of services and to factor movements in such a way that the Internal Market 1992 includes the EFTA and the EC in all economically relevant domains; and (3) the EFTA invites all the reform states from Eastern Europe fulfilling certain economic conditions to secure themselves free access into the whole west European market by means of joining this revitalized EFTA...|$|R

From analyses of time series data for Malaysia’s trade with the world and Japan, in terms of trade volume, trade share, and rate of growth, it is observed that during {{the first two years of}} this FTA, its influence on bilateral trade between these two countries was not significant. This research indicates that the agreement is still at a fledgling stage, and has limited scope for influencing and revamping <b>mutual</b> <b>trade.</b> The results provide weak support for the thesis that formation of a free <b>trade</b> <b>agreement</b> or bloc is an effective tool for enhancing trade between partner countries. Although a two years of engagement is not long enough to test any rigorous model nor draw valid conclusions, a FTA is indeed an effective tool as long as partners do not enter into such arrangements with many countries, which may dilute the anticipated outcome of an agreement between two countries. 1...|$|R
