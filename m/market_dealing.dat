He traded in cowhides, was the founder and promoter of the first indigo mart which was established under the name of M/s. Moore, Hickey & Co. The English merchants used to hire him for his sound judgements on indigo, silk, sugar, rice, saltpetre etc. He got appointed as [...] "Banian" [...] to around twenty first class agency houses out of around fifty or sixty such houses in Calcutta. Later he also became a landed property speculator as well as merchant successively in partnership with Fergusson Brothers & Co., Oswald Seal & Co. and Tulloh & Co. and in these three firms he was said to have lost some thirty lacs of rupees. He got into exporting of indigo, silk, sugar, rice, saltpetre to Europe and importing of iron and cotton-piece goods from England. He got up a number of cargo boats which were then a new speculation in the market. He worked the old Flour Mills, and shipped whole cargoes of biscuits to Australia for the first emigrants to its newly discovered gold fields. Later he put up a mill to refine sugar on the centrifugal principle. He was the first to use steamships for internal trade in Calcutta, and he prospered in competition with Europeans. In due course he amassed around thirteen trade ships including a steam tug named 'Banian'. He made a vast fortune in a single generation through money-dealing, a phrase which does not merely refer to money-lending, bill discounting and other banking business. There was scarcely a speculation into which he did not enter, and for which he did not supply a portion of funds.

40|$|Abstract. AG {{represents}} only one, it’s true {{that it is}} very fashionable today, of the new instruments which began to be used lately in the macroeconomic modelling. Here, it may also be mentioned the classification systems, the genetic programming, the models based on agents, the evolutionist games etc. The characteristics of all these methods consist in the effort to detect the internal dynamic processes of the modelled macroeconomic systems and not only the answer of these to external chocks and perturbations. Among these internal dynamic processes maybe the most interesting is that one of continuous adapting of the modelled macroeconomic system to the environment. In the macroeconomic environment are included different systems made of subsystems and heterogene agents and the decisions adopted by these affect both the systems as such and other subsystems and processes from the environment. This general independency, neglected several times in the macroeconomic modelling {{due to the lack of}} instruments and methods able to detect it, may be however approached with enough rigour resorting to new modelling methods as the one described in this chapter. In order to illustrate such a tendency, we shall present further on some of the most recent macroeconomic models which have been reformulated and studied using AG. Key words: genetic algorithm; fitness function; decision rule; string; multiple equilibrium points. 1. Cobweb model (Arifovic, 1994) One of the first models elaborated in this sense was the cobweb model, very famous and studied in the economic dynamics. Arifovic uses this model in order to study the adapting process of the decisions of production of the firms to the demand and offer on the market. Due to the fact that the model, in its classical form, was studied for a long time, it appears the immediate advantage of comparing the results obtained, by applying AG, with the ones resulted previously. Within the model, there are considered n active firms on a competitive <b>market,</b> <b>dealing</b> with a single perishable good (non-stackable). Due to the delay in production, the quantities from the respective good offered by firms on the market depend on the expected level of the price.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the nineteenth century the London Stock Exchange evolved from a <b>market</b> <b>dealing</b> {{primarily}} in new issues of British government debt to become the preeminent exchange of the first global capital market. By 1914, one-third of the public capital available to investors anywhere in the world was listed and traded on the London Stock Exchange. In contrast to these examples of spectacular growth of the business conducted within the exchange, however, the microstructure of the London Stock Exchange remained remarkably constant over the entire century. The remarkable expansion in scale and diversification of activity in the London Stock Exchange was sustained over the century with such minimal organizational change due to three factors. First, the evolution of the London Stock Exchange's microstructure was path dependent – the initial conditions for membership set the incentives for the owners and operators of the exchange, and these determined how they responded to successive shocks over time. Second, the continued success of the exchange was due to the peculiar structure of property rights in the exchange. Ownership of the exchange by the Proprietors was separated from governance of the operation of the exchange by the Members. Innovations were spurred by the owners of the exchange, who sought constantly to expand the membership. Newer members were then induced to take risky searches for new sources of revenue. This is how foreign securities were added permanently to the listings of the exchange in the 1820 s. The third factor, the exchange’s insistence on separating members in to two classes – brokers and jobbers (dealers) – with different incentives led to the increasing ineffectiveness of the exchange over time. By the turn of the 20 th century, brokers increasingly outweighed jobbers within the membership and exercised their political power to restrict membership, enforce minimum commissions, and confine arbitrage to a limited class of members. In short, the adverse consequences of a self-regulating club of self-interested members began to appear, but only after a century of remarkable growth, innovation, and effectiveness in mobilizing the savings of the world to realize the material benefits of the first industrial revolution. ...|$|E
