2500|$|Most [...] "wild" [...] horses today, {{such as the}} American mustang or the Australian brumby, are {{actually}} feral horses descended from domesticated animals that escaped and adapted {{to life in the}} wild. In contrast, the Przewalski's horse has never been domesticated and remains the only true wild horse in the world today. Przewalski's horse is one of three known subspecies of Equus ferus, the others being the domesticated horse Equus ferus caballus, and the extinct tarpan Equus ferus ferus. There are still a number of other wild equines, including three species of zebra and various subspecies of the African wild ass, onager (including the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass),</b> and kiang.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> are herbivorous mammals. They feed on grasses, {{herbs and}} vegetation. They also feed on shrubs and trees in drier habitats. During {{spring and summer}} in Mongolia, the {{succulent}} plants of the Zygophyllaceae family form {{an important component of}} the diet of the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> among Old World equids, {{existed for}} more than 4 million years. The oldest {{divergence}} of Equus was the onager followed by the zebras and onwards. A new species called the kiang (E. kiang), a Tibetan relative, was previously {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the onager as E. hemionus kiang, but recent molecular studies indicate it to be a distinct species, having diverged from the closest relative of the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass's</b> ancestor less than 500,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|No {{information}} is available for home ranges of Caspian tigers. In search for prey, they possibly prowled widely and followed migratory ungulates from one pasture to another. Wild pigs and cervids probably formed their main prey base. In many regions of Central Asia, Bactrian deer and roe deer were important prey species, as well as Caucasian red deer, goitered gazelle in Iran; Eurasian golden jackals, jungle cats, locusts, and other small mammals in the lower Amu-Darya River area; saiga, wild horses, Persian onagers in Miankaleh peninsula; Turkmenian kulans, <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses,</b> and mountain sheep in the Zhana-Darya and around the Aral Sea; Manchurian wapiti and moose {{in the area of}} Lake Baikal. They caught fish in flooded areas and irrigation channels. In winter, they frequently attacked dogs and livestock straying away from herds. They preferred drinking water from rivers, and drank from lakes in seasons when water was less brackish.|$|R
50|$|Based {{on ancient}} drawings, the Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> had stripes on its legs {{as well as}} a {{shoulder}} cross. Of the living subspecies of African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has only leg stripes, and the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> only the shoulder stripe. One or both features appear sometimes in the domestic donkey, the domestic descendant of the African <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus hemionus), {{also known}} as Mongolian khulan, is the {{nominate}} subspecies of the onager. It is found in southern Mongolia and northern China. It was previously found in eastern Kazakhstan and southern Siberia before being extirpated there through hunting. In 2015, the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> are listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

40|$|Genetic {{data from}} extant donkeys (Equus asinus) have {{revealed}} two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, suggestive of two separate domestication events in northeast Africa about 5000 years ago. Without distinct phylogeographic structure in domestic donkey haplogroups and with little {{information on the}} genetic makeup of the ancestral African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> however, it {{has been difficult to}} identify wild ancestors and geographical origins for the domestic mitochondrial clades. Our analysis of ancient archaeological and historic museum samples provides the first genetic information on the historic Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus africanus), Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus somaliensis) and ancient donkey. The results demonstrate that the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was an ancestor of the first donkey haplogroup. In contrast, the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> has considerable mitochondrial divergence from the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and domestic donkeys. These findings resolve the long-standing issue {{of the role of the}} Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the domestication of the donkey, but raise new questions regarding the second ancestor for the donkey. Our results illustrate the complexity of animal domestication, and have conservation implications for critically endangered Nubian and Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass...</b>|$|R
25|$|Few {{species of}} ass {{exist in the}} wild. The African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus, has two subspecies, the Somali <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus somaliensis, and the Nubian <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus africanus, the {{principal}} ancestor of the domestic donkey. Both are critically endangered. Extinct species include the European ass, Equus hydruntinus, which became extinct during the Neolithic, and the North African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> Equus africanus atlanticus, which became extinct in Roman times.|$|R

A recent survey showed there were 3128 to 4711 wild asses and 11366 to 16235 goitered gazelles living in Kalamaili. Argali sheep (Ovis ammon) and Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) are also reported but very rare.|$|E
50|$|The Atlas <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus atlanticus), {{also known}} as Algerian <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> is a purported extinct {{subspecies}} of the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> that was once found across North Africa {{and parts of the}} Sahara. It was last represented in a villa mural ca.300 AD in Bona, Algeria, and became extinct as a result of Roman sport hunting.|$|R
50|$|A the {{previous}} census in 2009, estimated 4,038 Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass.</b> However, {{the population was}} still growing. In December 2014, the population was estimated at 4,451 individuals. It has increased from a jump of 454. However, as of 2015, the current Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population has increased to more than 4,800 individuals in {{and outside of the}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> Wildlife Sanctuary of India.|$|R
50|$|First {{census of}} the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{was done in}} 1940, when there were an {{estimated}} 3,500 <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b> But, by the year 1960, this figure fell to just 362, it was then classified as a highly endangered species. In the years 1973 & 1976, Rann of Kutch and adjoining districts were taken up as the area for conservation for this sub-species also known as Khur. From 1976, the forest department began conducting the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> census. Water holes were increased in the area, the forest department has also started a project for having fodder plots though the forest department is yet to get desired success. In 1998, the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population was estimated at 2,940, by the year 2004 it has increased to an estimated 3,863. A recent census conducted by forest department in 2009 has revealed that the population of <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> in the state was estimated to about 4,038, an increase of 4.53% as compared to 2004. Recently in 2015, the current census of the Indian <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population has increased to more than 4,800 individuals in {{and outside of the}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Ass</b> Wildlife Sanctuary of India.|$|R
50|$|Onagers are {{the most}} horse-like of wild asses. Onagers are short-legged {{compared}} to horses, and their coloring varies depending on the season. They are generally reddish-brown in color during the summer, becoming yellowish-brown or grayish-brown in the winter. They have a black stripe bordered in white that extends {{down the middle of}} the back. The belly, the buttocks and the muzzle are white in most onagers, except for the <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> that has a broad black dorsal stripe bordered with white.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the harsh}} conditions, these deserts and the {{surrounding}} regions sustain many animals, including black-tailed gazelles, marbled polecats, wild Bactrian camels, <b>Mongolian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> and sandplovers. They are occasionally visited by snow leopards, brown bears, and wolves. Drought-adapted shrubs in the desert included gray sparrow's saltwort (Salsola passerina), gray sagebrush, and low grasses such as needle grass and bridlegrass. Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Great Gobi A and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area.|$|E
