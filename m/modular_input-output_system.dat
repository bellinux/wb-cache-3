A Boolean <b>input-output</b> <b>system</b> is (bi-)quadratic if every of its variables has indegree (and outdegree) at most 2, where the indegree of a variable {{is the number of}} variables its regulatory function takes input from, and the outdegree is the number of variables for which it serves as input. Cooperative quadratic Boolean <b>input-output</b> <b>systems</b> can use only binary AND, binary OR, and unary COPY gates; the latter type of gates is not allowed in strictly quadratic <b>input-output</b> <b>systems.</b> A bi-quadratic system is strictly bi-quadratic if, in addition, every of its variables except the input variables has indegree exactly 2. Note that for Boolean networks the latter requirement already implies that each variable must have outdegree exactly 2 as well (since the sum of indegrees in any directed graph is equal to the sum of outdegrees), but due to external inputs and outputs, this implication is in general false for Boolean <b>input-output</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

Results developed in this book are useful aids for the analysis and modeling of physical systems, including the development of guidance and control algorithms and in developing simulations. The generalized adjoint system is defined and is patterned similarly to adjoints of bounded linear transformations. Next the elementary properties of the generalized adjoint system are derived. For a space of <b>input-output</b> <b>systems,</b> a generalized adjoint map from this space of systems to the space of generalized adjoints is defined. Then properties of the generalized adjoint map are derived. Afterward the author demonstrates that the inverse of an <b>input-output</b> <b>system</b> may be represented in terms of the generalized adjoint. The use of generalized adjoints to determine bounds for undesired inputs such as noise and disturbance to an <b>input-output</b> <b>system</b> is presented and methods which parallel adjoints in linear systems theory are utilized.

The state of a system condenses the effects of past inputs to the system in a useful manner. This monograph emphasizes two main properties of the natural state; the first {{has to do with the}} possibility of determining the <b>input-output</b> <b>system</b> from its natural state set and the second deals with differentiability properties involving the natural state inherited from the <b>input-output</b> <b>system,</b> including differentiability of the natural state and natural state trajectories. The results presented in this title aid in modeling physical systems since system identification from a state set holds in most models.

This provides an alternative interpretation of the symbolic calculus introduced by Fliess to compute the output response of such systems. Finally, it is shown that the formal Laplace-Borel transform provides an isomorphism between the semigroup of all well defined Fliess operators under composition and the semigroup of all locally convergent formal power series under the composition product.

40|$|An {{economy is}} a complex {{organizational}} system. In such an economic system, the various economic factors (behaviors) have influences on or {{are affected by the}} economic phenomena through causal interactions of the price-resource mechanism. In other words, the economic phenomena vary in response to the various economic behaviors, and vice versa. They are interdependent in an economic system;Under such an interdependent economic system, a method of systematically analyzing the interrelationships among the economic behaviors is the <b>input-output</b> analysis (<b>system).</b> The <b>system</b> of <b>input-output</b> analysis was first developed by W. W. Leontief on the bases of both Quesnay 2 ̆ 7 s Tableau Economique idea (scheme) and Walras 2 ̆ 7 s general equilibrium framework. And the Leontief <b>input-output</b> <b>system</b> has been utilized by many economists since Leontief 2 ̆ 7 s development of it;However, such an <b>input-output</b> <b>system</b> has the following characteristics.

The identification of fuzzy clusters is based on an analysis to derive an alternative decomposition of␣interindustry flows (Dridi and Hewings 2002), it is a complementary approach to the so-called ‘Matrioshka principal’ (Sonis and Hewings 1990) and will be presented first; the approach looks into the hierarchy of the statistical dependence between supply and demand in <b>input-output</b> <b>systems.</b> The analysis on the cluster structure and the interindustry flows is conducted using the data analysis technique known as dual scaling (Nishisato 1980, 1994).

40|$|Recently, {{negative}} imaginary and counter-clockwise {{systems have}} attracted attention as an interesting class of systems, which is well-motivated by applications. In this paper first the formulation and extension of negative imaginary and counter-clockwise <b>systems</b> as (nonlinear) <b>input-output</b> Hamiltonian <b>systems</b> with dissipation is summarized. Next it is shown how {{by considering the}} time-derivative of the outputs a port-Hamiltonian system is obtained, and how {{this leads to the}} consideration of alternate passive outputs for port-Hamiltonian systems. Furthermore, a converse result to positive feedback interconnection of <b>input-output</b> Hamiltonian <b>systems</b> with dissipation is obtained, stating that the positive feedback interconnection of two linear <b>systems</b> is an <b>input-output</b> Hamiltonian <b>system</b> with dissipation if and only if the <b>systems</b> themselves are <b>input-output</b> Hamiltonian <b>systems</b> with dissipation. This implies that the Poisson and resistive structure matrices can be redefined {{in such a way that}} the interaction between the two systems only takes place via the coupling term in the Hamiltonian of the interconnected system.
