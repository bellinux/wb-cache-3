50|$|A <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> (MFC) is {{a device}} {{used to measure}} and control the flow of liquids and gases. A <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> is {{designed}} and calibrated to control {{a specific type of}} liquid or gas at a particular range of flow rates. The MFC can be given a setpoint from 0 to 100% of its full scale range but is typically operated in the 10 to 90% of full scale where the best accuracy is achieved. The device will then control the rate of flow to the given setpoint. MFCs can be either analog or digital. A digital flow controller is usually able to control more than one type of fluid whereas an analog controller is limited to the fluid for which it was calibrated.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} gas {{dispensing}} for PECVD proceses in low temperature plasma. Key to succesful depositions {{is an accurate}} and stable flow rate of precursor to reactor, where discharges are used for depositions of thin films. Liquid can be also an admixture of the precursor, {{but it has to}} be mixed with the carrier gas and finaly evaporated. For this purpose was chosen CEM evaporating system from Bronkhorst High-Tech B. V., which is composed of gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller,</b> liquid <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller,</b> evaporating device and control unit. Main goal of this thesis is to implement evaporating system to plasma chemical reactor, calibrate it and do measuring tests...|$|E
50|$|Constant <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> supply: Precision <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controllers</b> {{are used}} to control the flow rate of each gas for blending. <b>Mass</b> <b>flow</b> meters may be {{installed}} on the outputs of the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controllers</b> to monitor the output. The gases may be passed through a static mixer to ensure homogenous output.|$|R
50|$|Gas <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate can be {{directly}} measured, independent of pressure and temperature effects, with thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meters, Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meters, or <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controllers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controllers</b> {{require the}} supply gas or liquid {{to be within}} a {{specific}} pressure range. Low pressure will starve the MFC of fluid and cause it to fail to achieve its setpoint. High pressure may cause erratic flow rates.|$|R
30|$|All {{reactions}} {{were carried out}} in a fixed bed catalytic reactor, made of SS 316 (1.8  cm I.D. ×  30  cm height), at atmospheric pressure containing 10  g of fresh catalyst sample. The catalyst section was packed in the middle between two sections of glass wool. Porcelain beads were loaded {{at the top of}} the catalyst bed to preheat the feed. Before start of reaction, the catalyst was activated at 773  K for 10  h in the flow of air. After completion of activation, flow rate of carrier gas was controlled through a <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> at 40  mL/min, an optimum rate from previous studies [19]. The <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> was calibrated carefully with a soap film as well as with a wet gas meter for every run.|$|E
40|$|The design, development, and {{manufacture}} of an all mechanical <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> are discussed. A test program was conducted using inert gas as the test medium. The unit controlled the pressure within plus of minus one percent. An analytical method is presented for relating the control pressure error with error in mass flow...|$|E
30|$|Oxygen, carbon dioxide, {{nitric oxide}} and nitrous oxide {{concentrations}} in the headspace of the reactor were monitored in dried gas using a gas analyzer (NGA 2000, Rosemount, Chanhassen, MN, USA). The flow of nitrogen gas to the reactor was kept at 100  ml/min using a <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> (Brooks Instrument, Ede, The Netherlands), to maintain sufficient flow through the gas analyzer (80  ml/min).|$|E
30|$|The 2.45 -GHz {{microwave}} generator of the MPECVD {{system could be}} operated with the power up to 1.0 kW. The H 2, CH 4, and Ar process gases were introduced independently into the chamber through electronically controlled <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controllers.</b> The substrates could be heated up to over 800 °C and maintained at controlled constant temperature using a PID.|$|R
50|$|Thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meters, {{also known}} as thermal {{dispersion}} or immersible <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meters comprise a family of instruments for the measurement of the total <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> rate of a fluid, primarily gases, flowing through closed conduits. A second type is the capillary-tube type of thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meter. Many <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controllers</b> (MFC) which combine a <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meter, electronics and a valve are based on this design. Furthermore, a thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meter can be built by measuring temperature differential across a silicon-based MEMS chip.|$|R
2500|$|Needle valves: <b>Mass</b> <b>flow</b> meters may be {{purchased}} with <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controllers</b> which permit setting flow rates. [...] These are expensive, however. Respirometry research often {{will attempt to}} measure more than one animal at a time, which would necessitate one chamber per animal and thus controlled flow through each chamber. [...] An alternative and more cost-effective method to control flow would be via stainless steel or carbon steel needle valves. Needle valves plus <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> meters provides a cost-effective means to achieve desired flow rates. The valves cost about $20.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a new type}} of <b>Mass</b> <b>Flow</b> <b>Controller</b> (MFC) is designed, {{constructed}} and used. Whilst existing MFCs rely on either pressure loss or temperature rise measurements to estimate and control flows, this new device is based on measuring time, which is more easily and accurately monitored. The device adopts the 'bucket and stopwatch' method to deliver specific and constant masses at pre-set time intervals. By alerting the time intervals, the mass flow is precisely controlled.

The MFC is {{fitted with a}} closed loop control system which is given an input signal by the operator (or an external circuit/computer) that it compares to the value from the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> sensor and adjusts the proportional valve accordingly to achieve the required flow.

40|$|A <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller,</b> {{based on}} an {{integrated}} flow sensor and a thermally actuated solid state regulator, is presented. The sensor is a miniaturized differential calorimeter obtained by postprocessing a silicon chip fabricated by a standard microelectronic process. The regulator consists in a microchannel etched into {{the surface of a}} silicon substrate and sealed with a glass plate, joined to the silicon die using anodic bonding. Flow regulation is achieved by varying the channel temperature by means of a chromium resistor. The two devices are connected in closed-loop through a low noise—low offset electronic circuit. Experimental data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the flow controller, are presented. Limitations of the proposed approach and possible improvements are discussed...|$|E

Normally, the flow rate of ethylene was 2 – 22  ml/min with benzene to ethylene mole ratios ranging from 1 : 1 to 6 : 1, respectively, under atmospheric pressure. The flow rate of ethylene was adjusted through a separate thermal <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>controller</b> (Bronkhorst). The flow rate of benzene was controlled through a one channel syringe pump (Cole-Parmer). The alkylation reaction products were collected in a cooled condenser attached to the end of the reactor and was analyzed using a gas chromatograph.|$|E
