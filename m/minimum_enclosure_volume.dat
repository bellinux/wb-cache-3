A simplified theoretical approach is formulated to evaluate the modal parameters of the roof-air system considering air leakage through the openings, the pneumatic stiffness, and the structural and acoustical damping of the system. The accuracy of the approximate formulae is assessed by comparison with a complex eigenvalue analysis. An exact solution is derived to evaluate the modal parameters for a circular membrane roof backed by a cavity with openings.

Room pressure development during clean agent discharges is dependent upon several system-and enclosure-related factors. A major factor influencing the development of room pressure {{is the nature of the}} clean agent. The discharge of inert gas agents is characterized by a rapid buildup of pressure to a maximum, followed by a relatively slow decay in pressure with time.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} small, time-dependent, perturbations to geometric wave-equation domains is hardly existent. Acoustic enclosures are typical examples featuring locally reacting surfaces that {{respond to a}} pressure gradient or a pressure difference, alter the <b>enclosure's</b> <b>volume</b> and, hence, the boundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly, the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a temporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting surface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature nonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions. The solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates techniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The appropriate space is {{shown to be a}} (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context of a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is obtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution equations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's principle then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric perturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's time-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the formalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational acoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are derived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting surfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and reduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial differential equations. In this way, a straightforwardly applicable formalism is derived for scalar wave equations on time-varying domains. Comment: 121 pages and 16 figure...|$|R

The accuracy is discussed first in terms of mass balance at the steady-state stage for the <b>enclosure</b> <b>volume.</b> The required fineness of the grid is determined by analyzing the mass balance using two non-dimensional length scales. The first considers the ratio of the ventilation factor to the grid cell size, and the second considers the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the opening to the grid cell size. When these two length scales are larger than 10, the corresponding mass balance error as obtained from post-processing the output is lower than 4 %. The simulation results, including flow through the vertical opening, heat release rate inside the enclosure, gas temperature inside the enclosure, neutral plane height, and external flame height are compared with experimental data and empirical correlations. The air inflow rate through the opening is found to correlate linearly to the ventilation factor as m˙= 0. 41 *A*H^(1 / 2). For the heat release rate inside the enclosure, the predictions follow the empirical correlation Qin= 1131 *A*H^(1 / 2). This {{is directly related to the}} air inflow rate and incomplete combustion with the inflowing oxygen. Time-averaged gas temperatures inside the enclosure are under-predicted by maximum 13. 1 % compared with experimental data at the corner near the opening. Neutral plane height values at the opening, determined from the velocity profile of the vent flow, show good agreement with empirical estimations (Zf= 0. 4 ⋅H).
