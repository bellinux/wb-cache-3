The dining-cocktail lounge had half its space devoted to a kitchen and bar area; two seating areas in the other end seated 12 and 24, respectively. Two of the sleeping cars contained 12 open sections, with daytime seating for 24; the third contained eight enclosed sections, two double bedrooms, and a compartment, giving the car a <b>maximum</b> <b>occupancy</b> of 22.

25|$|The table below {{illustrates}} {{the capacity of}} a light rail train (the Siemens S70) {{compared to that of}} a standard car with five seats. The average length of a standard five-seat car is about 4.74 metres. The length of a Siemens S70 light rail vehicle is 27.7 meters, approximately the same length as 5.8 cars. The <b>maximum</b> <b>occupancy</b> of a five-seat automobile car is five people. The maximum capacity of the Siemens S70 is 220 people. This means that one metre in a car has a capacity of one person and one metre in a light rail vehicle has a capacity of almost eight persons, so the capacity of light rail is about eight times as high as that of an average consumer car, if only the length of the vehicles is taken into consideration. The average width of an automobile is about 1.77 metres, while the average width of the Siemens S70 is about 2.7 metres. The area of an average consumer car is about 8.4m², while the area taken up by a light rail car is about 74.8m². In an automobile car, each square metre has room for only 0.6 persons, while each square metre in a light rail car has room for 2.9 persons. This means that a light rail vehicle is significantly more capacity-effective than a consumer car is. Height is not taken into consideration, because it is not normally a problem given minimum-clearance regulations for underpasses.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the characteristics of}} field usage patterns in the SpecJVM 98 benchmarks. It finds that multiple object instances of the same class often exhibit different field-usage patterns. Motivated by this observation, we designed a heap compression mechanism that classifies object instances at runtime based on their field-usage patterns and eliminates unused fields to save space. To achieve the maximum space savings while minimizing the space and time overhead, our design combines three interrelated techniques in a novel manner: runtime object instance classification, field virtualization, and bidirectional object layout. An experimental evaluation reveals that this mechanism can reduce the <b>maximum</b> heap <b>occupancy</b> of SpecJVM 98 benchmarks by up to 18 % and 14 % on average while keeping the application execution overhead low. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{investigated the}} performance of an Electric Taxi (ET) fleet that catered solely for customers with advance reservations. In a previously related research, a customized Paired Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Window and Charging Station (PPDPTWCS) had been formulated to solve for the minimum number of taxis that would serve a fixed set of customer demand. The concept behind this fleet optimization was to chain multiple customer trips and trips to Charging Stations (CSs) to form a route and assigned to a taxi driver. In this paper {{the sensitivity of the}} ET fleet’s operations with respect to network sizes, customer demand densities and number of CSs have been investigated. It also analyzed the market shares of the CSs and the occupancy of a CS over time. The results showed that, (1) the expansion of network size or the increase in customer demand density led to increase in fleet size, number of trips to the CSs and <b>maximum</b> <b>occupancies</b> at the CSs but these performance measures grew at different rates; (2) when the network size and number of CSs were fixed, an increase in customer demand density led to a better utilization of taxis in terms of more customers served per taxi and higher average revenue per taxi; (3) given the same network size and demand density, the ET fleet’s performance was relatively insensitive to the number of CSs; and (4) the usage of individual CS was affected by the number of CS and their locations; and (5) when all the ETs were fully charged {{at the beginning of the}} same shift hour, they visited the CSs in bunches when their batteries were about to run out. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the operations of the ET fleet and the CSs. They could be used for making better decisions in the planning of ET operations...|$|R

For fixed <b>maximum</b> site <b>occupancy</b> $n_b= 5 $, we calculate the phase boundaries between the Mott insulator and the `superfluid' phase for the lowest two Mott lobes. We extract the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter from the density-density correlation function and determine accurately the critical interaction strength for the Mott transition. For both phases, we study the momentum distribution function in the homogeneous system, and the particle distribution and quasi-momentum distribution functions in a parabolic trap. With our zero-temperature method we determine the photoemission spectra in the Mott insulator and in the `superfluid' phase of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. In the insulator, the Mott gap separates the quasi-particle and quasi-hole dispersions. In the `superfluid' phase the spectral weight is concentrated around zero momentum.

40|$|We propose an {{improved}} solvent contact model {{to estimate the}} solvation free energies of amino acids from individual atomic contributions. The modification of the solvation model involves the optimization of three kinds of parameters in the solvation free energy function: atomic fragmental volume, <b>maximum</b> atomic <b>occupancy,</b> and atomic solvation parameters. All of these atomic parameters for 17 atom types are developed by the operation of a standard genetic algorithm {{in such a way}} to minimize the difference between experimental and calculated solvation free energies. The present solvation model is able to predict the experimental solvation free energies of amino acids with the squared correlation coefficients of 0. 94 and 0. 93 for the parameterization with Gaussian and screened Coulomb potential as the envelope functions, respectively. This result indicates that the improved solvent contact model with the newly developed atomic parameters would be a useful tool for the estimation of the molecular solvation free energy of a protein in aqueous solution...|$|R
40|$|IEEE 802. 11 -based {{multihop}} wireless {{networks have}} attracted considerable attention for next-generation networks since it can extend the service coverage area without difficulty. However, {{it is well}} known that the effective end-to-end throughput (E 2 ET) degrades due to the overhead caused by the distributed coordination function (DCF) scheme of IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol. To improve this issue, the transmission opportunity (TXOP) mechanism is defined in the IEEE 802. 11 e standard, with which a wireless node can transmit multiple frames consecutively for a <b>maximum</b> channel <b>occupancy</b> time, called TXOPlimit. This paper considers the performance of the TXOP mechanism for multihop wireless networks. Focusing on a three-node chain topology, we model it as a tandem queueing network with two nodes.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a system with}} two heterogeneous traffic classes. The users from both classes randomly generate service requests, one class having light-tailed properties, the other one exhibiting heavy-tailed characteristics. The heterogeneity in service requirements reflects the extreme variability in flow sizes observed in the Internet, with {{a vast majority of}} small transfers (2 ̆ 2 mice 2 ̆ 2) and a limited number of exceptionally large flows (2 ̆ 2 elephants 2 ̆ 2). The active traffic flows share the available bandwidth in a Processor-Sharing (ps) fashion.

The number of simultaneously active traffic flows is limited by a threshold on the <b>maximum</b> system <b>occupancy.</b> We obtain the exact asymptotics of the transfer delays incurred by the users from the light-tailed class.
