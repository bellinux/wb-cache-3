40|$|Póster presentado en: 2 nd International Seminar Rearing of unionoid mussels (Clervaux, Luxembourg - Tuesday 24 th November – Friday 27 th November 2015) Lake Banyoles is {{the second}} largest natural lake in the Iberian Peninsula {{and is one of}} the first places in the Iberian Peninsula where massive planned fish {{introductions}} have taken place. The proliferation of alien fish species explains the current scarcity of the native species that are the natural hosts of the parasitic larvae of unionids. This situation has led to a dramatic regression in the four native unionid species found in this lake (Unio mancus, U. ravoisieri, Potomida littoralis and Anodonta anatina). As a result of management geared towards the preservation of natural heritage, the ecological quality of this site has improved in recent decades. However, the main challenge for the management of the lake and its surrounding areas is now posed by invasive alien species. Projecte Estany (LIFE 08 /NAT/E/ 000078) was a four-year project (2010 – 2013) whose main aim was to design and implement a large-scale intervention actions that would combat, slow down and revert the decline in species and habitats of Community Interest via (1) the control of invasive alien species, (2) the strengthening of populations of seriously threatened native species, and (3) the restoration of key patches of riparian habitats. As part of the project to recover populations of two Unio species, a breeding laboratory was set up. During the first years of the project, several methodologies were tested to obtain mussel glochidia (larvae), optimize fish infection and design a methodology for fattening juveniles. Up to three different native fish species were tested as hosts for local Unio larvae: Barbus meridionalis, Squalius laietanus and Salaria fluviatilis. All demonstrated their capacity to act as hosts and release viable juveniles; however, due to their larger size, only the first two species are used for intensive <b>mussel</b> <b>breeding,</b> along with Luciobarbus graellsii. Between 2011 and 2013, a total of 108, 875 U. mancus and 27, 423 U. ravoisieri juveniles were produced via the artificial infection of host fish with larvae grown in a number of semi-natural sequential breeding systems fed by water and sediment from their natural habitats, pools, plastic outdoor channels, and/or cages. In the tested systems, U. mancus reached a mean length of 9. 7 mm (SD_ 1. 53) in one year and 12. 4 mm (SD_ 1. 55) in two years; for U. ravoisieri these values were 15. 8 (SD_ 0. 76) and 21. 2 mm (SD_ 2. 45). In the context of the further four years (2014 - 17) allotted to the project (LIFE Potamo Fauna, LIFE 12 NAT/ES/ 001091), efforts to breed Unio species in this laboratory, which has been enlarged, will continue. We will describe the results of the different juveniles’ collection systems and the facilities created to improve their growth over the past six years. The protocols implemented, the current installations and the results of the captive breeding of Unio species are shown here. Peer reviewe...|$|E

50|$|After 15 {{years of}} {{research}} and development into hatchery production of spat, the industry still remains almost completely reliant on wild spat, because collecting wild spat is markedly cheaper than <b>breeding</b> <b>mussels</b> in a hatchery. However, it is likely hatcheries will become increasingly important in greenshell mussel aquaculture for two main reasons. First is the potential for producing a more valuable product because hatcheries are able to selectively breed for desired traits. Second, the reliability of hatchery seed is a more stable base for an industry relying on wild seed, particularly in years when wild spat numbers are low, and when the hatchery spat will attract a premium.|$|R
40|$|The long {{freshwater}} mussel (Unio mancus, Lamarck 1819) is a threatened mollusc in Catalonia. Because of this, and taking {{part of the}} LIFE Potamo Fauna project, the “Consorci de l’Estany” creates a freshwater <b>mussel’s</b> <b>breeding</b> laboratory, where this specie is breeded in captivity in order to carry out reintroductions and population reinforcements. The {{aim of this study}} is make improvements on the in vitro culture, a technique which allows the breeding in captivity of this specie without the use of a host fish. The glochidia will be cultured in a medium with 3 essential components; M 199 medium, rabbit or carp serum and a mixture of antibiotics and antimicotics. In addition, another goal {{of this study is to}} prevent the fungal contamination caused by oomicets, because of this, malachite green will be used. The glochidia will be cultured in an incubator controlling the temperature and the CO 2 %, fact that allows a greater pH stability. Besides that, it is pretended to study the in vitro protocol and to make improvements on it, so two techniques are proposed here: the use of vials or the use of petri dishes. The goal here is to figure out which one is the best. Every day a change of the 50 % of medium will be done, and the fungal contamination will be removed. A monitoring of glochidia is done after few days to see how they develop. The results of this study indicate on one hand that malachite green has a significant effect on the oomycete contamination and it could be used to remove that contamination. On the other hand, the glochidia did not complete their metamorphosis and most of them died, so some aspect of the culture has failed (precariousness medium, contamination of mediums, extended exhibition of glochidia to clean medium MEM, or overdose of antibiotics or antimycotic). The methodology with the best results is the use of vials, with more advantages than the use of petri dishes. The advantages are, for instance, less contamination, less dirty in the medium, more pH stability and more facility when manipulating the samples. For this reasons, it is proposed for future studies the use of vials, and the implementation of some improvements, such as the use of vials with porous top or the less exhibition of glochidia to MEM mediu...|$|R
40|$|Several {{trace element}} (As, Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Sn, Zn) and gamma {{radionuclide}} (Bi- 214, Cs- 134, Cs- 137, K- 40, Pb- 212, Pb- 214, Th- 234, Tl- 208) contents were detected in Mytilus galloprovincialis samples. Analytical checks {{were carried out}} to assess higienic status and marine pollution of sea areas in front of Naples and Salerno coasts. Trace elements values show that only two samples of <b>mussels</b> from legal <b>breeding</b> has exceeded the level of Pb (European Regulation 1661 / 99). Radionuclides values are low and similar according litterature. In this study is confirmed the attitude of Mytilius galloprovincialis to behave as a good marine pollution indicator. Furthermore, the present investigation is a starting point to enhance safety and quality of this particular foodstuff and it’s also a contribution in the risk assessment related to the consumption {{of this kind of}} products...|$|R
40|$|The {{survival}} of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) depends on the protection and preservation of the suitable biotypes {{that is why it}} is necessary to know its requirements for environmental conditions. This species indicates the quality of suitable biotypes with its specific requirements for food and environment. During its life, the freshwater pearl mussel is undergoing complicated development cycle and in each phase it has different requirements for food. In the juvenile phase, it is very sensitive to quality of environment as well as quality and composition of its food, which consists of organogenic detritus, which is mainly decomposed mass of vegetable and animal origin together with bacteria. Its food arises in river basin areas as well as in river spring areas-from where it is carried downstream by a river and so pearl mussels may ingest it filtering the water. This highly specialized species that is sensitive to environmental changes, especially within its juvenile life phase, is very important as to its bio-indicating ability. The experimental part of this work was focused on the evaluation of the detritus carrying-capacity performed by the bio-indication method ex-situ in a laboratory out of its natural environment. For evaluating the carrying-capacity and quality of the tested detritus under optimal temperature conditions ex-situ for 10 days, there were used juvenile pearl <b>mussels</b> from a semi-natural <b>breeding.</b> The tested samples of detritus were collected according to the standard procedures in the summer 2015 from the locality of Blanice river spring area. There were collected totally 100 samples of detritus from 100 spring areas. The goal was to evaluate the growth of shells of juveniles depending on physico-chemical properties of the sample. The main analyzed data were the value of the pearl mussel growth and detritus parameters - pH, conductivity and altitude of the springs...|$|R
