After faking {{his death}} in Mexico by paying off the cops, George Sr. returns to the family model home, where George Michael discovers him and hides him in the attic.

5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

She befriended American aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, who, unbeknownst to Kalep, was planning a similar feat. After Earhart's successful flight from Canada to Ireland on 20 May, Kalep decided {{that it would not be}} worthwhile to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> attempt at flying across the Atlantic, since she would no longer be the first woman to do so. She continued to encourage other women to enter the field of aviation, however, and became a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organisation for women pilots which was founded by Earhart and 98 other female aviators. In August 1932, Kalep planned to fly with Roger Q. Williams from Los Angeles to Athens to celebrate the former city's hosting of the 1932 Summer Olympics, but their flight was canceled. Soon after, it was reported that Kalep had remarried to W. E. Hutton-Miller, an American stockbroker.|$|E

25|$|Mayumi Kojima {{was born}} in Tokyo. When she was in high school, she heard some music by Rosemary Clooney and {{suddenly}} became captivated by American 50s music.

25|$|Fefe Dobson's self titled {{debut album}} is {{generally}} pop-rock, {{as well as}} some traces of punk music. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different from most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In fact, Dobson originally signed with Jive Records, who intended to make her the next big pop star. However, Dobson didn't want to be a pop-star and wanted to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> type of music, and quickly left the label. For Dobson second official album Joy she worked producers David Lichens, Jon Levine, Howard Benson and Bob Ezrin on Joy, Dobson lives up to the portraits of her heroes she first hung during the recording of her first album—Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Coldplay, The Vines and Jeff Buckley. She co-wrote most of the songs on the album, usually composing on guitar, her choice of instrument.|$|E

25|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, and the fates of non-player {{characters}} Holloway, Poole and Alexander within the game. Eleanor can save Sofia Lamb or allow her to die, {{depending on whether the}} player spared or executed the non-player characters. If Delta rescued all of the Little Sisters he will breathe his last breath in Eleanor's arms, the weather will be sunny and clean, then she will absorb his personality and memories and leave Rapture with the Little Sisters to change the world for the better, dropping the doll that one of the little sisters give her in the ocean, which slightly resembles Delta, in order to mourn his death, and to make his death count. If Delta harvested all of the Little Sisters then Eleanor will extract Delta's ADAM and become bent on world domination, the weather becoming dark and stormy as the corpses of Rapture's inhabitants float to the surface. A mix between rescuing and harvesting the little sisters gives the player a choice; either Eleanor can absorb his ADAM and become evil, or Delta can stop her and die, in which case Eleanor will mourn his death and <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> way in life.|$|E

As author Judith Marcus explained in her book, Surviving the Twentieth Century, Madonna used the church to <b>make</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> point on victimization. For Marcus the main impact lay in the fact that the clip ultimately portrayed an empowerment message, questioning and [...] "attacking" [...] the Church's male prejudice and continuous female subjugation throughout history.|$|E
