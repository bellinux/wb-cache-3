50|$|Commercial IMC {{instruments}} are often operated as heat conduction (hc) calorimeters in which heat {{produced by the}} specimen (i.e. material in an ampoule) flows to the heat sink, typically an aluminum block contained in a thermostat (e.g. constant temperature bath). As mentioned above, an IMC instrument operating in hc mode is not precisely isothermal because small differences between the set temperature and the specimen temperature necessarily exist—so that there is <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> flow. However, small variations in specimen temperature do not significantly affect heat sink temperature because the heat capacity of the heat sink {{is much higher than}} the specimen—usually ca. 100×.|$|R

The structure of the housing stock {{of the country is}} analyzed, which includes different types of central heating boilers and CHP, individual gas or electric heating and stove heating. The analysis of the existing thermal supply (per unit area and per capita living) for each sector is carried out. It is found that <b>heat</b> <b>consumed</b> in the residential sector with central heating from CHP and boilers is significantly higher of <b>heat</b> <b>consumed</b> in other sectors. The missing amount of heat energy, which can be produced in two ways, is calculated.

The second part can be obtained from small new sources (for inhabited localities that do not have a centralized heat supply infrastructure). New indicators complement the system of indicators to be used to analyze and monitoring the level of Moldova's energy security.

These heat signatures provide valuable information {{to understand the}} behavior of electron clouds under certain circumstances. The heat loads from the Inner Triplets and the Stand Alone Magnets (SAMs) are used for this investigation. The data of the inner triplets confirmed with previous studies {{about the fact that}} two 50 ns beams are required for a significant electron cloud. The data has also revealed that the difference between the heat load of the inner triplets decreases with time. Also, the heat load increase at injection divides itself from heat load of the two beams. Furthermore, the heat/proton ratio does not seem to change in 2011 and 2012 (they are equivalent under similar beam conditions), suggesting that the SEY value may not have changed. It is suggested to proceed with PyECLOUD for more conclusive results. The stand-alone magnets do not show <b>measurable</b> <b>heat</b> load from the electron cloud, except for the 25 ns runs...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{perturbation}} calorimetry (PPC) is {{a relatively}} new and efficient technique, to study the volumetric properties of biomolecules in solution. In PPC, the coefficient of thermal expansion of the partial volume of the biomolecule is deduced from the <b>heat</b> <b>consumed</b> or produced after small isothermal pressure jumps (typically &# 177; 5 bar). This strongly depends on the interaction of the biomolecule with the solvent or cosolvent as well as on its packing and internal dynamic properties. This technique, complemented by ultrasound velocity and densitometry, provides valuable insight into the basic thermodynamic properties of solvation and volume effects accompanying phase transitions and interactions of biomolecular systems. Here we review data on protein folding, ligand binding processes, and phospholipid phase transitions, together with discussion of interpretation and further significant applications...|$|R

50|$|AGAs have {{recently}} been criticised for their high energy consumption and inefficiency. A small, traditional two-oven AGA running on gas will use approximately 425 kWh per week (22,100 kWh per year; perhaps half that if switched off during the summer months). The average standard gas oven and hob uses 580 kWh during a year, only 2.62% of the AGA's consumption.AGA's own figures for expected energy consumption for their two-oven AGA support this criticism, suggesting a weekly consumption of 40 litres of kerosene or diesel, 60 litres of propane gas, 425 kWh of natural gas or 220 kWh for the electric models. This would indicate that the smallest traditional two-oven gas AGA providing simple cooking functions (i.e,. no water heating or central <b>heating)</b> <b>consumes</b> almost as much gas in a week as a standard gas oven/hob does in nine months.|$|R
