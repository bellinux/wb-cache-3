RESULTS: All macro and <b>micro-element</b> concentrations of the substrates were positively and significantly related to the percentage of composts in the growing media. Plant grown on peat showed higher content of P, Ca, K, Na, Cu, Mn, Zn and Fe, and a slightly higher biomass production in comparison to compost-based growing media.

The governing boundary layer equations are transformed into a non-dimensional form and the resulting non-linear system of partial differential equations are solved using the efficient Keller-box implicit numerical finite difference method. Excellent correlation of the present numerical solutions is achieved for the case of free convection micropolar flow neglecting Sort/Dufour effects, with the earlier study by Nazar et al. (2002) [12]. With increasing Soret number, the local Nusselt number is boosted considerably, with the converse response {{with an increase in}} Dufour number. Increasing micropolar vortex viscosity parameter (K) decelerates the flow near the sphere surface but serves to accelerate the flow further from the sphere wall. With increasing K, reverse spin is induced of the <b>micro-elements</b> near the sphere surface. Temperature is strongly boosted throughout the boundary layer regime with increasing K with a similar response computed for the species concentration Buoyancy-assistance (N > 0) accelerates the flow whereas buoyancy-opposition (N < 0) retards flow.

Buoyancy-assistance serves to depress both temperature and concentration values through the boundary layer regime with the reverse effect sustained with buoyancy-opposition.

Incorporation of manure amendment to the soils reduced the availability of trace elements and consequently reduced their uptake by spinach. Zinc contents of sandy loam and silt loam soils declined by 44.9 and 29.3 % with the application manure: leaf litter of 1 : 3 as compared to the manure treatment without leaf litter (1 : 0).
