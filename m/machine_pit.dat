50|$|The company {{introduced}} the highly efficient Corliss valve gear into the United Kingdom from the United States in about 1864 and was closely identified with it thereafter; William Inglis {{being responsible for}} promoting the high speed Corliss engine. About 1881 Hick, Hargreaves received orders for two Corliss engines of 3000 hp, the largest cotton mill engines in the world. Hargreaves and Inglis trip gear was first applied to a large single cylinder 1800 hp Corliss engine at Eagley Mills near Bolton and the company received a Gold Medal for its products at the 1885 International Inventions Exhibition. Mill gearing was a speciality including large flywheels for rope drives, one example of 128 tons being 32 ft in diameter and groved for 56 ropes. Turbines and hydraulic machinery were also manufactured. Many of the tools were to suit the specialist work, with travelling cranes to take 15 to 40 tons in weight, a large lathe, side planer, slotting <b>machine,</b> <b>pit</b> planer and a tool for turning four 32 ft rope flywheels simultaneously. The workshops also featured an 80ton hydraulic riveting machine. For the ease of shipping and transportation, Soho Iron Works had its own railway system, traversed by sidings of the London North Western Railway (LNWR). Inglis, who lived in Bolton was a neighbour of LNWR's chief mechanical engineer, Francis Webb.|$|E

While fighting near Vaux-Andigny, France, on October 15, 1918, Villepigue and two other soldiers were ordered to scout through the village of Vaux-Andigny. During their trek through the village, they were ambushed by German machine gun fire, which killed one of his fellow soldiers, and wounded the other. Advancing forward on his own for more than 500 yards, with his platoon left far behind, Villepigue encountered four enemy soldiers manning the <b>machine</b> gun <b>pit.</b> He engaged them with handgrenade, killing them.

40|$|Abstract. The failure {{assessment}} for the defects in multiple corroded region {{has been considered}} with the real-size pipeline burst tests and the associated Finite Element Method. The corroded gas pipeline made of X 65 steel with various types of artificially <b>machined</b> <b>pits</b> {{has been used for}} a number of series of burst tests on gas pipeline. The failure pressures for the designed multiple corroded defect on gas pipelines have been measured by using in-situ burst testing and classified with respect to each designed defect sizes- length, width and depth- and distance between defects. The result from the experiments has been modeled and compared with Finite Element Method. As the result of FEM simulation, the failure pressure in multiple defects is lower than that in single defect, and closer to failure pressure in single defect of total length of defects in multiple defects as the distance between each defect is closer...|$|R
40|$|The closure {{behavior}} of cracks of different length and at different cyclic strain levels (ranging from predominantly elastic to grossly plastic strains) was studied {{to observe the}} effect of residual crack-tip plasticity on crack closure. Cracks were initiated either naturally or artificially (from electric discharge <b>machining</b> <b>pits)</b> in uniaxial test specimens of strengthened alloy steel AISI 4340 with a grain size of 0. 016 mm. It was found that, at high strains, cracks closed only when the lowest stress level in the cycle was approached. The stress or the strain opening level depended upon the exact point along the crack length where the observations were made. As the plastic deformation increased, the relative crack opening level was found to decrease and approach the value of stress ratio R. The experimental results were {{compared with those of}} three analytical models of crack closure and opening, demonstrating the limitations of the currently available elastic-plastic crack growth analysis...|$|R

Under {{the cover of}} fire laid down by a two-man Bren light machine gun crew, Rambahadur Limbu charged the <b>machine</b> gun <b>pit</b> and again silenced it with a grenade. The three men pressed on, jumping over the destroyed gun. However, one of the Indonesians was still alive and fired a burst as the men passed, hitting the Bren crew, before being killed himself by a grenade.

He carried the first man to shelter in the hut that had been cleared, before going back out to bring back the second. Both soldiers died of their wounds shortly afterward.

3000|$|... 3 direction, {{in which}} the {{machined}} depth becomes much smaller. In contrast, the depth is independent of the scratching direction. Separate pits can be generated with scratching velocities larger than the critical value of 100  μm/s. The total number of fabricated pits can reach nearly 4800 – 5800 in 1  s, when the scratching velocity is a constant value ranging from 200 to 900  μm/s. According to the stress relaxation modulus theory, the polymer surface is in the condition of a glass state when applying a high-frequency load. The energy applied on the sample surface is not large enough to break PMMA molecular chains during one penetration of the AFM tip. To form one pit, 65 to 80 penetrations are required. For the initial stage of penetration, elastic deformation is the dominant material removal mechanism. When the number of penetrations reaches 40 times, the polymer chains start to break and plastic deformation occurs. With increasing penetration depth, {{the height of the}} material accumulated beside the <b>machined</b> <b>pit</b> becomes larger, which will lead to an increase in the tangential force applied on the tip apex. This is the possible reason for the AFM tip sliding over the pile-up, after which one pit is created. Finally, pit arrays with dimensions of 5  μm, spacing distance of 70  nm, and machined depth of 2.5  nm are achieved successfully. FFT images are used to reveal the relationship between the density of pits and the scratching velocity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{remain the}} most widely used of all materials in aerospace industry, contributed over 50 % of the weight of a jet engine. In machining of any jet engine components, it is necessary to satisfy the surface quality or surface integrity requirements to facilitate high reliability components. In the present study, surface integrity of Inconel 718 was studied when drilling under different lubricants. The holes were drilled individually using indexable AlTiN coated carbide drill under minimum quantity of lubricant (MQL) conditions. The results demonstrated that the machining conditions and lubricants strongly influence the surface integrity. The surface roughness decreases with the increase in cutting speed and increases with the increase in feed rate. Microhardness profiles indicated that the subsurface deformation extends up to a 100 and 150 µm for palm oil and synthetic ester, respectively underneath the <b>machined</b> surface. <b>Pit</b> holes, cavities, grooves, microcracks and surface smearing were the dominant surface damages criteria for all cases...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper discuss {{designing}} and operating problems of half-shafts undercarriage systems of open <b>pit</b> <b>machines.</b> Example of failure of such system and investigation of its reasons are presented. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental and numerical methods {{were used to}} investigate reasons of dumping conveyor breakdown. In order to perform material evaluation fractographic and microscopic methods as well as chemical analysis, were used. Based on results of numerical simulations analysis and data coming from material evaluations the objectives are achieved. In order to prevent future similar problems, the new design of the the half-shafts steering frame was discussed as well. Findings: It was found that manufacturing and designing of the half shaft system were the main failure reasons. Such open <b>pit</b> <b>machines</b> undercarriages systems are prone to failures. Detailed analyses are required to implement half – shaft systems without risk of break-down. Recommendation is given in the paper for the single shaft system. Research limitations/implications: Friction in the supporting areas limits horizontal forces acting on safetying of the half-shaft. Sliding and static friction coefficients should be investigated in order to estimate optimal designing rules and correct forces. Practical implications: Practical implications into designing of half-shafts undercarriage systems and safetyings are given. Originality/value: The paper provides information backed by test results and evaluation, stating the nexus of causes of the dumping conveyor break-down. The numerical and experimental approaches present relationship between {{designing and}} manufacturing. The paper can be helpful for researchers and designers investigating reasons, approach methods or failures preventing methods of similar machines...|$|R
