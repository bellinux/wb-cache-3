40|$|AbstractSolar {{thermal energy}} {{is able to}} provide a {{considerable}} fraction of the medium temperature energy demand and should be more widely used in several specific industry sectors in the range between 100 °C and 250 °C. For the energy collection within this temperature range, the solar collector designs usually use optical concentration and its increasing capability for the integration in buildings. In the last decades various new designs have been developed specifically for industrial applications (state-of-the-art in IEA SHC Task 33 /SolarPACES IV on Solar Heat for Industrial Processes). At the end of 2013, the new revision of the International Standard ISO 9806 for testing methods of solar thermal collectors will be published for its certification worldwide. This new Standard will unite all the former existing American, European and International Standards. However, some solar collector types still do not fit the Standard testing methodology, in particular the process heat collectors and the solar collectors with changing geometry. This paper describes the points defined in the future ISO 9806 Standard specifically for the solar collectors with sun-tracking and concentration testing and which of them should still be improved in order to fit all the <b>medium-temperature</b> <b>collector</b> designs. A study has been performed in order to specify the range of incidence angle values throughout which the changing geometry collectors should be tested according to its location and the peak efficiency, {{in the case of}} not testing at normal incidence. Some important notes should be taken into account in future Standard revisions for this particular collector type...|$|E
25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. <b>Medium-temperature</b> <b>collectors</b> are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (377MW), Solar Energy Generating Systems installation (354MW), and Crescent Dunes (110MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, Solnova Solar Power Station (150MW), the Andasol solar power station (150MW), and Extresol Solar Power Station (100MW).|$|R
40|$|Solar {{collectors}} are {{the engines}} that drive all solar energy heating systems. Although solar heating collectors have settled upon {{a few basic}} designs, they are still manufactured {{in an array of}} configurations. Solar collectors are generally classified by the temperatures that can be produced under normal amounts of solar radiation. The collector’s end-use application can be determined by their temperature classification such as Low-temperature <b>collectors,</b> <b>Medium-temperature</b> <b>collectors</b> and High-temperature concentrators that track the sun and produces the highest temperatures. Reflectorsthat are axially symmetrical and shaped like a parabola, has the property of bringing parallel rays of light (such as sunlight) to a pointfocus and so any object that is located at its focus receives highly concentrated sunlight, and therefore becomes very hot. This is the basis for the use of this kind of reflector for high solar energy generation. Energy supply for domestic activities had been a major problem faced by both rural and city dwellers {{for a long time now}} in Africa. It was therefore desirable to design and construct a solar Fresnel reflector and a tracking stand that can be used to generate heat from the sun for cooking, baking and distillation purposes. The reflector and the tracking stand designed and constructed was able to concentrate solar energy within a regional diameter of 10 cm and could be used to raise the temperature of any object placed at its focal region. It was discovered that the heat generated is directly proportional to both the perfection of the collector design, its construction, the quality of the reflectors e. g plain mirror, the area exposed to the sun and the solar intensity of the day...|$|R
