40|$|Abstract: Rural {{women in}} Bangladesh {{have a lower}} status than men and are {{economically}} dependent on their husbands as well as socially discriminated. Rural women have very limited access to income generating activities and consequently less opportunity {{to contribute to the}} betterment of their families due to a number of social, cultural and religious barriers which push them into a vulnerable situation. In addition, they are also vulnerable to natural disasters and calamities over which they have little or no control. In this circumstance, microcredit programme contributes significantly to reduce vulnerability of the poor rural women who are more vulnerable in Bangladesh. In the present study, it has been attempted to assess the role of microcredit programme in reducing vulnerability of rural women. The study is based on empirical data collected through interviewing two groups of rural women e. g. ‘with credit ’ and ‘without credit ’ rural women. The ‘with credit’ respondents were the members of the Grammeen Bank’s microcredit programme. The findings of the study show that the <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> of the ‘with credit ’ respondents is US$ 27. 6) which is three times higher than that of the ‘without credit ’ respondents (US$ 7. 9). The increased income of the borrower women contributes significantly to improve the income level of their households which help them reduce vulnerability more effectively than the non-borrower families. It is also found that small proportions (10 percent) of the ‘with credit’ women are highly vulnerable, as compared to ‘without credit ’ women (22 percent). Therefore, it can be concluded that microcredit programme plays a significant role in reducing vulnerability among the rural poor families in Bangladesh.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the diet quality in Korean middle-aged women based on their self-rated health status (SRH) as well as to investigate the relationship between SRH and the diet quality. For the study, we obtained data for analysis from the combined 2008 ～ 2009 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). The study subjects were divided into two groups－‘Good ’ group (≥ 3. 06, n= 622) and ‘Bad ’ group (< 3. 06, n= 1, 092) － on the basis of the average SRH value (3. 06). The women in the ‘Good ’ group had achieved a higher education level and had a significantly high <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> (P< 0. 05), whereas women in the ‘Bad ’ group had a larger waist circumference (P< 0. 05). In addition, women in the ‘Good ’ group engaged in more physical activities (P< 0. 01). In comparison with the women in ‘Bad ’ group, women in the ‘Good ’ group were found to have a superior nutritional status, with a nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR) of protein (P< 0. 05), calcium (P< 0. 05), iron (P< 0. 05), vitamin A (P< 0. 05), vitamin B 2 (P< 0. 05), and niacin (P< 0. 01). The mean adequacy ratio (MAR) of women in the ‘Good ’ group was also significantly higher than that of the women in the ‘Bad ’ group.

For this study, the general characteristics of the senior citizen centers and users were analyzed. In this study, a survey with 298 senior citizen center users was conducted. The general characteristics such as the names and locations of senior citizen centers, the number of members, the opening periods and building areas, the general characteristics of the users, the reasons for use, the total years of use, the hours of use, the programs and the time required for coming to the senior citizen centers were investigated. The study findings are as follows. First, 75 % of all the users were females and they were 3 times more than males. The average age of the users was 82 years old and those in their eighties occupied half the users. People who used these centers, were healthy enough to do their jobs by themselves and those who only finished elementary education or below and secondary education, used these centers together. The <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> of the users was less than 200, 000 won to more than 500, 000 won. Second, meeting friends was the biggest reason for using the senior citizen centers and it was followed by eating meals. Female members used lunch that was provided free by the facilities and male members came to the facilities in the afternoon after eating lunch at home, since it was hard for them to receive this benefit. These study results can be used as basic data to compare the regional differences of senior citizen centers and the difference between national and public facilities and private facilities and between users. Furthermore, an advance study will be carried out to suggest development and support plans of senior citizen centers in Korea that are becoming more important, with the aging of population...|$|E

A Síntese de Indicadores Sociais 2002, lançada pelo IBGE, refere que o traço mais marcante da sociedade brasileira é a desigualdade. O propósito do estudo é testar a associação entre as taxas de homicídios e alguns indicadores de saúde e socioeconômicos. MÉTODOS: Estudo ecológico, de corte transversal. Foram analisados dados do Município de São Paulo, ano 2000, quanto a coeficientes de homicídios e cinco indicadores: taxa de mortalidade infantil, renda média do chefe de família, percentual de adolescentes de 15 a 17 anos que não freqüentavam a escola, percentual de adolescentes grávidas de 14 a 17 anos e densidade demográfica. Para testar essas associações foram utilizados o coeficiente de correlação de Pearson e a regressão linear múltipla. RESULTADOS: O coeficiente de homicídios foi 57, 3 / 100. 000. A correlação entre taxas de homicídios e renda média foi negativa e forte (r=- 0, 65). Maiores coeficientes foram encontrados nos distritos com menor renda e menores naqueles com maiores rendas. Para o percentual de adolescentes que não freqüentavam a escola (r= 0, 68) e para o percentual de adolescentes grávidas (r= 0, 67) a associação encontrada foi positiva e forte. Para a taxa de mortalidade infantil a correlação encontrada foi r= 0, 24 (para todos p OBJECTIVE: The {{relation}} between income and mortality due to violence {{has been studied}} in recent years. The Synthesis of Social Indicators of 2002 [Síntese de Indicadores Sociais, 2002], published by The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), states {{that one of the}} most outstanding characteristic of Brazilian society is inequality. The proposal of this ecological study was to test the association between homicide rates, and some health and socioeconomic indicators. METHODS: This is an ecological cross-sectional study. Data regarding Sao Paulo City, Brazil in the year 2000 was analyzed. The association between homicide coefficients and the following five indicators were tested: infant mortality rates, <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> of household heads, percentage of adolescents aged 15 to 17 years not attending school, proportion of pregnant adolescent women aged 14 to 17 years and demographic density. Pearson's correlation coefficient and a multiple linear regression model were utilized to test these associations. RESULTS: The municipal homicide rate was 57. 3 / 100, 000. The cor{{relation between}} homicide rates and average monthly income was strong and negative (r=- 0. 65). Higher homicide rates were found in the districts whose inhabitants had lower incomes and lower rates were found in those districts whose inhabitants had higher incomes. The correlation between homicide rates and proportion of adolescents not attending school was positive and strong (r= 0. 68). The correlation between homicide rates and the proportion of pregnant adolescent women was positive and strong (r= 0. 67). The correlation between homicides and the rate of infant mortality was r= 0. 24 (for all: p< 0. 05). The correlation between demographic density and homicides was not significant. Although the univariate regression was positive for four indicators, the multivariate regression test was only significant for average monthly income (negative) and proportion of adolescents not attending school (positive) (for both indicators: p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the problem of homicides and socioeconomic disparities in S. Paulo City.

According to the women interviewed, a greater percentage of income generated monthly, concentrated around ₦ 10, 000 and ₦ 20, 000, that is, <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income.</b> About 10.6 % of the total respondents earned less than ₦ 5000 <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income,</b> while 17 % earned between ₦ 5000 - ₦ 10, 000 and less than one tenth of the respondents earned above ₦ 20, 000 <b>monthly.</b> The mean <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> was about ₦ 7500.
