5000|$|Oklahoma 29, Ohio State 28. Ohio State (ranked No. 4 in the AP Poll) lost to Oklahoma (ranked No. 3), 29-28, {{before a}} crowd of 88,119 at Ohio Stadium (the third largest in stadium history to that point) in Columbus, Ohio. Oklahoma took a 20-0 lead {{early in the second}} quarter, but Ohio State then scored 28 {{unanswered}} points and led, 28-20, with six-and-a-half minutes left in the game. At that point, Ohio State backup quarterback Greg Castignola fumbled, and Oklahoma took over on Ohio State's 43-yard line. On the ensuing drive, Ohio State stopped Oklahoma on a fourth down play with four yards to go at the Buckeyes' 12-yard line, but an offside penalty resulted in a first down at the seven-yard line. Oklahoma scored a touchdown, but a run for two-point conversion to tie the game was stopped at the two-yard line by a swarming Ohio State defense. With only a minute-and-a-half remaining in the game, Ohio State players celebrated on the field, with a couple rolling playfully onto the AstroTurf. Oklahoma's onside kick bounced off an Ohio State player and was recovered for the Sooners by <b>Mike</b> Babb. Uwe <b>von</b> Schamann, a former soccer player from West Berlin, practiced transcendental meditation, smiled, and calmly participated in an Ohio State cheer as Woody Hayes called timeout in an attempt to ice the kicker. Von Schamman then kicked a 41-yard, game-winning field goal as the game's final three seconds ticked off the clock.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a puzzle: dictatorships that practice torture {{are more likely}} to accede to the UN Convention Against Torture (CAT) than dictatorships that do not practice torture. I argue the reason {{has to do with the}} logic of torture. Torture is more likely to occur where power is shared. In one-party or no-party dictatorships, few individuals defect against the regime. Consequently, less torture occurs. But dictatorships are protorture regimes; they have little interest in making gestures against torture, such as signing the CAT. There is more torture where power is shared, such as where dictatorships allow multiple political parties. Alternative political points of view are endorsed, but some individuals go too far. More acts of defection against the regime occur, and torture rates are higher. Because political parties exert some power, however, they pressure the regime to make concessions. One small concession is acceding to the CAT.
