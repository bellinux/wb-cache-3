5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. <b>Moral</b> <b>judgment</b> may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

He then challenged Kant's claim that animals have no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a <b>moral</b> <b>judgment.</b> Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a <b>moral</b> <b>judgment,</b> then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that animals have a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E

But human beings are also creatures of emotion and these emotions can intentionally or unintentionally have an effect on our judgment. This study examines the effect of a particular emotion ??? disgust ??? on <b>moral</b> <b>judgments.</b> One hundred and twenty undergraduate students from California State University, Fresno participated in the study. Participants in the experiment were assigned to one of three conditions randomly: neutral, core disgust, or sociomoral disgust. The first research question investigated in the current study was whether eliciting disgust leads to harsher <b>moral</b> <b>judgments.</b> It was hypothesized that eliciting disgust will lead to harsher <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> due to assimilation, less harsh <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> due to contrast effects, or no effect due to attribution effects. Eliciting disgust failed to make any kind of impact on <b>moral</b> <b>judgments.</b> The second research question was whether core disgust and sociomoral disgust affect <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> in different ways.

40|$|Can adults make fair <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> when {{individuals}} {{with whom they}} have different relationships are involved? The present study explored the fairness of adults’ relationship-based <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> in two respects by performing three experiments involving 999 participants. In Experiment 1, 65 adults were asked {{to decide whether to}} harm a specific person to save five strangers in the footbridge and trolley dilemmas in a within-subject design. The lone potential victim was a relative, a best friend, a person they disliked, a criminal or a stranger. Adults’ genetic relatedness to, familiarity with and affective relatedness to the lone potential victims varied. The results indicated that adults made different <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> involving the lone potential victims with whom they had different relationships. In Experiment 2, 306 adults responded to the footbridge and trolley dilemmas involving five types of lone potential victims in a within-subject design, {{and the extent to which}} they were familiar with and affectively related to the lone potential victim was measured. The results generally replicated those of Experiment 1. In addition, for close individuals, adults’ <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> were less deontological relative to their familiarity with or positive affect toward these individuals. For individuals they were not close to, adults made deontological choices to a larger extent relative to their unfamiliarity with or negative affect toward these individuals. Moreover, for familiar individuals, the extent to which adults made deontological <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> more closely approximated the extent to which they were familiar with the individual. The adults’ deontological <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> involving unfamiliar individuals more closely approximated their affective relatedness to the individuals. In Experiment 3, 628 adults were asked to make <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> with the type of lone potential victim as the between-subject variable. The results generally replicated those of the previous two experiments. Therefore, the present study shows that, in addition to apparent unfairness, latent fairness exists in adults’ relationship-based <b>moral</b> <b>judgments.</b> <b>Moral</b> <b>judgments</b> involving individuals with whom adults have different relationships have different cognitive and affective bases...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{selection}} {{seems to}} offer a compelling case {{for the development of}} evaluative judgments independent of evaluative facts. If such a case can be made, then how do <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> correlate to <b>moral</b> facts? It seems {{that there would be no}} tight connection from judgments to truth and <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> would be unwarranted. Gilbert Harman realized the implications of a probable non-moral genealogy. Richard Joyce goes on to provide a probable non-moral genealogy that would epistemically undermine <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> as Harman thought. Joyce argues that in a naturalistic world natural selection can account for <b>moral</b> <b>judgments,</b> but that the truth of those judgments play no explanatory role and seem to be superfluous. If there are such moral facts to be known does man need a moral faculty that J. L. Mackie says is 2 ̆ 2 queer 2 ̆ 2 to have arisen in a purely naturalistic world? To posit such a faculty and the off chance that <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> happen to correlate to moral facts in a naturalistic world would seem to be the result of either a miracle or a brute fact. Both the former hypotheses seem to lack persuasiveness and plausibility, but is there a better explanation? Is there a better explanation to vindicate <b>moral</b> <b>judgments?</b> This paper explores the possible vindication of <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> through the idea that it seems moral facts are conducive to survival and replication: just as the mind is able to arrive at normative claims about mathematics so too with morality. So, one does not need an additional faculty but that a moral faculty is already equipped in the mind. It is this idea that seems to be the avenue to pursue a vindication of <b>moral</b> <b>judgments...</b>|$|R

25|$|According to Robert Zydendos, karma in Jainism can be {{considered}} a kind of system of laws, but natural rather than moral laws. In Jainism, actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in just the same way as, for instance, physical actions that do not carry any special moral significance. When one holds an apple in one's hand and then let go of the apple, the apple will fall: this is only natural. There is no judge, and no <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is {{characterized}} by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on <b>moral</b> <b>judgment,</b> but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this social and {{political}} change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established.

Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition.

This proved a useful instrument to Vespasian in his establishment of the Flavian Imperial Dynasty following the death of Nero and civil war, and to Septimius in his consolidation of the Severan dynasty after the assassination of Commodus. In the development of Imperial rule from Principate to Dominate, the role of the Senate was increasingly marginalised and military loyalty became the key to Imperial authority.|$|E
25|$|Having {{come to her}} {{literary}} maturity at a {{time when}} the ubiquitous and unvarying stated defence of the novel was its educative power, Maria Edgeworth was among the few authors who truly espoused the educator's role. Her novels are morally and socially didactic in the extreme. A close analysis of the alterations which Edgeworth's style underwent when it was pressed into the service of overt didacticism should serve to illuminate the relationship between prose technique and didactic purpose in her work. The convention which Maria Edgeworth has adopted and worked to death is basic to the eighteenth-century novel, but its roots lie in the drama, tracing at least to the Renaissance separation of high and low characters by their forms of speech. Throughout the eighteenth-century drama, and most noticeably in the sentimental comedy, the separation becomes more and more a means of <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> as well as social identification. The only coherent reason for Edgeworth's acceptance is the appeal of didactic moralism. In the first place, she is willing to suspend judgment wherever the service of the moral is the result. Everything else may go, so long as the lesson is enforced. the lesson might be a warning against moral impropriety, as in Miss Milner's story, or against social injustice, as in The Absentee. Furthermore, the whole reliance on positive exemplars had been justified long before by Steele, who argued that the stage must supply perfect heroes since its examples are imitated and since simple natures are incapable of making the necessary deductions from the negative exemplars of satire.|$|E

40|$|Heightened {{awareness}} of the evolutionary, socio-cultural, and psychological origins of our <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> pushes {{many of us in}} the direction of moral skepticism, in the direction of doubting the objective truth of our <b>moral</b> <b>judgments.</b> But should {{awareness of}} the origins of our <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> shake our confidence in them? Are there good moral debunking challenges or debunking arguments from premises concerning the accessible origins of our <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> to skeptical conclusions regarding them? In vigorous pursuit of these questions, this dissertation sifts three promising moral debunking challenges to moral realism, namely Richard Joyce's (2001) evolutionary debunking argument from epistemic insensitivity, Sharon Street's (2006) "Darwinian Dilemma," and David Enoch's (2010) "Epistemological Challenge. " It is argued that each challenge faces cogent objections that not only demonstrate the inadequacy of the best debunking challenges available but also instructively guide us to the development of new and more forceful debunking challenges to moral realism. This dissertation develops two new and forceful debunking challenges, both of which target the epistemic reliability and justification of our <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> on realist views of the moral facts. The first new debunking challenge starts from the premise that the best explanation of our <b>moral</b> <b>judgments</b> does not appeal to their truth and invokes a new species of epistemic insensitivity to secure the conclusion that our moral belief-forming processes are epistemically unreliable.

500|$|According to Indologist Robert J.

When one holds an apple and then lets it go, the apple will fall. There is no judge, and no <b>moral</b> <b>judgment</b> involved, since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action. In the same manner, consequences occur naturally when one utters a lie, steals something, commits senseless violence or leads a life of debauchery. Rather than assume that these consequences—the moral rewards and retributions—are a work of some divine judge, Jains believe that there is an innate moral order in the cosmos, self-regulating through the workings of the law of karma. Morality and ethics are important in Jainism not because of a God, but because a life led in agreement with moral and ethical principles (mahavrata) is considered beneficial: it leads to a decrease—and finally to the total loss of—karma, which in turn leads to everlasting happiness. The Jain conception of karma takes away the responsibility for salvation from God and bestows it on man himself. In the words of the Jain scholar, J. L. Jaini: ...|$|E
