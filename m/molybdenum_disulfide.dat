It forms strong films on metallic surfaces and is a common additive to HPHT greases — {{in the event of a}} catastrophic grease failure, a thin layer of molybdenum prevents contact of the lubricated parts. It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E

Molybdenum has several oxidation states, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left). The chemistry and the compounds show more similarity to tungsten than to chromium; the instability of molybdenum(III) and tungsten(III) compounds, for example, contrasts with {{the stability of the}} chromium(III) compounds.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{synthesis of}} atomically thin <b>molybdenum</b> <b>disulfides</b> (MoS 2) {{of high quality}} and uniformity over a large area is essential for their use in electronic and optical devices. In this work, we synthesize MoS 2 that exhibit a high quality and large area uniformity using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with volatile S organic compound and NaCl catalysts. In the latter process, the NaCl enhances the growth rate (5 min for synthesis of monolayer MoS 2) and purity of the synthesized MoS 2. The optical microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and transmission electron microscopy measurements indicate that the NaCl-CVD MoS 2 has a large grain size, clear Raman shift, strong photoluminescence, good stoichiometry, and 6 -fold coordination symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that the electron mobility (10. 4 cm 2 V&# 8722; 1 s&# 8722; 1) and on/off current ratio (3 × 107) of monolayer MoS 2 measured using a field-effect transistor are {{comparable to those of}} previously reported MoS 2 synthesized using CVD...|$|R

30|$|Inorganic {{transition}} metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, such as tungsten and <b>molybdenum</b> <b>disulfides</b> (WS 2 and MoS 2, respectively) are of significant {{interest to the}} scientific community because of their unique multi-layered structures and functional properties, with nano-sized fullerene-like (IF) particles tending to exhibit {{a different set of}} properties compared to the corresponding bulk forms. These metal dichalcogenide nanomaterials have {{emerged as one of the}} most promising classes of nanomaterials since the discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [1 – 8]. As with early researches in the field of CNTs, a wide number of potential applications have been proposed and investigated including areas such as energy storage [9], field effect transistors [10], nanocomposite coatings [11, 12], battery anodes [13], light-emitting diodes [14], self-lubricating medical devices [15], and high-performance nanoscale lubricants [16 – 23]. In addition, the outstanding shock absorbing ability of IFs-WS 2 nanotubes holds a great potential for new impact and shock-resistant materials [24 – 26]. Composite hybrid materials formed by incorporating small amounts (less than 5 % weight ratios) of such nano-sized inorganic fillers into any given polymer matrix are also of particular interest, showing improved mechanical properties, higher thermal properties, and improved performances as barriers to heat, moisture, and solvents [27 – 29] when compared to similar composites prepared with conventional fillers [28, 30]. Indeed, considerable research work has been conducted dealing with polymer-based nanocomposites that incorporate inorganic IFs-WS 2 NPs into matrices of epoxy [30], polystyrene/poly(methylmethacrylate) [28], poly(propylene fumarate) [29], nylon 12 [31], and poly(phenylene) sulphide [32]. Due to the superior mechanical properties of corresponding inorganic IFs-WS 2 NPs, such as high stiffness and strength [33], ultrahigh-performance polymer nanocomposites have been readily produced [34]. In addition, commercial performant lubricants are now presently available that include same inorganic IFs-WS 2 NPs that impart unique tribological properties [35] to the corresponding final composite products. Although there are many potential applications in a wide variety of fields for such inorganic metal dichalcogenide IFs-WS 2 NPs and inorganic INTs-WS 2 nanotubes (INTs), novel developmental research has been strongly hampered analogously to early CNTs-based research. Indeed, these dichalcogenide nanomaterials are highly hydrophobic, thus quite insoluble in common organic/aqueous solvents, difficult to homogeneously disperse into most liquids and resins, while disclosing serious limited dual phase compatibility when admixed with common polymers.|$|R

Can other atomically flat crystals be used as substrates for making quality graphene heterostructures? Here we report on our search for alternative substrates. The devices fabricated by encapsulating graphene with <b>molybdenum</b> or tungsten <b>disulfides</b> and hBN are found to exhibit consistently high carrier mobilities of about 60 [*] 000 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1). In contrast, encapsulation with atomically flat layered oxides such as mica, bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, and vanadium pentoxide results in exceptionally low quality of graphene devices with mobilities of ∼ 1000 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1). We attribute the difference mainly to self-cleansing that takes place at interfaces between graphene, hBN, and transition metal dichalcogenides.

40|$|Monolayers of {{transition}} metal dichalcogenides, namely, <b>molybdenum</b> and tungsten <b>disulfides</b> and diselenides demonstrate unusual optical properties {{related to the}} spin-valley locking effect. Particularly, excitation of monolayers by circularly polarized light selectively creates electron-hole pairs or excitons in non-equivalent valleys in momentum space, depending on the light helicity. This allows studying the inter-valley dynamics of charge carriers and Coulomb complexes by means of optical spectroscopy. Here we present a concise review of the neutral exciton fine structure and its spin and valley dynamics in monolayers {{of transition}} metal dichalcogenides. It is demonstrated that the long-range exchange interaction between an electron and {{a hole in the}} exciton is an efficient mechanism for rapid mixing between bright excitons made of electron-hole pairs in different valleys. We discuss the physical origin of the long-range exchange interaction and outline its derivation in both the electrodynamical and k · p approaches.

Hydrodesulfurization is {{a process}} whereby sulfur bound in organic {{compounds}} is removed as hydrogen sulfide, and {{is important to the}} control of sulfur dioxide emissions in the combustion of petro- leum and coal fuels.

In an effort to clarify it, the kinetics of methanethiol hydro- desulfurization over tungsten disulfide at low pressures was established, with partial pressures of methanethiol and hydrogen varied over a hundred fold. The kinetic order in each reactant was positive when its partial pressure was low, negative when its partial pressure was high. The negative order in hydrogen had not been previously seen. The product gases, methane and hydrogen sulfide, each exhibited negative kinetic orders at high partial pressures, zero kinetic orders at low partial pressures.
