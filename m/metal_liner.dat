40|$|Pit defects due to {{corrosion}} {{may occur}} in the inner surfaces of <b>metal</b> <b>liners</b> of fiber wrapped composite cylinders during working process, which may affect their anti-fatigue performance. Finite element method was {{used to analyze the}} stress of hoop-wrapped composite cylinders with pit defects of different sizes based on element birth and death method to take the pre-stress resulted from autofrettage process into consideration. Numeral results show that stress concentration appears in the pit defects, but the portion of the liner far away from pit defects keeps the same stress level with the defect-free composite cylinder. Pit defects on liner reduce the fatigue performance of the composite cylinder. Goodman equation was utilized to calculate the equivalent alternating stress amplitude to evaluate the variation of the fatigue performance with the dimensional change of the pit defects in the inner surfaces of <b>metal</b> <b>liners</b> of hoop-wrapped composite cylinders...|$|R

Differences were observed in comparing the uniaxial and tank test results. These differences should be resolved if an adequate fracture control method is to be developed...|$|R
50|$|Explosively formed penetrator: Instead {{of turning}} a thin <b>metal</b> <b>liner</b> into a focused jet, the {{detonation}} wave is directed against a concave metal plate {{at the front}} of the warhead, propelling it at high velocity while simultaneously deforming it into a projectile.|$|E

40|$|Two {{innovative}} fan-noise reduction concepts {{developed by}} NASA are presented - soft vanes and over-the-rotor <b>metal</b> foam <b>liners.</b> Design methodologies are described for each concept. Soft vanes are outlet guide vanes with internal, resonant chambers that {{communicate with the}} exterior aeroacoustic environment via a porous surface. They provide acoustic absorption via viscous losses generated by interaction of unsteady flows with the internal solid structure. Over-the-rotor <b>metal</b> foam <b>liners</b> installed {{at or near the}} fan rotor axial plane provide rotor noise absorption. Both concepts also provide pressure-release surfaces that potentially inhibit noise generation. Several configurations for both concepts are evaluated with a normal incidence tube, and the results are used to guide designs for implementation in two NASA fan rigs. For soft vanes, approximately 1 to 2 dB of broadband inlet and aft-radiated fan noise reduction is achieved. For over-the-rotor <b>metal</b> foam <b>liners,</b> up to 3 dB of fan noise reduction is measured in the low-speed fan rig, but minimal reduction is measured in the high-speed fan rig. These <b>metal</b> foam <b>liner</b> results are compared with a static engine test, in which inlet sound power level reductions up to 5 dB were measured. Brief plans for further development are also provided...|$|R
50|$|The {{charges are}} {{generally}} cylindrical, fabricated from commonly available metal pipe, with the forward end closed by a concave copper or steel disk-shaped liner {{to create a}} shaped charge. Explosive is loaded behind the <b>metal</b> <b>liner</b> to fill the pipe. Upon detonation, the explosive projects the liner to form a projectile.|$|E
50|$|When triggered, {{the mine}} detonates a small {{clearing}} charge, which clears away any earth laid {{on top of}} the mine. It then fires the main warhead, which uses a <b>metal</b> <b>liner</b> to form a penetrating fragment which is projected into the belly of the vehicle passing over the mine. The self-forging fragment is capable of penetrating steel up to 200 millimeters thick.|$|E
50|$|Some {{pressure}} vessels {{are made of}} composite materials, such as filament wound composite using carbon fibre held in place with a polymer. Due to the very high tensile strength of carbon fibre these vessels can be very light, but are {{much more difficult to}} manufacture. The composite material may be wound around a <b>metal</b> <b>liner,</b> forming a composite overwrapped pressure vessel.|$|E
50|$|On the {{exterior}} {{there is often}} a corbeled brick crown, in which the projecting courses of brick act as a drip course to keep rainwater from running down {{the exterior}} walls. A cap, hood, or shroud serves to keep rainwater out of the exterior of the chimney; rain in the chimney is a much greater problem in chimneys lined with impervious flue tiles or <b>metal</b> <b>liners</b> than with the traditional masonry chimney, which soaks up all but the most violent rain. Some chimneys have a spark arrestor incorporated into the crown or cap.|$|R

The internal support of these liners required during the filament winding process has previously been provided by dissolvable salt mandrels. An internal pressurization technique has been developed which allows overwinding the liner without other means of support and without collapse.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the wall {{material}} on hydrogen ion species productions in a low-pressure plasma, especially H^- ions, is studied experimentally by using a multicusp ion source. Under the same discharge conditions, Al generally produces the highest H^- ion current although the difference in H^- yield between Al, Cu and stainless-steel liners depends on the source pressure of hydrogen gas. At the same time, there is little difference in the plasma parameters for the three different <b>metal</b> <b>liners.</b> The present results suggest that neutral particles (i. e. atomic hydrogen (H) and vibrationally excited molecules (H^*_ 2)) -wall interaction affects those differences in H^- production...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} uses of shaped charges was by German glider-borne troops against the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael.

50|$|MagLIF is {{a method}} of {{generating}} energy by using a 100 nanosecond pulse of electricity to create an intense Z-pinch magnetic field that inwardly crushes a fuel filled cylindrical <b>metal</b> <b>liner</b> (a hohlraum) through which the electric pulse runs. Just before the cylinder implodes, a laser is used to preheat fusion fuel (such as deuterium-tritium) that is held within the cylinder and contained by a magnetic field.

50|$|A high-explosive {{anti-tank}} (HEAT) warhead {{is a type}} of shaped charge explosive that uses the Munroe effect to penetrate armor. The warhead functions by having the explosive charge melt a <b>metal</b> <b>liner</b> to form a high-velocity superplastic jet. This concentrated metal jet is capable of penetrating armor steel to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD). Contrary to a widespread misconception (possibly resulting from the acronym HEAT), the jet does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely kinetic in nature. The HEAT warhead has become less effective against tanks and other armored vehicles due to the use of composite armour and explosive-reactive armor.|$|E

25|$|To combat {{loosening}} {{caused by}} polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel {{materials for the}} acetabular liners. Ceramic heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. <b>Metal</b> <b>liners</b> to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE {{was introduced in the}} late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.|$|R
25|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>liners</b> may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double wall stainless steel pipe or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated double wall pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. Condensing boilers do not need a chimney.|$|R
