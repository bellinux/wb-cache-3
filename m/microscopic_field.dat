40|$|Background and Objectives: In Iran, {{anaplasmosis}} {{is normally}} diagnosed with traditional Giemsa staining method. This is not applicable for {{identification of the}} carrier animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the detection of Anaplasma marginale in two different numbers of <b>microscopic</b> <b>fields</b> (50 and 100) using conventional Giemsa staining method compared with the PCR-RFLP technique. "nMaterials and Methods: In this study, examinations were performed on 150 blood samples from cattle without clinical signs. Sensitivity and specificity of two <b>microscopic</b> <b>fields</b> (50 and 100 fields) were compared with A. marginale specific PCR-RFLP. The degree of agreement between PCR-RFLP and the two microscopic tests was determined by Kappa (κ) values with 95 % confidence intervals. "nResults: PCR-RFLP showed that 58 samples were A. marginale, while routine microscopy showed erythrocytes harboring Anaplasma like structures in 16 and 75 blood samples determined in 50 and 100 <b>microscopic</b> <b>fields</b> respectively. Examination of 50 and 100 <b>microscopic</b> <b>fields</b> showed 25. 8 % and 91. 4 % sensitivity and 99 % and 76. 1 % specificity compared to 100 % sensitivity and specificity by PCR-RFLP. The Kappa coefficient between PCR-RFLP and Microscopy (50 fields) indicated a fair level of agreement (0. 29). The Kappa coefficient between PCR-RFLP and Microscopy (100 fields) indicated a good level of agreement (0. 64) "nConclusion: Our results showed that the microscopic examination remains the convenient technique for day-to-day diagnosis of clinical cases in the laboratory but for the detection of carrier animal with low bacteremia, microscopy with 100 fields is preferable to Microscopy with 50 fields and molecular methods such as PCR-RFLP can be used as a safe method for identifying cattle persistently infected with A. marginale...|$|R

40|$|Tongue {{cancer has}} a poor {{prognosis}} {{due to its}} early metastasis via lymphatic vessels. The present study aimed at evaluating lymphatic vessel density, relative density of lymphatic vessel, and diameter of lymphatic vessels and its predictive role in tongue cancer. Paraffin-embedded tongue and lymph node specimens (n = 113) were stained immunohistochemically with a polyclonal antibody von Willebrand factor, recognizing blood and lymphatic endothelium and with a monoclonal antibody podoplanin, recognizing lymphatic endothelium. The relative density of lymphatic vessels was counted by dividing {{the mean number of}} lymphatic vessels per <b>microscopic</b> <b>field</b> (podoplanin) by the mean number of all vessels (vWf) per <b>microscopic</b> <b>field.</b> The high relative density of lymphatic vessels (aeyen 80 %) was associated with poor prognosis in tongue cancer. The relative density of lymphatic vessels predicted poor prognosis in the group of primary tumor size T 1 -T 2 and in the group of non-metastatic cancer. The lymphatic vessel density and diameter of lymphatic vessels were not associated with tongue cancer survival.

40|$|The {{counting}} of poorly differentiated {{clusters of}} 5 or more cancer cells lacking a gland-like structure in a tumor mass {{has recently been}} identified among the histological features predictive of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. Poorly differentiated clusters can easily be recognized in the histological sections of colorectal cancer routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin.

Based {{on the number of}} poorly differentiated clusters that appear under a <b>microscopic</b> <b>field</b> of a × 20 objective lens (i. e., a <b>microscopic</b> <b>field</b> with a major axis of 1  mm), colorectal cancer can be graded into malignancies as follows: tumors with < 5 clusters as grade 1, tumors with 5 to 9 clusters as grade 2, and tumors with ≥ 10 clusters as grade 3. High poorly differentiated cluster counts are significantly associated with peri-neural and lympho-vascular invasion, the presence of nodal metastases or micrometastases, as well as shorter overall and progression free survival to colorectal cancer. The morphological aspects and clinical relevance of poorly differentiated clusters counting in colorectal cancer are discussed in this review...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we argue}} that <b>microscopic</b> <b>field</b> theories, which as such are already scientifically established, have emerged as a new {{paradigm}} in materials physics. We hence seek to elaborate on such field theories which underlie modern ab initio calculations, and we apply them to the bismuth tellurohalides (BiTeX with X = I, Br, Cl) as a prototypical class of spin-based materials. For this purpose, we begin by constructing tight-binding models which approximately describe the spin-split conduction bands of BiTeI. Following this, we derive the theory of temperature Green functions systematically from their fundamental equations of motion. This in turn enables us to develop a combined functional renormalization and mean-field approach which is suitable for application to multiband models. For the Rashba model including an attractive, local interaction, this approach yields an unconventional superconducting phase with a singlet gap function and a mixed singlet-triplet order parameter. We further investigate the unusual electromagnetic response of BiTeI, which {{is caused by the}} Rashba spin splitting and which includes, in particular, an orbital paramagnetism. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the Functional Approach to electrodynamics of media as a <b>microscopic</b> <b>field</b> theory of electromagnetic material properties which sits in accordance with ab initio physics...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Eosinophilic {{esophagitis}} is {{a chronic}} immunogenic-antigen mediated {{disease of the}} esophagus, characterized by symptoms related to esophagus dysfunction, histologically defined by over 15 eosinophil counts seen in high-power <b>microscopic</b> <b>field,</b> without gastroesophageal reflux disease. In adults, the most common clinical manifestations are dysphagia, reflux, chest pain, regurgitation and bolus impaction. Case report. We presented {{the case of a}} female patient, hospitalized for a serious form of pancreatitis with complications, which required artificial ventilation and enteral feeding, after the initial esophagoscopy verified reflux esophagitis. Further treatment cured the primary illness, and peroral feeding was reintroduced. However, dysphagia with regurgitation occurred, and endoscopic and radiological tests verified esophagus stenosis, which histopathologically corresponded to erosive esophagitis. Two months of treatment by a double dosage of proton pump inhibitors led to no regression of disorders, and the repeated biopsies from the stenotic segments resulted in over 30 eosinophil counts in the high-power <b>microscopic</b> <b>field,</b> which histologically corresponds to eosinophilic esophagitis. Subsequent therapy included fluticasone 880 μg/day orally for a period of eight weeks, which led to complete regression of disorders, and endoscopic and histopathologic remission. Conclusion. In case of irresponsiveness to the conventional therapy by proton pump inhibitors, repeated esophagoscopy and histopathological analyses of esophagus mucosa biopsy can point to the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, and a good therapeutic response to topical corticosteroids can be regarded as the clinical confirmation of the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sixteen choroid plexus (CP) {{tumors in}} 12 male and four female adult dogs were {{analyzed}} micro-scopically. Tumors {{were in the}} lateral (six), third (six), and fourth (four) ventricles. The {{average age of the}} dogs was 6 years. Tumors were classified by the following criteria: 1) choroidplexuspapilloma (CPP), which resembled normal choroid plexus and had low mitotic activity; 2) choroidplexus papilloma with atypical features (atypical CPP), which had increased cellular density, nuclear atypia, two to four mitoses per 40 x <b>microscopic</b> <b>field,</b> necrosis, and infiltration of the brain parenchyma and/or leptomeninges; and 3) choroidplexus carcinoma (CPC), which had marked nuclear atypia, poorly formed papillae,>four mitoses per 40 x <b>microscopic</b> <b>field,</b> abnormal mitotic figures, and/or extraneural metastasis. The 16 tumors were classified either as CPP or atypical CPP (none as CPC). Statistically significant associations between brain infiltration and necrosis and atypical CPP were identified. Immunohistochemical studies in 1 1 tumors demonstrated staining for keratin in three tumors, two of which also reacted with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). There was no immunoreactivity with glial fibrillary acidic protein or epithelial membrane antigen. Choroid plexus from one of three control dogs stained focally for cytokeratin only.
