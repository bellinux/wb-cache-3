5|$|Ireland {{consists}} of a mostly flat low-lying area in the midlands, ringed by <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> such as (beginning in County Kerry and working counter-clockwise) the Macgillycuddy's Reeks, Comeragh Mountains, Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, the Mournes, Glens of Antrim, Sperrin Mountains, Bluestack Mountains, Derryveagh Mountains, Ox Mountains, Nephinbeg Mountains and the Twelve Bens/Maumturks group.

5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges,</b> notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{territory}} is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed {{and the growth of}} a limited flora.

The waters off the coast are called the King Haakon VII Sea.|$|E
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or high <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges,</b> {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E

The cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains were undisturbed for approximately 300 million years, and the ample moisture and deep soils of cove topography allowed for the proliferation of temperate broadleaf and mixed forest species.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel <b>mountain</b> <b>ranges</b> alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E
