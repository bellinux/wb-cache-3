Genetic studies discovered that much of what had been grown as Merlot was actually Carménère, an old French variety that had gone largely extinct in France due to its poor resistance to phylloxera. While the vines, leaves and grapes look very similar, both grapes produce wines with distinct characteristics — Carménère being more strongly flavored with green pepper notes and Merlot having softer fruit with chocolate notes.|$|E

500|$|Winthrop gave {{a speech}} to the General Court in July 1645, stating that {{there are two kinds of}} liberty: natural liberty to do as one wished, [...] "evil as well as good," [...] a liberty that he {{believed}} should be restrained; and civil liberty to do good. Winthrop strongly believed that civil liberty was [...] "the proper end and object of authority", meaning that it was the duty of the government to be selfless for the people and promote justice instead of promoting the general welfare. He supported this point of view by his actions, such as when he passed laws requiring the heads of households to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children and servants received proper education, and for support of teachers from public funds. Winthrop's actions were for the unity of the colony because he believed that nothing was more crucial of a colony than working as a single unit that wouldn't be split by any force, such as with the case of Anne Hutchinson. He was a leader respected by many, even Richard Dummer, a principal Hutchinsonian disarmed for his activities, who gave 100 pounds to him.|$|E
