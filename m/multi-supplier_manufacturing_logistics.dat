40|$|Purpose - Sets out an {{exploratory}} study {{to give an}} alternative viewpoint of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Based on causal analysis, the relationship between competitive strategy and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> was explored. Variables, including both positioning and competitive dimensions, in the competitive strategy that interacted with <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> were identified. The elements of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> for this study included master production scheduling, capacity requirements planning, material planning, purchasing, and inventory control. A weighted business performance index was used to segregate the sample firms into three groups: high-, average-, and low-performing organizations. For each of the performance group, the causal relationships between strategic elements {{and the performance of}} <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> were then analyzed. Findings - The results showed a significant relationship between competitive strategy and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> system performance. Research/limitations/implications - Not all the elements in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> may contribute to the logistics performance. The construct of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> depends on a particular set of strategic variables that the organization designs. Originality/value - Extends the study of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> beyond its boundary through a broader strategic perspective. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} research {{directions and}} opportunities in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> based on recommendations from an NSF sponsored workshop, and subsequent {{efforts by the}} authors to synthesize, extract and revitalize the vision formed in the workshop. To convey this vision we suggest a taxonomy that characterizes research problems in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> by the physical entities (systems) involved, the level-of-abstraction, the focus, {{and the type of}} decision (decision scope) intended, and the broader business context (business environment) of which the research can be justified. A main goal of the paper is to envision a broader and richer research base in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> through the explicit consideration of business contexts and technological trends. We argue that these renewed directions for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> research offer opportunities for the OR/MS professionals to exert influence on corporate decision making, and to make direct impact on software innovation. 1...|$|R

40|$|The fourth {{industrial}} revolution, Industry 4. 0, {{is expected}} to cause disruptive changes in industrial production. It is driven by rapid technological developments {{and the need for}} manufacturing companies to make themselves independent of high labor costs. Industry 4. 0 concerns several aspects of industrial production, including <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics,</b> business models and products and services. The applications of Industry 4. 0 have been vastly outlined. However, the fit of Industry 4. 0 applications in different production environments is not clear. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify and investigate the Industry 4. 0 technologies that are applicable to <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics,</b> and how the production environment influences the applicability of these technologies. This is done through a multiple case study of four Norwegian manufacturing companies. The findings from the study indicate that the applicability of Industry 4. 0 in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics</b> is dependent on the production environment. Companies with a low degree of production repetitiveness see less potential in applying Industry 4. 0 technologies in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>logistics,</b> while companies with a highly repetitive production see a higher potential...|$|R
