40|$|During virus {{particle}} assembly, the arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) associates with the viral genome to form nucleocapsids, which ultimately become incorporated into new virions at the cell membrane. Virion release is {{facilitated by the}} viral matrix Z protein through its interaction with the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. However, the mechanism of nucleocapsid incorporation into virions is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that ALIX/AIP 1, an ESCRT-associated host protein, {{is required for the}} incorporation of the NP of <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus,</b> a close relative of Lassa virus, into Z-induced virus-like particles (VLPs). Furthermore, we show that the Bro 1 domain of ALIX/AIP 1 interacts with the NP and Z proteins simultaneously, facilitating their interaction, and we identify residues 342 to 399 of NP as being necessary for its interaction with ALIX/AIP 1. Our observations suggest a potential role for ALIX/AIP 1 in linking <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus</b> NP to Z and the budding apparatus, thereby promoting NP incorporation into virions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Serologically related arenaviruses have been isolated from West Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and the Central African Republic. Human disease is only associated with the West African isolates. The virulence of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Central African Republic isolates in humans is not known. This Thesis is an account of work {{carried out by the}} author to compare the biological characteristics of isolates from West Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. It describes the successful isolation and identification of the aetiological agents, their physicochemical and antigenic characteristics and describes in vivo studies using mice, guinea pigs and Rhesus monkeys. A direct comparison was made with a patient diagnosed as having Lassa fever. The disease in man and monkeys following infection with Lassa virus was similar. The Rhesus monkey and guinea pig proved suitable experimental models in which to study and compare the pathogenic responses and also to evaluate various aspects of protection. These animal models when immunised with the viruses from Mozambique and Zimbabwe were protected when subsequently challenged with Lassa virus. The Mozambique and Zimbabwe isolates proved to have morphological and physicochemical characteristics not dissimilar from West African Lassa viruses and those members of the arenavirus family from South America. Serological and immunochemical investigations suggest the existence of both common and unique antigenic determinants on the viruses from Mozambique, -Zimbabwe and West Africa. This grouping also coincides with the geographic separation of the viruses, i. e. Lassa - West Africa and Mopeia -southeast Africa. Similar differences in host susceptibility have also been demonstrated. Lassa virus produces a fatal haemorrhagic disease while Mopeia isolates produce only an asymptomatic infection. The combined data suggests the possibility of two virus groups within the 'Old World' arenavirus classification. The proposed name, 'Mopeia', forms one group and includes the viruses from Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The Lassa strains from West Africa form the second group. It is suggested that the <b>Mopeia</b> <b>viruses</b> are minor antigenic variants of Lassa and should be included within the arenavirus family...|$|R
40|$|Lassa virus causes hemorrhagic Lassa fever in humans, {{while the}} related Old World arenaviruses Mopeia, Morogoro, and Mobala are {{supposedly}} apathogenic to humans and cause only inapparent infection in non-human primates. Here, we studied whether the virulence of Old World arenaviruses in humans and non-human primates {{is reflected in}} type I interferon receptor deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice by testing several strains of Lassa virus vs. the apathogenic <b>viruses</b> <b>Mopeia,</b> Morogoro, and Mobala. All Lassa virus strains tested-Josiah, AV, BA 366, and Nig 04 - 10 -replicated to high titers in blood, lung, kidney, heart, spleen, brain, and liver and caused disease as evidenced by weight loss and elevation of aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT) levels with a high AST/ALT ratio. Lassa fever-like pathology included acute hepatitis, interstitial pneumonia, and pronounced disturbance of splenic cytoarchitecture. Infiltrations of activated monocytes/macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase and T cells were found in liver and lung. In contrast, Mopeia, Morogoro, and Mobala virus replicated poorly in the animals and acute inflammatory alterations were not noted. Depletion of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells strongly enhanced susceptibility of IFNAR(-/-) mice to the apathogenic viruses. In conclusion, the virulence of Old World arenaviruses in IFNAR(-/-) mice correlates with their virulence in humans and non-human primates. In addition to the type I interferon system, T cells seem to regulate whether or not an arenavirus can productively infect non-host rodent species. The observation that Lassa virus overcomes the species barrier without artificial depletion of T cells suggests {{it is able to}} impair T cell functionality in a way that corresponds to depletion...|$|R

J. Peters, M. J. Buchmeier, P. E. Rollin, and T. G. Ksiazek, p. 1521 – 1551, in B. N. Fields, D. M. Knipe, and P. M. Howley [ed. ], Fields virology, 3 rd ed., 1996; P. J. Southern, p. 1505 – 1519, in B. N. Fields, D. M. Knipe, and P. M. Howley [ed. ], Fields virology, 3 rd ed., 1996). Several types in both groups—LFV, Junin, Machupo, and Sabia viruses—cause severe and often lethal human diseases. By sequence comparison, we noted that eight Old World and New World arenaviruses share several amino acids with the nucleoprotein (NP) that consists of amino acids (aa) 118 to 126 (NP 118 – 126) (RPQASGVYM) of LCMV that comprise the immunodominant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope for H- 2 d mice (32). This Ld-restricted epitope constituted > 97 % of the total bulk CTLs produced in the specific antiviral or clonal responses of H- 2 d BALB mice.

40|$|Lassa fever is {{an acute}} febrile disease of West Africa, {{where there are}} as many as 300, 000 infections a year and an {{estimated}} 3000 deaths. As control of the rodent host is impracticable at present, the best immediate prospect is vaccination. We tested as potential vaccines in rhesus monkeys a closely related virus, <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus</b> (two monkeys), and a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the Lassa virus glycoprotein gene, V-LSGPC (four monkeys). Two monkeys vaccinated with the New York Board of Health strain of vaccinia virus as controls died after challenge with Lassa virus. The two monkeys vaccinated with <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus</b> developed antibodies measurable by radioimmunoprecipitation prior to challenge, and they survived challenge by Lassa virus with minimal physical or physiologic disturbances. However, both showed a transient, low-titer Lassa viremia. Two of the four animals vaccinated with V-LSGPC had antibodies to both Lassa glycoproteins, as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation. All four animals survived a challenge of Lassa virus but experienced a transient febrile illness and moderate physiologic changes following challenge. Virus was recoverable from each of these animals, but at low titer and only during a brief period, as observed for the Mopeia-protected animals. We conclude that V-LSGPC can protect rhesus monkeys against death from Lassa fever...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{intention}} {{of this study}} was to investigate the genomics, phylogeny and evolution of the Old World arenaviruses based on sequence data representing the four viral genes.

40|$|Arenaviruses are enveloped, negative-strand RNA viruses. For several arenaviruses, virus-like {{particle}} (VLP) formation requires the viral matrix Z protein.

Moreover, the Z protein promoted the association of NP with cellular membranes, suggesting that the association of NP, Z, and the cellular membranes may facilitate the efficient incorporation of NP into VLPs. By employing a series of NP deletion constructs and testing their VLP incorporation, we further demonstrated an important role for the C-terminal half of NP in its incorporation into VLPs.

40|$|In {{this work}} the domain {{structure}} of the Lassa virus L protein was investigated. Potential inter-domainlinkers were predicted and functionally analyzed in the minireplicon system. Two sites were identified at which L protein could be physically separated without significant loss of function in the minireplicon system, indicating that the corresponding domains are able to trans-complement each other. Physical interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The data indicate that the L protein is composed {{of at least three}} domains. In the second part full length L proteins of Lassa virus AV, Bantou and <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus</b> should be expressed in three different expression systems. Furthermore, a polymerase assay should be established to allow biochemical characterisation of the polymerase activity of L protein.

All strain 13 guinea pigs vaccinated with clone ML 29 survived at least 70 days after LASV challenge without either disease signs or histological lesions. Rhesus macaques inoculated with clone ML 29 developed primary virus-specific T cells capable of secreting gamma interferon in response to homologous MOP/LAS and heterologous MOPV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.

40|$|Lassa virus (LASV), {{which causes}} a viral hemorrhagic fever, {{inhibits}} the innate immune response. The exonuclease (ExoN) do-main of its nucleoprotein (NP) is {{implicated in the}} suppression of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling. We show here that a LASV in which ExoN function has been abolished strongly activates innate immunity and that this effect is dependent on RIG-I signaling. These results highlight the key role of NP ExoN function in the immune evasion that occurs during LASV infection. Lassa virus (LASV) is an Old World arenavirus responsible for ahemorrhagic fever, which affects 300, 000 to 500, 000 people annually and causes about 6, 000 deaths (1). This virus is a major public health concern in West Africa. Lassa fever varies from asymptomatic infections to fatal hemorrhagic fever (2). Dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages (M) are the principal targets of infection (3, 4). DC infection leads to a massive release of LASV, without the induction of cell activation and cell maturation or the production of cytokines. Similarly, M are productively infected but display no sign of activation other than modest type I inter-feron (IFN) production (4, 5). In contrast, <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus</b> (MOPV) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{events leading}} {{to death in}} severe cases of Lassa fever (LF) are unknown.

40|$|International audienceLassa virus (LASV) and <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus</b> (MOPV) {{are closely}} related Arenaviruses. LASV causes hemorrhagic fever, whereas MOPV is not pathogenic. Both viruses display tropism for APCs such as DCs and macrophages. During viral infections, NK cells are {{involved}} in the clearance of infected cells and promote optimal immune responses by interacting with APCs. We used an in vitro model of human NK and APC coculture to study the role of NK cells and to characterize their interactions with APCs during LASV and MOPV infections. As expected, NK cells alone were neither infected nor activated by LASV and MOPV, and infected DCs did not activate NK cells. By contrast, LASV- and MOPV-infected macrophages activated NK cells, as shown by the upregulation of CD 69, NKp 30, and NKp 44, the downregulation of CXCR 3, and an increase in NK-cell proliferation. NK cells acquired enhanced cytotoxicity, as illustrated by the increase in granzyme B (GrzB) expression and killing of K 562 targets, but did not produce IFN-γ. Contact between NK cells and infected macrophages and type I IFNs were essential for activation; however, NK cells could not kill infected cells and control infection.

A live attenuated reassortant of MOPV and LASV, designated ML 29, protects rodents and primates from LASV challenge {{and appears to be}} more attenuated than MOPV. To gain better insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanism of attenuation we performed gene expression profiling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to LASV and the vaccine candidate ML 29. PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML 29. Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using high-density microarrays. Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA. LASV and ML 29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways.

40|$|Lassa virus (LV) and <b>Mopeia</b> <b>virus</b> (MV) {{are closely}} related members of the Arenavirus genus, sharing 75 % amino acid {{sequence}} identity. However, LV causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates, whereas MV cannot induce disease. We have previously shown that antigen-presenting cells (APC) —macrophages (MP) and dendritic cells (DC) —sustain high replication rates of LV but are not activated, suggesting that they {{play a role in}} the immunosuppression observed in severe cases of Lassa fever. Here, we infected human APC with MV and analyzed the cellular responses induced. MV infection was productive in MP and even more so in DC. Apoptosis was not induced in either cell type. Moreover, unlike DC, MP were early and strongly activated in response to MV, as shown by the increased surface expression of CD 86, CD 80, CD 54, CD 40, and HLA-abc and by the production of mRNA encoding alpha interferon (IFN-α), IFN-β, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 6. In addition, MV-infected MP produced less of the virus than DC, which was related to the fact that these cells secreted IFN-α. Thus, the strong activation of MP is probably a major event in the control of MV infection and may be involved in the induction of an adaptive immune response in infected hosts. These results may explain the difference in pathogenicity between LV and MV...|$|E

The functional and physical integrity of the resulting complexes was tested by reporter gene assay, Northern blotting, and coimmunoprecipitation studies. The minigenomes, NPs, and L proteins of LASV and MOPV could be exchanged without loss of function.
