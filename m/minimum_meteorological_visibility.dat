In this paper, we rst present a review of di erent optical sensors likely to measure the visibility distance. We then present our stereovision based technique to estimate what we call the "mobilized visibility distance". This is the distance to the most distant object on the road surface having a contrast above 5 %. In fact, this de nition is very close to the de nition of the <b>meteorological</b> <b>visibility</b> distance proposed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE). The method combines the computation of both a depth map of the vehicle environment using the "v-disparity " approach and of local contrasts above 5 %. Both methods are described separately.

We therefore estimated the PM 2. 5 concentration using <b>meteorological</b> <b>visibility</b> data in Beijing. We found that 71 +/- 17 % of PM 10 were PM 2. 5, which contributed to visibility impairment (y = 332. 26 e(- 0. 232 x); R- 2 = 0. 75, P < 0. 05). We then reconstructed a time series of annual PM 2. 5 from 1973 to 2013, and examined its relationship with urbanization by indicators of population, gross domestic production (GDP), energy consumption, and number of vehicles. Concluded that 1) Meteorological conditions were not the major cause of PM 2. 5 increase from 1973 to 2013; 2) With population and GDP growth, PM 2. 5 increased significantly (R- 2 = 0. 5917, P < 0. 05; R- 2 = 0. 5426, P < 0. 05); 3) Intensive human activity could change air quality in a short period, as observed changes in the correlations of PM 2. 5 concentration with energy consumption and number of vehicles before and after 2004, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Estimating the {{atmospheric}} or <b>meteorological</b> <b>visibility</b> distance {{is very important}} for air and ground transport safety, as well as for air quality. However, there is no holistic approach to tackle the problem by camera. Most existing methods are data-driven approaches which perform a linear regression between the contrast in the scene and the visual range estimated by means of reference additional sensors. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model-based approach which takes into account the distribution of contrasts in the scene. It is robust to illumination variations in the scene by taking into account the Lambertian surfaces. To evaluate our model, meteorological ground truth data were collected, showing very promising results. This works opens new perspectives in the computer vision community dealing with environmental issues. ...|$|R

An excellent agreement is found in that the discrepancy between the results is smaller than the Monte Carlo standard uncertainties. If we take no account of the geometry of the optical device, the results of the model-estimated backscattered luminance differ from the simulations by a factor 20.

40|$|Highly {{integrated}} and increasingly complex video-based driver assistance systems are rapidly developing nowadays. Following the trend towards autonomous driving, {{they have to}} operate not only under advantageous but also under adverse conditions. This includes sight impairments caused by atmospheric aerosols such as fog or smog. It {{is an important part}} of environmental understanding to thoroughly analyze the optical properties of these aerosols. The aim of this thesis is to develop models and algorithms in order to estimate <b>meteorological</b> <b>visibility</b> in homogeneous daytime fog. The models for light transport through fog are carefully derived from the theory of radiative transfer. In addition to Koschmieder's well-established model for horizontal vision, a recursively-defined sequence of higher-order models is introduced which yields arbitrarily good approximations to the solutions of the radiative boundary problem. Based on the radiative transfer models, visibility estimation algorithms are proposed which are applicable to data captured by a driver assistance front camera. For any one of these algorithms, the recording of luminances from objects observed at distinct distances is required. This data can be acquired from moving objects being tracked as well as from depth-extended homogeneous objects such as the road. The resulting algorithms supplement each other with respect to different road traffic scenarios and environmental conditions. All given algorithms are extensively discussed and optimized regarding their run-time performance in order to make them applicable for real-time purposes. The analysis shows that the proposed algorithms are a useful addition to modern driver assistance cameras...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} affect {{both human}} health and climate. PMX is the mass concentration of aerosol particles that have aerodynamic diameters less than X μm, PM 10 was initially selected to measure {{the environmental impact of}} aerosols. Recently, it was realized that fine particles are more hazardous than larger ones and should be measured. Consequently, observational data for PM 2. 5 have been obtained but only for a much shorter period than that of PM 10. Optical extinction of aerosols, the inverse of <b>meteorological</b> <b>visibility,</b> is sensitive to particles less than 1. 0 μm. These fine particles only account for a small part of total mass of aerosols although they are very efficient in light extinction. Comparisons are made between PM 10 and PM 2. 5 over the period when the latter is available and with visibility data for a longer period. PM 10 has decreased by 44 % in Europe from 1992 to 2009, 33 % in the US from 1993 to 2010, 10 % in Canada from 1994 to 2009, and 26 % in China from 2000 to 2011. However, in contrast, aerosol optical extinction has increased 7 % in the US, 10 % in Canada, and 18 % in China during the above study periods. The reduction of optical extinction over Europe of 5 % is also much less than the 44 % reduction in PM 10. Over its short period of record PM 2. 5 decreased less than PM 10. Hence, PM 10 is neither a good measure of changes in smaller particles nor of their long-term trends, a result that has important implications for both climate impact and human health effects. The increased fraction of anthropogenic aerosol emission, such as from vehicle exhaust, to total atmospheric aerosols partly explains this contrasting trend of optical and mass properties of aerosols...|$|R
