50|$|A common {{flow meter}} (like a {{differential}} pressure and positive displacement flow meters) is the magnetic flow meter, also technically an electromagnetic flow meter or more commonly just called a mag meter. A magnetic field {{is applied to}} the <b>metering</b> <b>tube,</b> which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines. The physical principle at work is electromagnetic induction. The magnetic flow meter requires a conducting fluid, for example, water that contains ions, and an electrical insulating pipe surface, for example, a rubber-lined steel tube.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic flow meters, {{often called}} [...] "mag meter"s or [...] "electromag"s, use a {{magnetic}} field applied to the <b>metering</b> <b>tube,</b> which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines. The potential difference is sensed by electrodes aligned perpendicular to the flow and the applied magnetic field. The physical principle at work is Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The magnetic flow meter requires a conducting fluid and a nonconducting pipe liner. The electrodes must not corrode {{in contact with the}} process fluid; some magnetic flowmeters have auxiliary transducers installed to clean the electrodes in place. The applied magnetic field is pulsed, which allows the flowmeter to cancel out the effect of stray voltage in the piping system.|$|E

SUBSTANCE: {{method to}} determine properties of a multi-phase process fluid medium includes stages, when: the multi-phase fluid medium is sent along an oscillating movable flow <b>metering</b> <b>tube</b> and a flow metre of alternating pressure difference; {{motion of the}} flow <b>metering</b> <b>tube</b> is caused, and the first apparent property of the fluid medium is determined; at least one apparent intermediate value is determined, {{which is the first}} Froude number for the non-gaseous phase of the fluid medium and the second Froude number for the gaseous phase of the fluid medium; the extent of humidity of the fluid medium is determined on the basis of conversion {{between the first and second}} Froude numbers and the extent of humidity; the second apparent property of the fluid medium is determined using the flow metre of alternating pressure difference; the phase-dependent property of the fluid medium is determined on the basis of extent of humidity and the second apparent property. At the same time the first apparent property is selected from the apparent mass flow or density. The group of inventions also relates to a flow metre comprising an oscillating movable flow <b>metering</b> <b>tube,</b> connected oscillation exciter and sensor for reading of tube motion, and a controller, and also to a metering converter of the flow metre and the system for determination of properties of the multi-phase fluid medium.

The HESSI imager consists of a composite <b>metering</b> <b>tube,</b> two aluminum trays mounted to the tube on titanium flexure mounts, and nine modulation grids mounted on each tray. The vibration tests were acceleration controlled and force limited, {{in order to prevent}} overtesting.

40|$|The Solar-A {{satellite}} {{being prepared}} by the Institute for Sapce and Astronautical Sciences (ISAS) in Japan is dedicated to high energy observations of solar flares. The Soft X Ray Telescope (SXT) is being prepared to provide filtered images in the 2 to 60 A interval. The flight model is now undergoing tests in the 1000 foot tunnel at MSFC. Launch will be in September 1991. Earlier resolution and efficiency tests on the grazing incidence mirror have established its performance in soft x rays. The one-piece, two mirror grazing incidence telescope is supported in a strain free mount separated from the focal plane assembly by a carbon-epoxy <b>metering</b> <b>tube</b> whose windings and filler are chosen to minimize thermal and hygroscopic effects. The CCD detector images both the x ray and the concentric visible light aspect telescope. Optical filters provide images at 4308 and 4700 A.

Image sequence with {{two or more of}} the five x ray analysis filters, with automatic exposure compensation to optimize the charge collection by the CCD detector, will be used to provide plasma diagnostics. Calculations using a differential emission measure code were used to optimize filter selection over the range of emission measure variations and to avoid redundancy, but the filters were chosen primarily to give ratios that are monotonic in plasma temperature...|$|E
40|$|The 30 {{meter and}} 100 <b>meter</b> drop <b>tubes</b> at the Marshall Space Flight Center offer a unique {{opportunity}} to study solidification in a containerless, microgravity environment. Samples are melted in a furnace {{at the top of the}} drop tube and solidify during a 4. 5 second free fall in the 100 <b>meter</b> drop <b>tube</b> or a 2. 6 second free fall in the 30 <b>meter</b> drop <b>tube.</b> The cooling rate obtained in the drop tubes is lower than cooling rates in atomization and splat-quenching processes. Decoupling the rapid solidification process allows the study of the effects of undercooling and recalescence on alloy morphologies. The research therefore has a three-fold purpose. The first is examination of the limits of undercooling of niobium and niobium-base alloys in the drop tube. The second purpose is the observation of microstructures resulting from the solidification of samples at large undercoolings and moderate cooling rates. The third purpose is the observation of metastable phase formation in highly undercooled samples...|$|R

40|$|The Coriolis {{principle}} for measuring flow rates has great advantages {{compared to other}} flow measurement principles, the most important being that mass flow is measured directly. Up to now the measurement of low flow rates posed a great challenge. In a joint research project, the University of Twente and mechatronics company DEMCON worked on the mechatronic design and construction of a novel Coriolis mass flow meter for low flow rates. Innovations included shape and fixation of the <b>meter</b> <b>tube,</b> contactless (pure torque) actuation of the tube oscillation and contactless sensing of Coriolis force-induced displacements.

40|$|NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is {{currently}} implementing a reconfigurable polarimetric L-band {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR), specifically designed to acquire airborne repeat track interferometric (RTI) SAR data, also know as differential interferometric measurements. Differential interferometry can provide key displacement measurements, important for the scientific studies of Earthquakes and volcanoes. Using precision real-time GPS and a sensor controlled flight management system, the system {{will be able to}} fly predefined paths with great precision. The radar will be designed to operate on a UAV (Unmanned Arial Vehicle) but will initially be demonstrated on a minimally piloted vehicle (MPV), such as the Proteus build by Scaled Composites. The application requires control of the flight path to within a 10 <b>meter</b> <b>tube</b> to support repeat track and formation flying measurements. The design is fully polarimetric with an 80 MHz bandwidth (2 meter range resolution) and 16 kilometer range swath. The antenna is an electronically steered array to assure that the actual antenna pointing can be controlled independent of the wind direction and speed. The system will nominally operate at 45, 000 ft. The program started out as a Instrument Incubator Project (IIP) funded by NASA Earth Science and Technology Office (ESTO) ...|$|R

40|$|The NASA Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) {{program is}} {{developing}} a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for ground measurements. A key element {{for the success of}} this program is a Platform Precision Autopilot (PPA). An interim vehicle (NASA C- 20 AJGlll) was selected to carry the radar pod and develop the PPA. The PPA interfaces with the C- 20 AIG Ill aircraft by imitating the output of an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. This technique retains the safeguards in the aircraft's autopilot. The PPA entered initial flight testing in early 2007. The PPA uses a Kalman filter to generate a real-time position solution with information from the C- 20 AIGIII and a real-time differential GPS unit designed by JPL. The real-time navigation solution is used to compute commands (Guidance and Control subsystems) which in turn drive two modified ILS testers. The ILS tester units produce modulated RF signals fed to the onboard navigation receiver. These correction signals allow the C- 20 NGIII autopilot to fly a simulated ILS approach that meets the PPA requirements for UAVSAR applications. The PPA requirement is to make repeat pass flights within a ten <b>meter</b> <b>tube</b> over a 200 kilometer course in conditions of cairn to light turbulence.
