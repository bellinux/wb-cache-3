He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter's death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter’s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The Mütter Museum began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including Benjamin Rush's <b>medical</b> <b>chest</b> and Florence Nightingale's sewing kit.

40|$|In {{recent times}} remote medical {{practice}} {{has been developed}} into a unique discipline {{in its own right}} with telehealth one of the eight defining key features. Since 1942, the telemedicine consultation service provided by the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia has been supported by a tele-pharmacy program known as the <b>Medical</b> <b>Chest</b> Program. The contents of the chest comprise more than 85 items, including medications and equipment which can be prescribed during a telehealth consultation to cover both emergency care and definitive treatment for less serious conditions. By 2006 there were 3500 medical chests placed throughout Australia. Specifically, the state of Queensland had 21 470 telehealth consultations from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006, resulting in the prescription of at least one <b>medical</b> <b>chest</b> item in 2938 (13. 7 %) consultations. Queensland data regarding medication indicate that antibiotics (26 %), analgesics (23 %) and gastrointestinal medications (12 %) were the most common categories of dispensed medications, and that the most common clinical diagnostic categories for the consultation resulting in dispensed medications were respiratory (17 %), skin (15 %) and abdominal conditions (13 %). In summary, the RFDS <b>medical</b> <b>chest</b> program continues to be a successful large scale provider of medications to those living in remote Australia, enabling early access to medications for both emergencies and definitive care, while minimising the need for mail-order pharmacy or patient travel.

Interestingly, all breast metastases affected the same side as the primary lung cancers. In addition, all our cases shared other clinical manifestations, namely, ipsilateral pleural effusion/thickness and axillary lymph node enlargement. ConclusionBecause this distinctive feature could not be explained by simple coincidence, we consider that lung adenocarcinoma may preferentially metastasize to the ipsilateral breast through a stepwise mechanism, involving pleural seeding, axillary lymph node metastasis, and retrograde lymphatic spreading into the breast...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{biologic}} agents can {{be highly}} efficacious {{in the treatment of}} psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; however, their use is associated with an increased risk of developing active TB. In particular, TNF-α plays critical role in preventing TB infection and reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI). Therefore, it is critical that all patients be screened for LTBI prior to initiating therapy. An expert panel of Italian dermatologists met recently with the goal of producing a consensus paper on screening and chemoprophylaxis for LTBI in Italian psoriasis patients treated with biologics. Current recommendations for the screening algorithm include <b>medical</b> history, <b>chest</b> x-ray, and tests that evaluate immunologic response to the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Patients with positive screening results and without active disease are to be treated with a full course of chemoprophylaxis; however, if the patient is compliant and tolerating the regimen, biologic therapy for psoriasis may be started after at least 1 month on prophylactic therapy when prompt control of disease is required...|$|R

40|$|A weakly-supervised {{semantic}} segmentation framework with a tied deconvolutional neural network is presented. Each deconvolution layer {{in the framework}} consists of unpooling and deconvolution operations. 'Unpooling' upsamples the input feature map based on unpooling switches defined by corresponding convolution layer's pooling operation. 'Deconvolution' convolves the input unpooled features by using convolutional weights tied with the corresponding convolution layer's convolution operation. The unpooling-deconvolution combination helps to eliminate less discriminative features in a feature extraction stage, since output features of the deconvolution layer are reconstructed from the most discriminative unpooled features instead of the raw one. This results in reduction of false positives in a pixel-level inference stage. All the feature maps restored from the entire deconvolution layers can constitute a rich discriminative feature set according to different abstraction levels. Those features are stacked to be selectively used for generating class-specific activation maps. Under the weak supervision (image-level labels), the proposed framework shows promising results on lesion segmentation in <b>medical</b> images (<b>chest</b> X-rays) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC segmentation dataset in the same experimental condition...|$|R

This thesis describes medical aspects of the expeditions of the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration (1895 - 1922). It is divided into three sections. Section 1 describes the drugs and medical equipment taken to the Antarctic by these expeditions. There is an introductory discussion followed by papers on ophthalmic drugs, injections, inhalations and suppositories, oral drugs and topical preparations. Sledging medical cases are considered separately. Brandy was often used as a medicine and the medical uses of alcohol are described. Some expeditions took what were described as “medical comforts”. This term was sometimes used as a euphemism for alcoholic beverages but, in fact, encompassed a wide range of foods for invalids. Burroughs Wellcome and Co. supplied many of the expeditions with drugs and their <b>medical</b> <b>chests.</b> They used the expedition link in their advertising and the relationship between the expeditions and drug companies is described. Section 2 describes some of the medical problems encountered. The most serious problems were scurvy and a condition often called “polar anaemia”, which seems to be the same as a condition known at the time as “ship beriberi” and what is now described as “wet beriberi”. The controversy as to whether Captain Scott and his colleagues died of scurvy is also discussed. Other problems included frostbite and snow blindness. At least 11 general anaesthetics were given, including two for amputation of frostbitten toes. Psychological problems were common and there was some serious psychiatric illness including alcohol abuse. Section 3 describes the doctors and some of the research that they carried out. The most common research done by doctors was bacteriological. Most doctors collected biological data on the explorers including weights and haemoglobin measurements. This was largely for health monitoring but one doctor pursued physiological research. Three doctors and a medical student studied geology...|$|R
40|$|Made {{available}} {{in accordance with}} the Publisher's Author's Permissions policyBackground: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and chest pain {{is one of the most}} common symptoms of ACSs. A rapid response to chest pain by patients and appropriate management by health professionals are vital to improve survival rates. People from different ethnic groups are likely to have different perceptions of chest pain, its severity and the need for urgent treatment. These differences in perception may contribute to differences in response to chests pain and precipitate unique coping strategies. Delay in seeking <b>medical</b> care for <b>chest</b> pain in the general population has been well documented; however, limited studies have focused on delay times within ethnic groups. There is little research to date as to whether ethnicity is associated with the time taken to seek <b>medical</b> care for <b>chest</b> pain. Consequently, addressing this gap in knowledge will play a crucial role in improving the health outcomes of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients suffering from chest pain and for developing appropriate clinical practice and public awareness for these populations. Objectives: The current review aimed to determine if there is an association between ethnicity and delay in seeking <b>medical</b> care for <b>chest</b> pain among CALD populations. Inclusion criteria Types of participants: Patients from different ethnic minority groups presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with chest pain. Types of exposure: The current review will examine studies that evaluate the association between ethnicity and delay in seeking <b>medical</b> care for <b>chest</b> pain among CALD populations. Types of studies: The current review will consider quantitative studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies and analytical cross-sectional studies. Outcomes: The current review will consider studies that measure delay time as the main outcome. The time will be measured as the interval between the time of symptom onset and time to reach an ED. Search strategy: A comprehensive search was undertaken for relevant published and unpublished studies written in English with no date restriction. All searches were conducted in October 2014. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, ProQuest (health databases only), Informit, Sociological Abstracts, Scopus and Web of Science. The search for unpublished studies included a wide range of ‘gray literature’ sources including national libraries, digital theses repositories and clinical trial registries. We also targeted specific health research, specialist cardiac, migrant health, and emergency medicine organizational websites and/or conferences. We also checked the reference lists of included studies and contacted authors when further details about reported data was required to make a decision about eligibility. Methodological quality: Papers selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to being included in the review. Validity was assessed using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Adjudication was produced by the third reviewer. Data extraction: Data were extracted from included articles by two independent reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data synthesis: The extracted data were synthesized into a narrative summary. Meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity of study protocols and methods used to measure outcomes. Results: A total of 10 studies, with a total of 1, 511, 382 participants, investigating the association between ethnicity and delay met the inclusion criteria. Delay times varied across ethnic groups, including Black, Hispanic, Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Chinese. Seven studies reported delay in hours and ranged from 1. 90 to 3. 10 h. Delay times were longer among CALD populations than the majority population. The other three studies reported delay time in categories of time (e. g. < 1, < 4 and < 6 h) and found larger proportions of later presentations to the EDs among ethnic groups compared with the majority groups. Conclusion: There is evidence of an association between ethnicity and time taken in seeking <b>medical</b> care for <b>chest</b> pain, with patients from some ethnic minorities (e. g. Black, Asian, Hispanic and South Asian) taking longer than those of the majority population. Health promotions and health campaigns focusing on these populations are indicated...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} Bordetella pertussis as a {{cause of}} persistent cough in adults, we examined 201 patients who had a cough for 2 ± 12 weeks and no pulmonary disease. We obtained the following at presentation: <b>medical</b> history, <b>chest</b> radiograph, respiratory function measurement, naso-pharyngeal aspirate for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nasopharyngeal swab specimen for culture, and a blood sample (acute serum). Four weeks later a second blood sample (con-valescent serum) was obtained. Control sera were obtained from 164 age-matched healthy blood donors with no history of cough during the previous 12 weeks. Four patients were B. pertussis culture±positive; 11 (including the culture-positive patients) were B. pertussis PCR±positive; and 33, including 10 of the 11 PCR-positive patients, had serological evidence of recent B. pertussis infection. Pertussis-positive and-negative patients could not be discrim-inated by a history of cough. We conclude that B. pertussis infection is a common cause of persistent cough in adults. This is of concern, because these patients may be B. pertussis reservoirs from which transmission may occur to infants, in whom the disease can be devas-tating.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{association}} of neurofibromatosis with diffuse lung disease (NF-DLD) has been described, but its true prevalence and characteristics remain unclear. The {{objective of the}} present study was to define diffuse lung disease in patients with neurofibromatosis. A retrospective case series and literature review in a tertiary care academic medical centre is reported in which <b>medical</b> records, <b>chest</b> radiographs and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were reviewed. A total of 55 adult patients with neurofibromatosis were identified, three of whom had NF-DLD. A literature review revealed 16 articles reporting 61 additional cases, yielding a total of 64 NF-DLD cases. The mean age of patients was 50 yrs. Males outnumbered females; most reported dyspnoea. Of the 16 subjects with documented smoking histories, 12 were ever-smokers. Eight patients had HRCT scan results demonstrating ground-glass opacities (37 %), bibasilar reticular opacities (50 %), bullae (50 %), cysts (25 %) and emphysema (25 %); none had honeycombing. A group of 14 patients had surgical biopsy results that showed findings of interstitial fibrosis (100 %) and interstitial inflammation (93 %).

40|$|Background: Which {{diagnostic}} procedures {{should be used}} to differentiate between idiopathic and malignant pleural effusions, is not well established. Aim: To identify which parameters allow differentia-tion between idiopathic and malignant pleural effusions. Design: Case-note review. Methods: Over a 12 -year period, we treated 1014 consecutive pleural effusion patients, of whom 346 were diagnosed as having an idiopathic or malig-nant aetiology. We analysed <b>medical</b> history, <b>chest</b> X-ray, pleural fluid analysis (biochemical, microbiological and cytological), chest CT scan and additional examinations that were used accord-ing to clinical findings, and compared them with the eventual diagnosis and outcome. Results: Eighty-three patients with idiopathic effusions and 263 with malignant effusions were included. Idiopathic pleural effusion resolved in 47 patients, improved in 20 and persisted in 16. Biochemical pleural fluid analysis did not predict these outcomes. A history of neoplasm, chest X-ray and CT features, as well as additional examinations according to clinical find-ings, established a diagnosis or suspicion of malignancy in 256 (97. 7 %) of the 263 patients who received a diagnosis of malignant effusion. Diagnostic thoracoscopy was helpful in seven patients in whom malignant disease was strongly suspected, despite the absence of other pathological findings. Discussion: Non-invasive complementary examina-tions generally allowed accurate differentiation between malignant and idiopathic effusions.
