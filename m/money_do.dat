25|$|After Noah is blinded in an {{accident}} at film school, he breaks off with Luke, feeling a need to be independent and blaming Luke, because the couple had been arguing {{at the time of}} the accident. Noah finds a specialist, neurosurgeon Reid Oliver, whom he believes he can cure his sight, and Luke tries to lure the arrogant doctor to Oakdale; when promises of <b>money</b> <b>do</b> not work, he successfully blackmails him. In spite of this rocky start, the pair gradually fall in love. When Noah eventually begins to consider reuniting with Luke, Luke is torn - both angry at Noah's prior treatment and confused by his feelings for Reid. Reid eventually resigns from the hospital when he realizes that he must either do so or break off his relationship with Luke, the hospital's biggest donor, but is soon reinstated. Tragically, Reid is mortally injured when his car is struck by a train.|$|E
500|$|In {{classical}} theory, {{the interest}} rate is determined by savings and investment alone, [...] Changes in the quantity of <b>money</b> <b>do</b> not affect {{the interest rate}} but only influence the price level (quantity theory of money). Keynesian liquidity preference theory determines interest and income using two separate equilibrium conditions, namely, the equality of savings and investment, , and the equality of money demand and money supply, [...] This is the familiar IS-LM model. Like the classical approach, the IS-LM model contains an equilibrium condition that equates savings and investment.|$|E

2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my <b>money,</b> <b>do</b> all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E
