Hence, this study was designed to explore teachers 2 ̆ 7 leadership activities in the classroom in a private high school in Gilgit-Baltistan. This was a qualitative study within which a case study was used as a research method. The research participants were selected through purposive sampling which included head teacher, two secondary school teachers and six students of class ten. The fieldwork was spread over six weeks to collect relevant data. In this regard, semi-structure interviews, classroom observations and focused group discussions as tools for data collection were used. An activity theory was used as a lens to analyse the data within adapted teacher leadership frame work by Farman and Mackenzie (2010). Key findings include continuous professional capacity building promotes teachers 2 ̆ 7 leadership, teacher leadership promotes relationships with students, teacher leaders translate curriculum into learning activities, teacher leadership activities enhance students 2 ̆ 7 self-esteem and confidence to solve learning problems, teacher leaders 2 ̆ 7 pedagogic act contributes to students 2 ̆ 7 leadership qualities, school policies and teachers 2 ̆ 7 workload affect teachers 2 ̆ 7 leadership activities, and teacher leaders develop culture for leadership activities in the classroom. The study also proposes a possible framework for teachers 2 ̆ 7 leadership activities in the classroom for student learning. The study suggests a viable approach for <b>making</b> <b>school</b> <b>policy</b> enabling teachers to act as teacher leaders. The study also suggests making continuous professional development mandatory for teachers to carry out their leadership activities in the classroom for purposeful student learning...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} focus on children’s active and {{inactive}} lifestyles {{and the role of}} the <b>school</b> health <b>policy</b> to enhance participation in physical activity. Whether you are a child, adolescent or adult, the evidence is conclusive that regular physical activity is important for your health. Results from a cross-sectional survey among 1008 9 to 10 year old Flemish children showed that the majority of these young people (71 %) were involved in organised out of school sports activities. However, the average intensity of sports participation was low to moderate, especially among girls. In addition to this, no clear relationship between screen-based sedentary behaviour and physical activity was found, suggesting that there is time for both sedentary and active behaviour throughout the day. Within the framework of the Health Promoting School concept, schools are important agents in promoting positive health behaviour related to an active lifestyle. Based on the results of a school questionnaire concerning the <b>school’s</b> physical activity <b>policy,</b> the majority of investigated primary schools provided a variety of opportunities to enhance engagement in physical activity. Nevertheless, setting up a walking school bus or bicycle train as an active transportation system and increasing the involvement of multiple stakeholders (e. g. parents, pupils, external partners) in the <b>making</b> of <b>school</b> health <b>policies</b> were detected as important challenges for schools. In the near future, a more comprehensive examination of the methods by which schools can influence the risk and health behaviour of their pupils is needed. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The {{separate}} special <b>schools</b> <b>policies</b> of the Apartheid era {{created a}} system of schools for children {{with a wide variety}} of disabilities, with some schools specializing in educating blind, deaf or intellectually impaired students while others that catered for physically disabled students offered the standard academic curriculum coupled with medical and paramedical services to treat the pupils' impairments. As with the general population these schools were also racially segregated. The ones for white children were far better resourced than those for other racial groups. With the abolition of apartheid came a policy shift towards inclusive education with the ideal that most disabled children should attend the same schools as their non-disabled peers, however the process of <b>making</b> <b>schools</b> physically accessible and equipping and staffing them to accommodate such students has been very slow.

30|$|Policy {{simulations}} of simple interventions {{to prevent or}} slow down the movement of teachers up the quality ladder without {{taking into account the}} general equilibrium implications of such government actions proved to be mostly ineffective. Direct intervention to suppress movement of experienced teachers by closing a subset of the good school market induced large increases in the number of relatively inexperienced teachers at bad <b>schools.</b> <b>Making</b> bad <b>schools</b> more desirable does increase the number of experienced teachers at these <b>schools,</b> but this <b>policy</b> carries a very high price tag. This points to the conclusion that simplistic rule changes to redirect transfers will most likely be unsuccessful in increasing efficiency or equity. To get experienced teachers to stay at ‘bad’ <b>schools,</b> <b>policy</b> makers will have to change the characteristics of these schools that make them so unattractive, which promises to be an expensive endeavor. Ultimately, while the outcome of simplistic policy interventions in the teacher transfer market will be, at best, opaque, it is encouraging that insights gained from other matching labor markets will be applicable to this market as well.|$|R

Moreover, when respondents were confronted with both the cost and benefit frames - a situation which closely resembles the political and public debate - they still showed less support for ethnic-targeted <b>school</b> <b>policies.</b> We also found that aversion to ethnic-targeted <b>school</b> <b>policies</b> is driven by negative considerations such as a preference for hierarchical social relations and perceptions of ethnic threat.

40|$|Abstract Background Globally, non-communicable {{diseases}} (NCDs) {{are identified}} {{as one of the}} leading causes of mortality. NCDs have several modifiable risk factors including unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol abuse. Schools provide ideal settings for health promotion, but the effectiveness of <b>school</b> <b>policies</b> in the reduction of risk factors for NCD is not clear. This study reviewed the literature on the impact of <b>school</b> <b>policies</b> on major NCD risk factors. Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify, collate and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of <b>school</b> <b>policies</b> on reduction of NCD risk factors. A search strategy was developed to identify the relevant studies on effectiveness of NCD <b>policies</b> in <b>schools</b> for children between the age of 6 to 18  years in Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Data extraction was conducted using pre-piloted forms. Studies included in the review were assessed for methodological quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. A narrative synthesis according to the types of outcomes was conducted to present the evidence on the effectiveness of <b>school</b> <b>policies.</b> Results Overall, 27 out of 2633 identified studies were included in the review. <b>School</b> <b>policies</b> were comparatively more effective in reducing unhealthy diet, tobacco use, physical inactivity and inflammatory biomarkers as opposed to anthropometric measures, overweight/obesity, and alcohol use. In total, for 103 outcomes independently evaluated within these studies, 48 outcomes (46 %) had significant desirable changes when exposed to the <b>school</b> <b>policies.</b> Based on the quality assessment, 18 studies were categorized as weak, six as moderate and three as having strong methodological quality. Conclusion Mixed findings were observed concerning effectiveness of <b>school</b> <b>policies</b> in reducing NCD risk factors. The findings demonstrate that schools can be a good setting for initiating positive changes in reducing NCD risk factors, but more research is required with long-term follow up to study the sustainability of such changes...|$|R
