5|$|Three Biograph titles, The Usurer (August 15, 1910), The Affair of an Egg (September 1, 1910), and Examination Day at School (September 2, 1910), and two IMP titles, At the Duke's Command (February 6, 1911) and From the Bottom of the Sea (October 20, 1911), {{have been}} erroneously listed in Mary Pickford filmographies. Pickford {{historian}} Christel Schmidt has {{confirmed that the}} actress {{does not appear in}} these films. The Internet Movie Database lists Pickford as appearing in the Biograph shorts entitled <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> Entertains (January 9, 1909), The Fascinating Mrs. Francis (January 21, 1909) and The Deception (March 22, 1909). However, Pickford did not begin with Biograph until the end of April 1909.|$|E
25|$|Elliot, Alma, and Jess next {{come upon}} the {{isolated}} house of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones,</b> a negative, elderly eccentric {{who has no}} outside contact with society and is unaware of the current disaster. The following morning, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> becomes infected with the toxin. Realizing that the plants are now targeting individuals, Elliot locks himself in the basement but is separated from Alma and Jess, {{who are in the}} home's springhouse out back. They are able to communicate through an old talking tube, and Elliot warns them of the threat. He expresses his love for her before deciding that if he is to die, he would prefer to spend his remaining time with her. The three leave the safety of their buildings and embrace in the yard, surprised to find themselves unaffected by the neurotoxin. The outbreak has abated as quickly as it began.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, the Golden Lamb Inn in Lebanon, Ohio was {{purchased}} by Robert Jones, grandfather of Portman and husband of Virginia Kunkle Jones, who refurbished the inn and decorated it with Shaker furniture. In 1969, Mr. and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> leased the Golden Lamb to the Comisar family, who owned and operated the now defunct five-star Maisonette restaurant.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Parker {{was cast}} {{alongside}} YouTube reviewer Stuart Ashen in the Alienware sponsored sci-fi thriller series The Proxy. He also appeared as Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec {{in the film}} adaption of Louise Penny's murder mystery novel Still Life, set in rural Quebec. He also starred in the TV series, Me and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jones</b> broadcast in 2012.|$|E
25|$|A {{man named}} Rawlins, a {{reporter}} with a newspaper at Benalla, was shot and wounded. A boy and girl, the children of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jones,</b> were shot. The young girl survived, but the boy later died in hospital the following day. Reardon's son was shot accidentally by Sgt. Steele when they were attempting to escape the hotel. An Aboriginal tracker also had a narrow escape with a ball grazing his forehead.|$|E
25|$|The police, Aboriginal {{trackers}} {{and others}} watched the surrounded hotel throughout the night. At about 5 {{o'clock in the}} morning the landlady, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jones,</b> began loudly wailing over the fate of her son, who {{had been shot in the}} back. She came out from the hotel crying bitterly and wandered into the bush on several occasions. With the assistance of one of the prisoners she removed her son from the building, and sent him to Wangaratta for treatment. The firing continued intermittently. Bullets lodged in the station buildings and the train.|$|E
25|$|According to Ned Kelly, after {{shooting}} Sherritt, {{the gang}} rode through Beechworth to Glenrowan, {{with the intention}} of wrecking any special train bringing additional police to join in their pursuit. They forced line-repairers James Reardon and Denis Sullivan to damage the track. Having roused and tried other men without success, Kelly took Reardon's wife and seven or eight children to Stainstreet's residence, where they, and others were secured by Steve Hart while Kelly, Byrne, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jones</b> and the line-repairers went to damage the track. They selected the first turning after reaching Glenrowan, at a culvert and on an incline. One rail was raised on each side, and the sleepers were removed.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} police arrived, the gang decided {{to prepare for}} action and let their prisoners go, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jones</b> told them to stay to hear Ned lecture. Byrne {{interrupted}} the conversation alerting the group about the train's arrival. The gang rushed into the room where they kept their armour and hurried to dress. Constable Bracken grabbed {{the key to the}} room in which he and others were held, told everyone to lie low if there was any firing, and escaped. He rushed to the railway station at which the train had just arrived and explained the situation to the police. Supt. Hare told his men to leave their horses and he was followed to the hotel by six constables and five Aboriginal trackers. At this point the police started the volley.|$|E
500|$|Minogue's {{close friend}} and stylist William Baker, collaborated with graphic {{designer}} Tony Hung to create the artwork's concept of electro-minimalism. On the cover, which was photographed by Vincent Peters, Minogue is seen [...] "bound by a microphone cord, literally tied to her craft" [...] and dressed in white leotard designed by Fee Doran, under the label of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jones,</b> and shoes made by Manolo Blahnik. In her 2012 fashion retrospective book Kylie / Fashion, Minogue commented on the album's theme, saying: [...] "The whole campaign was so strong, sure, ice cool. Willie's [...] styling was incredible and [...] photography made for a second amazing album cover with him." [...] A new cover was issued for the US version of the album and features a close-up of Minogue biting on a bracelet. The US version cover also served as the cover for second single of the album, [...] "In Your Eyes".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on 11 August 2001. It begins with Minogue driving a De Tomaso Mangusta sports car on a futuristic bridge, while singing the [...] "la la la" [...] hook of the song. The next scene consists {{of a number of}} dance couples performing a dance routine dressed in black and white costumes; they are soon joined by Minogue, who is seen wearing a white tracksuit. The setting changes to a room where Minogue is seen striking various poses sporting bright crimson lipstick and a hooded white jumpsuit with a neckline plunging down to her navel. The outfit was designed by London-based fashion designer Fee Doran, under the label of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Jones.</b> Minogue then performs a synchronised dance routine with several backup dancers, who are wearing red and black suits. As the video ends, she performs a similar routine {{on the top of a}} building during the night, this time wearing a lavender halter neck dress with ribbon tile trim. Various scenes in the video show Minogue's face [...] "unusually" [...] close to the lens of the camera, thus it [...] "subtly distorts, yet remains glamorous." [...] Shadforth felt the shot gave a [...] "sort of sense of intimacy and as you say a sort of strangeness," [...] again drawing upon the suggestion of Minogue being an alien. Similarly, Morley opined that it was [...] "the side of Kylie that suddenly reveals itself as being experimental, she is prepared to push herself into positions and shapes that might not be conventionally attractive [...] She becomes alien Kylie as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones' wife {{received}} $3,000 {{in insurance}} payments (Jones was [...] "doubleheading" [...] {{as a member}} of two unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and had a $1,500 policy with each union) and later settled with IC for an additional $2,650 (Earl Brewer, a Water Valley attorney who would later serve as Governor of Mississippi, represented her in the settlement). Other than these payments <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> received nothing {{as a result of the}} wreck or Jones' service with the railroad, as the Railroad Retirement Fund was not established until 1937.|$|E
2500|$|She {{achieved}} great {{popularity in}} the [...] "Jones" [...] series, filmdom's first comedy series, in which she played <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> in around a dozen films. More popular still were the dramatic love stories in which she co-starred with John R. Cumpson, as Mr. Jones, and Arthur Johnson. The two played husband and wife in The Ingrate, and the adulterous lovers in Resurrection. Lawrence and Solter began to look elsewhere for work, writing to the Essanay Company to offer their services as leading lady and director. Rather than accepting this offer, however, Essanay reported the offer to Biograph's head office, and they were promptly fired.|$|E
2500|$|Kéllé {{experienced}} minor success {{after leaving}} Eternal {{in the form}} of a no. 14 single called [...] "Higher Than Heaven" [...] in October 1999, but her debut solo album, Breakfast in Bed, was never released. [...] A second single, [...] "I Wanna Know", was cancelled due to further health issues. She went on to launch her own artist management company, Red Hot Entertainment and finished as the female runner up on the reality TV show Love Island. Kéllé appeared in the BBC sitcom series Me and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> (2012) with Neil Morrisey. Kéllé, who is now a Mother of 2, can be found on Twitter.|$|E
2500|$|Moses – The raven, [...] "Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he {{was also}} a clever talker." [...] Initially {{following}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called [...] "Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!" [...] Orwell portrays established religion as [...] "the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power." [...] Napoleon brings the raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{man has to}} {{take the}} name, my dear, which he inherits. I could not call myself <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> any more than <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jones</b> can call herself Lady Persiflage. If he is the Duca di Crinola he must be the Duca di Crinola." ...|$|E
