5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is <b>menu-based,</b> {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, SAS {{was one of}} Inc. Magazine's {{fastest growing}} {{companies}} in America from 1979 and 1985. It grew more than ten percent per year from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. In 2007, SAS revenue was $2.15 billion, and in 2013 its revenue was $3.02 billion. By the late 1990s, SAS was the largest privately held software company. The Associated Press reported that analysts attributed the growth to aggressive R spending. It had the highest ratio of its revenues spent on R in the industry for eight years, setting a record of 34 percent of its revenues in 1993, as it {{was working on a}} new <b>menu-based</b> interface. The company began its relationship with Microsoft and development for Windows operating systems in 1989. Shortly afterwards it established partnerships with database companies like Oracle, Sybase and Informix.|$|E
5|$|Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} series developed by Multimedia Intelligence Transfer, Sega, and Menue, {{and published by}} Atlus and Sega for multiple platforms. The {{first game of the}} series, Revelations: The Demon Slayer, was released in 1992; this is the only title in the series to have been released in English. After The Demon Slayer, two sequels and five spin-off titles have been released. In the main series titles, players explore the game world and fight monsters in <b>menu-based</b> battles; players can also attempt to recruit monsters to their party, and can fuse two allied monsters into a single new one to try to get stronger monsters. The spin-off title Another Bible is a turn-based strategy game, while Last Bible Special is a role-playing game controlled from a first-person perspective.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} {{focuses on}} the invasion and land battles of Iwo Jima. The player commands the United States Marine Corps against the Imperial Japanese Army, who are occupying the islands {{as part of the}} Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II. The game is <b>menu-based</b> and only allows the player to use four command functions; move, attack, land and pass. Depending on the difficulty set, the game lasts 32 to 36 turns and can only be won by eliminating all Japanese forces from the island before the final turn ends. During the game, the enemy may fortify their positions, launch air strikes against the United States Navy fleet or may perform suicide attacks if their unit is about to be wiped out. The player also has the ability to order air strikes against the enemy, if weather permits.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these two gameplay types, Sonic Unleashed also features hubworlds, in which the player may reveal, as well as advance, {{the story of the}} game. Hubworlds operate differently depending on the version of the game being played; the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature fully interactive, explorable 3D hubworlds, similar to those in Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic Adventure, in which townspeople may be interacted with and side quests may be undertaken, in order to gain experience or unlock items, such as artwork, videos and music tracks. In contrast, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions feature <b>menu-based</b> map systems, in which players simply click on areas to talk to townspeople and find information. Within both day and nighttime levels are medals that Sonic may collect, two types of which exist: Sun and Moon. In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, collecting these medals allows the player to level up Sonic's Sun and Moon stats, and these must be increased to reach new stages in the game, with a certain number of Sun medals for Hedgehog levels, and a certain number of Moon medals for Werehog levels. Because only the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions feature playable hubworlds, these are also the only versions in which Sun and Moon medals may be found by exploring the towns, talking to the citizens, and completing side quests. In the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, Sun and Moon medals are earned after completing stages and clearing their objectives. The medals are used to open up doors in Gaia gates, which can earn bonus content.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} form of Japanese adventure {{game that}} eventually emerged is the visual novel, a genre that was largely rooted in Portopia Serial Murder Case, but gradually became more streamlined and uses many conventions that are distinct from Western adventures. They are almost universally first-person, and driven primarily by dialog. They {{also tend to}} use <b>menu-based</b> interactions and navigation, with point and click implementations that are quite different from Western adventure games. Inventory-based puzzles {{of the sort that}} form the basis of classic Western adventures, are quite rare. Logic puzzles like those found in Myst are likewise unusual. Because of this, Japanese visual novels tend to be streamlined, and often quite easy, relying more on storytelling than challenge to keep players interested.|$|E
25|$|The ribbon, a {{panel that}} houses a fixed {{arrangement}} of command buttons and icons, organizes commands {{as a set}} of tabs, each grouping relevant commands. The ribbon is present in Microsoft Word 2007, Excel 2007, PowerPoint 2007, Access 2007 and some Outlook 2007 windows. The ribbon is not user customizable in Office 2007. Each application has a different set of tabs that exposes functions that the application offers. For example, while Excel has a tab for the graphing capabilities, Word does not; instead it has tabs to control the formatting of a text document. Within each tab, various related options may be grouped together. The ribbon is designed to make the features of the application more discoverable and accessible with fewer mouse clicks as compared to the <b>menu-based</b> UI used prior to Office 2007. Moving the mouse scroll wheel while on any of the tabs on the ribbon cycles—through the tabs. The ribbon can be minimized by double clicking the active section's title, such as the Home text in the picture below. Office 2007 does not natively support removing, modifying or replacing ribbon. Third party add-ins, however, can bring menus and toolbars back to Office 2007 or customize the ribbon commands. Add-ins that restore menus and toolbars include Classic Menu for Office, ToolbarToggle, and Ubitmenu. Others like RibbonCustomizer enable the customization of ribbons. Office 2010 does allow user customization of the ribbon out of the box.|$|E
500|$|Mother is a single-player, {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in a}} [...] "slightly offbeat", late 20th century United States (as interpreted by Itoi). Unlike its Japanese role-playing game contemporaries, Mother is not set in a fantasy genre. The player fights in warehouses and laboratories instead of in standard dungeons, and with baseball bats and psychic abilities instead of swords and magic. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses psychic powers to fight hostile, formerly inanimate objects and other enemies. The game uses random encounters to enter a <b>menu-based,</b> first-person perspective battle system.|$|E
500|$|... later {{released}} outside Japan as EarthBound Beginnings, is a role-playing {{video game}} developed by Ape {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Famicom. The game is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but {{is set in the}} late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to fight hostile, formerly inanimate objects and other enemies. The game uses random encounters to enter a <b>menu-based,</b> first-person perspective battle system. It is the first game in the Mother series and was followed by two sequels, EarthBound in 1994 and Mother 3 in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Horii's {{earliest}} {{inspiration for}} Dragon Quest {{is his own}} 1983 PC visual novel The Portopia Serial Murder Case – a murder mystery adventure game that bears some similarities to games such as Mystery House, Zork, , and particularly DéjàVu. Horii wanted to advance the game's storyline by using dialogue. Portopia was originally released for Japan's NEC PC-6001 and was later ported to the NES in 1985. The port is Enix's second release for the system and the first game which Horii and Nakamura worked on together. Horii redesigned the interface for the port to accommodate the console's limited controls, and added a dungeon-crawling area which the detective explores. While Portopia did not directly result in Dragon Quests creation, it was, according to 1UP.com, [...] "a proving ground" [...] for the RPG. The <b>menu-based</b> command system of Portopia would later be used in Dragon Quest.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy V {{includes}} many standard role-playing elements {{as well as}} renovated features introduced in earlier Final Fantasy games. Players navigate from a top-down perspective; a traversable overworld connects the various towns, dungeons, and other points of interest. The player can traverse the overworld by foot, Chocobo, hydra-guided ship, wind drake, or airship, depending on the situation. Most towns contain scattered inns for resting, shops for purchasing equipment, and people from whom the player can gain information. The player may also embark on several side quests that become available as the story progresses. Characters grow in strength by gaining experience points from random encounters with monsters on the overworld or in a dungeon. Experience culminates in a [...] "level up", in which character attributes such as hit points and magic power increase. A <b>menu-based</b> management system allows the player to equip, heal, and change each character's selected job outside of battle {{as well as to}} save the game's progress.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy II {{features}} gameplay {{similar to}} that of its predecessor, Final Fantasy. The player can freely roam an overworld containing several towns and dungeons. A <b>menu-based</b> system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to two—often disposable—items for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as [...] "Cure", can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player's progression through the game. One new feature is the [...] "Word Memory" [...] system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can [...] "ask" [...] about and [...] "memorize" [...] special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen {{as they were in the}} first Final Fantasy, and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. Final Fantasy II introduced the chocobo, the signature Final Fantasy mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced in II; a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.|$|E

50|$|The Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC) is {{designed}} to provide instruction to students through resident instruction at Fort Benning, Georgia. Located on Camp Cornett at Fort Benning's Harmony Church cantonment area, the RSLC Program of Instruction (POI) is tailored to train and test the fundamentals of reconnaissance operations for Soldiers and leaders assigned to reconnaissance Teams and Squads. Therefore, priority for training is to Team Leaders (U.S. Army Specialists to Sergeants), Squad Leaders (U.S. Army Staff Sergeants), and leaders (U.S. Sergeants First Class / Lieutenants) assigned oversight of small unit reconnaissance operations without prior reconnaissance training and experience. In addition to resident course instruction, the RSLC POI provides opportunities to deliver <b>menu-based</b> training through Mobile Training Teams (MTT) at a requesting unit's home station location. <b>Menu-based</b> training enables unit commanders to meet specific reconnaissance focused training priorities without sacrificing other training needs in support of a unit's operational mission requirements. While resident course instruction has priority over <b>menu-based</b> MTT instruction, the RSLC Cadre will work to meet every unit's training needs.|$|E
