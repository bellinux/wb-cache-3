60|$|In {{the first}} place, it is formed, in many respects, upon FEUDAL PRINCIPLES. In the feudal times, {{it was not}} uncommon, even among subjects, for the lowest offices to be held by {{considerable}} persons; persons as unfit by their incapacity, as improper from their rank, to occupy such employments. They were held by patent, sometimes for life, and sometimes by inheritance. If my memory does not deceive me, a person of no slight consideration held the office of patent hereditary cook to an earl of Warwick. The earl of Warwick's soups, I fear, were not the better for the dignity of his kitchen. I {{think it was an}} earl of Gloucester, who officiated as steward of the household to the archbishops of Canterbury. Instances of the same kind may in some degree be found in the Northumberland house-book, and other family records. There was some reason in ancient necessities, for these ancient customs. Protection was wanted; and the domestic tie, thought not the highest, was the closest. The king's household has not only several strong traces of this FEUDALITY, but it is formed also upon the principles of a BODY CORPORATE; it has its own magistrates, courts, and by-laws. This might be necessary in the ancient times, {{in order to have a}} government within itself, capable of regulating the vast and often unruly multitude which composed and attended it.

40|$|The atomic {{structures}} that develop {{as a function}} of coverage during deposition of Bi on Ag(111) have been studied using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and ab initio calculations. The growth process involves two sequential stages. At low coverage, Bi atoms are incorporated into the topmost layer of Ag(111), resulting in the formation of an Ag 2 Bi alloy confined to the surface and ordered (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 °Ag 2 Bi islands supported on Ag(111). This <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> of Bi was found to be energetically favorable based on ab initio total-energy calculations. At coverage above a critical value of 0. 55 monolayers, the Ag 2 Bi alloy phase gradually converts into an ordered Bi (p×√ 3) overlayer structure supported on Ag(111). We postulate that the dealloying transition is likely driven by compressive strain induced by incorporation of large-size Bi atoms into Ag at a high coverage and the subsequent lack of miscibility of Ag and Bi bulk phases. After completion of the dealloying process, Bi(110) thin films can be grown epitaxially on top of Ag(111) with a chemically abrupt interface. © 2011 American Physical Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{historian}} and socio 1 ogist, Ernest Troeltsch {{stated in the}} conclusion to his major work The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches (1912) that: The Ethos of the Gospel… is an ideal which requires a new world {{if it is to}} be fully realized… (it is) an ideal which cannot be realized within this world apart from compromise. Therefore the history of the Christian Ethos becomes the story of a constantly renewed search for this compromise. Troeltsch endeavoured through an historical survey to identify the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> to the social and cultural environment found necessary by a variety of religious movements. His categorization of 'Church', 'Sect' and 'Mysticism' was based on the response of their members' behaviour to the ‘world' as they perceived it, and the teaching of their religious leaders. Troeltsch identified the 'Church' as that type of organisation that compromised with the 'world' by affirming many of the social and cultural values in which it was encapsulated and by endeavouring to come to terms with these values. The 'sect', by contrast rejected both the world and compromise with it. It was hostile, but its existence and the values subscribed to by its members were largely dependent upon a symbiotic relation to that environment and it used its encapsulation to sustain its discrete identity. 'Mysticism', relied on an individual's religious spontaneity that was concerned with neither the encapsulating environment nor the symbiotic relation of' an organisation and its membership to the ‘world'. The Mystics’ concern was the inner world of man...|$|E
40|$|A Raman tribometer {{has been}} used to study third body {{processes}} and friction during sliding against two low friction coatings: annealed boron carbide and Mo-S-Pb, a MoS 2 -based coating. Reciprocating sliding tests were performed in either dry or humid air with transparent hemispheres (glass or sapphire) loaded against the coatings. Videos and Raman spectra of the sliding contact were recorded during the tests. For annealed boron carbide, friction was controlled by a mix of H 3 BO 3 and carbon; for amorphous Mo-S-Pb, friction was controlled by MoS 2 generated by sliding. Friction changes in the former were correlated to the relative amount of the two materials; in the latter, the rise in friction was ascribed to a change in interfacial shear strength of MoS 2, inferred from the deformation of transferred debris particles. For both coatings, interfacial sliding was the dominant <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> velocity <b>accommodation</b> in the sliding interface. 1...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of a {{government}} strategic decision in 1995, a new formation (the PI class) has emerged in Western Australian primary schools and its implementation is now set to accelerate across the state. Unlike multi-age groupings, PI is constructed when there are insufficient numbers of children to run straight pre-primary classes. School staff responsible for developing PI classes have raised a number of concerns. For example, the basis on which PI curriculum is to be built has yet to be promulgated. Also, a formal process for dealing with the ideological differences with respect to pre-primary and primary education has not been articulated. A further concern centres on the exculpation of the early childhood professional community from the decision in introduce PI. As educationists and the community look towards government and employers for guidance and direction, school staff are already involved in the task of constructing, implementing and evaluating PI classes. The stance that school staff adopt towards PI will be critical to its success or failure. This study investigates that stance in terms of the conceptual and behavioural position developed by school staff involved in PI. It does so from a symbolic interactionist perspective. Data for the study came predominantly from interviews with six principles, fifteen teachers and ten teacher-aids at three government and three independent primary schools. Further data was collected from classroom observations, informal conversations with school staff and document analysis. An analysis of this data identified self-interest and educational ideology as powerful influences on the way school staff defined PI. Different definitions of the PI situation led to the construction <b>of</b> different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> For example, a supportive stance was adopted when PI was seen to enhance staff self-interest and student learning; an oppositional stance predominated when PI was seen to impede staff self-interest and student learning. Overall, the findings of the study indicate that PI’s future success is conditional on the provision of educational leadership, appropriately trained staff, mechanisms for resolving philosophical differences, PI curriculum, guidelines, and quality support structures...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{shielding}} for planetary entry probes {{of future}} Jovian and Venusian missions will encounter heating levels well beyond those previously experienced. These entries are typically dominated by radiative heating {{from the shock}} layer. This paper demonstrates the potential of reflecting this incident radiation diffusely from an ablating material. This technique contrasts with the absorption experienced by char-forming or graphitic ablators. Two dielectric materials, Teflon (polytetra-fluoroethylene) and boron nitride, are examined for their ablative performance, including reflection, in a combined convective- and radiative-heating environment. For Teflon, at the conditions obtained, superimposition of radiative heating upon a convective stream causes no additional increase in surface recession over the convective only results. For boron nitride, an excellent room-temperature reflector in the visible spectrum, a decrease in reflectivity from 90 to 55 percent is experienced when the surface undergoes sublimation at high temperatures. The process of reflection {{in each of these}} materials is described in terms of backscattering from crystals.

40|$|In {{the face}} of a growing media storm in Australia that sensationalises the {{phenomenon}} of freedom camping through a divisive portrayal of its influence on regional and urban communities, we present a conceptual framework which we consider will aid investigation of our understandings of freedom camping as a form of ‘street life’ and contested use of public space. It is not unusual for local news to include sectoral-interest commentaries and debates about campers and camping impacts: Are they free-campers or simply freeloaders? In the void of any consistency across states and territories and unambiguous national policy to support local communities and government to effectively deal with the conflict that inevitably arises, we go against recent trends in policy discourse, which focus on governance and other ‘newer’ concepts, as we seek to bring the concept of power back to the centre of analyses of policy using freedom camping as the vehicle. As linkages and connections between conceptualisations and theories of power and tourism and leisure studies are unevenly developed, we wish to place constructs of power more firmly at the centre of the agenda of critical tourism research. We do not engage in a treatise of theories for studying power; rather what we present is a framework capable of encapsulating diverse approaches to studying power in the context of leisure and tourism public policy. Freedom camping in Australia refers to touring consumers who occupy, by deliberate choice, a vehicle as a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> in an open space that is not bound by market-based commercial norms and caravan park-based regulations. We acknowledge freedom camping is not a recent phenomenon, nor is it unique to Australia, though its prominence is raising the ire of civic leaders concerned for their respective leisure, policy, management and regulatory environments that support freedom and commercial camping practices...|$|E
40|$|Freedom camping is a {{practice}} whereby domestic or international travellers occupy by deliberate choice a recreational vehicle (RV) as a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{in an open}} space that is not bound by market-based commercial norms and camping and/or caravan park-based regulations. This thesis describes, critically analyses and explains the public-policy process concerning freedom camping in four Australian local government communities. Pragmatic and reflexive knowledge-making underpin this grounded multi-methods research. Perspectives of 41 local, state, national and international-level informants are critiqued. Their voices are interrogated against discipline specific literature including planning and policy, tourism, recreation and leisure, additional to threads of my own RVing experiences. The thesis presents four significant findings: First, there is market failure of freedom camping supply; second, the disjunct in scales of tourism policy expose the complexity of Federalism; third, community intervention is closing freedom camping policy and practice gaps; and finally, {{there is no clear}} or sequential emergence of planning approaches and policy models for tourism, recreation and leisure studies. Four major contributions are made to the fragmented RV and tourism policy-studies literature. First, an original taxonomy of caravanning aids international understanding of the “other” in RVing. Second, conceptualising the history of freedom camping since Federation (1900) identifies four legislative periods - enabling, constraining, acknowledging and facilitating/trialling – to reveal how camping supply and demand is shaped by societal influence. Third, the local government case study explains community engagement with freedom camping through reference to power relations, decision-making and public policy theory. Fourth, incremental amendment to an existing framework for the study of planning and policy in tourism, recreation and leisure acknowledges power as the fundamental root of policy studies. Returning power to the centre of analysis strengthens the model’s analytical power. To develop a formal theory, Glaser and Strauss (1967) suggest to start with a substantive one. Through a model this thesis delivers such an evolution in theory though it remains firmly rooted in praxis...|$|E
40|$|In current {{academic}} literature hostels have frequently {{been identified as}} the primary <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> for young budget travellers, most notably {{in the form of}} backpackers. Although typically identified as a rite de passage for many middle-class Westerners, a need to challenge contemporary backpacker typologies was identified as potential travellers from Eastern Europe, Russia, China and Southeast Asia had become increasingly mobilised. Research has focused predominantly outside of Europe and has centred mainly in three regions – India, Southeast Asia, and Australasia. This geographically ‘Eastern-centric’ research orientation has thus created a regional-based definition which has been used to describe a global phenomenon. Moreover, these typologies have also neglected the motivations of travellers from non-conventional demographic backgrounds and have frequently overlooked those visiting destinations which are deemed unconventional or non-exotic. Backpacker motivations have become heavily stereotyped and rigid, yet many academics have persisted in romanticising their behavioural performances, frequently portraying their journeys as highly mobile, fluid sojourns which are built upon strong desires to attain new cultural experiences and to immerse oneself into the unknown. Building upon the research of Hannam and Ateljevic (2007), Edensor (2007) and Muzaini (2006), this thesis challenges many fundamental definitions and explores the notion that many backpackers may indeed search for the banal as opposed to maintaining its avoidance. Moreover, the role of mobility, which has been neglected from a significant proportion of {{academic literature}} on backpackers, is critically observed in order to assess its significance and validity in the overall 6 experience of backpacking-orientated vacations. While backpackers are frequently identified as highly mobile travellers, the thesis critically examines this notion and suggests that many may be far less mobile than originally perceived. A multi-method qualitative study was developed and undertaken between April 2008 and September, 2009 which details the accounts and experiences of 59 interviewees and additionally documents the findings from several participant observations at a total of 24 different hostels in Southern and Western Norway. The findings of this thesis suggest that the hostel user is a highly versatile character who exhibits a wide spectrum of different motivations, many of which differ considerably from observations in more typical research settings. Moreover, the accounts of many hostel users reveal that mobility is an intrinsic feature to the overall experience of their holidays, while those exhibiting similar characteristics to the conventional backpacker typology frequently opted to perform in significantly different and more immobile ways. The thesis therefore represents a genuine contribution to knowledge on a subject which has often failed to escape an academic obsession with creating definitions and a need to oversimplify the large diversity of motivations used to characterise them.

40|$|Prominent Qing {{specialist}} Pamela Crossley of Dartmouth College has a {{new book}} coming out in February, The Wobbling Pivot, China Since 1800 : An Interpretive History, which is aimed at general readers and is designed to be suitable as well for classes devoted to modern Chinese history. One theme in the book that is likely to be of special interest to those who follow this blog is her frequent discussion of similarities and differences over time in patterns of unrest and the way that the state and its representatives respond to challenges from below. Focusing largely on tensions and <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> between central authorities and local communities, Crossley offers an intriguing new way of thinking about many of the big upheavals of the recent past, from the White Lotus Rebellion to the recent unrest in Tibet and Xinjiang. In this excerpt, however, which gives a good sense of the liveliness of the book’s prose as well as the kinds of subjects it addresses, we see how her approach {{can also be used to}} shed light on minor fracases of the sort that anyone who has spent time in China is likely to have witnessed at some point during their stay. It is unusual for the contents of a semi-confidential email to become universally known on the Internet. But in March of 2009, after the nomination of Charles W. Freeman Jr. as chair of the American government’s National Intelligence Council, his email to the ChinaSec listserv group of May 26, 2006 drew attention for this comment about the Tiananmen incidents of 1989 : “I find the dominant view in China about this very plausible, i. e. that the truly unforgivable mistake of the Chinese authorities was the failure to intervene on a timely basis to nip the demonstrations in the bud, rather than – as would have been both wise and efficacious – to intervene with force when all other measures had failed to restore domestic tranquility to Beijing and other major urban centers in China.

These structures have been studied using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, ab initio calculations and photoemission spectroscopy from core-levels and valence bands at room temperature. At 1 / 3 of a monolayer of Bi on Ag(111) leads to the formation of BiAg 2 surface alloy with a long range ordered (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ° superstructure. A detailed analysis of this structure using LEED I-V measurements together with DFT calculations is presented. The Bi atom is found to replace one top layer Ag atom in each unit cell, forming a substitutional BiAg 2 surface alloy. This <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> of Bi was found to be energetically favourable based on ab initio total-energy calculations. Based on photoemission spectroscopy we find the sp-derived Shockley surface state on Ag(111) is rapidly quenched upon deposition of Bi, due to the strong variation of inplane surface potential in the Ag 2 Bi surface alloy. The core levels of Bi 4 f of the (√ 3 ×√ 3) R 30 ° Ag 2 Bi alloy and Bi(110) thin film are shifted to lower binding energy by ~ 0. 6 eV and ~ 0. 3 eV compared with the Bi bulk value, respectively. Mechanisms inducing the core level shifts are discussed as due to a complex superposition of several factors. At coverage above a critical value of 0. 55 monolayers, the Ag 2 Bi alloy phase gradually converts into an ordered Bi (p × √ 3) overlayer structure supported on Ag(111). We postulate that the dealloying transition is likely driven by compressive strain induced by incorporation of large-size Bi atoms into Ag at a high coverage and the subsequent lack of miscibility of Ag and Bi bulk phases. After completion of the dealloying process, Bi(110) thin films can be grown epitaxially on top of Ag(111) with a chemically abrupt interface. The deposition of 1 / 3 of a monolayer of Pb on Ag(111) leads to the formation of Ag 2 Pb surface alloy with a long range ordered (√ 3 x√ 3) R 30 ° superstructure. A detailed analysis of this structure using LEED I-V and MEIS measurements together with DFT calculations is presented. Quasicrystals, materials with aperiodic long-range order, are usually formed by at least two elements with a specific chemical composition. In this study, we demonstrate that, a single element multilayer quasicrystal can be formed on a template. Using a hitherto unexplored quasicrystalline substrate, the icosahedral Ag-In-Yb quasicrystal, and various experimental techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy combined with theoretical calculations of adsorption energies, we identify the initial adsorption sites for Pb atoms on the substrate and hence deduce the multilayer structure of the Pb overlayer.

40|$|Several State Housing Authorities in Australia are {{currently}} examining models of devolved management and ownership of social housing stock and addressing reduced Commonwealth State Housing Agreement funding (or {{have already done}} so).

In this article we illustrate a framework for analysing these changes by focusing on the transfer of some 86 000 properties from the Glasgow City Council to the Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) in 2003 and also provide an interpretation of how the restructuring of social housing in the UK reflects the political economy of property rights, and the governance and incentive structure through which the restructuring of advanced economies is implemented. We conclude by briefly drawing implications from the British case for Australia. The analysis is conducted in a new institutional tradition that assesses property rights and the provision of social housing, and associated policy goals, under comparative institutional arrangements or governance structures. We argue that stock transfer in essence is a policy of delineating ownership of different attributes of the housing stock and that such a delineation is crucial to the functioning of the emerging governance structure and the ability of stakeholders to extract value from ownership. We draw on a series of interviews conducted by the authors as part of research into the 2003 GHA transfer. These interviews were conducted with policy makers and politicians (past and present), the regulator in Scotland, GHA staff and representatives of the community-based housing association sector in Glasgow...|$|R

Kinetic constants of CMY- 2 and CMY- 30 against the latter substrates {{suggested that the}} improved efficiency of the Gly 211 variant was due {{to an increase in}} k(cat). The structural basis of the increased turn-over rates of oxyimino-cephalosporins caused by Val 211 Gly was studied using 5 ns molecular dynamics simulations of CMY- 2 and CMY- 30 in their free forms and in covalent complexes with ceftazidime (acylenzyme) as well as a boronic acid analogue of ceftazidime (deacylation transition state). Analysis of thermal factors indicated that Val 211 Gly increased the flexibility of the Omega-loop/H 7 -helix and the Q 120 -loop formed by amino acids 112 - 125, and also altered the vibrations of the H 10 -helix/R 2 -loop. Structural elements containing the catalytic residues remained relatively rigid except Tyr 150 in acyl-enzyme species. Regions exhibiting altered flexibility due to the substitution appear to move in a concerted manner in both enzymes. This movement was more intense in CMY- 30 and also at directions different to those observed for CMY- 2. Additionally, it appeared that the Val 211 Gly increased the available space for the <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> the R 1 side chain of ceftazidime. These findings are likely associated with the significantly increased vibrations of the bound compounds observed in CMY- 30 complexes.

One study found the approach used by school administrators to address accommodations influences student perceptions <b>of</b> test <b>accommodations</b> (Rickey 2005). Rickey (2005) studied three different middle schools, interviewing a variety of stakeholders. In schools where administrators frequently justified the use <b>of</b> <b>accommodations,</b> students reported positive perceptions <b>of</b> <b>accommodations.</b> When administrators showed more ambivalence, student opinion followed (Rickey 2005).|$|R

The model <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{is referred to as the}} Host Home care model <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and was designed in a collaborative manner with a person-centred focus. While five face-to-face interviews were conducted, this paper focuses on the interview with Opal, the young woman with an intellectual disability. The remaining four interviews were with Opal’s parents and two staff members from the disability-specific organisation that auspiced an individual funding package that supported the Host Home care model <b>of</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Themes that arose from the data analysis identified characteristics of the Host Home model <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> from Opal’s perspective.

40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{studied the}} {{accuracy}} and precision of 32 objective wavefront methods for finding the amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> obtained in 180 eyes. MethodsOcular accommodation was stimulated with 0. 5 D steps in target vergence spanning the full range <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> for each subject. Subjective monocular amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> was measured using two clinical methods, using negative lenses and with a custom Badal optometer. ResultsBoth subjective methods gave similar results. Results obtained from the Badal optometer where {{used to test the}} accuracy of the objective methods. All objective methods showed lower amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> that the subjective ones by an amount that varied from 0. 2 to 1. 1 D depending on the method. The precision in this prediction also varied between subjects, with an average standard error of the mean of 0. 1 D that decreased with age. ConclusionsDepth of field increases subjective <b>of</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> overestimating the objective amplitude obtained with all the metrics used.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Accommodation</b> and {{breakdown}} <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{are important}} elements of information processing in nerve fibers, as they determine how nerve fibers react to natural slowly changing stimuli or electrical stimulation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and that breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Annually, over 75 million {{international}} passengers {{travel to}} tropical areas, more than 20 million of whom come from industrialized countries. They experience {{a high rate}} of traveler's diarrhea (TD), varying from 20 to 56 %, which may result in serious limitations to their activities. The cause of TD is considered to be infectious in the overwhelming majority of cases and, apart from differences in relative importance, the list of responsible microbial agents is fairly constant regardless of geographic origin. The ingestion of contaminated food or water is considered to be the principal <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> transmission of the enteric pathogens of TD. Several factors have been proposed as playing a role in the etiogenesis of diarrhea in travelers, including personal (age, socioeconomic status, body weight, preexisting gastrointestinal illnesses), behavioral (<b>mode</b> <b>of</b> travel, standard <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> eating in public places, dietary errors) and travel-related (destination, duration of stay, country of origin, season) factors, which are reviewed in detail...|$|R
