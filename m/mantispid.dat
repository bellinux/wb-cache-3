25|$|For {{the most}} part the femur and tibia are the longest leg {{segments}} but variations in the lengths and robustness of each segment relate to their functions. For example, gressorial and cursorial, or walking and running type insects respectively, usually have well-developed femora and tibiae on all legs, whereas jumping (saltatorial) insects such as grasshoppers have disproportionately developed metafemora and metatibiae. In aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) and bugs (Hemiptera), the tibiae and/or tarsi of one or more pairs of legs usually are modified for swimming (natatorial) with fringes of long, slender hairs. Many ground-dwelling insects, such as mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae), nymphal cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), and scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), have the tibiae of the forelegs (protibiae) enlarged and modified for digging (fossorial), whereas the forelegs of some predatory insects, such as <b>mantispid</b> lacewings (Neuroptera) and mantids (Mantodea), are specialized for seizing prey, or raptorial. The tibia and basal tarsomere of each hindleg of honey bees are modified for the collection and carriage of pollen.|$|E
40|$|Brauer (1855) was {{the first}} who showed the {{drawings}} of the egg and the first instar larva of the Mantispidae and the species concerned was Mantispapagana Fabricius. In 1869, he further exposed every fact of its life history. Since then, observations on the eggs of this family {{have been made by}} Smith (1934), Hoffmann (1936) and Hungerford (1936). The last mentioned author succeeded in taking the photogra,ph of the larva (1936). In 1953, Peterson described and illustrated the larva of Itl interrupta Say, but he confused antennae with labial palpi. The number of eggs deposited by a female <b>Mantispid</b> varies with the species. For example, Hungerford (1936) gave the figures of 3, 464 to 8, 385 eggs in the case of M. interrupta, while Hoffmann (1936) showed 1, 028 eggs laid by a female of ClimacieZZa brunnea var. occidentaZis Banks. In Japan Nawa (1902) first gave the picture of the <b>Mantispid</b> eggs and the species concerned was Eumantispa harmandi Navas. In the next year, he illustrated the first instar larva of the same species, but his drawing was in-complete. According to Nawa, the eggs then laid were amounted to 5, 600 and the incubation period lasted for about two weeks. In 1949, Esaki published the description and figure of the eggs of Mantispa japonica MacLachlan and re-corded the number of eggs laid as 908 and 338 and the duration of egg period as 10 days. The following table gives the incubation periods extracted from the above-mentioned sources. Unfortunately, however, I have found no literature giving a detailed mor-phological observation on the first instar larva of the Mantispidae. Since the year 1953, I have been engaged in making observations on the Mantispidae on Mt. Hikosan. This is my first report on the eggs and first instar larvae of th...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Egg sacs of 25 {{species of}} spiders in 14 {{families}} {{were found to}} contain immatures of Mantispa viridis in northwestern South Carolina, bringing the total spider taxa associated with this species to at least 2 9 species in 15 families. Thirty-one of the 124 M. viridis infested egg sacs had two or more mantispids in them. However, only three of these sacs produced two or more adult mantispids, with two sacs producing two adult s each and the third sac producing four adults. Larvae of Mantispa viridis Walker, {{a member of the}} <b>mantispid</b> subfamily Mantispinae, ar e predators of spider eggs. First instars ofM. viridis locate spider egg sacs and penetrate through th e surrounding silk {{to gain access to the}} eggs, where-upon they develop through two additional an d relatively immobile instars prior to pupatio n within the sac (Richardson 1976; Redborg & MacLeod 1985). Ten species of spiders in th...|$|E
50|$|First-instar <b>mantispids</b> use two {{strategies}} to locate spider eggs: larvae may burrow directly through the silk of egg sacs they find, {{or they may}} board and be carried by female spiders prior to sac production (phoresy), entering the sac as it is being constructed. <b>Mantispids</b> that board spiders usually adopt positions {{on or near the}} pedicel; some species may enter the spider's book lungs. Larvae maintain themselves aboard spiders by feeding on spider hemolymph. Transfers of larvae from spider to spider are possible during spider mating or cannibalism. All of the major groups of hunting spiders are attacked by spider-boarding mantispids; the egg sacs of web-building species are also entered by egg-sac penetrators.|$|R
50|$|Mantispidae, known {{commonly}} as mantidflies, <b>mantispids,</b> mantid lacewings or mantis-flies, is {{a family}} of small to moderate-sized insects in the order Neuroptera. There are many genera with around 400 species worldwide, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Only 5 species of Mantispa occur in Europe.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} imitators of P. raphigastra. The Stratiomyid fly may {{successfully}} fly along {{with members of}} Polybioides. There are also <b>Mantispids</b> with the same general body constitution and coloration as P. raphigastra. Polistes meadeanus, also known as Polybia andrei and Polybio shelfordi mimicks Polybioides so effectively that even experienced hymenopterists may fail to recognize they are of the genus Polistes.|$|R
40|$|The {{natural history}} and {{intraspecific}} interactions of Servaea incana, a common jumping spider of temperate Australia, are described. S. incana inhabits the trunks of eucalypt trees, where it builds silken retreats and nests under loose bark. Like other jumping spiders, S. incana males use elaborate visual displays (Type I courtship) when they encounter females in the open. Male jumping spiders usually rely on silk-borne vibrations to communicate with females residing within retreats and nests (Type II courtship). S. incana often uses visual displays in this context, because the thin silken walls allow conspecifics to see each other. Adult males that encounter subadult females at retreats sometimes build their own retreat nearby and cohabit until the subadult female moults to maturity, copulating shortly afterwards. Adult females and immature stages of both sexes possess similar display repertoires that contain fewer display elements than the repertoire of males. We {{found no evidence that}} visual displays of S. incana contain seismic elements, in contrast to some of its closest relatives. S. incana preys upon a variety of small arthropods and, unusually amongst salticids, ants make up {{a large portion of the}} diet. Identified enemies of S. incana include spiders, a pompilid wasp and a <b>mantispid.</b> 20 page(s...|$|E

Some more specialized groups are more intimately associated with Polistes; this includes strepsipterans {{in the family}} Stylopidae (genus Xenos), wasps of the genus Elasmus (formerly placed in their own family, [...] "Elasmidae"), and wasps in the family Trigonalidae.|$|R

When ants are placed on eg g sacs females attack, relocate the sac, or cut attachment lines so that the sac hangs from a minima l number of threads.
