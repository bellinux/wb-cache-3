5|$|In 1932, Pflueger renovated the Nasser brother's New Mission Theater, {{bringing}} Art Deco stylings to {{the lobby}} {{in contrast to the}} Spanish Mission trimmings in the <b>main</b> <b>auditorium.</b> In 1993, the theater closed. The theater, now designated San Francisco Landmark No. 245, was purchased by Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas and completely renovated to its original splendor, opening its doors once again to patrons in December 2015. Pflueger simultaneously worked on the remodeling of the Nasser's New Fillmore Theater, a sister design similar in many respects. The New Fillmore closed in 1957 and was demolished to make way for an urban redevelopment project.|$|E

The façade, foyer and auditorium were designed by Edward Barry, and date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive £178 million reconstruction in the 1990s. The <b>main</b> <b>auditorium</b> is a Grade 1 listed building. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, previously {{a part of the}} old Covent Garden Market, created a large new public gathering place. In 1779 the pavement outside the playhouse was the scene of the murder of Martha Ray, mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, by her admirer the Rev. James Hackman.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} for a {{flexible}} theatre complex, where up to ten areas are available for performance. Tom Morris has cited as inspiration the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. The <b>main</b> <b>auditorium</b> gained an optional thrust stage, {{and an increase in}} seating to 540. The Side Stage area was redeveloped, with additional capacity of 250, creating the option of a separate second auditorium. Other spaces redeveloped as performance areas included the Paint Shop and the rehearsal room. The Theatre Royal re-opened in September 2012, with Wild Oats. Further work (mainly {{in the area of the}} foyer) is planned for the refurbishment's next phase, to be completed in 2016, to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the theatre opening.|$|E

25|$|The inner {{decoration}} of the <b>main</b> <b>auditorium</b> was completely modified in 1933 according to principles of New Objectivity.

25|$|The second {{hall was}} closed for remodelling in 1935, as it was {{difficult}} for all of the audience to see the orchestra performing. It re-opened the following December.

On 5 February 1945, a discarded cigarette started a large fire that burned down the hall for a second time. The organ was destroyed, and the <b>main</b> <b>auditorium</b> was reduced to pieces of charred wood and hot metal.|$|E
