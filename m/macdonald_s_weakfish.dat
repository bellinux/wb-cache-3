40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} adult high (or other-world) fantasy of two pioneers in the genre: George MacDonald, who enjoys some {{reputation}} still, and David Lindsay, whose fame has remained very limited. Lindsay acknowledged MacDonald as his greatest literary influence; focusing on <b>MacDonald</b> <b>s</b> "Phantastes" and Lindsay s "A Voyage to Arcturus", this thesis tries to identify formal and thematic parallels {{which may be}} due to that influence. The parallels are summed up in the term dream-quests, which draws attention to a number of characteristics that make the works resemble dreams, and to the quest for truth and an otherworldly ideal that the works share. The thesis looks to George <b>MacDonald</b> <b>s</b> poetic beliefs for the rationale behind this kind of fantasy, arguing that Phantastes was intended as a dramatisation of his views on the nature and role of the imagination and of symbolism. Lindsay, it is argued, fell heir to the theory and practice of such fantastic dream-quests, though he adapted it to fit a set of spiritual teachings that are in some respects very different from <b>MacDonald</b> <b>s...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Dictyostelium discoideum, a {{multicellular}} organism {{stems from}} individual amoebae {{in response to}} nutrient depletion. Despite the vastly different strategy used to generate multicellular structures, processes associated with animal development including cell sorting, pattern formation and cell-type choice are mirrored to a remarkable degree {{in the development of}} Dictyostelium. Morphogenesis ultimately leads to the formation of a fruiting body composed of dormant spores mounted on a rigid stalk of dead cells. The simplicity of this dichotomous choice makes Dictyostelium a model system for the study of pattern formation in developing organisms. Several lines of evidence suggest that cell-type biases are directly linked to the cell cycle. Cells starved early in the cell cycle preferentially become the stalk cells while those starved in later phases of the cell cycle favour the spore pathway [Weijer, C., Duschl, G., David, C. N. (1984) J. Cell Sci., 70, 133 - 145; <b>MacDonald,</b> <b>S.</b> A., Durston, A. J. (1984) J. Cell Sci., 66, 195 - 204; Gomer, R. H., Firtel, R. A.

The underlying mechanism linking the cell cycle to cellular differentiation is unclear.
