500|$|John de Lancie {{deliberately}} {{missed his}} first audition for Q {{as he was}} appearing as a lead in a play at the time. A second audition was arranged during lunchtime {{so that he could}} attend. He later said that after he auditioned, [...] "a big guy walked out, put his hands on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> said, 'You make my words sound better than they are.' I said, 'Well, you must be the writer.' And he said, 'I'm Gene Roddenberry.' I had absolutely no idea who that was." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in A Moveable Feast, Hemingway remembered [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", recalling when he [...] "sat in {{a corner}} with the {{afternoon}} light coming in over <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> wrote in the notebook.... When I stopped writing I {{did not want to}} leave the river where I could see the trout in the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. The story was about coming back from the war but {{there was no mention of}} the war in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reports {{conflict}} {{about who}} shot first, {{but after two}} members of the mob approached the house, someone opened fire. Sarah Carrier was shot in the head. Her nine-year-old niece at the house, Minnie Lee Langley, had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier. When Langley heard someone had been shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier. Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door, using the closet for cover: [...] "He got behind me in the wood , and he put the gun on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> them crackers was still shooting and going on. He put his gun on my shoulder... told me to lean this way, and then Poly Wilkerson, he kicked the door down. When he kicked the door down, Cuz' Syl let him have it." ...|$|E
60|$|I shrugged <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> {{remarked that}} it was no {{business}} of mine.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid her}} gentle hands upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> looked calmly in my face.|$|R
60|$|She put {{her hands}} on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> drew me down to kiss her.|$|R
500|$|Bennett {{had been}} at first {{slightly}} in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett's friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication {{a few weeks later}} with his Fantasie, Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett's music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, praising amongst other works Bennett's Op. 10 Musical Sketches for piano, [...] "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The essay ends: [...] "For some time now he has been peering over <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> for the second time he has asked 'But what are you writing?' Dear friend, I shall write no more than: 'If only you knew!'" [...] Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought [...] "rather too eccentric".|$|E
500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated <b>my</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>And</b> it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When I got back, it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{must have}} been when I was about 19 or 20 and went out {{training}} with a friend on the Belgian borders. As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> {{he gave me a}} half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
60|$|WYATT. I fear {{you come}} to carry it off <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>And</b> sonnet-making's safer.|$|R

60|$|I shrugged <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> {{we stood}} {{for a little while}} looking down on the shining {{crescent}} of the Rhine.|$|R

60|$|More I {{would have}} said, {{but at that}} {{juncture}} the lash of the coachman's whip curled itself about <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> stung me vilely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] assented the old man; [...] "lay your load upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> {{take off}} <b>my</b> parcel, putting it upon your own back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Smith, {{can you not}} {{guess so}} simple a thing?" [...] said Edra, placing her white hands on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> smiling {{straight}} into my face.|$|R
60|$|Her {{hands were}} clasped upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> her chin rested on them, and {{her blue eyes}} looked quietly into mine.|$|E
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> gave me a slight turn, {{pointing}} with his other arm at the same time.|$|E
60|$|She winced. Then {{abruptly}} {{she was on}} {{her knees}} before me, with her hands upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> her eyes meeting mine.|$|E
60|$|So Fate having {{issued its}} decree, of which Hans's version was that Zikali, or his Great Medicine, had so {{arranged}} things, I shrugged <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> waited.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Rawjester {{deliberately}} {{turned his}} back upon me and remained silent for twenty minutes. I drew my shawl the more closely around <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> closed <b>my</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|What Dick's welcome was I did not hear, but {{judging from}} the grip he put on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> then on <b>my</b> hands, {{he was glad to}} see me.|$|R
60|$|Stanley {{laid his}} hand upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> his touch was inexpressibly soothing. I felt light and happy, {{in spite of}} all.|$|E
60|$|She flung herself upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> {{clung to}} me, and began again to wish her {{daughter}} lying dead at our feet.|$|E
60|$|As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street, I felt {{a hand on}} <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> a rough voice which I knew well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, in {{that case}} we would all fall together," [...] {{returned}} the Ork. [...] "Get aboard, little girl; sit across <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> put both your arms around my neck." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{looked more}} and more like lunacy. However, there was nothing for it but to submit. I shrugged <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> sat down in the arm-chair beside the empty fireplace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pull away my old hood {{that lies}} there on <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> let me tie my pretty dress with this fine belt," [...] said Bud, feeling {{something}} on her back.|$|R
60|$|At our {{entrance}} {{the conversation}} ceased for a moment. Mr. Ravenor laid his hand upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> turned towards the little group.|$|E
60|$|She didn't {{seem to hear}} me: she put {{her hand}} on <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> kept me where I was, sitting by her side.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Harrison {{probably}} guessed {{what was}} passing in my mind, for {{he placed a}} kindly hand upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> said, with a smile:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have brought}} {{me the best}} news I have ever heard, sir; you cannot tell what a weight you have lifted from <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> how I feel indebted to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am. Everything {{is fixed}} up; the bother of {{collecting}} supplies and getting porters {{has been taken}} off <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> all I {{have to do is}} to get along as quickly as possible.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have walked}} from Mellborough?" [...] he asked. Then {{something}} in my face seemed to strike him, and, leaning forward, he placed his hands upon <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> turned towards {{the glow of the}} fire.|$|R
