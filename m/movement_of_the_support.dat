40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{determine}} if the elbow joint instability and translatory movements during elbow flexion lead to significant errors in elbow angle perception. The matching elbow was fixed on a rocking platform of two different heights so that the elbow flexion was associated with tilting <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> and the angle/torque relation-ship changed depending on the height of the platform. The matching on any of the rocking supports did not cause an over-flexion constant error but it did increase the error variance, especially in the high rocking support condition. An adaptation to the rocking support condition was revealed by an after-effect resulting in an overestimation of the reference angle in the final testing on a rigid support. It is concluded that the elbow angle percep-tion is modified as a result of adaptation to the rocking support, which is associated with recalibration of position sense during the experimental session. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the estimation of the elbow joint angle depends on the internal representation of the arm’s dynamics...|$|E

Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is considered to contribute to control of the trunk. This study investigated the contribution of IAP to the postural response to multidirection support-surface translation. IAP was recorded with a thin-film pressure transducer inserted via the nose into the stomach and trunk motion was recorded with an optoelectronic system with markers over the spinous process of L 1. A pattern of trunk movement was recorded {{in response to the}} support-surface translations that was consistent with a 2 ̆ 7 hip 2 ̆ 7 strategy of postural control. The trunk moved in a manner appropriate to move the centre of gravity over the new base of support. IAP was increased with movement in each direction, but varied in timing and amplitude between translation directions. In general, the IAP was greater with translations in the sagittal plane compared to the frontal plane and was initiated earlier for translations in the backward direction. These data indicate that IAP contributes to the postural response associated with support-surface translation and suggest that this is consistent with stiffening the spine. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{reducing}} the dynamic loading of the support unit and the immediate roof rocks resulting from the successive operation of the safety valve during operation of the props in the regime of «equal resistance» is considered. In the developed working characteristic of hydraulic props of supporting units their overload protection is singled out into an independent function and is separated from the function of rock pressure control. The resistance of the hydraulic props of the support units to the roof rocks subsidence is regulated in a non-pulsed manner, and the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> units {{can be carried out}} in a «non-unloading» mode. As a result, the static «trampling» of the intermediate roof is reduced, and in the regime of controlling the rock pressure, the dynamic impacts of the mechanized support on the intermediate roof are excluded. In this case, the protection of the support unit from overloads works only when the support is overloaded and does not directly participate {{in the formation of the}} process of rock pressure rock. The proposed non-pulse method provides controlled transmission of hydraulic energy with a small pressure drop from the head ends of the hydraulic props to the pressure line of the hydraulic system of the heading mechanized complex and its subsequent useful use...|$|E
40|$|A {{concept has}} been {{developed}} where characteristic load cycles of longwall shields can describe most {{of the interaction between}} a longwall support and the roof. A characteristic load cycle is the change in support pressure with time from setting the support against the roof to the next release and <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support.</b> The concept has been validated through the back-analysis of more than 500 000 individual load cycles in five longwall panels at four mines and seven geotechnical domains. The validation process depended upon the development of new software capable of both handling the large quantity of data emanating from a modern longwall and accurately delineating load cycles. Existing software was found not to be capable of delineating load cycles to a sufficient accuracy. Load-cycle analysis can now be used quantitatively to assess the adequacy of support capacity and the appropriateness of set pressure for the conditions under which a longwall is being operated. When linked to a description of geotechnical conditions, this has allowed the development of a database for support selection for greenfield sites. For existing sites, the load-cycle characteristic concept allows for a diagnosis of strata-support problem areas, enabling changes to be made to set pressure and mining strategies to manage better, or avoid, strata control problems. With further development of the software, there is the prospect of developing a system that is able to respond to changes in strata-support interaction in real time...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{a series}} of back-analyses of the {{interaction}} between longwall shields and strata at a number of mines are presented. The purpose of these back-analyses was to quantify the impact of cover depth and panel width on shield performance. Recently developed shield load cycle analysis theories were used to quantify the interaction between shields and strata. A load cycle is the change in support pressure with time from the initial setting of the shield against the roof until the subsequent release and <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support,</b> which typically corresponds to a single shear. Historical shield pressure data from five longwall mines in Australia and Europe were back-analysed, together with strata delay data for the longwall faces. An assessment of the geology of the near-seam overburden was also made for each site. The longwall panels incorporated cover depths ranging from 50 to 770 m and panel widths ranging between 168 to 319 m. Use was made of {{a modified version of the}} longwall visual analysis (LVA) software that was specifically extended for this project and provided maps of the critical load cycle parameters implicit to the utilised analysis methodology. The major extension of the software involved presenting the outputs on the basis of individual load cycles for every shield as opposed to a time or chainage basis, thus allowing load cycle analysis to be carried out. In total about 6. 5 km of longwall retreat and over 2 000 000 individual load cycles were back-analysed. Together with the strata delay and geological data, this enabled the effects of panel width and cover depth to be quantified within the range of the data...|$|E

Closed-loop frequency response functions were calculated for visual stimulus to EMG and visual stimulus to body sway angle. The open loop frequency response function for the plant was determined by dividing the frequency response functions, mathematically canceling the effects of feedback.

Phase for the stationary condition was lower at the higher stimulus driving frequencies than for any of the moving platform conditions. In contrast, trunk segment gains were lower for the sway-referenced conditions at lower stimulus frequencies than for the stationary and sum-of-sines conditions. Phase showed a slight lead of the legs over the trunk for the sway-referenced conditions. The phase relationship between the trunk and leg segments, typically in-phase below ~ 1 Hz and anti-phase above ~ 1 Hz, showed a gradual transition at a lower frequency for the sway-referenced conditions than for the stationary or sum-of-sines conditions.

40|$|A proven way of {{interpreting}} the shield leg pressure sensor data within each shield load cycle {{has been developed}} by the authors {{and this has been}} encapsulated into real time and non real time software. A load cycle is the change in support pressure with time from setting the support against the roof to the next release and <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support.</b> It is now possible to automatically identify when a shield has too low a set pressure, and when a shield is faulty and/or has an inadequate capacity for the conditions. It has been found that once set conditions deteriorate and shields are set manually it is very common for set pressures to be too low for the conditions, resulting in roof control problems. The software can automatically identify set pressures that are too low which will enable auditing of shield operation and corrections to be made. Up to 10 % of shield legs have faults on a typical Australian longwall and these periodically result in localised roof control problems. Faulty support components are automatically identified, enabling timely repairs to be made. On some longwalls the shields become overloaded {{at the peak of the}} periodic weighting cycle and the software can identify the difference between a heavily loaded support and one that is overloaded. By minimising the cycle time and making sure that set pressures are adequate in cycles following the overloading event, it is quite possible to successfully mine through an overloading event if the event is correctly identified. The use of this software has the potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate roof control problems on a longwall face with significant benefits to both productivity and safety. By automatically identifying potential causes of roof control problems and offering solutions, the software has the potential to aid longwall automation. A Beta test version of the real time software has been successfully working at BMA’s Broadmeadow Mine for some time and several mines have benefited from expert off-line analyses using the software. The software can also be used to isolate the many interconnected factors affecting roof control on a longwall face, which will enable their quantification and is therefore a powerful research tool...|$|E
40|$|The neural {{processes}} that mediate human spatial orientation and adaptive changes occurring {{in response to}} the sensory rearrangement encountered during orbital flight are primarily studied through second and third order responses. In the Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project (EDOMP) neuroscience investigations, the following were measured: (1) eye movements during acquisition of either static or moving visual targets, (2) postural and locomotor responses provoked by unexpected <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>support</b> surface, changes in the interaction of visual, proprioceptive, and vestibular information, changes in the major postural muscles via descending pathways, or changes in locomotor pathways, and (3) verbal reports of perceived self-orientation and self-motion which enhance and complement conclusions drawn from the analysis of oculomotor, postural, and locomotor responses. In spaceflight operations, spatial orientation can be defined as situational awareness, where crew member perception of attitude, position, or motion of the spacecraft or other objects in three-dimensional space, including orientation of one's own body, is congruent with actual physical events. Perception of spatial orientation is determined by integrating information from several sensory modalities. This involves higher levels of processing within the central nervous system that control eye movements, locomotion, and stable posture. Spaceflight operational problems occur when responses to the incorrectly perceived spatial orientation are compensatory in nature. Neuroscience investigations were conducted in conjunction with U. S. Space Shuttle flights to evaluate possible changes in the ability of an astronaut to land the Shuttle or effectively perform an emergency post-landing egress following microgravity adaptation during space flights of variable length. While the results of various sensory motor and spatial orientation tests could have an impact on future space flights, our knowledge of sensorimotor adaptation to spaceflight is limited, and the future application of effective countermeasures depends, in large part, on the results from appropriate neuroscience investigations. Therefore, the objective of the neuroscience investigations could {{have a negative effect on}} mission success. The Neuroscience Laboratory, Johnson Space Center (JSC), implemented three integrated Detailed Supplementary Objectives (DSO) designed to investigate spatial orientation and the associated compensatory responses as a part of the EDOMP. The four primary goals were (1) to establish a normative database of vestibular and associated sensory changes in response to spaceflight, (2) to determine the underlying etiology of neurovestibular and sensory motor changes associated with exposure to microgravity and the subsequent return to Earth, (3) to provide immediate feedback to spaceflight crews regarding potential countermeasures that could improve performance and safety during and after flight, and (4) to take under consideration appropriate designs for preflight, in-flight, and postflight countermeasures that could be implemented for future flights...|$|E

The most well-known were introduced by Heyman: a “static factor of safety ” (or load factor) assessing how vulnerable the structure is to increases in the living loads and a “geometrical factor of safety ” assessing how critical <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure is for its stability. In non seismic areas, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main risks <b>of</b> total or partial collapse of arches and vaults is excessive displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supports</b> (following walls or soil deformation). Limit analysis technique {{can be used to}} analyse this risk, quantifying movements permitted before collapse and evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thrust on <b>the</b> <b>supports.</b> This analysis can be combined with pathological investigations and displacement monitoring to study <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk and define a “kinematic factor of safety”. A software program was developed (a) to compute domains of stability for particular mechanisms of deformation, (b) to study possibility of transitions between mechanisms during deformation and (c) to interactively study <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supports</b> on thrust and stability. Scaled physical models are used to validate the limit analysis approach, using an experimental rig where horizontal and vertical displacements are controlled by computer. A high-speed camera is used to study transition between mechanisms. Finally it is referred to techniques integrating this kinematic approach into a more general probabilistic approach, taking into account various uncertainties in the structure (shape, thickness, loads, movements) ...|$|R
