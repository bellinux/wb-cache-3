This will curb revenue loss, prevent double non-taxation and streamline the flow of investments. In order to provide certainty to investors, investments in shares made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause as per 2005 Protocol. Further, a two-year transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019 has been provided during which capital gains on shares will be taxed in source country at half of normal tax rate, subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause. The Third Protocol also inserts provisions to facilitate relieving of economic double taxation in transfer pricing cases. This is a taxpayer friendly measure and {{is in line with}} India’s commitments under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to meet the minimum standard of providing <b>Mutual</b> <b>Agreement</b> <b>Procedure</b> (MAP) access in transfer pricing cases.

40|$|Ömsesidiga överenskommelser (eng. <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>procedures)</b> återfinns huvudsakligen i artikel 25 OECD:s modellavtal. Syftet med sådana överenskommelser är att undvika internationell dubbelbeskattning. Överenskommelserna kan antingen utgöra ett rättsmedel, som är ett alternativ till domstolsförfarande, eller verka som ett medel för att få skatteavtalen att fungera bättre mellan de avtalsslutande staterna. De rättsliga svårigheter som uppkommer i samband med överenskommelserna beror huvudsakligen på att överenskommelserna utgör en internationellt, av OECD, konstruerad företeelse som ska anpassas till och tillämpas på ett nationellt, redan befintligt regelsystem. Det kan härmed uppkomma spänningar och motsättningar mellan olika bestämmelser. Det övergripande syftet med denna studie är att kartlägga och utvärdera en internationellt konstruerad företeelse, dvs. ömsesidiga överenskommelser, för att undersöka om ändamålet med sådana överenskommelser uppfylls inom ramen för det svenska regelsystemet. Studien företas inom rättsområdet internationell skatterätt, men har emellertid en interdisciplinär ansats. Härav analyseras även bestämmelser inom folkrätt, konstitutionell rätt, förvaltningsprocessrätt, allmän förvaltningsrätt och sekretess. The {{focal point}} {{of this study is}} <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>procedures,</b> which are found in tax treaties, and derived from Art. 25 OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD MTC). The overall purpose of the <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements</b> is to avoid {{international}} double taxation. The agreements can either constitute an alternative to court proceedings, or constitute a means for improving the functioning of tax treaties. Provisions regarding <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements</b> can be found, in various forms, in all Swedish tax treaties. Since Sweden is a dualistic state tax treaties are incorporated into the Swedish legal system by legislation. This means that the provisions regarding <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements</b> are incorporated into Swedish legislation. Legal difficulties that arise regarding the agreements are mainly {{due to the fact that}} <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>procedures</b> constitute an internationally, by the OECD, constructed phenomenon, which is to be applied on a nationally, already existing, legal system. It may hereby occur tensions and conflicts between different provisions. The overall aim of this study is to identify and evaluate <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements</b> from a Swedish perspective. This includes identifying a relatively unexplored area, i. e. <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements</b> and their place within the Swedish legal system. In order to meet the overall objective, three research tasks are formulated. First, which internal provisions apply to <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements,</b> and how are they to be applied? Secondly, it is examined if the Swedish legal system, regarding <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements,</b> is consistent from three evaluation criteria: the constitutional principles of separation of powers and legal competence, legal certainty aspects, and the provisions of the Vienna Convention of the Law on treaties (VCLT). If there are any inconsistences in the legal system, may these be solved? Thirdly, it is studied if the Swedish legal system, regarding <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements,</b> provides for fulfillment of the purpose of <b>mutual</b> <b>agreements</b> or if there are any legal obstacles to this. The thesis is carried out in the field of tax law. However, the study has an interdisciplinary approach, which means that aspects of other areas of law are considered, such as international law, constitutional law, administrative judicial procedural law, administrative law, and secrecy...|$|R
40|$|I was {{previously}} Director of <b>Mutual</b> <b>Agreement</b> <b>Procedures,</b> National Tax Agency ('NTA'), in Japan. This paper was written during my stay at Columbia University as senior visiting research scholar. I {{hope that this}} paper will lead to further discussion of practical aspects of Transfer Pricing Methodologies for Bilateral Advance Pricing Arrangements. The opinions expressed herein are my personal views {{and do not necessarily}} reflect organizational or state positions. It is desirable for multinational enterprises to minimize the risk of economic double taxation arising as a result of transfer pricing adjustments. Such economic double taxation should be, if at all possible, addressed under the condition of rational income allocation between countries. For this purpose we need practicable transfer pricing methodologies. Furthermore, it is better if we have an efficient bilateral framework in which to settle transfer pricing disputes. There is some possibility that Bilateral Advance Pricing Arrangements ('BAPA'), where Transfer Pricing Methodologies ('TPMs') are mainly based on profit methods, can be a reliable way of resolving these disputes. Looking to the past, actual results of BAPA between Japan and the United States may be viewed as a successful model whereby tax authorities have reached agreement in a considerable number of cases of various types related to both inbound and outbound transactions. In this paper, which is intended to be highly supportive of the BAPA, I enumerate the practical points at issue, after taking note of world currents in transfer pricing taxation. I also express some important items for development of the BAPA...|$|R
40|$|I {{analyze the}} {{arbitration}} {{clause of the}} new Japan-Netherlands tax treaty, {{which is the first}} instance for Japan to adopt an arbitration clause in its tax treaties. Disputes arising from tax treaties are typically settled through a <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>procedure.</b> Even so, the history of tax treaty arbitration is not new, the first being the Ireland-UK tax treaty of 1926. Adoption of an arbitration clause in the Japan-Netherlands tax treaty appears to have been prompted by the adoption of such clause in the 2008 OECD model tax treaty. The most important feature of the arbitration clause in the Japan-Netherlands tax treaty is that arbitration is designed as part of the <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>procedure.</b> Only by designing arbitration as such can the basic nature of the <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>procedure</b> be maintained, whereby a dispute settlement is an intergovernmental process and an agreement reached between the competent authorities of the two countries has a domestic effect. It {{should be noted that the}} arbitration procedure under the Japan-Netherlands tax treaty has three problematic points: transparency, rules for treaty interpretation, and control over arbitration. First, regarding transparency, at least arbitration decisions—which are in principle treated as confidential under the treaty—should be made public. Second, rules for treaty interpretation are defined as part of the arbitration procedure and the relevant provisions are set forth—not in the new tax treaty itself—but in the implementing agreement concluded along with the treaty. However, such rules should be provided for in the treaty itself, which is an official legal document duly endorsed by the parliaments of both contracting states. Third, regarding control over arbitration, the current system where domestic courts of both contracting states are given the control function is inappropriate. If any organization or body is to exercise control over arbitration, that function must be fulfilled by a separate arbitration committee. It is also possible not to prepare a control system. Lastly, if we follow the OECD model tax treaty, we should not adopt it unconditionally but only after necessary revisions are made in view of conditions such as the national legal systems of the contracting states. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{their joint}} fight against tax {{avoidance}} and tax evasion, international governance organizations have developed different tools. One of these tools is the joint tax audit, {{in which two}} or more countries join {{together to form a}} single audit team to examine an issue(s) /transaction(s) of one or more related taxable persons with cross-border business activities. International governance organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union and the African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF), promote the use of joint tax audits, amongst others, as a tool in fighting tax fraud, tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. The literature on this phenomenon mainly focuses on the advantages and obstacles of using the instrument, and the need to amend legislation. Moreover, in the literature, guidance for companies invited to participate in a joint tax audit can be found, as well as references to the few joint tax audits conducted and the results of a pilot project conducted by the Netherlands and Germany. The authors’ aim is to answer the question, “Which countries may benefit most from joint tax audits if the arguments raised in the tax literature are valid?”. The authors have identified eight arguments for joint tax audits (arguments (a) – (h), see sections 4. 1. and 5.) in the tax literature and have used sixteen different yardsticks (factors 1 – 16, see section 6.) to analyse which countries might benefit most. To make the research project manageable, the research focuses primarily on the situation faced by the European Union’s 28 Member States (hereinafter the “EU- 28 ”) and the 13 associated states. By combining arguments raised in the legal literature about joint audits with what public finance data tell us about, for example, tax compliance costs, the number of active taxpayers per administration employee, the number of <b>mutual</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>procedures,</b> tax compliance and tax moral levels, the authors analyse which of the EU- 28 and its associated states might benefit most from joint audits and for what reasons. The analysis strongly supports the international governance initiatives for a multilateral legislative framework on joint audits. As multinational legislation in this field should be drafted with great care, the authors call for more pilot projects with, as their aim, the sharing of know-how and building capacity. The authors also provide some recommendations {{for the development of the}} multinational legislative framework and urge tax authorities/the OECD/the European Union to publish statistics on the joint audits performed...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the institutional design of international double tax avoidance. The basic {{argument is that}} double tax avoidance exhibits the strategic structure of a coordination game with a distributive conflict. The distribution of tax revenues depends on the asymmetry of investment flows between treaty partners. Since investment flows are defined dyadically, bilateral bargaining can best accommodate countries’ concern for the distribution of tax revenues and other economic benefits connected to the tax base. Moreover, {{because there are no}} serious externality problems with bilateral agreement, this solution is also viable. At the same time, {{there is a need for}} a multilateral organization to disseminate information and shared practices in the form of a model convention that provides a focal point for bilateral negotiations. The strategic structure of a coordination game can also explain why the institutions of double tax avoidance do not have to be equipped with third-party enforcement capabilities. Instead, the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Agreement</b> <b>Procedure</b> (MAP) is interpreted as a device to deal with the fact that double tax agreements (DTAs) are incomplete contracts. ...|$|E

The result of the thesis presents that there are problems with the approaches and methods, which in some situations will cause double taxation, not the least regarding allocation of Free Capital.

40|$|Today {{adjustments}} on {{the pricing}} of internal transactions between multinational enterprises {{can lead to}} economic double taxation for the involved companies.

Consequently, changes regarding these rules should be implemented.

This is essentially because the lack of time limit for the procedure and the lack of obligation for the authorities to reach a solution on the issue. These weaknesses should be attended to, if the procedure shall have a larger effect in the future. Since it is not appropriate to introduce cogent rules for the competent authorities to solve the dispute between themselves other alternatives should be considered, as international arbitration procedure and an international tax court.
