25|$|The {{singular}} number {{indicates that}} the denoted thing is one or indivisible (as in méilė – love, smė̃lis – sand, píenas – milk). The plural number, when it can be {{in contrast with the}} singular, {{indicates that the}}re are <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> denoted by the word. But sometimes, when a word doesn't have the singular number, being a plurale tantum noun, the plural form doesn't indicate real singularity or plurality of the denoted object(s).|$|E
25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E
500|$|Waters {{was drawn}} to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, [...] "I find it a {{fascinating}} period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong." [...] Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote Street Lavender, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that Tipping the Velvet is a female version of Street Lavender, with a plot similar to My Secret Life by [...] "Walter".|$|E

500|$|Haw {{also argued}} that footbinding was not common even among Chinese during Polo's time and almost unknown among the Mongols. While the Italian missionary Odoric of Pordenone who visited Yuan China {{mentioned}} footbinding (it is however unclear whether he was merely relaying something he had heard as his description is inaccurate), no other foreign visitors to Yuan China mentioned the practice, perhaps {{an indication that the}} footbinding was not widespread or was not practiced in an extreme form at that time. Marco Polo himself noted (in the Toledo manuscript) the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very short steps. It has also been noted by other scholars that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> not mentioned by Marco Polo such as tea and chopsticks weren't mentioned by other travelers as well. [...] Haw also pointed out that despite the few omissions, Marco Polo's account is more extensive, more accurate and more detailed than those of other foreign travelers to China in this period.|$|E

In December 2016, Kotakus Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that [...] "over the last year, the PewDiePie channel {{has also had}} an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself from <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that made him famous.

[...] On the technical aspect of his videos, PewDiePie spoke about how his early videos would feature raw footage, although he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos.|$|E
500|$|When Locke {{began writing}} {{the letters that}} would {{eventually}} become Some Thoughts on Education, he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience. For example, Locke writes: [...] "I place Vertue [...] as {{the first and most}} necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman." [...] James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although [...] "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to all children" [...] (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, [...] "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are." ...|$|E

In a retrospective interview, Ohshima said that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> done by firefighters—along with rescuing people—were [...] "the very essence of a Sonic Team game", and that they recognised that a firefighter was a hero with whom people could identify.

According to Takeo Miyoshi, [...] "Our first inspiration came from the explosion and building destruction scenes of Hollywood movies. We just wanted to describe the heroism of lifesaving in that loud, explosive type of setting." [...] The developers wanted to design a future that was [...] "clean and beautiful", with sustainable energy, but where disasters still could occur, and only heroes could protect people from them. The designers envisioned that a futuristic firefighter would be acrobatic and dexterous to reach places where people were trapped.|$|E

2500|$|Default {{reasoning}} and the qualification problem: <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> people know {{take the form}} of [...] "working assumptions". For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the late}} 1960s to early 1970s, {{the concept of}} {{combining}} the elements of multiple martial arts was popularized in the west by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do.

The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style, to be formless, to adopt an individual's own style and not following the system of styles."

A contemporary of Bruce Lee, Wing Chun practitioner Wong Shun Leung, gained prominence fighting in over 60-100 illegal beimo fights against other Chinese martial artist of various styles. In his career, Wong also fought and won against Western fighters and other combat styles such as his match against a Russian boxer named Giko, his televised fight against a fencer, and his well-documented fight against Taiwanese Kung-Fu master Wu Ming Jeet.
