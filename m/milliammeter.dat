2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary <b>milliammeter</b> cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946, Ashby {{described}} {{the design of}} the units thus [...] "Its principle is that it uses multiple coils in a <b>milliammeter</b> & uses the needle movement to dip in a trough carrying a current, so getting a potential which goes to the grid of a valve, the anode of which provides an output current." [...] It was the realization of what he had described in 1946 as an [...] "Isomorphism making machine".|$|E

50|$|An ammeter (from Ampere Meter) is a {{measuring}} instrument {{used to measure}} the current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in amperes (A), hence the name. Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated as <b>milliammeters</b> or microammeters. Early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the Earth's magnetic field for operation. By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in electric power systems.|$|R
40|$|Solar cells convert {{light energy}} into {{electrical}} energy. This {{is illustrated in}} the video by holding an array of photocells close to a light bulb and observing the photocurrent with a <b>milliammeter.</b> The electrical energy produced {{may be used to}} run a small electric motor such as that shown in Figure 1...|$|E
40|$|Tables I and II of {{the present}} paper {{summarize}} the gust and draft velocity data for thunderstorm-flights 21 and 22 of August 14, 1946 and August 15, 1946, respectively. These data were evaluated from records of NACA airspeed-altitude and acceleration recorders installed in P- 61 C airplanes and are of the type presented for previous flights. Table III summarizes the readings of a <b>milliammeter</b> which was {{used in conjunction with}} other equipment to indicate ambient-air temperature during thunderstorm surveys. These data were read from photo-observer records and include all cases in which variations of the instrument indications were noted for the present flights...|$|E
40|$|The gust and draft {{velocities}} evaluated from {{acceleration and}} airspeed-altitude records taken by NACA instruments installed in P- 61 c airplanes participating in thunderstorm flights 9, 10, and 11 of July 12, 1946, July 17, 1946, and July 18, 1946, respectively, {{are presented in}} references 1 and 2 for previous flights. In accordance with a recent discussion {{with a member of}} the U. S. Weather Bureau staff, motion-picture records of the pilots' instrument panels for the present flights were inspected to note variations in the readings of a <b>milliammeter</b> used in conjunction with other equipment to indicate ambient air temperature.

40|$|An {{oscillograph}} {{has been}} designed and constructed which will reproduce in ink on paper tape the wave form of steady state a. c. voltages or currents in the frequency range 50 to 25, 000 cycles. The tracing is done at a speed of approximately 1 cycle in 3 seconds, and represents a recording of the instantaneous voltage or current progressively at different phase positions in the cycle. The principle of the device {{is that of the}} Rosa curve tracer, but operation has been made automatic by the introduction of several new features, including an electrical phase shifter, a new type of electronic switch, and a recording <b>milliammeter.</b> The sources of error in the apparatus are analyzed and are shown to be reasonably small in magnitude and the error capable of further reduction. An appendix describes the use of the instrument as an harmonic analyzer. ...|$|E
40|$|The development, fabrication, and {{application}} of a magnetometer are described. The magnetometer has a miniature transducer and is capable of automatic scanning. The magnetometer described here is capable of detecting static magnetic fields as low as 1. 6 A/m and its transducer has an active area 0. 64 mm by 0. 76 mm. Thin and rugged, the transducer uses wire, 0. 05 mm in diameter, which is plated with a magnetic film, enabling measurement of transverse magnetic fields as close as 0. 08 mm from a surface. The magnetometer, which is simple to operate and has a fast response, uses an inexpensive clip-on <b>milliammeter</b> (commonly found in most laboratories) for driving and processing the electrical signals and readout. A specially designed transducer holding mechanism replaces the XY recorder ink pen; this mechanism provides the basis for an automatic scanning technique. The instrument {{has been applied to}} the measurements of magnetic fields arising from remanent magnetization in experimental plated-wire memory planes and regions of magnetic activity in geological rock specimens...|$|E
