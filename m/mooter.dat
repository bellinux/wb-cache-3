50|$|The CUHK Vis team, {{composed}} of first year JD law students, earned a team honourable mention and an individual honourable mention {{in their first}} moot competition at the 4th Annual Vis (East) moot. In the Vis (Vienna) Moot 2008, CUHK finished 17th out of 214 participating teams and a team <b>mooter</b> received an honourable mention for his advocacy skills. At the 10th Annual Vis (East) moot in 2013, lead oralists Jenny Chan and Felicity Ng took the team to the elimination round and finished at the Semi-Finals, marking the team's first appearance at the Vis (East) elimination rounds and further defeated the defending champion in the quarter-finals. In 2014, CUHK went into the elimination rounds in both Hong Kong and Vienna, in addition to receiving a total of 9 honorable mentions from Vis (East) and Vis (Vienna), 5 of which were from Vis (Vienna). This placed CUHK as the top university for having the most awards and honorable mentions. In 2016, CUHK emerged as the Championship team at the 13th Annual Willem C. Vis (East) International Commercial Arbitration moot.|$|E
5000|$|An {{invitational}} debate {{called the}} Grand Law Debate is annually {{organized by the}} Oratorical and Debating Club where for each year, another law school is invited {{to engage in a}} friendly debate with the college's own students. [...] The format traditionally used is the Oregon-Oxford type of debate. Since 2007, the college has also been regularly sending participants to the International Humanitarian Law Moot Court Competitions in Manila which is mainly organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Philippine National Red Cross. It won the 3rd Best Memorial in 2007, 2nd Best Memorial in 2008, Best <b>Mooter</b> Award for the General Rounds in 2009, and the championship trophy against the University of the Philippines Diliman in 2010. In 2012, the college also started to join the Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition and in its maiden participation immediately landed third nationwide. [...] In the same year, the college participated {{for the first time in}} ANC's Square Off-the CVC Law Debates and immediately won over the contingent from Saint Louis University of Baguio City.|$|E

40|$|Yahoo!Clusty 1 is a Clustering Meta-search Engine (MSE) {{that allows}} users to send queries to Yahoo!. The {{returned}} snippets are grouped into homoge-neous groups by topic. The objective of this project has been to create a flexible MSE for the Yahoo! web search engine. The purpose is to present the results returned to a query in a more structured format which will allow the user to easily explore them by category. The basic idea, which is has been recently become a focus of attention in the information retrieval community [6, 7], is to consider only the snippets of the returned web pages as a consistent representation of each page and grouping them in homogeneous clusters by means of clustering and catego-rization algorithms. The processing must {{be done on the}} fly at run-time, so it requires efficient implementation and design of technologies and algo-rithms in order to minimize the latency between the issuing of the query and the presentation of the results. Many different approaches have been presented in the last 10 years (Copernic, Dogpile, iBoogie, Kartoo, <b>Mooter,</b> Vivisimo, etc.) and many academic prototypes have been explored as well. A recent example is given by the Armil 2 [1] meta-search engine. Given the limited amount of time and the complexity of the project, the goal is not to develop a sophisticated MSE that can outperform all the previous MSEs but to create a flexible platform for testing various clustering algorithms and labeling techniques on snippets and show that all this can be achieved in a one semester project. Moreover the system has been developed {{in such a way that}} it can be easily extended with more functionalities...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE In {{a recent}} paper, we have {{explored}} that indomethacin (IMC) effectively {{acted as a}} crystallization inhibitor for polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) 1 {{despite the fact that}} the absence of interaction between the drug and the carrier in the solid state was reported in the literature. We hypothesize that the interaction between the two components must exist. METHODS Dispersions made up of IMC and PEG were prepared by heating the mixture of the drug and the carrier to above the melting temperatures of both components, followed by solidification of the melt. Drug-carrier interaction was characterized by variable temperature Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and solid state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. RESULTS FTIR data show the strong interaction between IMC and PEG in molten state. This interaction is disrupted upon storage (and solidification), resulting in segregation of IMC from PEG crystals. This is further confirmed by NMR. Surprisingly, each ether oxygen of the PEG unit can form hydrogen bonds with two IMC molecules, owing to the perfect arrangement of drug molecules along the carrier chains that in turn is originating from π-π stacking between aromatic rings of neighbouring IMC molecules. When the hydroxyl group of IMC is substituted by a methoxy group, no interaction between the new compound and PEG can be detected and the methoxy derivative of IMC is unable to inhibit crystallization of PEG. CONCLUSION This work demonstrates the presence of hydrogen bonding between IMC and PEG in molten state, and the disruption of the bonds upon crystallization of the carrier. Furthermore, both the presence of a hydrogen bonding forming center and an aromatic ring of IMC are required for the crystallization inhibition effect on PEG. REFERENCES 1.

40|$|A vital {{aspect of}} {{successful}} advocacy is effective engagement by the advocate with the Bench (and jury). However, rarely are these skills naturally occurring {{or at least}} the natural (untailored) psychomotor repertoire is not necessarily well adapted to advocacy. More often these skills are developed or refined to the specific requirements of advocacy by mooting practice. Assisting future advocates to develop effective psychomotor skills therefore is a core component of any mooting programme. This article explains the relevance of the psychomotor domain to advocacy and identifies the matters that must be addressed with <b>mooters</b> in order for them appropriately to develop these skills. In so doing, it positions the mooting psychomotor domain in context with the cognitive and affective domains...|$|R

The team decisively won two preliminary rounds and narrowly lost a third (winning the oral but losing on the memorial to a team that was later recognized for best overall memorial). Pictured, from left to right, are Irina Samborski, Luca Lucarini, Alexander Evangelista, Jacob Klugsberg and Jessica Hardy-Henry. “Despite the disappointment, the team were fantastic ambassadors for Osgoode,” said Professor Faisal Bhabha who, together with Iris Fischer of Blakes, co-coached the team. “They befriended many of the teams, showed grace and openness, left a very positive impression on judges, <b>mooters</b> and organizers alike, and I am confident have grown Osgoode’s international reputation. ” The annual Price Moot Court Competition challenges students to engage in comparative research of legal standards at the national, regional and international levels, and to develop their arguments (in written and oral forms) on cutting-edge questions in media and ICT law.

40|$|Singapore has an {{extremely}} proud tradition in international moot court competitions. The famous NUS’ 82 team which won Singapore’s first Jessup championship comprised {{members who have}} all gone on to become Senior Counsel; one is now a High Court Judge (Steven Chong) and another, the Attorney-General (VK Rajah). Videos of championship finals featuring Singapore <b>mooters</b> continue {{to be used as}} training tools by universities all over the world, especially the 2001 Jessup final featuring the first and only person to have ever won the two largest moots, the Jessup and the Vis. And in that same year (2001), NUS won arguably the greatest grand slam of titles in a single moot season by bringing home the Asia Cup, Lachs, Maritime, and Jessup championships. Not many know this yet, but 2014 / 15 (August 2014 to July 2015) has been yet another historical season for Singapore in international moots. NUS and SMU reached a total of 13 international moot fi nals, winning 10; the two schools also split eight Best Oralist prizes between them in the process...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{dependence}} of lawyers upon the spoken word, whether it be in presenting argument in court, conducting negotiations, or conveying advice to clients, it is perhaps surprising that traditionally law schools assess students primarily on their written rather than their oral expression and presentation. Commonly the emphasis is upon methods of written expression such as examinations and research assignments. Assessment of oral expression, if present at all, is usually through participation in a moot as a barrister or presentations to or participation in class. Oral examinations (“viva voce”) are seldom an option and are reserved, if at all, {{to the role of}} being a supplement to some other form of assessment. At the Queensland University of Technology Law Faculty, assessment of the 300 first year students enrolled in the unit Contract Law prior to 1993 comprised of two examinations (a mid year examination worth 30 % of the total marks and an end of year examination worth 50 % of the total marks) and a written 2, 000 word assignment (worth 20 % of the marks). Students could choose to participate in the Faculty’s mooting programme as either a solicitor or barrister in lieu of submission of a written assignment, although the number of moots in Contract Law was restricted to three. Accordingly, there was a limit of 24 places for <b>mooters</b> in Contract Law, of which only 12 were available to students wishing to act as counsel. In 1993 the four members of the Contract Law teaching team decided to provide more opportunity for assessment of students’ oral expression and presentation. In addition to assessing performance in small group tutorials, a formal programme of oral examinations by panels each comprising two academics was introduced as an alternative to written research assignments and moots. Thus, rather than fulfilling merely a secondary role, vivas were presented as a direct alternative to written assessment by way of assignment, and provided a forum in addition to the limited opportunities available in moots in which students could display oral skills...|$|R
