25|$|Some {{scholars}} use emergy (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, {{budgets for}} the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward <b>material</b> <b>recycling,</b> where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by adaptive reuse systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{production of}} metal foam bodies useful in aviation- and aerospace technology, comprises foaming a mixture made of <b>recycling</b> <b>material</b> of a metal or alloys and a foaming agent. Chips of the metal or alloys are used as the <b>recycling</b> <b>material.</b> The mixture of the <b>recycling</b> <b>material</b> and the foaming agent are compacted to a foamable starting <b>material.</b> The <b>recycling</b> <b>material</b> is adjusted to a defined size in a grinding process before mixing. The production wastes of a cutting dry machining are used as chips for mixing with the foaming agent. During the preparation process of the <b>recycling</b> <b>material,</b> the foaming agent homogenously distributed with the <b>recycling</b> <b>material</b> is grinded. The mixture is heated on a temperature above a decomposition temperature of the foaming agent that lies in the temperature range of the melting point of the used the metal or alloys and {{in such a manner}} that the foam body is subsequently cooled-off. The foaming is carried out in a foam form/a component. USE - Useful in the aviation- and aerospace technology as lightweight structures and also in the automobile- and machine construction. ADVANTAGE - The production of the metal foam bodies is economical. The pollution of the produced porous metal bodies is avoided by removing the pollution of the chips as production wastes...|$|R
