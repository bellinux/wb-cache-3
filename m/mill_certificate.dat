50|$|Industry quality {{standards}} require materials {{to be tested}} at the manufacturer {{and the results of}} these tests be submitted through a report, also called a Mill Sheet, <b>Mill</b> <b>Certificate</b> or Mill Test Certificate (MTC). The only way to trace a steel plate back to its Mill Sheet is the Heat Number. A heat number is similar to a lot number, which is used to identify production runs of any other product for quality control purposes.|$|E
50|$|In steel industry, MTC means <b>mill's</b> test <b>certificate.</b> Some <b>mills</b> {{also call}} it as MTR, that is, mill's test report.|$|R
50|$|The MSS Group {{recommended}} {{strengthening the}} beam above the column {{by adding a}} beam bracket with web stiffeners. This change was not implemented when Tamm Tacy advised that <b>mill</b> <b>certificates</b> obtained from the steel sub-contractor indicated to be 25% higher strength than expected. It was later determined {{that this type of}} data is not a truly representative sampling of the steel as fabricated and so is not a valid measure of actual strength.|$|R
50|$|A Mill Test Report (MTR) {{and often}} also called a Certified Mill Test Report, Certified Material Test Report, <b>Mill</b> Test <b>Certificate</b> (MTC), Inspection Certificate, Certificate of Test {{and a host}} of other names is a quality {{assurance}} document used in the metals industry that certifies a material's chemical and physical properties and states a product made of metal (steel, aluminum, brass or other alloys) compliance with an international standards organization (such as ANSI, ASME, etc.) specific standards.|$|R
40|$|Square and {{rectangular}} {{hollow sections}} are generally produced either by hot-rolling or cold-forming. Cross-sections of nominally similar geometries, {{but from the}} two different production routes may vary significantly {{in terms of their}} general material properties, geometric imperfections, residual stresses, corner geometry and material response and general structural behaviour and load-carrying capacity. In this paper, an experimental programme comprising tensile coupon tests on flat and corner material, measurements of geometric imperfections and residual stresses, stub column tests and simple and continuous beam tests is described. The results of the tests have been combined with other available test data on square and rectangular hollow sections and analysed. Enhancements in yield and ultimate strengths, beyond those quoted in the respective <b>mill</b> <b>certificates,</b> were observed in the corner regions of the cold-formed sections—these are caused by cold-working of the material during production, and predictive models have been proposed. Initial geometric imperfections were generally low in both the hot-rolled and cold-formed sections, with larger imperfections emerging towards the ends of the cold-formed members—these were attributed largely to the release of through thickness residual stresses, which were themselves quantified. The results of the stub column and simple bending tests were used to assess the current slenderness limits given in Eurocode 3, including the possible dependency on production route, whilst the results of the continuous beam tests were evaluated with reference to the assumptions typically made in plastic analysis and design. Current slenderness limits, assessed on the basis of bending tests, appear appropriate, though the Class 3 slenderness limit, assessed on the basis of compression tests, seems optimistic. Of the features investigated, strain hardening characteristics of the material were identified as being primarily responsible for the differences in structural behaviour between hot-rolled and cold-formed sections...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of tricalcium silicate content of cement on concrete durability {{has long been}} a topic of discussion in the literature. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether increasing tricalcium silicate content of cement has a negative effect on concrete sulfate durability. Several <b>mill</b> <b>certificates</b> were reviewed to select cements with similar tricalcium aluminate content and variable tricalcium silicate contents. Cements selected for this study were randomly labeled as cements C, D, D 2, E, and P. The following properties were assessed for the as-received cements: Blaine fineness, particle size distribution, chemical oxide content, and mineralogical content. Three different methods were employed to determine the mineralogical composition of the as-received cements: Bogue calculation, internal standard method, and Rietveld refinement analysis. Despite the attempt to select cements with similar composition, it was determined that the as-received cements had compositional differences other than their C 3 S content. These cements had a variable tricalcium aluminate and alkali content, as well as differences in the amount and form of calcium sulfates. In order to eliminate these variances, doped cements were prepared by increasing the C 3 S content of the as received cements to 69 % by Bogue calculation. Durability of as-received cements and doped cements was assessed through several measurements including length change, compressive strength, and phase transformation in sodium sulfate solution. For as-received cements, compressive strength of mortar cubes stored in saturated lime solution was evaluated as well. Semiquantitative x-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy observations were performed on mortar bars to evaluate the relative amounts and morphology of the hydrated phases. It was concluded {{at the end of this}} study that cements with high tricalcium silicate content generally have poor durability in sodium sulfate environment. All the cements experienced higher expansion with increased C 3 S content. High C 3 S content combinedwith high C 3 A content was particularly detrimental to mortar resistance to sodium sulfate attack...|$|R
