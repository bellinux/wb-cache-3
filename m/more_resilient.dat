5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global warming and the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also <b>more</b> <b>resilient</b> than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E

5|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the storage pit. Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and <b>more</b> <b>resilient</b> buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some technologies are not available to certain civilizations.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} yellow {{stingray}} under Least Concern, citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions. In addition, its small size implies relatively high productivity, {{which would make}} its population <b>more</b> <b>resilient</b> to fishing pressure. This species is not targeted commercially, but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range. It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade, being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market. The extent of this trade {{has not yet been}} quantified. Another potential threat is habitat degradation, particularly to seagrass beds. No conservation measures have been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 6 allows {{players to}} select between four {{scenarios}} with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows {{one of four}} main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are <b>more</b> <b>resilient.</b> Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running whilst shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within {{a limited amount of}} time.|$|E

25|$|UNESCAP funded {{research}} on how communities show resiliency {{in the wake of}} natural disasters. They found that, physically, communities were <b>more</b> <b>resilient</b> if they banded together and made resiliency an effort of the whole community.

40|$|Consistency {{and change}} in {{personality}} were analyzed by examining personality types across adulthood and old age using data from two nationally representative panel studies from Germany (N = 14, 718; 16 - 82 years) and Australia (N = 8, 315; 15 - 79 years). In both samples, the Big Five personality traits were measured twice across a period of 4 years. Latent profile analyses and latent profile transition analyses revealed four main findings: First, solutions with 3 (in the German sample) or 4 (in the Australian sample) personality types {{were found to be}} most interpretable. Second, measurement invariance tests revealed that these personality types were consistent across all age groups but differed slightly between men and women. Third, age was related to the number of individuals classified within each personality type. Namely, there were <b>more</b> <b>resilients</b> and fewer undercontrollers in older compared with younger age groups. Fourth, there was strong consistency of personality type membership across a period of 4 years in both genders and most age cohorts. Comparatively less consistency across time was found for undercontrollers and individuals in old age. Taken together, these findings show that in the two nations studied here, personality types were highly consistent across gender, age, and time...|$|R
