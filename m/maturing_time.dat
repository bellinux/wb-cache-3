50|$|Garrotxa is a {{traditional}} Catalan goat's milk cheese. Almost extinct by the early 1980s, it has been revived by a young cheesemakers and goat farmers' cooperative in the Garrotxa area of Catalonia. The revival began in 1981, and the cheese has since become widespread in artisanal production. Garrotxa is traditionally made from the milk of Murciana goats and aged in caves to enhance mold development and the resulting flavor. Garrotxa is described as having a powdery gray or grayish-blue rind, a firm texture, an ivory-colored interior, and an earthy flavor. The cheese is semi-soft. Cheese wheels of Garrotxa are small (typically around three pounds) and mature relatively quickly in the humid Pyrenees. <b>Maturing</b> <b>time</b> varies, but is typically between four and eight weeks.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the phenomenon of}} longevity in biological world, {{the relationship between the}} potential of longevity of an organism and its structural complexity is analyzed. I. Potential of longevity is the maximum longevity of a species if the individuals live in an ideal environment. Longevity of an organism includes two parts: the <b>time</b> for development (<b>mature</b> <b>time)</b> and the time for structure-maintenance (maintaining <b>time).</b> II. The <b>mature</b> <b>time</b> for an organism depends on its structural complexity. The maintaining time for an organism is related to two factors, the degree of damage-exposure and the potential of functionality for structure-maintenance. Potential of functionality include two parts: the capacity of basic functionality and the potential of functional compensation. The capacity of basic functionality is built in the structural complexity of the organism. However, the structural complexity and the functionality of an organism will be reduced gradually with age by the accumulation of Misrepairs. Functional compensation can slow down the decline of functionality during aging by two mechanisms: functional substitution and regeneration of cells, and theses two functions are also built in the structural complexity. The potential of longevity of an organism is therefore hidden in its structural complexity, which is determined by the gene configuration. III. An animal has limited longevity because it has limited structural complexity. Limited structural complexity and limited longevity are essential for the survival of a species. IV. In spite having the same potential of longevity, individuals of a species normally have different lifespans. The lifespan of an individual is related to the degree of damage-exposure, which is determined by the living environments and the living habits of the individual. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

Most apricot fruits are harvested in the season of cultivar ‘Hungarian Best’ or at a short time afterwards. There is particularly a lack of early- and late-maturing cultivars of high quality fruit. This study was aimed at evaluating of 14 introduced apricot cultivars of late <b>maturing</b> <b>time</b> in order to recommend the best of them for growing in the Belgrade region. The study was carried out at the Experimental station ‘Radmilovac’ of the Faculty of Agriculture in Belgrade over a period of five years (2009 - 2013). The experimental orchard was established in 2007, the rootstock was Myrobalan seedling, and tree spacing was 4. 5 x 3 m. Control cultivar for comparison was ‘Hungarian Best’, which is the most grown apricot cultivar in Serbia. Flowering of introduced cultivars ranged from three days before to three days after the control cultivar (‘Hungarian Best’), while the maturation time was 7 to 15 days after the control. Compared with the control cultivar, significantly higher yield was achieved in seven cultivars (‘Harogem’, ‘Umberto’, ‘Litoral’, ‘Sophia’, ‘Harlayne’, ‘Bergarouge’, and ‘Silistrenska Kompotna’), while significantly higher fruit weight was achieved in two cultivars (‘Cegledy Arany’ and ‘Sophia’). Compared to the control higher content of soluble solids was found in four cultivars (‘Kabaasi’, ‘Late Dryanovska’, ‘Harlayne’, and ‘Silistrenska Kompotna’).

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of fresh cheeses {{one of the main}} drawbacks is the mold proliferation {{on the surface of the}} product. Therefore, the use of chemical agents with antimicrobial activity is almost mandatory. However, the industry’s interest is oriented toward alternatives preferably in line with consumers expectations for food products with a short list of ingredients. In this study, the antimicrobial efficacy of ozone against molds and yeasts that contaminate the rooms of fresh cheese maturation has been tested. The experiment was conducted using 2 adjacent rooms with a volume of 360 m 3 each. Five successive batches of cheese obtained in as many days were considered for experimental purposes. At the end of the salting phase (in brine for 48 h) the cheeses of each batch were equally split between the 2 rooms. The cheeses were settled on plastic shelves located in the opposite side of the door. In one room were placed 4 ozone generators (2 near the door and 2 in the opposite side) operating according to corona discharge with a production capacity of 5 g ozone/h each one. The emission of ozone was continued for 28 consecutive days from 6 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 am. The microbial samples were taken by scrubbing 100 cm 2 surface area both for shelves (accurately sanitized before the beginning of the trial) and for cheese. The scrubs were collected the day after the cheese manufacture, at the end of first, second, third and fourth week of maturing. In all cases the collections were taken at 8 : 00 am. At the fourth week, microbial analysis was also conducted on 25 g of crust cheese removed for a thickness of about 2 mm. The molds and yeasts cells collected were submitted to grown on DRBCA AGAR BASE and OGYE AGAR BASE at 25 ° C for 5 days. The scrubs coming from the room used as control showed molds charges that were in the order of magnitude of 1 log in the first sampling time rising up to 3 - 4 logs after 28 days both for shelves and cheeses. The yeasts showed more variable values in the first sampling time (from 1 to 3 logs) and higher values at the end of the experiment (up to 5 logs). In the room submitted to ozone treatment the microbial behavior was completely different. The molds were almost absent from all the surfaces tested already at the end of the first week of <b>maturing</b> <b>time</b> and this situation persisted until the end. The yeasts showed a linear decrease until disappearing at the end of the third week. In conclusion, the employment of ozone in gaseous form seems to be able to eliminate molds and yeasts both from shelves surface and from the crust of fresh cheeses. That of ozone is a technology relatively easy to use that leaving no residual is also environmental friendly. It was defined as GRAS by the US-FDA and employed as direct food additive.
