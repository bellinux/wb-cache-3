40|$|Observations on {{maturation}} {{stages of}} nineteen species of economically important finfish off the Northeast {{coast of the}} USA were analyzed to examine relationships between fish size or age, and maturity. Maturation schedules and median lengths (L 50) and ages (A 50) at maturation were derived by fitting the logistic model to the observed proportions. Analyses were generally restricted to observations from 1985 to 1990 obtained during stratified random bottom trawl surveys conducted in spring and autumn by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries in waters of the continental shelf from Nova Scotia to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Butterfish, Peprilus triacanthus, attained sexual maturity at the smallest median length (11. 4 cm, males) and pollock, Pollachius virens, at the highest (41. 8 em, males). Median length at <b>maturity</b> for gadiforms <b>ranged</b> from 22. 2 to 41. 8 em. Within the pleuronectiforms, median length at <b>maturity</b> <b>ranged</b> from 19. 1 to 30. 4 cm.

Butterfish also attained sexual maturity at the youngest median age (0. 9 yr, both sexes) whereas redfish, Sebastes fasciatus, were the latest to mature (5. 5 yr, both sexes). For gadids, the median age at <b>maturity</b> <b>ranged</b> from 1. 3 to 2. 3 yr.

40|$|In this study, {{the thermal}} {{maturity}} {{of crude oil}} samples from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (UK) were assessed and characterised using the following methods: calibration of the oil samples against source rock biomarker dataset of which the maturities are known, use of established empirical relationships between Vitrinite Reflectance Equivalent (VRE) and aromatic molecular ratios, use of phase diagram as a relative maturity indicator and use of GOR as a relative maturity indicator. The {{results show that the}} biomarker maturity parameters are only diagnostic of a broad <b>maturity</b> <b>range</b> (VRo ~ 0. 65 - 1. 0 %), aside, there was no significant increase in the ratios of virtually all parameters (e. g., % 29 ββ sterane, % 29 αα sterane, % 27 Ts, % 29 Ts) in this <b>maturity</b> <b>range,</b> and in most cases their inversion complicates their application. Vitrinite reflection equivalent (VRE) values derived from the aromatic molecular ratios mainly range from ~ 0. 64 - 0. 89 %.

This assertion is only broadly true as reservoired oils are mixtures of petroleums from source rocks at different levels of maturity. Our dataset also displays poor correlation between GOR and biomarker/aromatic related maturity parameters, indicating the need to (a) carefully consider how these parameters should be used and (b) unravel the effects of petroleum mixing when looking for trends between maturity and bulk composition...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{questions}} the sensitivity and {{the accuracy of}} Raman spectroscopy {{as a tool for}} determining the maturity of natural organic matter (NOM). It focuses on the definition of optimized experimental parameters in order to maximize the quality of the Raman signal and control the accuracy and reproducibility of measurements. A series of 11 coals has been investigated, sampling a wide <b>maturity</b> <b>range</b> (2 – 7 % vitrinite reflectance VR). The role of experimental parameters is first investigated. An excitation wavelength of 514. 5 nm gives better results than 457. 9 and 632. 8 nm, minimizing the fluorescence background observed in the spectra of low-rank coals. Both Raman and fluorescence spectra were investigated with time-resolved experiments in air and argon. These data show that fluorescence and Raman spectra are sensitive to acquisition time and laser power parameters, and reveal a physicochemical instability of the samples under laser irradiation, mostly due to photo-oxidation processes. These data clearly show that the experiments, especially in air, should be performed with strictly constant acquisition parameters. In addition, the results of a whole series of coal measurements performed in air under constant experimental conditions show that Raman spectroscopy is definitely sensitive to the maturity of coal samples with VR > not, vert, similar 1 %. The most sensitive spectral maturity tracers are the width of the D-band (FWHM-D), the ratio of the peak intensities of the D- and G-bands (ID/IG), the normalized ratio of the band integrated intensities AD/[AD + AG] for the <b>maturity</b> <b>range</b> VR = 3 – 7 % and the width of the G-band (FWHM-G) for VR = 1 – 5 %. However, the accuracy and reproducibility are definitely weaker in such measurements compared to the standard VR.
