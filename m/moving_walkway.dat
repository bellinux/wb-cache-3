It includes ticketing, all baggage claim areas, security checkpoints, and ground transportation such as taxi, limo, and the Port Authority's 28X airport shuttle. A 331-room Hyatt Regency hotel/convention center opened on June 29, 2000 and is directly attached via <b>moving</b> <b>walkway</b> to the terminal. Several shops and cafes occupy the Landside Terminal including Travelmart, Sue Venir, City of Bridges Cafe, and Travelex currency services.

25|$|The {{terminal}} currently houses all non-SkyTeam airlines {{serving the}} airport, {{and is considered}} D Concourse. (Concourses A, B, and C are housed in the McNamara Terminal) The concourse has 26 gates, two of which opened {{in the middle of}} 2009 to accommodate international wide-body aircraft. The two gates were unusable at the building's opening because they were extremely close to Smith Terminal's C Concourse, which was demolished after operations moved to the new facility. The terminal features four long segments of moving walkways on the departures level, and another <b>moving</b> <b>walkway</b> on the lower level; that is for international arriving passengers to access the Federal Inspection Services area.|$|E
25|$|Between 1998 and 2002, in {{preparation}} for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the station underwent a £100 million redevelopment. The glass roof of the trainshed, which is Grade II listed was re-glazed and re-painted. A new main entrance and enlarged concourse with a mezzanine level, designed by BDP, replaced the 1960s structure which had become insufficient for the number of passengers. A <b>moving</b> <b>walkway</b> was installed to take passengers from the concourse to platforms 13 and 14 at the far south end of the station which involves a long walk. Another entrance was also created on Fairfield Street to access a new taxi rank and drop-off point for cars.|$|E

Gates C23, C24, and C25 are international gates and can accommodate aircraft up to the Boeing 747.The airport has implemented the most ambitious expansion in its history, begun in 2006 and completed in January 2011. Terminal 1 was re-opened after extensive renovation in 2014; and Terminal 2 was opened in 2008. The two terminals {{do not have an}} airside connection. Passengers moving between the terminals may ride a shuttle bus or take the <b>moving</b> <b>walkway</b> through the covered parking decks between the terminals.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{development}} plan, future phases {{would see the}} addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal. A fourth runway (parallel to the existing runways 1 and 19 L) opened in 2008, and development plans include a fifth runway to parallel the existing runway 12–30. If this runway is built, the current runway will be redesignated as 12L-30R while the new runway will be designated 12R-30L. An expansion of the B concourse, used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals, has been completed, and the building housing Concourses C and D will eventually be knocked down {{to make room for}} a more ergonomic building. Because Concourses C and D are temporary concourses, {{the only way to get}} to those concourses is via <b>moving</b> <b>walkway</b> from the Concourse C station which is built in the location of the future gates and Concourse D by mobile lounge from the main terminal.|$|E
25|$|Manchester Airport railway station, {{opened in}} May 1993, is between Terminals 1 and 2. It {{is linked to}} the {{terminals}} by a Skylink <b>moving</b> <b>walkway.</b> Trains operated by Northern or TransPennine Express connect the airport to Manchester Piccadilly station and other railway stations, mainly throughout northern England, including Crewe, Wigan and Southport. A third rail platform was completed in 2008 to allow for an increase in rail capacity. In 2009, Network Rail stated that the third platform meant that capacity will become constrained by the layover of the trains and recommended building a line underneath the Airport towards Northwich by 2024. On 28 January 2013, the Government announced the Airport will be included in the 2nd stage of High Speed 2 which will provide links with other British cities like Birmingham and London and also a quicker route into Central Manchester. Work on building a new fourth platform commenced in early 2014 with a blockade required in February 2015 to allow completion. Construction finished in May 2015 and the platform opened to passengers in Autumn 2015.|$|E
50|$|While {{inclined}} <b>moving</b> <b>walkways</b> {{can be used}} in multi-level {{retail stores}} to transport shopping carts between floors, they are associated with safety hazards (such as, with baby strollers) and take up about twice as much floor space as a separate cart conveyor system, because <b>moving</b> <b>walkways</b> can not be installed at inclinations greater than 12 degrees, while a cart conveyor can operate at an inclination of up to 35 degrees. Only specially-designed shopping carts can be transported with a cart conveyor.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{significant}} investment {{has been made to}} install automated pedestrian movement systems within airport terminals, little is known about their effects on airport pedestrian flows. Specifically, while walking speeds of pedestrians have been studied in general, such analysis specific to airport passengers has been lacking. New insight into the walking speeds of airport pedestrians is provided. Corridors with and without <b>moving</b> <b>walkways,</b> the most common of airport automated pedestrian movement systems, are considered. Pedestrian movements in various airport terminal corridors are empirically observed, and observed walking speeds are compared with those of research performed in other transportation terminals. Furthermore, the effects on walking speeds of observable characteristics of pedestrians and the surrounding environment are investigated.

500|$|The script posed several {{technical}} {{challenges to}} both the puppet and special effects departments of Century 21 Productions. The [...] "blurring" [...] of the structures making up the Mysteron city was accomplished by mounting a sheet of glass between the camera and the effects set, with Vaseline placed on the glass at the necessary points to create lens flare. Complex scale model shots of Captain Blue's SPV navigating the spiral structure of the Car-Vu were simplified by turning the road surface instead of the vehicle, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate the wires (or move the camera). Since the spinning blades reduced the practicality of overhead wire control, the scenes of Spectrum Helicopter A42's dogfight with the jetpack-wearing Blue were filmed upside-down (with wires supporting {{the base of the}} helicopter model) and flipped during post-production. A sequence of the World President and Captain Brown standing on a <b>moving</b> <b>walkway</b> while undergoing security checks at the Maximum Security Building was particularly difficult to film, since it was essential that the puppet operators, working from a gantry overhead, keep pace with the speed of the conveyor belt powering the set below. The Captain Scarlet [...] "grimacing" [...] head, used for the reaction shot immediately after the reconstruction is hit by Blue's bullet, was sculpted especially by the puppet workshop for its one-off appearance in this episode. In his DVD audio commentary for the episode, Gerry Anderson remembered how, on a technical level, [...] "everything had to be perfect" [...] for the filming of the first episode of the new series.|$|E

[...] The video opens with intercalated beauty shots of will.i.am and Spears, until the scene cuts to will.i.am using his iPhone camera add-on and social network iam+. will.i.am says [...] "bring the action", and Spears is seen wearing a skin-tight skirt and a long-sleeved top with bare midriff and cleavage. Spears performs fast movements to the song's beat and sings the lyrics. She is then seen atop a white box and posing to the camera. When the track's chorus begins, will.i.am appears {{in front of an}} empty black background and is joined by Spears, who is now wearing a corseted leotard accented with feathers, standing on a <b>moving</b> <b>walkway,</b> and they sing together. After the first [...] "Britney, bitch" [...] line is heard, dancers perform to [...] "Scream & Shout". The video cuts to intercalated scenes of flaming disco balls, Spears image multiplied, and will.i.am wearing several gold accessories, including a cap with a gold plate that reads 'King'. Mor said that the video has no narrative, and that, [...] "there's no deep meaning to any of it...To me it was just about, you know, every scene is like a photo. I just liked it, I liked seeing the human heads, and I liked seeing the gold chains off of the plaques and then making it scroll. And then it was an awesome way to introduce characters, some friends of will...so that it wasn't just about them." [...] Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush compared Spears' look on the video to a [...] "sexy, futuristic librarian".|$|E
