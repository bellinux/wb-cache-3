5|$|The U.S public's {{perception}} of the Soviet lead in the space race (by putting the first <b>man</b> <b>into</b> space) motivated President John F.

After the scientist begs for mercy, Mega Man spares Wily and returns home.|$|E

5|$|On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union {{launched}} Sputnik 1, {{the first}} artificial satellite. This shattered American confidence in its technological superiority, creating {{a wave of}} anxiety known as the Sputnik crisis. Among his responses, President Dwight D. Eisenhower launched the Space Race. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was established on October 1, 1958, as a civilian agency to develop space technology. One of its first initiatives was publicly announced on December 17, 1958. This was Project Mercury, which aimed to launch a <b>man</b> <b>into</b> Earth orbit, return him safely to the Earth, and evaluate his capabilities in space.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Russian {{flight of}} Sputnik 1 {{prompted}} the United States to accelerate its fledgling space program. On July 29, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, which established NASA and subsumed NACA within this newly created organization. Langley Research Center {{became a part}} of NASA, as did Langley employees such as Kraft. Even before NASA began its official existence in October, Kraft was invited by Gilruth {{to become a part of}} a new group that was working on the problems of putting a <b>man</b> <b>into</b> orbit. Without much hesitation, he accepted the offer. When the Space Task Group was officially formed on November 5, Kraft became one of the original thirty-five engineers to be assigned to Project Mercury, America's man-in-space program.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified <b>man</b> <b>into</b> the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E

5|$|In the 11th century, the earls of Orkney were at {{the height}} of their power. The Earl of Orkney, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, also ruled Caithness and Sutherland, and seems to have {{controlled}} the western seaboard of Scotland, and the Hebrides. Historian Magnús Stefánsson described the political situation of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man during the 11th and early 12th century as being unstable, and suffering from the rivalries of petty kings and chieftains. In 1079, the Hebridean warlord Gofraidh Crobhán was able to unite the Hebrides and the Isle of <b>Man</b> <b>into</b> an effective independent kingdom. In 10989, the Norwegian king Magnús Óláfsson invaded the Hebrides, and asserted his right over the islands; he did so again in 11023. He is thought to have planned to unite Orkney, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Mann, under the control of his son. In 1103, Magnús was slain in Ireland, and no Norwegian king set foot in the islands for over a century and a half. With Magnús' death, the Outer Hebrides were brought back {{under the control of the}} Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, whose kings tactfully recognised Norwegian sovereignty. In 1156, the kingdom was partitioned following an inconclusive sea battle between the warlord Somhairle mac Gille Brighde, and the Manx king Gofraidh mac Amhlaibh: the Outer Hebrides remained under the control of Gofraidh, but the Inner Hebrides were ruled separately by Somhairle. Two years later, Somhairle successfully invaded the Isle of Man, took the throne, and ruled the entire Kingdom of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1164.|$|E

25|$|With {{the happy}} ending, all {{the role of}} all the main {{characters}} is transformed. They all start out as figures on the margins or even outside of city-state society, {{but at the end}} they assume more conventional roles within that society. Glykera turns from a concubine with unclear citizenship into a citizen wife. Polemon, a mercenary soldier with changing alliances, becomes a settled husband and polis citizen. Pataikos, a childless widower, assumes a position {{at the head of a}} family, and even Moschion will turn from a philandering young <b>man</b> <b>into</b> a respectable husband.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Stuart Woolf, {{in close}} {{collaboration}} with Levi, translated If This Is a <b>Man</b> <b>into</b> English, {{and it was}} published in the UK in 1959 by Orion Press. Also in 1959 Heinz Riedt, also under close supervision by Levi, translated it into German. As one of Levi's primary reasons for writing the book was to get the German people to realise what had been done in their name, and to accept at least partial responsibility, this translation was perhaps the most significant to him.|$|E
25|$|Once the Ludendorff Bridge was captured, the Americans needed {{additional}} bridges as backups to the structurally weakened Ludendorff Bridge, and to {{get more}} troops and armor across the Rhine so they could expand and defend the bridgehead. On 8 March at 3:00 pm, they began constructing the first bridge. To procure the necessary bridge-building supplies, the First Army's 1111th Engineer Combat Group sent a <b>man</b> <b>into</b> Antwerp, where the supplies were dispatched by train to the front.
