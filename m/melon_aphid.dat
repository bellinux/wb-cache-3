40|$|Resistance {{breakdown}} {{has been}} observed following the deployment of plant cultivars resistant to pests. Assessing the durability of a resistance requires long-term experiments at least at a regional scale. We collected such data for melon resistance conferred by the Vat gene cluster to <b>melon</b> <b>aphids.</b> We examined landscape- level populations of Aphis gossypii collected in 2004 – 2015, from melonproducing regions with and without the deployment of Vat resistance and with different climates. We conducted demo-genetic analyses of the aphid populations on Vat and non-Vat plants during the cropping seasons. The Vat resistance decreased the density of aphid populations in all areas and changed the genetic structure and composition of these populations. Two bottlenecks were identified in the dynamics of adapted clones, due to the low levels of production of dispersal morphs and winter extinction. Our results suggest that (i) Vat resistance will not be durable in the Lesser Antilles, where no bottleneck affected the dynamics of adapted clones, (ii) Vat resistance will be durable in south-west France, where both bottlenecks affected the dynamics of adapted clones and (iii) Vat resistance will be less durable in south-east France, where {{only one of the}} two bottlenecks was observed...|$|R
5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the <b>melon</b> (cotton <b>aphid)</b> Aphis gossypii, spirea aphid Aphis spiraecola, and black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown citrus aphid Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic fungi {{are being}} used as {{biocontrol}} agents of insect pests, but their efficacy can be poor in environments where water availability is reduced. In this study, the potential to improve biocontrol by physiologically manipulating fungal inoculum was investigated. Cultures of Beauveria bassiana, Lecanicillium muscarium, Lecanicillium longisporum, Metarhizium anisopliae and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus were manipulated by growing them under conditions of water stress, which produced conidia with increased concentrations of erythritol. The time-course of germination of conidia at different water activities (water activity, a(w)) was described using a generalized linear model, {{and in most cases}} reducing the water activity of the germination medium delayed the onset of germination without affecting the distribution of germination times. The germination of M. anisopliae, L. muscarium, L. longisporum and P. fumosoroseus was accelerated over a range of a(w) levels as a result of physiological manipulation. However, the relationship between the effect of physiological manipulation on germination and the osmolyte content of conidia varied according to fungal species. There was a linear relationship between germination rate, expressed as the reciprocal of germination time, and a(w) of the germination medium, but there was no significant effect of fungal species or physiological manipulation on the a(w) threshold for germination. In bioassays with M. anisopliae, physiologically manipulated conidia germinated more rapidly on the surface of an insect host, the <b>melon</b> cotton <b>aphid</b> Aphis gossypii, and fungal virulence was increased even when relative humidity was reduced after an initial high period. It is concluded that physiological manipulation may lead to improvements in biocontrol in the field, but choice of fungal species/isolate will be critical. In addition, the population-based threshold model used in this study, which considered germination in terms of physiological time, also called hydrotime, could have general application in mycology and environmental microbiology...|$|R

40|$|Current anticholinesterase {{pesticides}} {{were developed}} during World War II and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) in insects and in mammals. A sequence analysis of AChEs from 73 species and a three-dimensional {{model of a}} malaria-carrying mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) AChE (AgAChE) reported here show that C 286 and R 339 of AgAChE are conserved {{at the opening of}} the active site of AChEs in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. Both residues are absent in the active site of AChEs of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse.

The four insects are house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, and German cockroach. The discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito AChEs rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria. Anti-AgAChE pesticides can be designed to interact with R 339 and subsequently covalently bond to C 286. Such pesticides would be toxic to mosquitoes but not to mammals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fertilization {{levels for}} {{ornamental}} crops may influence pest population dynamics, crop quality, and pest management strategy. We examined {{the effect of}} fertilization on population growth and within-plant distribution of <b>melon</b> or cotton <b>aphid,</b> Aphis gossypiiGlover, on potted chrysanthemum, Dendranthema grandiflora (Tzvelev). In terms of pest management implications, we also investigated the effect of fertilization {{on the number of}} insecticide applications needed to control A. gossypii on potted chrysanthemum. Population growth rate of A. gossypii increased with fertilization levels from 0 to 38 ppm N and reached a plateau from 38 to 488 ppm N. Increased fertilization beyond 38 ppm N, 10 % of the commercial standard, did not result in higher aphid number. Aphids responded to nutrient availability of plants by distributing themselves in areas with higher level of nitrogen. More aphids were found in the apical and middle strata of the plants than the basal stratum, which had the lowest nitrogen content. Leaf nitrogen content increased with increased fertilization level and was consistently higher in the apical and middle strata than the basal stratum. Increased fertilization from 0 to 375 ppm N did not result in higher number of insecticide applications. All three insecticides (bifenthrin, kinoprene or pymetrozine) were effective in keeping the aphid infestation below a pre-determined level, five aphids per plant, but pymetrozine required the least number of applications. For chrysanthemum, a fast-growing crop and heavy utilizer of nitrogen, increased fertilization shortened the time to flowering, which would allow growers to harvest their crop sooner and reduce the time for aphid population growth...|$|R

Aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae) {{are some of the}} most serious and damaging insect pests, because they cause direct damage by feeding directly on crops and indirectly damage them through virus transmission (Blackman and Eastop 2007). In Iraq, aphids seriously impact several greenhouse crops, especially cucumber, eggplant, tomato and potato (Tarek 2013). The <b>melon</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis gossypii), the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), the potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) and the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) are four of the most common and important aphid pest species of greenhouse crops in Iraq (Jasman et al. 2016). All these aphid species are extremely polyphagous and vectors of large numbers of plant viruses (Chan et al. 1991). Chemical insecticides are the most common control method of aphid species, but their use results in insecticide residues, high levels of insecticide resistance and high costs (Bielza 2008; Gao et al. 2012). These difficulties in using synthetic insecticides to manage aphid populations have led to a growing interest in novel and effective alternatives like biological control including the use of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF).|$|E

This report demonstrates the formation and solidification of in āere (in air) produced stylet sheaths by six hemipteran families: Diaphorina citri (Psyllidae, Asian citrus psyllid), Aphis nerii (Aphididae, oleander/milkweed aphid), Toxoptera citricida (Aphididae, brown citrus aphid), Aphis gossypii (Aphididae, cotton <b>melon</b> <b>aphid),</b> Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Aleyrodidae, whitefly), Homalodisca vitripennis (Cicadellidae, glassy-winged sharpshooter), Ferrisia virgata (Pseudococcidae, striped mealybug), and Protopulvinaria pyriformis (Coccidae, pyriform scale). Examination of in āere produced stylet sheaths by confocal and scanning electron microscopy shows a common morphology of an initial flange laid down {{on the surface of}} the membrane followed by continuous hollow core structures with sequentially stacked hardened bulbous droplets. Single and multi-branched sheaths were common, whereas mealybug and scale insects typically produced multi-branched sheaths.

Structural similarity of in āere sheaths are apparent in stylet sheaths formed in planta, in artificial diets, or in water. The use of 'Solvy', a dissolvable membrane, for intact stylet sheath isolation is reported.

Among the melon genetic resources, Vat is a unique gene conferring resistance to both the <b>melon</b> <b>aphid</b> Aphis gossypii and the viruses it carries. The ‘virus side’ of this pleiotropic phenotype is seldom regarded as an asset for virus control. Indeed, the effect of Vat on virus epidemics in the field is expected to vary according to the composition of aphid populations in the environment and long-term studies are needed to draw a correct trend. Therefore, the first objective of the study was to re-evaluate the potential of Vat to reduce viral diseases in melon crops. The second objective was to investigate the potential of Vat to exert a selection pressure on virus populations. We monitored the epidemics of Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) in two melon lines having a common genetic background, a resistant line (R) and a susceptible line (S), in eight field trials conducted in southeastern France between 2011 and 2015. Vat had limited impact if any on WMV epidemics probably because A. gossypii is not the main vector of WMV in the field, but a favorable impact on CMV, yet of variable intensity probably related to the importance of A. gossypii in the total aphid population. Vat had a significant impact on CABYV epidemics with mean incidence reduction exceeding 50 % in some trials. There was no effect of Vat on the structure of virus populations, both for the non-persistent WMV transmitted by numerous aphid species and for the persistent CABYV transmitted predominantly by A. gossypii...|$|E

Biological control of A. solani using the generalist aphid predator Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani) was assessed {{in a series of}} greenhouse experiments. Here, the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), was also included because aphid pests can co-occur. Experiments showed that A. aphidimyza perceives aphid colonies located on new growth of plants (meristems or top leaves) to be of higher value as oviposition sites compared to other plant locations. Aulacorthum solani-infested plants, with aphids primarily present on lower leaves or flowers, received fewer eggs than M. persicae-infested plants. In trials using a single innundative release of the predator, this translated to more variable control of A. solani compared to M. persicae (12 - 80 % vs. 78 - 95 %, respectively; tested across several stages of plant growth). This is likely partially attributable to apparent competition, since control of A. solani was significantly improved in the absence of alternate prey. Entomopathogenic fungi were assessed as another biocontrol option against aphids, including the <b>melon</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis gossypii Glover. Novel isolates of fungi originally collected from aphid hosts were sought to potentially increase pathogenicity. However, no isolate tested, commercial or novel, resulted in acceptable mortality of 1 st instar aphid nymphs, with all LC 50 values > 700 conidia/mm 2 under ideal lab conditions. Control options for A. solani and multi-species aphid infestations are discussed in light of the results presented in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Resource {{provisioning}} as {{a habitat}} manipulation tactic {{to control the}} <b>melon</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis gossypii, by the polyphagous aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani, was investigated in the ornamental, potted-plant nursery using the shrub Photinia x fraseri as a plant host. Floral food resources from an invasive, Conium maculatum, an ornamental, P. x fraseri, and a native, Salvia apiana considerably improved the longevity and fecundity of A. colemani in laboratory experiments. Additionally, floral nectar from P. x fraseri and honeydew from A. gossypii had a statistically similar effect on the longevity, fecundity, percent emergence, and sex ratio of A. colemani and enhanced the parasitoid more than extrafloral nectar from Cucurbita pepo. In common garden field studies, A. colemani remained for the entire seven days tested in the presences of resources while {{in the absence of}} resources, the parasitoid was detected for only 3 days. Further field studies using floral food of P. x fraseri, honeydew of A. gossypii, and a flowers x aphids treatment were conducted to determine the effects on the abundance and movement of the parasitoid in a common garden. Significantly more parasitoids were initially associated with flowers x aphids treatment 24 h post release. This was followed by a switch to the aphids treatment 1 week later. Parasitoids were found in both the treatment plots and associated crop plots (no resources) suggesting that A. colemani moves in search of resources and may be switch-foraging to maximize fitness. Imidacloprid, a systemic insecticide commonly used in nursery systems, was detected in the xylem, nectar, pollen, and leaves of P. x fraseri treated with a full or half label rate. The concentration of imidacloprid detected in the xylem and nectar was greater than the determined LC 50, LC 75, and LC 90 of imidacloprid for A. colemani. Bioassay data suggested the survival of the parasitoid is negatively impacted by feeding on nectar from imidacloprid treated plants. No effect was observed when the parasitoid was exposed to leaves from imidacloprid treated plants. These findings suggest that soil-applied imidacloprid is moderately compatible with biological control due to toxicity occurring through contact with nectar from treated plants rather than direct exposure...|$|E
