40|$|Throughout its history, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} accused of violating antitrust {{law in a}} range of different ways—restricting television broadcasts, limiting coaches’ salaries, and capping the amount of athletic scholarships. Most recently, in the case of White v. NCAA, a class of plaintiffs argued that the NCAA’s artificial limitation on student-athlete compensation violated antitrust law.

The NCAA is now considering a proposal— the <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Expense</b> Allowance (“MEA”) —that would raise the NCAA’s artificial cap on athletics-related financial aid by $ 2000.

40|$|In January 2015, the Power Five Conferences of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{passed a}} new policy to change the {{procedure}} by which the amount of athletic financial aid is calculated and provided to student athletes (Sherman, 2015). Policy 15. 02. 2 of the NCAA Regulation Handbook states that institutions can provide athletic financial aid based {{on the cost of}} attendance rather than the cost of living (National Colligate Athletic Association, 2017). The previous policy allowed for institutions to provide cost of living aid, including total cost of tuition, books, supplies, and meals (National Colligate Athletic Association, 2012). The new ruling adds transportation, childcare, disability costs, and <b>miscellaneous</b> personal <b>expenses</b> in the calculations when figuring the total amount of athletic financial aid to be provided to student athletes (National Colligate Athletic Association, 2017). University financial aid offices are responsible for calculating the full cost of an athlete’s attendance (New, 2015). This allows each institution to interpret the policy and decide how much financial aid to provide to the student athletes. San Jose State University’s (SJSU) Athletic Department implemented Policy 15. 02. 2 for the 2015 / 2016 academic year using funding from the university. This initial funding was provided as a one-time allotment, with subsequent monies for full cost of attendance being the responsibility of the Athletic Department (Murray, 2015). San Jose State Athletics has been responsible for funding cost of attendance following the one-time allotment (Poch, 2017). With a limited athletics budget, does offering cost of attendance packages to student athletes benefit the university through improved athletic performance and more winning games or events? Does the higher cost-of-attendance financial support promote financial fairness and just compensation to the student athletes receiving this aid? Does the university receive any downstream deliverable benefits that justify the increased cost, such as increased freshman enrollments following a winning season, or increased donations to the Spartan Foundation and the Athletic Department to support the increased cost of athletics...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care to about 4. 7 million veterans primarily through its medical facilities [...] which include hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics, {{and other health care}} facilities [...] and by contracting for care with other healthcare providers. To lower costs, increase access, and improve the quality of care provided to eligible veterans, VA evaluates the efficiency of its medical facilities, which includes performing studies to determine whether increased savings and efficiencies can be obtained from outsourcing certain segments of its operations. We have previously reported that VA would benefit from examining certain aspects of its operations, including its medical and laundry facilities, to determine if operational efficiencies could be achieved through consolidations, competitive sourcing, or both. While VA has the authority to conduct cost comparison studies and, when beneficial, to enter into contracts with commercial providers, VA may only finance cost comparison studies with funds that are legally available for this purpose. Under a provision in Title 38 of the U. S. Code, VA is prohibited by law from using any one of its Veterans Health Administration (VHA) appropriations for medical care, medical and prosthetic research, and medical administration and <b>miscellaneous</b> operating <b>expenses</b> [...] which fund VHA's operations [...] to conduct cost comparison studies unless the Congress specifically makes these appropriations available to conduct such studies. The Title 38 cost comparison funding prohibition also provides that no employee compensated from these VHA appropriations may carry out any activity in connection with such studies unless the Congress makes these appropriations specifically available for that purpose. In light of this, Congress asked us in April 2004 whether the limitations imposed by the Title 38 cost comparison funding prohibition applied solely to those studies conducted pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A- 76, Performance of Commercial Activities, which provides policies and procedures for determining whether commercial activities should be performed in-house using government resources or under contract with private contractor resources. If not, the request further asked whether the prohibition applied to such studies conducted as part of VA's Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) process. In our October 2004 legal opinion, we concluded that the Title 38 cost comparison funding prohibition was not limited to standard A- 76 cost comparison studies in particular, or A- 76 studies in general, and that the prohibition applies to CARES cost comparison studies. We further concluded that if VA had in fact obligated the VHA appropriations for the unavailable purpose of conducting cost comparison studies, then it would have violated the purpose statute. However, we noted in the opinion that we had not simultaneously undertaken an audit to determine if VHA had used these appropriations for this purpose. We met with VA headquarters officials and obtained information and documentation regarding cost comparison studies performed as part of CARES and other cost comparison studies performed during fiscal years 2001 to 2004. The information and documentation VA provided in response to our audit inquiry, however, were limited because VA does not maintain comprehensive, centralized data on the number and type of activities related to cost comparison studies conducted in the past or currently underway. Because of this, we limited the scope of our evaluation to determine whether VA improperly used VHA medical care appropriations in the three areas in which VA reported that cost comparison activities were performed: (1) VA's CARES process, (2) VA's evaluation of its medical center laundry facilities, and (3) the 1, 626 cost comparison studies referenced in VA's fiscal year 2002 Performance and Accountability Report (PAR). ...|$|R
30|$|First, {{reforms to}} the tax and fee systems in rural areas have been {{comprehensively}} carried out in order to effect overall rural reforms. In 2004, subsidies were extended to grain farmers and special taxes on agricultural products, excluding tobacco, were abolished throughout China. In 2005, the livestock tax was completely rescinded nationwide, and the agricultural tax was rescinded in 592 key counties for national poverty alleviation and development work. The agricultural tax was completely rescinded nationwide in 2006, thus ending the thousand year history of grain taxes on Chinese farmers. This resulted in a fundamental change to the distribution relationship {{between the state and}} farmers. Since 2006, the nation has entered a new era in rural tax reforms, one characterized by institutional reforms to townships, reform to the compulsory education system in rural areas, reforms to the county and township financial management system, etc. In 2007, the national government mandated compulsory education in all rural areas and forced local governments to cover both tuition and <b>miscellaneous</b> education <b>expenses</b> under the social security system. Second, the government has steadily promoted VAT reforms. Pilot VAT reforms were launched in eight major industries throughout Northeast China in September 2004. This reform was then expanded to more than 20 industrial cities in central China in 2007. It was planned that all of China would be covered by the reforms in 2009. Third, there have been new steps taken in income tax reforms. Great {{progress has been made in}} the reform of corporate income taxes. The unification of tax codes on both domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises in China on January 1, 2008 ushered in an era of equal enterprise taxation. The personal income tax threshold on wages and salaries was adjusted from 800 to 1600 yuan on January 1, 2006, further adjusted to 2000 yuan on March 1, 2008, and to 3500 yuan in 2011. There have also been adjustments to the progressive taxation scale, the classification range, and levels of taxation. Fourth, the government has rolled out financial and taxation policies conducive to saving resources and energy and developing new energy sources, and resource taxation policies have been improved. Beginning in Xinjiang in the second half of 2010, the government has implemented reforms to the calculation of resource taxes on crude oil and natural gas based on their prices instead of quantities. After a period of adjustments, this policy was extended nationwide in 2011, and will be extended to all resources in 2012. Fifth, pilot reforms to property tax on personal homes were launched in Shanghai and Chongqing in 2011. The scope of this pilot reform will be expanded once sufficient experience has been accrued. This reform is closely related to the establishment of local tax systems and the long-term healthy development of the real estate industry. It is an integral step in the optimization of distribution of income and property allocations. Sixth, business taxes have been replaced by the VAT, with Shanghai carrying out the pilot reform in January 2012. About ten provinces or cities across the country are expected to follow suit after August 2012. This reform was implemented for several reasons. One was to eliminate the double levying of business taxes. Another was to stimulate and guide those enterprises within the market affected by business tax and to eliminate the tendencies of taxes being “small but all-inclusive” or “large and all-inclusive”, and to reduce the actual tax burden and form economic incentives for upgrading, thereby boosting consumption, expanding domestic demand and optimizing industrial structure. Seventh, in response to the global financial crisis, the central government implemented structural, macroeconomic tax reductions and selectively reduced the tax burden by half on small and medium enterprises in 2009. Also, the income tax threshold on small and micro businesses was raised from to 5000 Yuan to 20, 000 Yuan in the second half of 2011. These measures have been instrumental for cyclical compensation, in improving the business environment and improving the people’s livelihoods. Eighth, the central government passed a number of laws and regulations in the realm of tax collection and administration in 2004, such as the New Law of the Administration of Tax Collection. These measures were intended to strengthen taxation, improve normalization and promote continuous tax revenue growth.|$|R
