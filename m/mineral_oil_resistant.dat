40|$|Recycled {{cellulosic}} paperboards {{may include}} <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> after the recycle process, which {{together with their}} poor water resistance limit their use as food packaging materials. In this work, we demonstrate that a proper functionalization of the recycled paper with two successive polymer treatments, imposes a <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> migration barrier and simultaneously renders it waterproof and grease resistant, making it an ideal material for food contact. The first poly (methyl methacrylate) treatment penetrates the paper network and creates a protective layer around every fiber, permitting thus {{the transformation of the}} paperboard to a hydrophobic material throughout its thickness, reducing {{at the same time the}} <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> migration. Subsequently, the second layer with a cyclic olefin copolymer fills the open pores of the surface, and reduces the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> hydrocarbons migration at levels below those proposed by the BMEL.

The hypotheses for the study were (1) a combination of microbial- and phyto-remediation would yield a best remediation strategy, and (2) the addition of low levels (10 mg/L) of a biosurfactant would stimulate and increase the rate of remediation by increasing the bioavailability of the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> in the soil. The results indicate, on average, a higher rate of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> removal occurred in planted lysimeter tanks versus non-planted lysimeter tanks. Specifically, for unplanted treatments an average of 22 % of the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> was removed in 24 weeks in comparison to the planted treatments for which an average of 54 % of the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> was removed. The effect of application of fertilizer on <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> degradation was unclear, but a visual inspection showed that vegetated tanks receiving fertilizer had better growth. No conclusions can be made regarding the addition of biosurfactant. Though a couple of the lysimeter tanks receiving biosurfactant performed relatively well, overall, the results were inconclusive.

40|$|THE use of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> as a {{laxative}} {{has been}} reported to interfere with the absorption of vitamin A. If this is true, its use should be restricted. Since {{it is one of the}} most commonly used laxatives, its effect deserves further study in order to determine whether it is a valuable or pernicious substance. Dutcher, Ely and Honeywell (1927) fed rats limited amounts of vitamin A and varying amounts of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and found that growth of rats was prevented when the oil was added to the diet. They are of the opinion, therefore, that <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> acts as a solvent for vitamin A, carrying it out of the system. Burrows and Farr (1927) also have reported losses of vitamin A when <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> was added to an adequate diet and believe that <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> depletes the system of its store of vitamin A. Mellanby (1928) on the other hand believes the effect of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> to be due to inter ference with the absorption of bile salts. He has shown that bile salts form a stable emulsion with the <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and are, therefore, lost to the system and digestion is impaired when bile salts are not absorbed. He believes that the bile salts act as a hormone for pancreatic secretion or are the vehicles by which secretin is carried through the intestinal wall.

40|$|<b>Mineral</b> <b>oil</b> {{migration}} from cardboard packaging into foodstuffs {{is recognized as}} a serious problem for the consumers. Within this study, a fast automated method for the determination of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> permeation through barrier films was developed. The method is using 15 defined standard substances representing <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> chemistry instead of complex <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> mixtures. The developed method {{can be used for}} the evaluation of the barrier properties for polymer films regarding <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> components from paper and cardboard packaging materials. For all investigated permeants and polymer films, the logarithm of the permeation rates and the logarithm of the vapour pressure result in a linear correlation. The correlation can be used to compare the permeation properties of different barrier films. From the results of this study, it can be concluded that 12 m oriented polyethylene terephthalate or 15 m oriented polyamide are effective barriers towards <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> components. The b arrier effect of pure polyolefin films is negligibly poor because the permeation is too fast and the lag time is in the range of a few hours at 40 °C. As a consequence, the migration of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> components from cardboard can be significantly reduced if inner layers of good barrier materials such as polyethylene terephthalate or polyamide are used...|$|R

This anomalous behavior sharply contrasts with the polystyrene without <b>mineral</b> <b>oil,</b> which at lower temperatures absorbs much less solvent.

40|$|A key {{trend in}} the PVC market is to replace or {{decrease}} the amount of phthalate plasticisers used due to increasing health concerns. Therefore, the demand for non-phthalate based plasticisers is growing rapidly. <b>Mineral</b> <b>oils</b> are used {{in a variety of}} rubber and polymer applications as plasticisers; however, due to the lower polarity their applicability in PVC compounds is limited. Therefore, these materials are typically used as secondary plasticiser along with a primary for the purpose of improved properties and cost reduction. Some of the non-phthalate based solutions are fast fusing plasticisers, which act like solvents and have too rapid and too high plasticizing effect. This makes the compounding difficult and could cause problems in production. These substances have good compatibility with <b>mineral</b> <b>oils,</b> and using them together in PVC compounds can help the compounding issue by reducing the solvent power and increasing the fusion time to a level where the production parameters are similar to compounding with phthalates.   The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the use of <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> as a secondary plasticiser in a non-phthalate system for PVC. Four different grades of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and three non-phthalate plasticisers were used in compounding and compression moulding of PVC sample films.

40|$|For {{ecological}} purposes, cardboard {{packaging material}} is largely produced using recycled paper. Swiss {{studies have shown}} that cardboard boxes made from recycled material can contain significant portions of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil.</b> The <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> stem from printing ink which is commonly used in newspaper printing. If foods such as rice are packaged in such cardboard boxes, it is possible that increased amounts of <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> can migrate from the cardboard to the foodstuff. Due to the large portion of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> fractions with short chain and aromatic hydrocarbons, such contaminations of foodstuffs are adverse. Short chain hydrocarbons are more easily taken up by the body. Frequent intake of such contaminated foodstuffs can thus lead to exceedances of the toxicological limit values. Animal {{studies have shown that}} <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> mixtures with low viscosity are stored in the body and can lead to accumulations and damage in the liver, heart valves and lymph nodes. As a result of this data, the Federal Insti-tute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in its assessment {{came to the conclusion that}} there is an ur-gent need to minimise the migration of <b>mineral</b> <b>oils</b> to foodstuffs. In order to reduce this substance migration, the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV) has asked BfR to recommend possible courses of action. For foodstuffs that are especially prone to contamination with <b>mineral</b> <b>oils,</b> BfR provides the op-tion to use inner bags in order to prevent substance migration from the cardboard box.

The present test results predict that the antiwear and extreme pressure properties in case of the selected commercially available <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> are better than neat castor oil.

Fire codes often require that transformers inside buildings use a less flammable liquid, {{or the use of}} dry-type transformers with no liquid at all. <b>Mineral</b> <b>oil</b> is also an environmental contaminant, and its insulating properties are rapidly degraded by even small amounts of water.|$|R
