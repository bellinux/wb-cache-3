40|$|AbstractThis paper {{introduces}} a linear relaxation of the matroid <b>matching</b> problem, called the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> problem. When the matroid <b>matching</b> problem {{is in fact}} a matroid intersection problem, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope coincide. When the matroid <b>matching</b> problem {{is in fact a}} <b>matching</b> problem in a graph, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and the classic fractional <b>matching</b> polytope of the graph coincide. Thus, the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope may properly contain the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope. The fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope is a lattice polyhedron and, although its extreme points are not all integral, they are half-integral. This paper establishes strong relationships between extreme points of the fractional matroid <b>matching</b> polytope and those of graphic fractional <b>matching</b> polyhedra. Despite these strong relationships, adding the rank 1 inequalities does not define the matroid <b>matching</b> polytope. In fact, even the <b>matching</b> polytope of a graphic matroid is not generally described by adding these inequalities...|$|R
