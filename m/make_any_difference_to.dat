On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61. Singapore has until 14 June to submit to the ICJ its comprehensive and compelling rebuttal to Malaysia’s application.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E

In {{the first two}} essays I focus on developing country settings (Tanzania and Nepal respectively) to study how rural villagers form their social networks, and how {{the existence of these}} informal links impacts their welfare. The third essay focuses on the international trade of arms to investigate whether the political orientation of government in power <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> arms export policy...|$|R

The mysterious man speaks in an enigmatic way, but his words do not seem to <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> Wayno, who murders a woman in a casino restroom shortly after the mysterious man tells him to [...] "surprise him" [...] by leaving the casino rather than following the woman into the restroom.|$|E
500|$|When {{the former}} Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to Maunsell’s N15 {{specification}} in February 1925, the Southern Railway {{decided to give}} names to all express passenger locomotives. Because of the railway's association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, John Elliot suggested {{that members of the}} N15class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: [...] "Tell Sir Herbert [...] I have no objection, but I warn you, it won't <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the working of the engines". Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell's permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No.E453, was given the first name and christened King Arthur. The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as [...] "Urie Arthurs"; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the [...] "Eastleigh" [...] and [...] "Scotch Arthurs".|$|E
500|$|Blunt's third studio album titled Some Kind of Trouble, was {{released}} on 8 November 2010. The album debuted at number four in the UK with over 100,000 copies sold in the first week. The album's first single [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was released}} on 27 October 2010. The single did much better in Europe than the UK, sitting at number two on the European Airplay Chart for five consecutive weeks, but only charting at number 37 in the UK top 40. The second single from the album, [...] "So Far Gone" [...] was released in the UK on 3 January 2011. The third single from the album, [...] "If Time Is All I Have" [...] was released in the UK on 4 April 2011. Overall critical reception has been mixed, with Allmusic saying, in a positive review, that [...] "Some Kind of Trouble {{is a step in}} the right direction for Blunt, a move toward love songs free of pretension" [...] whilst BBC Music felt [...] "When all's said, Some Kind of Trouble is not a terrible record by any means, but there's little sense that Blunt has advanced, and equally little sense that it'll <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> his bottom line." ...|$|E

I think that public participation and interaction are now a routine part {{of all kinds of}} news media and it’s also become a regular fixture in our teaching about journalism at the LSE. But what difference does it make? In this guest article by LSE student and Polis intern Claire Manibog, first published on her blog, she looks at whether being networked <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the idea of insider/outsider journalism.

40|$|The authors {{surveyed}} zoning {{boards in}} the over 100 {{of the largest}} U. S. cities to determine the occupational composition of board members. It {{comes as no surprise}} that the boards are overwhelming populated with white-collar citizens, with business owners and real estate development the most prevalent occupations represented. The authors then conducted a survey of citizens to determine whether this skewed board composition <b>makes</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> <b>to</b> the decision-making process. The study concludes that the composition of the board does matter, but not always in ways one might predict...|$|R

40|$|Exploring the {{experiences}} of early to mid-twentieth century British theatre-makers in Russia, this book imagines how these travellers interpreted Russian realism, symbolism, constructivism, agitprop, pageantry, dance or cinema. With some searching for {{an alternative to the}} corporate West End, some for experimental techniques and others still for methods that might politically inspire their audiences, did these journeys <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> their practice? And how did distinctly Russian techniques affect British theatre history? Migrating Modernist Performance seeks to answer these questions, reimagining {{the experiences}} and creative output of a range of, often under-researched, practitioners. What emerges is a dynamic collection of performances that bridge geographical, aesthetic, chronological and political divides...|$|R
