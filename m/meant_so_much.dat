It was then that Galis decided to pursue a professional career in Greece's Basket League. Later, while playing in Greece, he would be offered NBA contracts by the Celtics and the New Jersey Nets. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, FIBA did not have professional status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the national team level. Since playing for the Greek national team <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to him, he stayed in Greece.

25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare.

Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

60|$|I {{told you}} before that the holiest was called the oracle, not because in a strict sense the whole of it was so, but because such answer of God was there, as {{was not in the}} outward temple, but I think that the ark and mercy-seat were indeed more {{especially}} that called the oracle; 'for there I will meet with thee,' saith God, and from above that 'I will commune with thee' (Exo 25:22).

2500|$|The late (Sunni) theologian Mawdudi (founder of Jamaat-E-Islami) {{wrote that}} the {{establishment}} of the caliphate as (essentially) a monarchy began with the caliphate of Muawiyah I. It wasn't the kind where Muawiyah was appointed by the Muslims. Mawdudi elaborated that Muawiyah wanted to be caliph and fought in order to attain the caliphate, not really depending upon the acceptance of the Muslim community. The people did not appoint Muawiyah as a caliph, he became one by force, and consequently the people {{had no choice but to}} give him their pledge of allegiance (bay'ah).

Following Hasan ibn Ali's abdication of the caliphate, all the Muslims (including the Sahabah and Tabi'een) gave their pledge of allegiance to Muawiyah I, bringing an end to civil war.

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to the record was generally positive. UK-based Melody Maker viewed The Colour and the Shape {{to be a significant}} American rock release, writing, [...] "The Colour and the Shape is a great rock album at a time when great rock albums are viewed with increasing suspicion." [...] The publication saw the album as leagues ahead of other post-grunge acts: [...] "The first album might have been a collection of loveable songs, but lacked the sheer visceral attack that thrills this time round," [...] wrote Victoria Segal. [...] "An attack that would have [...] almost any other US rock band biting their nails in anguish and embarrassment." [...] Christina Kelly of Rolling Stone was largely positive, although she singled out Norton's production as distracting: [...] "Colour has a big, radio-ready, modern-rock sound. Some might even call the album overproduced: On the ballads, the vocals are overprocessed and fake sounding." [...] Entertainment Weekly praised the band's growth, but criticized the sound journalist David Browne described as [...] "like much current alt-rock: been there, grunged that." [...] In contrast, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described that production as revolutionary: [...] "everything here wound up defining the sound of post-grunge modern rock, and it remains as perhaps the best example of its kind." [...] In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said the music is routine but elevated by Grohl's [...] "marital breakup content/concept," [...] allowing him to [...] "fully inhabit the music that <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to him and millions of other Kurt Cobain fans."

40|$|The {{urban area}} {{that is the subject}} of the study, is in the {{northern}} part of Bucharest. It is an area that used to be rural up to the end of the 19 th century and became part of the city only after the urbanisation plan of the northern areas, when it was integrated in the “new” road system of bulevardul, which linked the city to the countryside. The regular weave of the boulevards - Bulevardul Aviatorilor, Iancu de Hunedoara and Calea Dorobantilor - defines the space where, starting from about 1985, the quarter was developed. The counterposition between these two green spaces, either public or private, and the solid structure of the buildings also leads the subject-user to considerations about temporality. The mutability of the greenery recalls the concept of transitory, <b>meant</b> not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as its ontological meaning but as an aesthetic expression which communicates a condition of fleetingness, through specific expressive codes. Which aspect of our present allows picking up and modulating time, making its movement perceptible, better than nature? Then perhaps, the public greenery and the private one introduce with strength the space-time dimension, the feeling of the ephemeral in a place where, on the contrary, conveys values of substantiality, constructive solidity, balance, uniformity and individualism at the same time...|$|R
5000|$|Dean’s {{understanding}} of the term incorporates both other forms of governance {{and the idea of}} mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham’s, and Kerr’s approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham’s approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population 1999:19. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one {{way of looking at the}} practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: [...] "Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts..." [...] 1999:212. This reflects that the term government to Foucault <b>meant</b> not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups 1999:12.|$|R

Between 1925 and 1935, the General Education Board appropriated over $5million to Black {{liberal arts colleges}} and universities. Immediately after the announcement of Rosenwald's gift, McKenzie wrote the General Education Board requesting Fisk's inclusion among the recipients of the fund. McKenzie request noted that [...] "colored citizens of the United States constitute not only {{a tenth of the}} population, but are the most needy and least provided for large group in that population." [...] He also highlighted Fisk's unique contribution within Black education, noting that as the nation's largest private Black university, Fisk [...] "hopes that the quality of its work and the correctness of its ideals will also justify you in providing an adequate endowment for its teacher salaries." [...] After suggesting that a $1,000 annual increase for fifty of Fisk's faculty would help secure and retain [...] "the best possible teachers," [...] McKenzie requested that Fisk be granted [...] "at least a million dollars for teachers' salaries," [...] and declaring [...] "we believe that this institution that has <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to the nation should be placed in the front ranks of those to be endowed by Mr. Rockefeller." [...] In May 1920, the General Education Board granted Fisk $500,000 towards a campaign of $1million [...] "to be set aside and maintained inviolate by Fisk University as endowment, the income to be used in providing permanently or increases in teachers' salaries. Fisk was to raise matching funds of $500,000 including a condition that Fisk raise $50,000 in Nashville. As a result, McKenzie engaged with White community groups more fully than any previous Fisk president, becoming a member of the Kiwanis Club, the Chamber of Commerce, {{and the director of the}} Community Chest. He attended luncheons, hosted groups on Fisk's campus and frequently spoke at organizational gatherings. A calculated strategy, his outreach led to [...] "white friendship for the school that was stronger than during any preceding administration."

After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going to send you the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put the phone down, thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it <b>meant</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation.
