50|$|Merluccius is a genus of <b>merluccid</b> <b>hakes</b> {{from the}} Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, where mainly found {{relatively}} deep.|$|E
50|$|Predators of dories include large sharks {{such as the}} {{dusky shark}} (Carcharhinus obscurus) and other requiem sharks, and larger shelf- and slope-dwelling bony fish, such as predatory Moehau, and <b>merluccid</b> <b>hakes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) is a <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> of {{the genus}} Merluccius, found in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, {{along the coast of}} Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The Panama hake (Merluccius angustimanus) is a <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> of {{the genus}} Merluccius, found off {{the west coast of}} the Americas from Del Mar, California, to Ensenada de Tumaco, Colombia.|$|R
50|$|Lyconodes argenteus is {{a species}} of <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> so far known only from the {{southeast}} Atlantic Ocean near to South Africa. This species grows to 4.5 cm in total length.|$|R
50|$|Macruronus is a genus of <b>merluccid</b> <b>hakes.</b> Most {{are found}} in {{southern}} oceans off Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, but M. maderensis (which {{is in need of}} taxonomic review) is only known from Madeira. Members of this genus reach 1 - 1.3 m in length depending on the exact species involved.|$|E
50|$|Orange roughy are {{generally}} sluggish and demersal; they form aggregations {{with a natural}} population density of up to 2.5 fish per m2, now reduced to about 1.0 per m2. These aggregations form in and around geologic structures, such as undersea canyons and seamounts, where water movement and mixing is high, ensuring dense prey concentrations. The aggregations are not necessarily for spawning or feeding; the fish are thought to cycle through metabolic phases (active or feeding and inactive or resting) and seek areas with ideal hydrologic conditions to congregate during each phase. They lose almost all pigmentation while inactive, when they are very approachable. Predators include large, deep-roving sharks, cutthroat eels, <b>merluccid</b> <b>hakes,</b> and snake mackerels.|$|E
50|$|Slimeheads are pelagic spawners; that is, {{spawning}} aggregations {{are formed}} {{and the fish}} release eggs and sperm en masse directly into the water. Evidence of oceanodromy (seasonal migration) is seen in some species. The fertilized eggs (and later the larvae) are planktonic, floating with the currents until the larvae develop the strength to determine their own way. Only the economically important species have had their reproduction studied in any detail; the larvae and juveniles of Darwin's slimehead are pelagic and frequent rather shallow waters near the coast, whereas in orange roughy, the early life stages are apparently confined to deeper water (around 200 m). Slimeheads are very slow-growing and long-lived fish; the orange roughy ranks among the longest-lived animals known, with a maximum reported age of 149 years (however, this age is disputed). Predators of slimeheads are not well known, but include large deep-roving sharks, cutthroat eels, <b>merluccid</b> <b>hakes,</b> and snake mackerels.|$|E
50|$|The silver hake, Atlantic hake or New England hake, Merluccius bilinearis, is a <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> of {{the genus}} Merluccius, found in the {{northwest}} Atlantic Ocean. It is highly predatory and typically feeds on fish and crustaceans.|$|R
5000|$|Merluccius merluccius (European <b>hake)</b> is a <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> of {{the genus}} Merluccius. It {{sometimes}} was called the [...] "herring hake", perhaps because it often feeds on Atlantic herring, so {{is likely to be}} netted along with herring. This is consistent with a 19th-century account: ...|$|R
5000|$|Merluccius paradoxus, the deep-water Cape <b>hake,</b> is a <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> of {{the genus}} Merluccius, found in the {{south-eastern}} Atlantic Ocean, {{along the coast of}} Southern Africa, south of Angola. Its range extends in decreasing abundance around the southern coast of Africa and into the Indian Ocean, but it is at its most plentiful in the cold, nutrient-rich fishing grounds of the Benguela Current.|$|R
50|$|Merluccius gayi is a <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> of {{the genus}} Merluccius, with two subspecies, the South Pacific hake (M. g. gayi) and the Peruvian hake (M. g. peruanus), found in the {{south-western}} Pacific Ocean, {{along the coast of}} South America, from Peru (Merluccius gayi peruanus) to the Chilean coasts north to the Chilo√© Archipelago. During the Southern Hemisphere summer, it migrates southwards in shallow waters, while in the winter, it lives more to the north, in far deeper waters.|$|R
50|$|The blue grenadier, hoki, blue hake, New Zealand whiptail, whiptail or whiptail hake, Macruronus novaezelandiae, is a <b>merluccid</b> <b>hake</b> of {{the family}} Merlucciidae found around {{southern}} Australia and New Zealand at depths of between 10 and 1000 m. It feeds in midwater on small squids, crustaceans, and fish. Its length is between 60 and 120 cm. It is a slender, silvery fish similar in appearance to the gemfish. The meat of the fish is white and almost always sold in filets.|$|R
