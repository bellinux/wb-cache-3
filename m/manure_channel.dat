40|$|Productivity in Swedish pig {{production}} is high, but unfortunately so are production costs, {{especially those of}} labour and of buildings. The piglet producing herds allocate {{about a quarter of}} their total working time for the work operation scraping manure (including supervision). In addition to being labour consuming, the workers also consider that manure scraping is heavy and hard work. Problems with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), especially in the upper extremities, are also a reality for today's workers in animal production, especially for women. Since women mainly work in the farrowing and lactation units in Swedish pig herds, farrowing pen design deserves special attention. In this study, working time and workload for two different work operations in the farrowing unit, was studied in 16 herds. The purpose was to obtain more knowledge about the workload of workers in modern farrowing pens and to use this knowledge to develop recommendations to prevent injuries among the workers. The herds were visited on 1 - 2 occasions per herd. One of the herd selection criteria was that the herds had farrowing pens which were built after year 2000. There were 7 herds with pens for farrowing, lactation and nursery (until 25 kg) periods (pen type A, without a protective gate system) and 9 herds with pens for farrowing and lactation (pen type B, with protective gate system). In the present study, previously conducted observations were supplemented with details about the gate structures, closures, piglet corners, gaps to remove manure etc. Two working operations, "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals “(WO 1), where manure scraping and control of the piglets were combined, and "Handling of piglets” (WO 2), where the time required to capture and mark all piglets in the pen with a colour marker on zthe back, were studied. The working operations were carried out continuously in a number of farrowing pens per unit. The time spent on the various work elements within the work operation was registered using a portable handheld computer (PSION). Both work operations were performed by the same person in all herds (person 1). Similarly, all the work time registrations using the hand computer were carried out by the same individual (person 2) in all the herds. The following work elements were recorded: transport outside the pen, transport inside the pen, work with pen gates, manure scraping from inside the pen, manure scraping from outside the pen, work with boards, work with creep area, work with handling of the pigs (catching each pig, lifting them up, marking them on the back with a colour marker). Using a digital camera, the different work elements in the two working procedures were videotaped. Observation studies of the video recordings were used to carry out detailed analyses of the workload and to visualize and identify the movements and postures used in the studied work procedures. To analyze the work postures in the different work lements, the program WinOWAS was used. WinOWAS is based on 84 so-called “basic type work positions” after evaluations of the positions of the back (4 positions), the arms (3 positions) and the legs (7 positions). The various “basic type work positions” are, depending on the degree of work load, classified in one of four action categories (higher score corresponding to higher load). For the various work elements, the program calculated the percentage of time in each action category. Classification of load was also made for the weight of the burden that was handled (20 kg) (Figure 1). To calculate the load on the different body parts, the program 2 DSSPP (2 D Static Strength Prediction Program) was used. The study estimated the torque (Nm) as a measure of the mechanical stress on the shoulder and lumbar spine (Figures 2 and 3) for the work elements: “Manure Scraping (keeper inside the pen) " and "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) ". The load of the work element "Manure Scraping (keeper outside the pen) " was calculated when reaching with the scraper either 150 cm or 200 cm. The study showed that there was a wide variation in the farrowing pen designs. In addition to variation in size, many different solutions for equipment details were found. How well the solutions functioned would have significant impact on the work time and work load for the different work elements. For example, the design of the gate locking system (Figure 4) affected how quickly the opening and closing of the gates could be done. In some of the farrowing pens, retractable wooden boards were used instead of gates (Figure 5). In these pens, the keeper normally stepped over the wall when entering the pens during the daily manure scraping routine. From a work load perspective, it would be a disadvantage to have to climb over a wall instead of being able to walk through a gate. In some pens, the gates in the dung alley between the pens were designed with a low "threshold", so that the keepers had to deal with both a gate and climbing over a low wall (Figure 6). The time spent manure scraping was not only affected by the pen hygiene but also how the manure was scraped into the <b>manure</b> <b>channel</b> (Figure 7). Having flaps in the slatted floor often were perceived as a problem because they often were not sufficiently durable. Openings in the slats under the gate between the pens in the <b>manure</b> <b>channel</b> appeared to be the most valued solution. In many of the herds manure scraping was not done in the whole pen every day. On certain week days, only the concrete area in the pen was cleaned and the manure moved out onto the slatted area. The actual manure scraping work was most often carried out from inside the pen but sometimes it was done from the inspection alley (Figure 8). In {{order to be able to}} scrape from the inspection alley, the pen had to be “facing forward” i. e., the solid floor had to be placed adjacent to the inspection alley and the slatted floor had to be relatively large so that the solid area did not become too wide. For the work operation “Handling of piglets” the capturing of the piglets was facilitated if the pigs could be gathered in a piglet corner. Most of the type A pens were equipped with a permanent board which could be closed to lock in the piglets. In pen type B such permanent “closing in” devices for the piglets were missing. Instead, loose boards, which were moved from pen to pen, were hooked onto metal profiles on the pen wall. The average time for the work operation WO 1 "Removal of manure and monitoring the animals“, was a little longer (0. 95 min) in the type A-pens (no protective gate system and 64 % solid floor), than in the type B-pens (0. 76 min) (with a protective gate system and 52 % solid floor). However, the difference between the pen types was not statistically significant (Table 1). Type A-pens were scraped predominantly from inside the pen (98 % of the cases), while type B-pens more often were scraped from the inspection alley (55 % of the cases). The mean time for “Handling of piglets” (WO 2) was slightly shorter in type A-pens (1. 38 min) without protection devices, compared with the type B-pens (1. 50 min) with a protective gate system. The difference was not significant (Table 1). Work with pen manure scraping from inside resulted in a work load score of 1. 50, as compared to that of 1. 83 when the pen scraping was done from the inspection alley, because particularly the spine is subjected to greater stress when the pen manure is scraped from outside. Capturing and colour marking the pigs involved both bending and twisting the back, and this work element was therefore the most stressful one in the work operation WO 2, with a work load score of 2. 65 (Table 3). In Figure 10 it is shown that, for WO 1, a shorter working time often has to be "paid for" by a higher work load. Despite a numerically longer working time (although not significant) for WO 1 in pen type A, a significantly lower work load for this work operation (WO 1) and pen type was registered, as compared to that for the type B-pen (Table 3). The relationship between working time and work load for WO 2 was reversed. A tendency towards a shorter working time for WO 2 in the type A-pens resulted in there being a tendency to a higher work load in this pen type (Table 4, Figure 11). The mechanical load on the shoulders and back was alculated for the work element "manure scraping" when the keeper either carried out the work from inside the pen or from the outside (Figure 12). When scraping pen manure from outside, the work load according to two different depths (150 and 200 cm) of how far the keeper had to reach as a maximum, was compared. Maximum work load on both the shoulders and the back was obtained when the keeper had to scrape pen manure from outside, extending to a maximum of 200 cm (Table 5). Farrowing pens with partly solid floors will always require a certain work time for manure scraping. As expected, the study showed that the work time for “removal of manure and monitoring the animals” (WO 1) was longer (0. 95 min per pen) in type A-pens, with a higher proportion (64 %) of solid pen flooring compared with the type B pens (0. 76 min per pen), with a smaller proportion (52 %) of solid flooring. However, the variation between the different herds was large, and the difference was not significant. The results suggested that it was not only the relationship between the solid and the slatted areas in the pen that affected the pen manure scraping working time. In type B-pens, it was possible to reach and scrape the solid floor from the inspection alley outside the pen. This was because the solid floor was not as wide/deep as in pen type A. Thus, no working time for opening gates was needed. However, in the studies of work load, it was concluded that it was more stressful to scrape pen manure from outside (score 1. 83), compared with inside the pen (score 1. 50). To scrape pen manure from outside meant more bending and more twisting of the back, compared to carrying out this work element inside the pen. The biomechanical calculations showed that it could be up to four times more burdensome, especially for the back, to scrape pen manure from outside than inside. The work load depended on how far into the pen the keeper needed to reach with the scraper. The height of the pen wall and the location of the solid pen area in relation to the inspection alley were other factors affecting this work load. The results were interesting and should provide ground for reflection among the people in managerial positions in our pig producing herds. Together with an achievable positive and wanted rationalization of the work with manure scraping in the newer farrowing pens, the work with scraping has actually become more of a burden for the keepers. Given that reports of MSDs problems already are many, the result was somewhat alarming. In conclusion, the "new" Swedish farrowing pens appear to be more competitive in terms of working time for the work element “manure scraping”, but the work with manure scraping that remains becomes more of a burden. For the employees, this does not directly mean something positive. Instead, the overall work load increases at the same time as an employee manages to clean a larger number of farrowing pens. This condition means that the requirements for a good and well planned work organization in future pig-producing herds, so that the staff do not risk injuries in the future, will be even higher. It is suggested that the modern, large-scale agriculture make use of the experience gained in other industries. Job rotation and alternation between work tasks is recommended as being important components of future organization on pig farms to reduce occupational injuries among the pig keepers...|$|E
40|$|In this {{literature}} review, measures {{of reducing the}} ammonia (NH 3) emissions from pig production are described, with focus on systems {{that can be used}} under Swedish conditions. The entire production chain with feed, housing, manure storage and application on the field is described and taken into consideration. However, in order to limit the study, the production of crops for feed is not included. As compared to many other countries, emissions of NH 3 in Swedish pig production are already low, due to low protein levels in the feed, housing systems with a small excretory area, and storage of slurry outside the building. Lowering the crude protein level from 14. 5 % to 12. 5 % would reduce NH 3 emission by 20 % from the pig house. Including fiber in the feed, leads to a shift from nitrogen in the urine towards more nitrogen in the faeces. In combination with removing the manure daily from the pig house, this might give opportunities for reducing NH 3 emissions. A reduction in NH 3 emission of up to 50 % might be possible. However, using fiber leads to higher methane (CH 4) emissions (from animal and housing), and therefore this should be combined with biogas production. More research is needed in this field. Adding acids or salts to the feed could reduce NH 3 emission by up to 40 %, while also improving feed conversion efficiency. Of course, good practice when preparing the feed must be followed. By applying multi-phase feeding and feeding according to the sex of the animals, NH 3 emissions could be reduced by 5 - 15 %. By reducing feed spillage, offering a good environment for the pigs and maintaining good pig health, nitrogen losses could also be reduced with about 5 – 15 %. The importance of having clean pens is also discussed in {{this literature}} survey. Swedish housing systems, having a relatively high percentage of solid flooring (with some bedding) and a small excretory area in the pen, provides an opportunity for reducing NH 3 emissions from the housing system. However, one prerequisite for this is that the pigs keep the pens clean, and therefore the room temperature should not be too high. This means that during hot periods, the air has to be conditioned before entering the pig house, e. g., by taking in the air via channels under the building. Removing manure daily by means of scrapers (reduction up to 40 %) and cooling the manure under the slats (reduction up to 50 %) are measures that are already implemented in Swedish pig production. The effect of air temperature, air flow and ventilation system are also discussed. Cleaning the exhaust air using bio-filters (up to 65 % reduction), bio-scrubbers (up to 70 % reduction) and chemical scrubbers (up to 96 % reduction) is also an option. By only purifying the exhaust air from the manure channels, the costs for this method can be reduced substantially. The emissions of CH 4 and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from the housing system are also discussed. Removal of the manure under the slats appears to reduce CH 4 emission from the building. The use of deep-litter bedding may in many cases result in high N 2 O emissions. More research is needed in this field. Treating the manure with sulphuric acid, in combination with aeration and re-circulation in the pig house, can reduce NH 3 emissions by up to 70 %. Pumping slurry between different compartments in a pig house is not allowed according to the Swedish Welfare Legislation. Therefore it is not certain that the acidification of slurry, inside the pig house, can be applied in Sweden. Anaerobic treatment of biogas production, as another treatment of manure, may not reduce NH 3 emissions when storing and spreading the manure, but it results in increasing the nitrogen availability for the crops. In that way nitrogen losses can be reduced since less nitrogen has to be spread per hectare. Besides, biogas production reduces odour problems as well as emissions of green house gas (GHG) by the production of energy and lower CH 4 emissions. Aerobic treatment of manure, can reduce the emissions of NH 3 and GHG. However, poorly controlled aeration processes can have the opposite effect. Storage of slurry in a tank having a cover lid has been pointed out in many investigations, to be the easiest and most effective way of reducing NH 3 and CH 4 emissions. The straw used for fattening pigs is mainly consumed by the pigs, and it is rare that a naturally stable crust will be developed on the slurry. However, within piglet production a crust on the slurry tank is often found. This crust can cause problems when the slurry tank is covered. Technical solutions have to be developed to solve this problem. On pig farms, the main crops are cereals, and the slurry is mainly applied either in the spring during tillage work, or band spread in the early summer on growing cereals. Incorporation of the slurry, e. g., by harrowing in the spring, effectively reduces the NH 3 losses if it takes place as soon as possible after spreading, preferably directly or at least within 4 hours after spreading. Another possibility is to band spread the slurry onto the growing cereals because the canopy provides a microclimate which reduces the NH 3 losses, as compared to spreading on a bare field. Late application during the vegetation period or spreading before the autumn sowing, often results in lower nitrogen utilization by the plants, and thereby higher risks of nitrogen leakage. Due to interactions between different sources on a farm, reduction in NH 3 emission from the individual sections of the livestock production system cannot be simply added to give the net reduction in emission from the total system. Thus a whole farm system approach is needed for devising control strategies for reducing NH 3 emission. Four scenarios were evaluated in this report. Scenario 1 consists of: Reduction of the crude protein in the feed from 14. 5 % to 12. 5 %, relatively simple technique inside the pig house to reduce NH 3 emission, covering the slurry tank and new technique when spreading manure. Scenario 2 consists of: Using biproducts from industry (16. 5 % crude protein instead of 14. 5 %) and cleaning of exhausting air, covering the slurry tank and new technique when spreading manure. Scenario 3 comprises conditions similar to those of Scenario 1, including high dietary feed fiber content in combination with biogas production. Scenario 4 comprises conditions similar to those of Scenario 2, including high dietary feed fiber content and in combination with biogas production. Preliminary calculations indicate that the scenarios may reduce emissions by 47 - 68 %. It {{should be pointed out that}} the calculations are still very uncertain. The calculations show that Scenario 3 appears to be the most effective way of reducing NH 3 emissions. So the combination of using low protein feed with high fiber content together with the production of biogas appears to be a promising method for future development. Even Scenario 1, which used only simple techniques, has a significant result: lowering the protein content affects the entire chain from feed to the field. From the literature review, it can be concluded that one should consider whole farm systems when trying to reduce NH 3 emissions. Having a roof on the manure storage, using band spreading together with incorporation, e. g. harrowing, within a few hours after spreading, are the most important and easiest ways of reducing NH 3 losses. When discussing the method of animal keeping, feeding and housing, a low protein level in the feed has a positive effect along the entire production chain, and appears to be the most effective means of reducing NH 3 emissions. Using more fiber or acids/salts in the feed will reduce the NH 3 emission even more. When biproducts from industry are used in the pig feed, cleaning the exhausting air from the <b>manure</b> <b>channel</b> may be an option. More research is needed before recommendations can be given...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of three manure pit additives in commercial scale <b>manure</b> <b>channels</b> and simulated outdoor storage. The additives were American BioCatalysts (ABC), Pit Boss (PB) and Westbridge (WB). Results from two sets of indoor trials were combined to provide eight replicates of each additive. The protocol consisted of manure accumulation, pretreatment and treatment. Air and slurry samples were taken on Days 28 and 35 of the treatment phase. The outdoor phase that followed determined if residual effects resulting from indoor treatment existed. Manure was transferred from the <b>manure</b> <b>channels</b> to outdoor storage lagoons where it was stored in simulated lagoons. Samples were taken on Days 49 and 63. In terms of odour threshold reduction, the additives' effectiveness varied from producing no reduction to reductions of 66 %. The 66 % reduction produced by PB in the outdoor trial was the only significant odour threshold reduction in the experiment. During indoor storage, the additives produced minor odour threshold reductions. The additives were able to promote H 2 S reductions of 14 to 76 % and consistent yet minor NH 3 reductions in the indoor trials. None of the additives produced practical reductions in Total Solids or solubilization that could have improved manure-handling ease. Perhaps the strongest attribute of all of the additives was the ability to maintain elevated nutrients and micronutrient levels. Higher levels of TKN were maintained by all of the additives and the ability of the additives to maintain nitrogen in the available form, especially on Day 35 representing a potential of 9 to 25 % more available nitrogen during field application. Likewise, the additives resulted in 4 to 23 % more P while promoting elevated ortho-phosphate levels during the indoor trial. Improvements in nutrient value were also observed in potassium, copper and zinc results. Only with respect to waste strength reduction was the effectiveness of the additives relatively poor. In order to make more progress in the field of manure pit treatment, research must be directed towards understanding the modes of action of manure pit additives. With this information, optimization of their performance would lead to better results. Note:Page 81 is missing...|$|R
