25|$|The {{principal}} <b>maritime</b> <b>customs</b> ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (all in Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Béjaïa), and Bône (Annaba) (in Algeria); and Tripoli (in Libya). At such ports generally, the imports {{were off}} loaded {{and transferred to}} a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed wharehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The amount imposed varied, usually five or ten percent. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy.

25|$|Yet the dynasty rallied. Chinese {{generals and}} {{officials}} such as Zuo Zongtang led {{the suppression of}} rebellions and stood behind the Manchus. When the Tongzhi Emperor came to the throne {{at the age of}} five in 1861, these officials rallied around him in what was called the Tongzhi Restoration. Their aim was to adopt western military technology in order to preserve Confucian values. Zeng Guofan, in alliance with Prince Gong, sponsored the rise of younger officials such as Li Hongzhang, who put the dynasty back on its feet financially and instituted the Self-Strengthening Movement. The reformers then proceeded with institutional reforms, including China's first unified ministry of foreign affairs, the Zongli Yamen; allowing foreign diplomats to reside in the capital; establishment of the Imperial <b>Maritime</b> <b>Customs</b> Service; the formation of modernized armies, such as the Beiyang Army, as well as a navy; and the purchase from Europeans of armament factories.|$|E

2500|$|With the 1911 Revolution, the {{imperial}} system fell, {{but the old}} patchwork salt system survived. In 1913, the President of the young new republic, Yuan Shikai, negotiated with foreign banks a series of [...] Reorganization Loans which were intended {{to shore up the}} central government in relation to the provinces. The foreign banks insisted that the loans were to be repaid from the most reliable sources of government income, that is, the <b>maritime</b> <b>customs,</b> the land tax, and the salt tax. Yuan agreed to set up a joint Sino-Foreign Salt Administration to monitor collection of the salt tax and remit the required portions to foreign creditors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the Imperial <b>Maritime</b> <b>Customs</b> Service, the Salt Administration {{had only a few}} dozen foreign employees and more than 5,000 Chinese ones.

But after 1922, Chinese provincial leaders and local military commanders no longer allowed these funds to leave the territories they controlled; central government salt revenues fell disastrously, though payments to foreign governments continued. The Salt Administration was also useful in organizing and financing army units. The eight regiments under General Sun Li-jen were among the most effective Chinese troops during the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|E

Divided into fifteen volumes, this work covered Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Ocean Archipelagos, and was sub-divided further into sections on geography, topography, water masses, atmosphere, biology, anthropology, and historical geography. Chinese maritime trade gazetteers mentioned a slew of different countries that came to trade in China, such as United States vessels docking at Canton in the [...] "Yuehaiguanzhi" [...] ('Gazetteer of the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Customs</b> of Guangdong') published in 1839 (reprinted in 1935).

2500|$|The Treaty of Nanking, the Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, and two French and American {{agreements}} {{were all}} [...] "unequal treaties" [...] signed between 1842 and 1844. The terms of these treaties undermined China's traditional mechanisms of foreign relations {{and methods of}} controlled trade. Five ports were opened for trade, gunboats, and foreign residence: Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, and Shanghai. Hong Kong was seized by the British to become a free and open port. Tariffs were abolished thus preventing the Chinese from raising future duties to protect domestic industries and extraterritorial practices exempted Westerners from Chinese law. This made them subject to their own civil and criminal laws of their home country. Most importantly, the opium problem was never addressed and after the treaty was signed opium addiction doubled. China was forced to pay 21 million silver taels as an indemnity, which was used to pay compensation for the traders' opium destroyed by Commissioner Lin. A couple of years after the treaties were signed internal rebellion began to threaten foreign trade. Due to the Qing government's inability to control collection of taxes on imported goods, the British government convinced the Manchu court to allow Westerners to partake in government official affairs.

2500|$|During {{the first}} week of June, while the Japanese were {{securing}} Keelung and advancing on Taipei, law and order broke down in Tamsui. [...] On 5 June Tang Ching-sung and several senior ministers boarded the steamship Arthur at Tamsui, intending to escape to mainland China, and it was rumoured that they had with them large sums of money owed in pay to the Chinese garrisons of the northern towns. [...] Large numbers of Chinese soldiers in flight from Keelung had poured into Tamsui on 4 June, and on 5 June a party of soldiers boarded the steamship and extorted $45,000 from its passengers. [...] The money was distributed among the various infantry units present in Tamsui. [...] On the evening of 5 June the gunners of Tamsui's Hobe Fort, indignant that they had been left out of this distribution of spoils, threatened to fire on the steamship unless a suitable bribe was found. [...] The European employees of the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Customs</b> raised the sum demanded ($5,000) during the night and handed it over to the gunners in return for the breechblocks of the fort's four Krupp cannon. The Hobe Fort, the 'lock and key of the northern gate' (北門鎖鑰) as the Chinese called it, had been built only a few years earlier at great expense by the Chinese governor Liu Ming-ch'uan. [...] (citation) It was now effectively disarmed before it had even fired a shot at the Japanese. [...] During the afternoon of 6 June Arthur got up steam and attempted to leave Tamsui, as her captain believed that it was now safe to do so, but was fired on several times by a Chinese field battery. [...] Around fifty Chinese soldiers aboard the steamship were wounded by the exploding shells and several soldiers were killed, including the captain of Tang Ching-sung's bodyguard. [...] The German gunboat , which had been sent to Tamsui to protect the town's European residents, immediately replied, putting the Chinese battery out of action. [...] Arthur left Tamsui that evening with Tang Ching-sung and most of the senior officers of the republic on board. [...] The Chinese troops in Tamsui now began to loot the town, singling out the wealthy foreign residences for immediate attention, but the presence of Iltis and the British gunboat [...] deterred them from making physical attacks upon the foreigners. [...] Order was only restored {{with the arrival of the}} Japanese. [...] On 7 June two Japanese warships entered Tamsui harbour, and their appearance immediately put an end to the looting. [...] On 8 June eighteen Japanese cavalry troopers advanced northwards from Taipei and occupied Tamsui without firing a shot, taking the surrender of several hundred Chinese soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|Steamers came late to {{the upper}} river, the section {{stretching}} from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But [...] summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as an [...] "150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass", posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 – 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70 - 80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver {{through some of the}} most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges. Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built Kuling but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. [...] Kuling was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. [...] In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade {{as long as it was}} restricted to native crafts. [...] In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. [...] Little took up residence in Chongqing and built Leechuan, to tackle the gorges in 1898. [...] In March Leechuan completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. [...] Leechuan was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot. [...] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. [...] Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command. [...] In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. [...] Pioneer was sold to British Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS Kinsha. [...] Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS Suixing ended in catastrophe. [...] On Suixing's maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. [...] In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. [...] Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS Shutung and SS Shuhun. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. [...] Plant was appointed by Chinese <b>Maritime</b> <b>Customs</b> Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. [...] In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. [...] He also wrote Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. [...] Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. [...] Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 - 1919. [...] Between 1918 -1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business. Shutung was commandeered by warlords and Shuhun was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping. In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. [...] The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. [...] In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. [...] One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. [...] Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.|$|E
