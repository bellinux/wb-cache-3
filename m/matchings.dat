25|$|The {{number of}} <b>matchings</b> in a graph {{is known as}} the Hosoya index of the graph. It is #P-complete to compute this quantity, even for bipartite graphs. It is also #P-complete to count perfect <b>matchings,</b> even in bipartite graphs, because {{computing}} the permanent of an arbitrary 0–1 matrix (another #P-complete problem) is the same as computing the number of perfect <b>matchings</b> in the bipartite graph having the given matrix as its biadjacency matrix. However, there exists a fully polynomial time randomized approximation scheme for counting the number of bipartite <b>matchings.</b> A remarkable theorem of Kasteleyn states that the number of perfect <b>matchings</b> in a planar graph can be computed exactly in polynomial time via the FKT algorithm.|$|E
25|$|There are 24 perfect <b>{{matching}}s</b> in the Heawood graph; {{for each}} matching, {{the set of}} edges not in the matching forms a Hamiltonian cycle. For instance, the figure shows the vertices of the graph placed on a cycle, with the internal diagonals of the cycle forming a matching. By subdividing the cycle edges into two <b>matchings,</b> we can partition the Heawood graph into three perfect <b>matchings</b> (that is, 3-color its edges) in eight different ways. Every two perfect <b>matchings,</b> and every two Hamiltonian cycles, can be transformed into each other by a symmetry of the graph.|$|E

This completes the study of inverse problems of the six natural NP-complete problems from [2] and answers an open question from [1]. We classify the inverse complexity of the natural verifier for HAMILTONIAN CYCLE and 3 -D <b>MATCHING</b> by showing coNP-completeness of the corresponding inverse problems.

25|$|Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the Tutte {{polynomial}} can be arbitrarily well approximated {{along the}} positive branch of , equivalently, the partition {{function of the}} ferromagnetic Ising model. This exploits the close connection between the Ising model {{and the problem of}} counting <b>matchings</b> in a graph. The idea behind this celebrated result of Jerrum and Sinclair is to set up a Markov chain whose states are the <b>matchings</b> of the input graph. The transitions are defined by choosing edges at random and modifying the matching accordingly. The resulting Markov chain is rapidly mixing and leads to “sufficiently random” <b>matchings,</b> which can be used to recover the partition function using random sampling. The resulting algorithm is a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (fpras).|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} the BLUE-RED <b>MATCHING</b> problem: given a graph {{with red and}} blue edges, and a bound w, find a maximum matching consisting of at most w edges of each color. We show that BLUE-RED <b>MATCHING</b> {{is at least as}} hard as the problem EXACT <b>MATCHING</b> (Papadimitriou and Yannakakis, 1982), for which it is still open whether it can be solved in polynomial time. We present an RNC algorithm for this problem as well as two fast approximation algorithms. We finally show the applicability of our results to the problem of routing and assigning wavelengths to a maximum number of requests in all-optical rings. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007...|$|R

25|$|A {{matching}} in a graph is {{a subset}} of its edges, no two of which share an endpoint. Polynomial time algorithms are known for many algorithmic problems on <b>matchings,</b> including maximum matching (finding a matching that uses as many edges as possible), maximum weight matching, and stable marriage. In many cases, matching problems are simpler to solve on bipartite graphs than on non-bipartite graphs, and many matching algorithms such as the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for maximum cardinality matching algorithm for maximum <b>matchings</b> in bipartite graphs|journal=SIAM Journal on Computing|volume=2|issue=4|pages=225–231|year=1973|doi=10.1137/0202019}}. work correctly only on bipartite inputs.|$|E

25|$|A second graph-theoretic {{description}} {{of the problem is}} also possible. Once the women have been seated, the possible seating arrangements for the remaining men can be described as perfect <b>matchings</b> in a graph formed by removing a single Hamiltonian cycle from a complete bipartite graph; the graph has edges connecting open seats to men, and the removal of the cycle corresponds to forbidding the men to sit in either of the open seats adjacent to their wives. The problem of counting <b>matchings</b> in a bipartite graph, and therefore a fortiori the problem of computing ménage numbers, can be solved using the permanents of certain 0-1 matrices. In the case of the ménage problem, the matrices arising from this view of the problem are circulant matrices.|$|E
40|$|An induced {{matching}} M of a graph G {{is a set}} of pairwise non-adjacent edges {{such that}} their end-vertices induce a 1 -regular subgraph. An induced matching M is maximal if no other induced matching contains M. The MINIMUM MAXIMAL INDUCED <b>MATCHING</b> problem asks for a minimum maximal induced matching in a given graph. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Here we show that, if P 6 = NP, for any " > 0, this problem cannot be approximated within a factor of n 1 −" in polynomial time, where n denotes the number of vertices in the input graph. The result holds even if the graph in question is restricted to being bipartite. For the related problem of finding an induced matching of maximum size (MAXIMUM INDUCED <b>MATCHING),</b> it is shown that, if P 6 = NP, for any " > 0, the problem cannot be approximated within a factor of n 1 / 2 −" in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that MAXIMUM INDUCED <b>MATCHING</b> is NP-complete for planar line graphs of planar bipartite graphs...|$|R

40|$|The online {{matching}} {{problem has}} received significant attention {{in recent years}} because of its connections to allocation problems in Internet advertising, crowd-sourcing, etc. In these real-world applications, the typical {{goal is not to}} maximize the number of allocations; rather it is to maximize the number of “successful ” allocations, where success of an allocation is governed by a stochastic process which follows the allocation. To address such applications, we propose and study the online matching problem with stochastic rewards (called the ONLINE STOCHASTIC <b>MATCHING</b> problem) in this paper. Our problem also has close connections to the existing literature on stochastic packing problems; in fact, our work initiates the study of online stochastic packing problems. We give a deterministic algorithm for the ONLINE STOCHASTIC <b>MATCHING</b> problem whose competitive ratio converges to (approximately) 0. 567 for uniform and vanishing probabilities. We also give a randomized algorithm which outperforms the deterministic algorithm for higher probabilities. Finally, we complement our algorithms by giving an upper bound on the competitive ratio of any algorithm for this problem. This result shows that the best achievable competitive ratio for the ONLINE STOCHASTIC <b>MATCHING</b> problem is provably worse than that for the (non-stochastic) online matching problem...|$|R
