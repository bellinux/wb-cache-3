Pećanac declined his request and suggested that he <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> Mihailović the chief of staff position and recommended Mihailović's detachments disband and join his detachments. In the meantime, Pećanac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries.|$|E

25|$|In {{the vein}} of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Dolci {{believed}} that conflicts in society were inevitable, but that {{any attempt to}} resolve conflicts by violence or other coercive means would eventually backfire.

25|$|The {{average rate}} of {{accretion}} onto Sgr A* is unusually small for a black hole of its mass and is only detectable {{because it is so}} close to Earth. It was thought that the passage of G2 in 2013 <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> astronomers the chance to learn much more about how material accretes onto supermassive black holes. Several astronomical facilities observed this closest approach, with observations confirmed with Chandra, XMM, EVLA, INTEGRAL, Swift, Fermi and requested at VLT and Keck.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} {{of life in}} extreme conditions has complicated definitions of habitability, but also generated much excitement amongst researchers in greatly broadening the known range of conditions under which life can persist. For example, a planet {{that might otherwise be}} unable to support an atmosphere given the solar conditions in its vicinity, {{might be able to do}} so within a deep shadowed rift or volcanic cave. Similarly, craterous terrain <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> a refuge for primitive life. The Lawn Hill crater has been studied as an astrobiological analog, with researchers suggesting rapid sediment infill created a protected microenvironment for microbial organisms; similar conditions may have occurred over the geological history of Mars.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who might}} {{particularly}} benefit from focal therapy with HIFU are men with recurrent cancer after the gland has been removed. Cancer recurrence rates after surgical resection {{can be as}} high as 15-20%. MR imaging improves early detection of cancer, so MR-guided therapies can be applied to treat recurrent disease. Additionally, for men who have already failed salvage radiation treatment and have limited therapeutic options remaining, interventional therapies <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> more chances to potentially cure their disease. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of these treatments, additional work is needed to further evaluate which patients are best suited for these procedures and determine long-term efficacy.|$|E

25|$|Candidate {{destinations}} included Guiana, {{where the}} Dutch had already established Essequibo, or {{somewhere near the}} existing Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because {{the presence of the}} older colony <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> better security and trade opportunities. It was thought, however, that they should not settle too near, since that might too closely duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company administered a territory of considerable size in the region. The intended settlement location was {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson River. This made it possible to settle at a distance which allayed concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still provided the military and economic benefits of relative closeness to an established colony.|$|E
25|$|On January 23, 1946, CFA {{member and}} {{sculptor}} Lee Lawrie visited the Friedlander workshop with {{an official of}} the National Park Service. They inspected the revised full-size model, and reported to the CFA on January 26 that it was satisfactory. By this time, however, the cost of casting in bronze had nearly doubled in the post-war period to more than $100,000 per statue. The National Capital Region of the National Park Service agreed to dismantle and store the Fraser and Friedlander models until such time as the prices for casting were more reasonable. In the summer of 1947, Fraser surveyed foundries in Europe to see which <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> the least expensive casting. The single response indicated that it would cost $212,000 to cast both of his statues. The Fraser and Friedlander statues were re-approved by the CFA in October 1947.|$|E
25|$|The Greek Army {{continued}} with {{the evacuation of}} the region, but the process slowed down {{out of fear that}} a hasty withdrawal <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> the opportunity to irregular bands to carry out atrocities against the civilian population. As the official position of the Greek government towards the uprising was that of strict neutrality, Prime Minister Venizelos ordered the blockade of the port of Sarandë and prohibited a demonstration in Athens in favor of the uprising. However, it cannot be doubted that the Greek government sympathized with the demands of the Northern Epirotes. In fact, the only way for Venizelos to stop the uprising would have been to declare martial law in the region, but this action would have caused major political instability and the possible resignation of his government. The opposition parties in Greece even accused Venizelos of going beyond what was required of him to comply with the decision of the Great Powers, and instead of simply evacuating the districts, he was handing them over to the Albanians and depriving the Epirotes of any means of resistance.|$|E

25|$|Lord Hasting was not {{averse to}} {{exploiting}} any commercial opportunities {{that access to}} the Himalayan region <b>might</b> <b>offer.</b> He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was {{at this time in}} the throes of a cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems about remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the Company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).|$|E
25|$|Set in a {{realistic}} environment (as {{opposed to the}} more fantastical settings prominently featured in children's programming), certain stories (often in {{second half of the}} episode) may not necessarily focus on the titular protagonist's point of view and may instead detail the experiences and viewpoints of surrounding characters, usually Arthur's schoolmates. Often such episodes will depict those characters handling situations often faced by children in actuality as a means of guiding audiences through those situations, including bed-wetting, asthma or dyslexia, and Arthur's character sometimes may see a reduced role (in some episodes, Arthur himself does not appear in the story at all). Stories in later seasons dealt with more serious issues or subjects, such as cancer or Asperger syndrome, albeit numerous episodes may simply address topics including childhood fears, trends or fantasies. Occasionally a couple of episodes <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> very little educational value at all. In spite of the realistically designed environment, the series may showcase the fantasies or daydreams of a few characters on a number of occasions, and a few episodes features supernatural elements such as ghosts or secret situations unknown to other characters such as Kate and Pal's friendship.|$|E
25|$|Tobin's anti-communism led him {{to attempt}} to {{dismantle}} Local 574, which had led the successful Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. The local (led by Carl Skoglund, Farrell Dobbs and the Dunne Brothers) was avowedly Trotskyist, but had successfully led the union through the general strike. Alarmed at the local leadership's political views, Tobin revoked Local 574's charter {{and set up a}} competing local (Local 500). But after Local 574 secured a jurisdictional agreement in early 1935 from the Minneapolis Central Labor Union, it undertook a wildly successful organizing campaign and thrived. The AFL and the Minnesota Federation of Labor were alarmed at the growth of the Trotskyist-led union, and demanded action. In October 1935, the Teamsters international union passed a resolution denying membership to communists. Tobin also agreed to let an AFL organizer attempt to raid Local 574. The AFL and Local 574 engaged in mutual acts of violence. But {{when it became clear that}} Local 574 could not be raided and that the CIO <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> membership to the renegade local, Tobin convinced Local 574 leader Victor Dunne to merge with Local 500. A year later, the newly formed Local 544 had organized 250,000 truckers in the Midwest and formed the Central Conference of Teamsters. But after several of Local 544's leaders left the organization, Tobin trusted the local in 1941 and ejected the remaining Trotskyist leadership. When the CIO offered the ousted leaders a role in the newly formed United Construction Workers Organizing Committee, Tobin used his influence with the federal government to secure a federal indictment of sedition under the Smith Act. Several of the men were convicted (although most were acquitted or had charges dropped), and the local broken.|$|E

Hamburg was their first such opportunity. Ninety-four white men, including Tillman, were indicted by a coroner's jury, but none was prosecuted for the killings. Butler blamed the deaths on intoxicated factory workers and Irish-Americans who had come across the bridge from Augusta, and over whom he had no control.|$|E
500|$|On 28–29 March 1938, Hitler held {{a series}} of secret {{meetings}} in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten Heimfront (Home Front), the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland. The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovakian government, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia. In April 1938 Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that [...] "whatever the Czech government <b>might</b> <b>offer,</b> he would always raise still higher demands... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly". In private, Hitler considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and {{the mass}} media of being {{involved}} in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population <b>might</b> <b>offer</b> to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control {{of his or her own}} thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, [...] "Project Monarch") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, subliminal advertising, [...] "Silent Sound Spread Spectrum", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses. The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.|$|E
