Bossy was also noted for his clean play, never resorting to fighting (and being one of the first players to speak out against violence on the ice), and winning the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly play three times: 1983, 1984, and 1986.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, 2011, Ohio State {{announced}} that Urban Meyer {{was hired as}} head coach. Despite the program being on probation for NCAA violations and prohibited from appearing in a bowl for the 2012 season, the Buckeyes overcame a rash of injuries on defense in a season reminiscent of 2002 and completed a perfect 12–0 season with a victory over Michigan on November 24, 26–21. In one of the <b>most</b> <b>incredible</b> performances in college football history, Ohio State won the first ever College Football Playoff, with its third-string quarterback, Cardale Jones, after the starter and second-string quarterback were out to injury. Jones had never started in a college game. His first 3 starts were in the B1G Championship Game, the Sugar Bowl, and the National Championship Game. He went 3-0 to win the national championship. Many credit Urban Meyer with this being the best coaching job in college football history.. The next season brought with it expectations of a repeat championship as Ohio State returned many of its starters from the previous year. Ohio State {{would go on to}} compile a 13-1 record, with a crucial loss to Michigan State keeping them out of the College Football Playoff. In 2016, in spite of having the fewest returning starters of any team in the country, Ohio State would go on to win 11 games, but ultimately losing to Penn State in the regular season and Clemson in a crushing 31-0 defeat in the College Football Playoff Semifinal.|$|E

All military pilots, at times, must work under extreme conditions, experiencing high levels of stress, especially in a war zone.

After initial training, the military completely reforms the individual, and in <b>most</b> cases <b>incredible</b> stress management skills are formed.

Lyrically, [...] "A Different Kind of Love Song" [...] alludes to themes of tragedy, heroism and , as noted by Rolling Stone journalist Barry Walters. The song was also treated with different remixes done by producers such as Rodney Jerkins. In an interview with MTV News, Jerkins expressed that he was flattered to be working with Cher.

500|$|In 1848 Alkan was bitterly {{disappointed}} when {{the head of}} the Conservatoire, Daniel Auber, replaced the retiring Zimmerman with the mediocre Marmontel as head of the Conservatoire piano department, a position which Alkan had eagerly anticipated, and for which he had strongly lobbied with the support of Sand, Dumas, and many other leading figures. A disgusted Alkan described the appointment in a letter to Sand as [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>incredible,</b> the most shameful nomination"; and Delacroix noted in his journal [...] "By his confrontation with Auber, [...] has been very put out and will doubtless continue to be so." [...] The upset arising from this incident may account for Alkan's reluctance to perform in public in the ensuing period. His withdrawal was also influenced by the death of Chopin; in 1850 he wrote to Masarnau [...] "I have lost the strength to be of any economic or political use", and lamented [...] "the death of poor Chopin, another blow which I felt deeply." [...] Chopin, on his deathbed in 1849, had indicated his respect for Alkan by bequeathing him his unfinished work on a piano method, intending him to complete it, and after Chopin's death a number of his students transferred to Alkan. After giving two concerts in 1853, Alkan withdrew, in spite of his fame and technical accomplishment, into virtual seclusion for some twenty years.|$|E

Cells communicate each other by direct contact or by releasing factors that, soluble or packaged in membrane vesicles, can reach {{different regions of the}} organism. To date numerous studies highlighted the existence of several types of extracellular vesicles that, differing for dimension, origin and contents, play a role in physiological and/or pathological processes. Among extracellular vesicles, exosomes are emerging as efficient players to modulate target cells phenotype and as new non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tools in multiple diseases. They, in fact, strictly reflect the type and functional status of the producing cells and are able to deliver their contents even over a long distance. The results accumulated {{in the last two decades}} and collected in this chapter, indicated that exosomes, can carry RNAs, microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, DNA, lipids, metabolites and proteins; a deeper understanding of their contents is therefore needed to get the <b>most</b> from this <b>incredible</b> cell product...|$|R

The tour, from the band's point of view, had been put together as a show of unity in the face of consistent accusations of rivalry between the two bands, especially in Europe.

[...] "We set out to reclaim our throne as the <b>most</b> <b>incredible</b> live punk band from you know who," [...] said Cool. Cool contended that [...] "we heard they were going to quit the tour because they were getting smoked so badly... We didn't want them to quit the tour. They're good for filling up the seats up front." [...] Several reviewers were unimpressed with Blink-182's headlining set following Green Day.

A notable feature of the party was its thousands of gold and black helium balloons which reportedly took three days to inflate, and a grand firework display at the end which was reported to have been seen on Majorca. 350 bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne, and a cake in the shape of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia Cathedral were provided for the party, although the original cake collapsed and was replaced with a 2-metre-long sponge with the notes from Mercury's song [...] "Barcelona".|$|E
