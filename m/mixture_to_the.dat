25|$|Most modern road use {{diesel engines}} are {{provided}} with an FRP valve in the intake manifold (usually mistaken {{by some as a}} petrol engine throttle body). In most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engine when the vehicle is switched off, preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen; this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum. In more advanced control systems this FRP valve can be shut by an electronic control unit when it senses runaway scenario.|$|E
25|$|The 138 was {{powered by}} a single Bristol Pegasus engine. This engine {{featured}} a highly powered supercharger, which was a critical element enabling the engine to deliver the required performance in order to attain the envisioned altitude performance. The supercharger's installation, the detail work of which having been performed by Clifford Tinson, was a two-stage system; the first-stage compressor was permanently engaged, but the second-stage incorporated clutches which enabled it to be manually engaged by the pilot upon attaining the correct height. This arrangement was necessary to avoid administering an excessively dense <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cylinders when flown at low altitudes. The supercharger arrangement employed an intercooler {{between the first and}} second stages.|$|E

25|$|The large {{majority}} of known organisms use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. One unique use of catalase occurs in the bombardier beetle. This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes {{the contents of the}} two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats the <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boiling point.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} 119 undelivered aircraft {{were bought}} {{up by the}} British Purchasing Commission and transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan between August and September 1940, and all were operational by November The type was named the Yale Mk.I following British naming practice of naming trainers after education institutions and US-supplied aircraft after American locations, in this case, Yale University, and were used initially as intermediate pilot trainers taking pilots from the de Havilland Tiger Moth and Fleet Finch to the much faster and more complex North American Harvard, until this category was dispensed with as being unnecessary. They were then relegated for use as airborne wireless radio trainers, along with the contemporary Fleet Fort intermediate trainer in 1943. Prior to service entry, the throttle and engine mixture controls were modified from the system used by the French whereby the throttle was pulled back to increase power, and the mixture control pulled back to lean out the <b>mixture,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system used on the Harvard. The Yale appeared in the movie Captains of the Clouds. The RCAF sold all surviving examples off as scrap in 1946 but over 30 survive today {{as a result of}} a large number of them being bought surplus by a single farmer, with about 15 currently in airworthy condition.|$|E
500|$|The tentacles bear cilia (fine mobile hairs) {{on their}} edges {{and along the}} center. The beating of the outer cilia drives a water current from {{the tips of the}} tentacles to their bases, where it exits. Food {{particles}} that collide with the tentacles are trapped by mucus, and the cillia down the middle drive this <b>mixture</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base of the tentacles. A brachial groove runs round the bases of the tentacles, and its own cilia pass food along the groove towards the mouth. The method used by brachiopods is known as [...] "upstream collecting", as food particles are captured as they enter the field of cilia that creates the feeding current. This method is used by the related phoronids and bryozoans, and also by pterobranchs. Entoprocts use a similar-looking crown of tentacles, but it is solid and the flow runs from bases to tips, forming a [...] "downstream collecting" [...] system that catches food particles as they are about to exit.|$|E
