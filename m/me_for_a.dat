500|$|Around 1907, Caion's {{paper was}} hosting poems {{by the young}} Symbolist author George Bacovia (including [...] "Sonnet" [...] and [...] "Pulvis") and art chronicles by Theodor Cornel. Bacovia {{described}} their first encounter, in November 1903, as follows: [...] "Caion [...] was very depressed after his recently completed trial with Caragiale. My solitary presence, without any sort of recommendation from another author, made him receive me with significant reserve. I then communicated the purpose of my arrival, asking for the address of his collaborator, the poet Macedonski. Nevertheless, he still asked <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> handful of poems, the ones later published by his magazine." ...|$|E

500|$|Otto and Edith Frank {{planned to}} go into hiding with the {{children}} on 16 July 1942, but when Margot received a call-up notice from the Zentralstelle für jüdische Auswanderung (Central Office for Jewish Emigration) on 5 July, ordering her to report for relocation to a work camp, {{they were forced to}} move the plan ten days forward. Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and neighbour, Toosje Kupers, a book, a tea set, a tin of marbles, and the family cat for safekeeping. As the Associated Press reports: [...] "'I'm worried about my marbles, because I'm scared they might fall into the wrong hands,' Kupers said Anne told her. 'Could you keep them for <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little while?'" ...|$|E

500|$|Actor Raphael Sbarge became {{attracted}} {{to join the}} series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world {{and the other in}} a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost [...] "in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive." [...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E

500|$|Bannon was 22years {{old when}} she began writing her first pulp novel. She was {{influenced}} by the only lesbian novels she had read, The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall from 1928 and Vin Packer's Spring Fire from 1952, albeit in two different ways: she was unable to relate to the dismal tones in Hall's novel, but as a sorority girl was more familiar with the plot and circumstances of Spring Fire. Bannon said, [...] "Both books completely obsessed me {{for the better part of}} two years." [...] Although recently married and on her way to having two children, she found the books struck a chord in her life and recognized emotions in herself that compelled her to write about them. In the beginning of her marriage she was left alone quite a lot and said, [...] "I was kind of desperate to get some of the things that had been consuming <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time down on paper." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes when we played not so good and we paid for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lifetime, {{but this is a}} different story. It's our turn to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite a few times in Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan Wakefield, in {{his review}} of the book in [...] "," [...] {{questioned}} Pressman's primarily critical description of Erhard's character. [...] Wakefield suggested {{that one of the}} reasons the press or [...] "media" [...] paints a negative view is because [...] "nobody in the media bothers to speak to the people who value in his programs." [...] Wakefield refers to a study done by opinion analyst Daniel Yankelovich in which [...] "seven out of ten participants in The Forum found it to be 'one of their life's most rewarding experiences,' while 94 percent felt the program had 'practical' and 'enduring' value." [...] While Pressman describes the est training as [...] "a mish-mash of self-help theories, common-sense psychology, and dime-store ideas of motivation," [...] Wakefield, who had experienced the est training personally states, [...] "If I was [...] "conned" [...] by that [...] "mish-mash" [...] when I did est in 1984, I'm grateful I was conned into losing the addiction to alcohol that had plagued <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quarter of a century." ...|$|E

500|$|John Albert Taylor {{was born}} in Ogden, Utah to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who {{separated}} during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, including a move to Colorado {{at the age of}} nine, when he was told that his father had died. According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a Vietnam veteran, or his mother: [...] "But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. I was the whipping post." [...] At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather. According to court records, he repeatedly raped and sodomized his sister Laurie during his teens, and raped, and sodomized other young girls, and was committed to a sex offender program. In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song opens with a distinctive, Bach-inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's chorus. Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by {{a variation on the}} song's introduction, which then fades out. The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band's rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial radio stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long. Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes. The lead vocal on The Byrds' version of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan. The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997: [...] "I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him, 'Hey, God, take <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> trip and I'll follow you.' It was a prayer of submission." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver Goldsmith, who had in February 1762 {{published}} The Mystery Revealed, {{may also}} have been responsible for the satirical illustration, English Credulity or the Invisible Ghost (1762). [...] It shows a séance as envisioned by the artist, with the ghost hovering above the heads of the two children in the bed. [...] To the right of the bed a woman deep in prayer exclaims [...] "O! [...] that they would lay it in the Red Sea!" [...] Another cries [...] "I shall never have any rest again". [...] The English magistrate and social reformer John Fielding, who was blind, is pictured entering from the left saying [...] "I should be glad to see this spirit", while his companion says [...] "Your W——r's had better get your Warrant back'd by his L—rds—p", referring to a Middlesex magistrate's warrant which required an endorsement from the Lord Mayor, Samuel Fludyer. [...] A man in tall boots, whip in hand, says: [...] "Ay Tom I'll lay 6to1 it runs more nights than the Coronation" [...] and his companion remarks [...] "How they swallow the hum". [...] A clergymen says [...] "I saw the light on the Clock" [...] while another asks [...] "Now thou Infidel does thou not believe?", prompting his neighbour to reply [...] "Yes if it had happen'd sooner 't would have serv'd <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new Character in the Lyar the Story would tell better than the Cat & Kittens". [...] Another clergyman exclaims [...] "If a Gold Watch knock 3times", and a Parson asks him [...] "Brother don't disturb it". [...] On the wall, an image of The Bottle Conjuror is alongside an image of Elizabeth Canning, whose fraud had so worried Samuel Fludyer that he had refused to arrest either Parsons or Kent.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
