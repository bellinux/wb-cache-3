I see {{he has gone}} to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly {{the best of their}} rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E

500|$|While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and {{two friends}} were {{abducted}} overnight and held at gunpoint {{by a group}} of locals. Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: [...] "It taught <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> come into this world as you leave it, on your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." [...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. Wonderbra rollout {{included}} {{events with}} Eva Herzigová in New York's Times Square. The advertisements were toned down {{in comparison to}} the earlier UK campaign. The U.S. print and billboard advertising showed models wearing only the Wonderbra. Underneath read slogans such as [...] "who cares if it's a bad hair day" [...] and [...] "look me in the eyes and tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love me." [...] The $25 Million campaign worked in conjunction to the ongoing media interest in the bra. Although Playtex promoted the authenticity of their [...] "One and Only Wonderbra", the rapid introduction of competitive products meant that the overall U.S. market benefited from a 43% increase in push-up bra sales by the end of 1994.|$|E
500|$|... "Boy Oh Boy" [...] is a 90s–influenced electropop {{song with}} dancehall and reggae elements. Regarding its style, Stan confessed, [...] "I want to release what I like {{and not to}} follow the trend and speed up the {{creation}} process just because {{something needs to be}} released. [...] is a mixture of [...] styles. I would say it is a more '90s track but with a contemporary feel". On another occasion, the singer described the single as an [...] "old kind of style, but a new style. It's like eurodance." [...] According to her, the lyrical message is [...] " [...] of expressing the girls' need to be loved [...] and sometimes you just need to tell to the guy, 'tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love me'". Jonathan Currinn from CelebMix noted, [...] "As for the meaning behind the song, the lyrics suggest a relationship where a guy is always breaking her heart even though she knows that he actually cares for her. Such a deep emotional message behind this infectious tune." ...|$|E

500|$|When Athens was liberated in October 1944, Harold Macmillan visited Princess Andrew and {{described}} her as [...] "living in humble, {{not to say}} somewhat squalid conditions". In a letter to her son, she admitted {{that in the last}} week before liberation she had had no food except bread and butter, and no meat for several months. By early December the situation in Athens had far from improved; Communist guerillas (ELAS) were fighting the British for control of the capital. As the fighting continued, Princess Andrew was informed that her husband had died, just as hopes of a post-war reunion of the couple were rising. They had not seen each other since 1939. During the fighting, to the dismay of the British, she insisted on walking the streets distributing rations to policemen and children in contravention of the curfew order. When told that she might have been shot by a stray bullet, she replied [...] "they tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't hear the shot that kills you and in any case I am deaf. So, why worry about that?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, prove to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I {{think a lot of}} Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Ester Dean and Alexander Grant, with {{production}} helmed by Grant under his production name Alex da Kid. [...] "Farewell" [...] contains lyrics that revolve around saying goodbye to a lover who {{is not able to}} be physically present in the relationship for long periods of time. Instrumentation consists of a piano. The song was composed in the key of G major and set in common time signature, and has a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocals span from the low note of G3 to the high note of D5. [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine noted that the song's structure was similar to Beyoncé Knowles song [...] "Halo", while Priya Elan for NME wrote that the song was reminiscent of Rihanna's song [...] "Fire Bomb", from her fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). Lipshutz also noted that Rihanna delivered the bridge with [...] "powerhouse" [...] vocals. A reviewer for Flavour Magazine wrote that Rihanna displayed [...] "great vocals" [...] in the lyric [...] "Somebody's gonna miss you... Farewell." [...] Melissa Maerz for Entertainment Weekly wrote that Rihanna [...] "wails" [...] the lyrics [...] "'Even though it kills <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to go/ I know I'd be sadder if you didn't hit the road." ...|$|E

500|$|Later {{that year}} Cros led his brigade, {{as part of}} the 1st Moroccan Infantry Division, at the Second Battle of Artois - an allied attempt to capture Vimy Ridge with an assault on a [...] wide stretch of the front. [...] Cros took {{particular}} care to inspire a keen esprit de corps in his men and {{on the eve of the}} attack told them: [...] "I am your father and you know that I love you as my children, if you want to show <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> love me in return, fight and kill lots of Boche". [...] At 10 AM on 9 May 1915 Cros' brigade advanced in conjunction with the division's 1st Brigade, a French Foreign Legion unit led by Colonel Pein. [...] The five-hour preliminary bombardment was largely ineffective and the division took heavy casualties in reaching the German lines, [...] distant. [...] However they managed to push the Germans out and some units even reached the villages of Vimy and Givenchy-en-Gohelle. [...] The next morning, hit by their own artillery and under German counter-attack, the French were forced to withdraw to their own lines in the course of which Cros was killed. [...] Cros was one of almost 2,000 men of the Moroccan division killed in that action, as was fellow brigade commander Colonel Pein.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though {{he might be a}} bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve was one of several drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1935 {{letter to}} her son, Picasso's mother said: [...] "They tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> write. I can believe {{anything}} of you. If one day they tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> say mass, I shall believe it just the same." [...] That same year André Breton wrote about Picasso's poetry for the French artistic and literary journal Cahiers d'Art, wherein Breton exclaimed that: [...] "Whole pages appear in bright variegated hues like a parrots' feathers." [...] Penrose describes how [...] "..words have been applied as a painter uses colour from his brush." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the McGuinness Flint {{recording}} When I'm Dead and Gone, Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle play kazoos {{in harmony}} during the instrumental break. The New Seekers' live track (Ever Since You Told <b>Me</b> <b>That</b> <b>You</b> Loved Me) I'm A Nut features a kazoo solo by singer Eve Graham.
