5|$|On 20 August 1948, the Jewish National Fund {{called for}} {{building}} a settlement on some of al-Birwa's lands, and on 6 January 1949, Yas'ur, a kibbutz, was established there. In 1950, the <b>moshav</b> of Ahihud was inaugurated on the village's western lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one of al-Birwa's schools, two shrines for local sages, and three houses remained standing as of 1982. One of the shrines was domed and built of stone. Most of the structures stood amid cacti, weeds, olive and fig groves, and mulberry trees. Most of al-Birwa's inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages, including Tamra, Kabul, Jadeidi-Makr, Kafr Yasif, and other localities. Some fled to Lebanon, {{and ended up in}} the Shatila refugee camp, in the outskirts of Beirut, where Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal interviewed them in 1973. Among the refugees of al-Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish, who was born in the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most people}} of Finnish origin in Israel are either Finnish Jews who immigrated to Israel and their descendants, {{a small number}} of Finnish Christians moved to Israel in the 1940s before the {{independence}} and gained citizenship following independence. For the most part many of the original Finnish settlers intermarried with the other communities in the country, and therefore remain very small in number. A <b>Moshav</b> shitufi near Jerusalem named Yad HaShmona meaning the Memorial for the Eight was established in 1971 by a group of Finnish Christian-Israelis although today most members are Israeli and are predominantly Hebrew speakers and the <b>moshav</b> has become a center of Messianic Jews.|$|E

Jewish settlers initially moved into the abandoned Arab houses in the village but left after building more suitable housing further down the coast. According to local legend, when bulldozers tried to knock down the local Maqam (shrine) of Sheikh al-Majrami, the blades of the bulldozers broke. Kibbutz Nahsholim was established by Polish and American immigrants just southeast of the ancient tell in June 1948 while <b>moshav</b> Dor was established by Jewish immigrants from Greece along the southernmost bay in 1949. Kibbutz Nahsholim grows bananas, avocado and cotton, and raises fish in ponds. A plastics factory manufactures irrigation equipment. It also operates a beach resort.|$|E

25|$|On 27 April, an Auster Autocrat {{assisted}} a Haganah force {{take control}} of the evacuated British Tegart fort at Samakh. Fighting intensified {{as the end of the}} British Mandate for Palestine drew near. During the first half of May, the squadron flew 180 sorties, an average of four sorties per pilot per day and as many as nine. These were predominantly reconnaissance, medical evacuation and supply flights, but also included combat missions. On 1 May, the settlement (<b>moshav)</b> of Ramot Naftali came under attack from ALA forces which far outnumbered and outgunned its 45 Jewish defenders. With Operation Yiftah and the battles for Safed underway, there were no ground forces available to provide assistance. The Galilee Squadron came to Ramot Naftali's aid, making nine bombing and strafing sorties against the attacking forces; its aircraft suffered extensive damage from ground fire but forced an Arab withdrawal and saved the <b>moshav.</b>|$|E

25|$|Starting in the 1990s, {{the growth}} of {{high-tech}} companies in Yokneam Illit also brought an influx of Israeli-born residents along with {{an increasing number of}} immigrants from Western Europe, South Africa, North America and South America. During this period, the economic problems of the Kibbutz and <b>Moshav</b> movements led many of the young families in the Megiddo Regional Council to move to nearby Yokneam Illit.|$|E
50|$|Atarot farmers {{supplied}} fruit, {{produce and}} dairy products to Jerusalem. Some of the <b>moshav's</b> fields were located at a distance, which created a security problem during the 1929 Palestine riots and 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine when it residents were shot at, robbed, and besieged.|$|R
