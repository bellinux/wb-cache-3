A newly identified SNARE protein, SNAP- 23, is proposed to mediate vesicle targeting to the plasma membrane in diverse tissues. The current studies were done to determine whether SNAP- 23 is expressed in collecting ducts with an intracellular distribution compatible with a role in aquaporin- 2 trafficking. RT-PCR demonstrated SNAP- 23 mRNA in microdissected collecting ducts and other tubular segments including the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb. Immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody raised against a COOH-terminal peptide revealed a solitary band at an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa in renal <b>medullary</b> <b>membrane</b> fractions and inner medullary collect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the abundance of the apical urea transporter of the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) is regulated in viva by factors associated with altered water balance, immunoblots of rat inner <b>medullary</b> <b>membrane</b> fractions were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the renal urea transporter (RUT) gene product. In inner medullas of Brattleboro rats, which manifest severe chronic water diuresis, a I 17 -kD band was seen, in addition to the previously described 97 -kD band. These two bands were detectable by antibodies directed against two different regions of the RUT sequence. When Brattleboro rats were treated with a 5 -d infusion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by osmotic minipump, the 1 l 7 -kD band was markedly diminished, whereas the 97 -kD band was unchanged. Simultaneous infusion of the diuretic agent furosemide prevented the AVP-induced decrease in th...|$|E
40|$|Anion {{exchange}} {{similar to}} that catalyzed by erythrocyte band 3 occurs across many nonerythroid cell membranes. To identify anion-exchange proteins structurally related to band 3, we immunoblotted rabbit kidney <b>medullary</b> <b>membrane</b> fractions with anti-band 3 antibodies. Immunoblots using antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 revealed cross-reactive proteins in the plasma membrane fraction only. In contrast, two monoclonal antibodies against band 3 membrane domain labeled a 45 -kDa protein; further immunoblotting and immunogold studies of membrane fractions and kidney sections {{using one of the}} anti-membrane domain antibodies showed that labeling was strongest in mitochondria of H(+) -secreting collecting duct cells. Tissue-to-tissue expression of the 45 -kDa mitochondrial protein was variable: kidney medulla greater than heart greater than kidney cortex much greater than liver. We conclude that a 45 -kDa protein with immunological cross-reactivity to the erythrocyte band 3 membrane domain is expressed in mitochondria in a highly cell-specific fashion and speculate that the protein {{may play a role in}} mitochondrial anion transport...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} and {{properties of the}} peptide-transport system in rabbit renal proximal tubule was examined with glycylsarcosine as the substrate and using brush-border-membrane vesicles derived from pars convoluta (outer cortex) and pars recta (outer medulla). The dipeptide was transported into these vesicles against a concentration gradient {{in the presence of}} an inward-directed H+ gradient, demonstrating the presence of a H+-coupled peptide-transport system in outer-cortical as well as outer-medullary brush-border membranes. Even though the transport was electrogenic and was energized by a H+ gradient in both membranes, the system was more active in outer <b>medullary</b> <b>membranes</b> than in outer cortical membranes. Kinetic analysis showed that, although the affinity of the transport system for glycylsarcosine was similar in both membrane preparations, the capacity of the system was significantly greater in outer medulla than in outer cortex. In addition, the pH profiles of the peptide-transport systems in these membrane preparations also showed dissimilarities. The greater dipeptide uptake in one membrane vis-à-vis the other may probably be due to the difference in the affinity of the transport system for H+ and/or the difference in peptide/H+ stoichiometry...|$|R
40|$|Epidermal {{growth factor}} antagonizes {{vasopressin}} in vivo and in vitro. Since EGF causes diuresis through a renal action and may antagonize the hydroosmotic effect of AVP in vitro we investigated the antagonistic action of EGF with AVP in vivo and {{the mechanism of}} the antagonism in vitro. Conscious ewes received i. m. injections of a selective AVP V 2 -receptor agonist (1 -desamino, D-Arg 8 vasopressin acetate, DDAVP) every 12 hours for days 5 to 16. All ewes received an i. v. isotonic saline infusion (100 ml/day) for days 1 to 8 and days 13 to 16, and i. v. EGF in 100 ml saline/day at doses of 0 (N = 8) or 10 (N = 8) µg/hr for days 9 to 12. DDAVP reduced both urine volume and water intake, and increased urine osmolality. In contrast, simultaneous infusion of EGF reversed the DDAVP-induced responses, resulting in a transient negative fluid balance, kaliuresis and a transient natriuresis (all P< 0. 05). When EGF treatment ceased, the effects of DDAVP treatment alone gradually became apparent. From the in vitro studies, the AVP-related peptides displaced specific AVP V 1 and V 2 -receptor antagonist radioligands from rat renal inner <b>medullary</b> <b>membranes,</b> whereas EGF had no effect. However, EGF antagonized AVP V 2 -stimulated cAMP production in a dose-dependent way (IC 50 = 2 x 10 − 7 M). Therefore, the diuretic effect of EGF is not via direct antagonism of the antidiuretic AVP V 2 -receptor but seems mediated by inhibition of the antidiuretic AVP V 2 -receptor second messenger system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Metabolic alkalosis is {{a common}} feature of hypokalemic {{hypertensive}} syndromes associated with angiotensin II excess. The alkalosis-generating effect of angiotensin II is usually ascribed to its stimulatory effect on aldosterone secretion, a hormone that upregulates collecting duct hydrogen ion secretion. We studied the effect of angiotensin II infusions on the expression of B 1 and a 4 protein, subunits of the renal H-ATPase in adrenalectomized rats. Adrenalectomized rats were given either angiotensin II or vehicle for 7 days via osmotic mini-pumps. H-ATPase B 1 protein expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis in isolated medulla and cortex plasma membrane preparations from one kidney, whereas the contralateral kidney was used for immunostaining. By Western blotting, the relative abundance of B 1 protein was 2 -fold higher in renal medulla membranes from rats with intact adrenal glands (sham surgery) than from adrenalectomized rats (21947 %, n 12; P 0. 05). In contrast to renal medulla, adrenalectomy did not significantly alter the relative abundance of B 1 protein in renal cortex. Angiotensin II also did not significantly alter the relative levels of B 1 protein in the cortex, but it increased it significantly in renal <b>medullary</b> <b>membranes</b> (23156 %, n 8; P 0. 005). Moreover, enhanced H-ATPase B 1 subunit protein immunoreactivity was found in medullary collecting duct segments of rats infused with angiotensin II. In contrast to B 1, expression of a 4, another subunit of the H-ATPase was not altered by adrenalectomy or angiotensin II. We conclude that adrenalectomy decreases whereas angiotensin II increases H-ATPase B 1 subunit expression in medullary, but not in cortical collecting ducts. B...|$|R
40|$|Transmural {{stimulation}} of the isolated adrenal gland of the rat and guinea pig results in secretion of catecholamine. The secretion is due to activation of cholinergic receptors of the adrenal medulla by acetylcholine released from splanchnic nerve terminals after transmural stimulation. Our aim was {{to see whether the}} same experimental technique could be used to directly excite the adrenal medullary cell membrane by electrical stimulation and whether such stimulation would result in secretion of catecholamines. We demonstrate here that a single electrical shock to the perfused adrenal gland of the rat results in massive secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine. The secretion {{is directly related to the}} strength and duration of the applied stimulus over a wide range. Catecholamine secretion is unaffected by tetrodotoxin or hexamethonium/atropine but is abolished by Ca 2 + lack or 3 mM Mn 2 +. We suggest that the adrenal <b>medullary</b> <b>membrane</b> undergoes nonpropagated electrotonic depolarization on electric stimulation and thereby voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels are opened to initiate secretion...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of an antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP), d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP, with renal tubular V 2 receptors were studied in <b>medullary</b> <b>membrane</b> preparations from kidneys of Sprague-Dawley and Brattleboro rats. In both rat strains, V 2 receptors had comparable KD and Bmax values for binding of [3 H]AVP. In vitro studies {{revealed that the}} V 2 -antagonist was more potent than cold AVP in displacing [3 H]AVP. In vivo treatment of Sprague-Dawley rats with the antagonist over one week resulted only in a transient state of diabetes insipidus (DI). No specific [3 H]AVP binding was detectable throughout the period of administration. Chronic treatment of Brattleboro rats resulted in a complete normalization of water intake. This agonistic effect was also associated with undetectable [3 H]AVP binding. After stopping the infusion of d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP, Bmax values tended to rise but had still not reached base line values after 6 days. In contrast, the chronic infusion of AVP in Brattleboro rats resulted in a reduction in water intake which {{was accompanied by a}} decreased Bmax. [3 H]AVP binding remained detectable during the entire treatment period. Thereafter Bmax was restored to base line values within 2 days of stopping the infusion. These results suggest that d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP has a high affinity for V 2 receptors in both Sprague-Dawley and Brattleboro rats. Its rate of dissociation from the receptor appears to be much slower than that of AVP. In Brattleboro rats, the binding of d(CH 2) 5 -D-Tyr(Et) VAVP leads to an antidiuretic response. In Sprague-Dawley rats, a transient diuretic response is followed by a progressive normalization in water intake. This occurs despite persistent and complete blockade of renal medullary V 2 receptors...|$|E

At 4 #{ 176 },the binding did not saturate; therefore, equilibrium binding constants could not be estimated. Similar results were obtained with 125 l- 5 CH 23982, a ligand that exhibits 25 -fold higher specific activity, compared with [3 H]SCH 23390. Of 1 1 dopamine receptor ligands used, only (+) -SCH 23390 and (±) -SKF 83566 inhibited the binding of[3 H]SCH 23390, but with very low affinities (lC values of 446 and 635 n, respectively). In stnatal mem-branes, binding of [3 H]SCH 23390 and of 1251 -SCH 23982 followed saturation isotherms.

Thirty-five patients who were submitted to surgery were followed up {{for an average of}} 74 months, Postoperative and final medical conditions were characterized for comparison with MT 1 -MMP immunostainings, performed in surgical paraffin blocks. A value of p <. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results.

40|$|Selective {{estrogen}} receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen (Tam) and toremifene (Tor), {{are widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer. In addition, they have been demonstrated to prevent estrogen deficiency– induced bone loss in postmenopausal women. These effects are thought to be caused by the interaction of the SERMs with the estrogen receptor, although SERMs have also been shown to conduct non–receptor-mediated effects such as rapid changes in membrane functions. We compared the effects of Tam, Tor, and 17 -estradiol (E 2) on the viability of rat osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Both Tam and Tor were found to cause osteoclast apoptosis in in vitro cultures, which was reversed by E 2. In addition, at higher concentration (10 M), both SERMs had an estrogen receptor–independent effect, which involved interaction with the plasma membrane as demonstrated with UMR- 108 osteosarcoma cells by Tam and Tor, but not E 2. A leak of protons leading to changes in intracellular pH was shown both in <b>medullary</b> bone derived <b>membrane</b> vesicles and in intact cells. These effects were followed by a rapid loss of cell viability and subsequent cell lysis. Our results show that both Tam and Tor have an ionophoric effect on the plasma membranes of bone cells and that these SERMs differed in this ability: Tor induced rapid membrane depolarization only in the presence of high concentration of potassium. These non–receptor-mediated effects may be involved in therapeutic responses and explain some clinical side effects associated with the treatment of patients with these SERMs. (J Bone Miner Res 2003; 18...|$|R
40|$|Hog {{anterior}} pituitary secretory granules sediment at 3, 000 g. When rat or rabbit {{skeletal muscle}} actin filaments are present with the granules, the sedimentation decreases markedly. Depolymerized actin or viscous solutions of Ficoll and collagen {{have no effect}} on granule sedimentation. With this assay, actin filaments bind secretory granules (consisting of the proteinaceous core plus limiting membrane), secretory granule membranes, mitochondria, artificial lecithin liposomes, and styrene-butadiene microspheres, but have little or no interaction with membrane-free secretory granule cores and albumin microspheres. A secretory granuleactin complex sedimentable between 3, 000 g and 25, 000 g can be isolated. Metal ions, nucleotides, salts, dithiothreitol, or pretreatment of the granules with trypsin do not destroy the binding, which appears to be a lipophilic interaction. Microfilaments, which resemble skeletal muscle actin filaments in many characteristics, have been found in most nonmuscle mammalian cells (23, 2, 6). The potential importance of microfilaments is underscored by the fact that actinlike material constitutes up to 20 % of total protein in several nonmuscle cell types (23). As a consequence, it has been postulated that actin filaments play a role in many functions, such as transport of secretory granules (10) and neurosecretory vesicles (1), cell movement (27), maintenance of cell shape (27), cell differentiation (30), and fast axoplasmic transport (15). The exact nature of the presumptive interaction between actinlike filaments and cell organelles has not been elucidated. However, Burridge and Phillips (3) have recently reported that both skeletal muscle actin and myosin can be found in association with adrenal <b>medullary</b> secretory granule <b>membranes</b> after mixing, and a definite morphological association has been established between microfilaments and the plasma membrane (2, 4, 22). In this paper a simple system for examining the binding of large particles by microfilaments is detailed, and evidence is presented demonstrating that skeletal muscle actin binds hog pituitary secretory granules and granule membranes in vitro...|$|R
