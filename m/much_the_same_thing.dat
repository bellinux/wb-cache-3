500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's catalog of music was written by Yoshiki with relatively little composition from the other members. hide contributed several songs, including the single [...] "Scars", while Pata's only claim is [...] "White Wind from Mr. Martin ~Pata's Nap~". Toshi's contributions are limited to lyrics for a few songs. Taiji contributed music {{to a couple of}} songs, notably [...] "Voiceless Screaming" [...] from the album Jealousy, for which, when performed live, he played the acoustic guitar, and Desperate Angel. Heath's only writing credit is the instrumental song [...] "Wriggle" [...] on the 1996 album Dahlia, which he wrote with Pata. Only one song is credited as a full band collaboration, [...] "Easy Fight Rambling" [...] on the 1989 album Blue Blood. Of songs from the band's lesser-known former members, only the track [...] "Time Trip Loving" [...] from the single [...] "Orgasm", composed by Jun with Toshi writing the lyrics, was officially released. In 2010 it was reported that Sugizo had written some songs, though no further information has been given since.

2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona told No Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ...

2500|$|From 1948, {{successive}} National Party administrations formalised {{and extended}} {{the existing system}} of racial discrimination and denial of human rights into the legal system of apartheid, which lasted until 1991. A key act of legislation during this time was the Homeland Citizens Act of 1970. This act augmented the Native Land Act of 1913 through the establishment of so-called [...] "homelands" [...] or [...] "reserves". It authorised the forced evictions of thousands of African people from urban centres in South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia) to what became described colloquially as [...] "Bantustans" [...] or the [...] "original homes", as they were officially referred to, of the black tribes of South Africa. The same legislation applied also to South West Africa over which South Africa had continued after World War I to exercise a disputed League of Nations mandate. Apartheid apologists attempted to justify the [...] "homelands" [...] policy by citing the 1947 partition of India, when the British had done <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> without arousing international condemnation.|$|E
2500|$|The Rocky Cut raid set {{the stage}} for the final act of the James–Younger Gang: the famous Northfield, Minnesota raid on September 7, 1876. The target was the First National Bank of Northfield, which was far outside of the gang's usual territory. The idea for the raid came from Jesse and Bob Younger. Cole tried to talk his brother out of the plan, but Bob refused to back down. Reluctantly, Cole agreed to go, writing to his brother Jim in California to come home. Jim Younger had never wanted {{anything}} to do with Cole's outlaw activities, but he agreed to go out of family loyalty. The Northfield bank was not unusually rich. According to public reports, it was a perfectly ordinary rural bank, though rumors persisted that General Adelbert Ames, son of the owner of the Ames Mill in Northfield, had deposited $50,000 there. Shortly after the robbery, Bob Younger declared that they had selected it because of its connection to two Union generals and Radical Republican politicians: Benjamin Butler and his son-in-law Adelbert Ames. General Ames had just stepped down as Governor of Mississippi, where he had been strongly identified with civil rights for freedmen. He had recently moved to Northfield, where his father owned the mill on the Cannon River and had a large amount of stock in the bank. One of the outlaws [...] "had a spite" [...] against Ames, Bob said. Cole Younger said <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> years later and recalled greeting [...] "General Ames" [...] on the street in Northfield just before the robbery.|$|E

2500|$|Over the 20th century, trusts {{came to be}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes beyond the classical role of parcelling out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to be able to save for retirement through occupational pensions. After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, but if people wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement. After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's [...] "pension promise" [...] was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee {{for the benefit of the}} employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report, was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in other financial investments, though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding [...] "units" [...] in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, gilts or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in [...] "tax havens", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a [...] "resulting trust" [...] or (more normally today) a [...] "constructive trust". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity.|$|E

In both these, to be graceful, it is requisite that there be no appearance of difficulty; there is required a small inflection of the body; and a composure of the parts in such a manner, as not to encumber each other, not to appear divided by sharp and sudden angles. In this ease, this roundness, this delicacy of attitude and motion, it {{is that all the}} magic of grace consists, and what is called its je ne sais quoi; as will be obvious to any observer, who considers attentively the Venus de Medicis, the Antinous, or any statue generally allowed to be graceful in an high degree.|$|R

30|$|Once {{everyone}} was learning <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things,</b> assessments to compare their learning {{to what was}} taught followed naturally. Over centuries, as institutions {{and the value of}} their awards increased, it became desirable to standardize ways of measuring student success. Combined with a need to limit costs and increase scalability, this resulted directly in the graded assessment-driven systems we see today (Schneider & Hutt, 2014). Grade-based assessment schemes and measurements of standardized outcomes were efficient and scalable ways to award credentials, given the available technologies up until the Internet age. As well as dire motivational consequences that I will discuss in the next section, the increasing significance of the role of credentialing of learning led to two quite divergent and, largely, mutually exclusive purposes for our educational systems. They had to be not only smart learning environments, but also smart credentialing environments.|$|R

5000|$|According to David Daigle, the Associate Director for Communications, Public Health Preparedness and Response, {{the idea}} arose when {{his team was}} {{discussing}} their upcoming hurricane-information campaign and Daigle mused that [...] "we say pretty <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> every year, in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way, and I just wonder {{how many people are}} paying attention." [...] A social-media employee mentioned that the subject of zombies had come up a lot on Twitter when she had been tweeting about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and radiation.
