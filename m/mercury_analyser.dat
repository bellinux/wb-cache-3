40|$|ARTICLE HAS BEEN RETRACTED BY EDITORIAL OFFICE, UPON AN APPROVAL OF ALL AUTHORS The {{contaminants}} {{present in}} the atmosphere have a substantial impact on public health. Among contaminants, the most important are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This paper {{is focused on the}} possibility of continuous PAHs monitoring and the description of their vertical distribution using filters, which serve to purify the air before the determination of the greenhouse gases (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, CO, ozone) and Hg in air, continuously sampled at 8, 50 and 230 m at the atmospheric station Krešín near Pacov and elaboration of a simple and economical method of extraction of these filters. The station serves as a point for monitoring the occurrence and remote transport of greenhouse gases and selected atmospheric pollutants and for the measurements of basic meteorological characteristics. In December, 17, 2014, a sampling of 16 priority PAHs started and lasted until December, 9, 2015. Samples were taken approximately once a month. The maximum concentration of ΣPAHs was 15. 905 ng/m 3, measured at the height of 8 meters in the period of 11. 2. 2015 – 11. 3. 2015, the concentration of benzo[a]pyrene exceeded the immission limit in the period by more than 50 %. By the sampling, the hypothesis about decreasing concentration of PAHs with increasing height was confirmed, especially the decrease of heavier PAHs. The sampling has shown that it is highly desirable to use the meteorological tower for sampling of PAHs using PTFE filters either by including the active sampler itself, or by using pre-filters for tropospheric ozone and gaseous elemental <b>mercury</b> <b>analysers.</b>  </p...|$|R

40|$|Total gaseous mercury was {{collected}} at ten sites, which comprise {{part of the}} UK rural heavy metals monitoring network, between 2005 and 2008. Using the gold amalgam technique to capture total gaseous mercury, samples were analysed using a Tekran 2537 A <b>mercury</b> vapour <b>analyser.</b> The data showed no upward or downward trend in atmospheric mercury concentrations over the period, with 4 year average concentrations between 1. 3 and 1. 9 ng m− 3, which {{are in line with}} other studies' observed northern hemispheric background concentrations of between 1. 5 and 1. 7 ng m− 3. Using data from nine of the sites, we were able to show seasonality within the data and through kriging we were able to interpolate the TGM concentrations over the UK, revealing a south-east to north-west declining concentration gradient. Using continuous speciated mercury measurements from one of the network sites, we show through wind sector analysis and air-mass back trajectories that this spatial trend is likely to be due to air masses moving over the UK from continental Europe on easterly winds. The levels of TGM recorded in the south-east of the UK also more closely match observed background TGM levels on the continent, which could indicate that the TGM concentrations from the north of the UK are a better reflection of the true North Atlantic atmospheric mercury background level. ...|$|R

The factors affecting the soil gas Hg concentration, such as the sampler type, test hole depth, soil characteristics, fault characteristics, and the mechanisms of their influence are discussed in terms of a gas diffusion equation. The results show that (1) the soil gas Hg concentration is affected mainly by the time lapse between the hole drilling and measurement, test hole depth and sampler shape; (2) the measured soil gas Hg concentration agrees well with the gas diffusion equation analytical solution, and the curve shape is closely related to the degree of Hg enrichment in the soil and the soil density; and (3) the soil gas concentration in the fracture zone is largely affected by the rock type, tectonics, the fault slip rate, the degree of fault locking, the development degree of fractures between the hanging wall and footwall, and the degree of fracture locking because these factors can alter the Hg upward transport channels and degree of surface enrichment.

Generally, the sediments belonged to class I and II (unpolluted and moderately polluted sediments). The concentration of mercury in bottom sediments follows the order: Rybnik (highest) > Bagna Rzeszowskie > Rzeszów > Ożanna > Brzóza Stadnicka > Brzóza Królewska > Głuchów > Narożniki (lowest). The low mercury content in sediments is related to absent or limited anthropogenic sources of this metal. Elevated concentrations of Hg in bottom sediments of the reservoirs in Rybnik and Bagna Rzeszowskie are related to their proximity to large agglomerations and industrial plants.

Although the CRM were not certified for Hg species, the sum of Hg species obtained was compared to the certified value for total Hg; recoveries were 92 %, 100 %, 97 %, and 95 %, respectively. One sediment and three soil samples from mercury contaminated areas (total Hg concentrations 0. 067 - 126 mgkg(- 1)) were analysed as well. It was possible to compare peaks of thermo-desorption curves from the samples with those from standard materials and thereby distinguish different Hg species in solid samples. Generally, Hg was present as bound to chloride or humic substances. The precision was satisfactory, as reflected by the relative standard deviations determined for standards and certified reference materials (< 11 %; n= 10) ...|$|E
40|$|Semi-continuous {{emissions}} monitors (SCEM) {{are widely}} used for the determination of atmospheric mercury. These sophisticated instruments perform nearly real-time measurements of atmospheric mercury. However, their high cost and limited mobility do not make them suitable tools for field measurements. On the other hand actively pumped Hopcalite-type sorbent tubes, connected to a vacuum pump, can be deployed to sample air even at remote locations {{without the need for}} an instrument shelter. This is particularly important for developing countries where the cost of a dedicated <b>mercury</b> <b>analyser</b> may be prohibitive to its widespread use. Analysis of the mercury content of exposed sorbent tubes may be performed by cold vapour atomic absorption spectroscopy (CVAAS). The necessary instrumentation is versatile, not limited to the determination of mercury and is used in many laboratories. During a five month monitoring campaign in Pretoria, South Africa, weekly average atmospheric mercury concentration data were generated using an Opsis HG 200 SCEM. They were compared to results obtained by exposing Carulite C 300 sorbent tubes to ambient air, followed by CVAAS analysis of the absorbed mercury. The average mercury concentration during four months of measurements with the Opsis analyser was 1. 7 ± 1. 9 ng m- 3 mercury, while 1. 6 ± 0. 4 ng m- 3 were determined by sorbent tube / CVAAS analysis.

40|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is an abundant apex predator found in nearshore waters of South Florida, {{especially in the}} Lower Florida Keys (Key West) and the coastal waters of Everglades National Park (ENP). The objective {{of this study was}} to assess variation in contamination levels of total mercury (T-Hg) and persistent organic pollutants (NDL-PCBs, PBDEs, DDT, HCH, HCB, PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs) in {{bottlenose dolphin}}s found offshore of the densely populated Key West (n = 27) and from undeveloped ENP (n = 20). T-Hg and POPs were analysed in skin and blubber, respectively, by the mean of Direct <b>Mercury</b> <b>analyser</b> (for THg), GC-ECD (POPs) and GC-HRMS (DLCs). The 7 ICES PCBs were the main compounds found in bottlenose dolphins from Key West (8229 ng. g- 1 lipids) and the ENP (2289 ng. g- 1 lipids), while the concentrations of PCDD/Fs remained low (Key West: 104 pg. g- 1 lipids, ENP: 102 ng. g- 1 lipids). POP concentrations were higher in individuals from Key West compared to those from the ENP. However, POPs concentrations in Key West dolphins were lower than those from other locations in Florida and around the world. Unlike organic pollutants, T-Hg concentrations were significantly higher in ENP dolphins (Key West: 2941 ng. g- 1 dw versus ENP: 9314 ng. g- 1 dw) highlighting the specific cycle of Hg in mangrove ecosystems. To conclude, sources of T-Hg and POPs differed between Key West and ENP as reflected by their concentrations in skin and blubber of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins highlighting their role as sentinels of their environment.

30|$|Literature survey {{revealed}} {{a large number}} of report on the determination of two of the most toxic heavy metals (As and Hg). Arsenic concentration averaged (0.4  ±  0.6  μg/g) in the tobacco samples from Africa, Asia, Europe, South and North America has been determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Lugon-Moulin et al. 2008). Taebunpakul et al. (2011) have determined total arsenic and arsenic speciation in tobacco products: from tobacco leaf and cigarette smoke by HPLC-ICP-MS. Lazarević et al. (2012) have determined the contents of arsenic in tobacco (< 0.02 – 2.04  μg/g) and cigarettes (< 0.02 – 0.71  μg/g) by electro-thermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Campbell et al. (2014) have determined total inorganic arsenic species (144 – 3914  μg/kg) in tobacco samples from different origin using HPLC-ICP-MS. Piadé et al. (2015) have determined arsenic levels in tobacco filler and cigarette smoke in {{a large number of}} samples worldwide survey and reported median tobacco level for arsenic 237  ng/g while median mainstream smoke yields for arsenic was < 3.75, ng/cigarette. Maruyama and Komiya (1973) have determined arsenic and mercury in tobacco leaves by neutron activation analysis. Suzuki et al. (1976) have determined mercury in cigarettes. Chang et al. (2002) reported a rapid method for the determination of mercury in mainstream cigarette smoke by two-stage amalgamation cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry and the vapor phase mercury in the mainstream smoke was found 7.4  ±  0.4  ng/cigarette. Zhangyu et al. (2004) have reported levels of mercury in tobacco and tobacco additives by microwave digestion and RP-HPLC followed by on-line column enrichment. Kowalski and Wierciński (2009) have reported mercury contents in cigarette tobacco (6.48 – 10.56  ng/g, 2.95 – 10.2  ng Hg per a single cigarette) determined using <b>mercury</b> <b>analyser.</b>|$|E
40|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} in food {{is one of}} the food safety issues due to the potential human health risks. Mercury, the most volatile heavy metal, occurs widely in the environment from both natural sources and human activities Mercury exposure may cause neurotoxin effects and motor function impairment, harm the cardiovascular system and cause genetic damage. Dietary exposure is the main pathway for mercury intake for the population[1]. The aim of this study was determine the amounts of mercury in 150 different products from 9 food groups available on Portuguese market, representative of consumption by Portuguese population. These samples were collected during 2014 and 2015. Determination was carried in compliance with ISO standard 17025. Total mercury (Hg) was determined in a Direct <b>Mercury</b> <b>Analyser</b> DMA 80, according to United States Environmental Protection Agency test method 7473 (USEPA, 2007) [2]. We obtained a range 0, 2 to 13, 8 µg/Kg for the limit of quantification. Analytical quality control was achieved using certified reference material NIST 1566 b oyster tissue. Most of the results were below the limit of quantification (LOQ). However, 28 % of the results revealed measurable mercury. Analysis of this data indicated that the average intake of mercury from fish and seafood products can be near the tolerable weekly intakes established by JECFA (1, 6 µg/kg body weight). Although fish {{is an important part of}} a healthy diet as it provides important nutrients, it´s recommend that young children select fish from a wide range of species, without giving undue preference to large predatory fish such as swordfish and tuna. Due to their place in the food chain, these fish are likely to contain higher levels of methylmercury than other fish species. These results provide information on the analytical data on the chemical substances of interest and are contribution to food risk assessment. N/...|$|E
