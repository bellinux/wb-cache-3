However, {{in the short run}} this measure worked against him, as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted precisely because of such rules.|$|E

5|$|Operation Storm was a {{strategic}} {{victory in the}} Bosnian War, effectively ending the siege of Bihać and placing the HV, Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and the ARBiH {{in a position to}} change the <b>military</b> <b>balance</b> of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the subsequent Operation Mistral 2. The operation built on HV and HVO advances made during Operation Summer '95, when strategic positions allowing the rapid capture of the RSK capital Knin were gained, and on the continued arming and training of the HV {{since the beginning of the}} Croatian War of Independence, when the RSK was created during the Serb Log revolution and Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) intervention.

This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, shifted the <b>military</b> <b>balance</b> in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5000|$|The year 1923 was a {{particularly}} chaotic one on the Yangtze. By the early 1920s, the Patrol found itself fighting river bandits while maintaining neutrality between the regional warlords that were battling the Nationalist Kuomingtang forces and Communist Forces in an ongoing civil war. To accommodate this difficult <b>military</b> <b>balancing</b> act and the increased perils to U.S. citizens and economic interests, in 1925 Congress authorized the construction of six new shallow-draft gunboats. Construction took place in Shanghai at Kiangnan Dock and Engineering Works during 1926-27, with the [...] "new six" [...] launched in 1927-28, and all commissioned by late 1928 during Stirling's time as [...] "COMYANGPAT". These powerful new river gunboats, expressly designed to navigate the treacherous Yangtze and the 250 miles of rapids [...] "upriver" [...] from Ichang (1,000 mi. upriver) to Chungking, were to replace the three coal-fired Spanish-American War gunboats seized from Spain in the Philippines {{more than a quarter}} century earlier. Elcano, Villalobos, and Quiros had been patrolling the Yangtze since 1903; however age and their deeper drafts were proving increasingly problematic. The two gunboats built in the United States for service on the Yangtze, Palos and Monocacy were [...] "obsolete even as they slid down the launching ways in 1914." ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the battle}} of Naseby on 14 June 1645, Rupert's {{horsemen}} again mounted a successful charge against the flank of Parliament's New Model Army, but Charles's troops elsewhere on the field were pushed back by the opposing forces. Charles, attempting to rally his men, rode forward but as he did so, Lord Carnwath seized his bridle and pulled him back, fearing for the king's safety. Carnwath's action was misinterpreted by the royalist soldiers as a signal to move back, leading to a collapse of their position. The <b>military</b> <b>balance</b> tipped decisively in favour of Parliament. There followed a series of defeats for the royalists, and then the Siege of Oxford, from which Charles escaped (disguised as a servant) in April 1646. He put himself {{into the hands of}} the Scottish Presbyterian army besieging Newark, and was taken northwards to Newcastle upon Tyne. After nine months of negotiations, the Scots finally arrived at an agreement with the English Parliament: in exchange for £100,000, and the promise of more money in the future, the Scots withdrew from Newcastle and delivered Charles to the parliamentary commissioners in January 1647.|$|E
5|$|English castles, {{including}} Kenilworth, did {{not play}} a decisive role during the Wars of the Roses (1455–85), which were fought primarily {{in the form of}} pitched battles between the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. With the mental collapse of King Henry VI, Queen Margaret used the Duchy of Lancaster lands in the Midlands, including Kenilworth, as one of her key bases of military support. Margaret removed Henry from London in 1456 for his own safety and until 1461, Henry's court divided almost all its time among Kenilworth, Leicester and Tutbury Castle for the purposes of protection. Kenilworth remained an important Lancastrian stronghold {{for the rest of the}} war, often acting as a <b>military</b> <b>balance</b> to the nearby castle of Warwick. With the victory of Henry VII at Bosworth, Kenilworth again received royal attention; Henry visited frequently and had a tennis court constructed at the castle for his use. His son, Henry VIII, decided that Kenilworth should be maintained as a royal castle. He abandoned the Pleasance and had part of the timber construction moved into the base court of the castle.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke and U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter W. Galbraith {{met with}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in Zagreb. Holbrooke was {{directed}} by the United States to urge Tuđman to stop offensive operations by the HV in western Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, Holbrooke and Galbraith thought the instructions unwise and saw the opportunity to defeat the VRS and establish a new <b>military</b> <b>balance</b> in the country. Holbrooke also considered that the changing {{situation on the ground}} allowed him and Galbraith to ignore the instructions. Holbrooke urged Tuđman to capture Sanski Most, Novi Grad and Prijedor from the VRS, and to do so quickly, but asked him to stop short of capturing Banja Luka. Holbrooke and Galbraith considered it would be advantageous for them and that justice would be served if the VRS lost Banja Luka, but decided against encouraging it, fearing there would be another 200,000 refugees from the city or that Croatia would not be willing to relinquish control of Banja Luka later on. They were also hoping that more moderate Bosnian Serb leadership might be found in the city, as it was the most urban Bosnian Serb area.|$|E

However, if there is too much focus on spice mining, Harkonnen troops can ambush a sietch, capturing all troops inside. They can only be rescued if the sietch is liberated.

5000|$|As Gibson had {{observed}} {{not long after}} the London Conference, the United States had decreased interest in the new conference because treaties already limited its navy, its army was so small that reduction was ludicrous, and the proposed measures of air limitation were so vague that they meant little. Gibson wrote that the conference would [...] "probably meet in February or March 1932 and, discouraging as it may sound, it will probably go on and on." [...] He had come to believe that armaments would never be abolished completely but that treaties could perhaps maintain <b>military</b> <b>balances.</b> Secretary Stimson later wrote that Americans regarded the Geneva Conference as [...] "a European peace conference with European political questions to be settled. The necessary work of settling them must be done by the leaders of Europe." [...] Stimsom realized that Germany's position in European affairs could not be ignored as it had been at Geneva in 1927 or at London in 1930, but {{he did not know how}} to reconcile German military ambition with French fear of its neighbor. Stimson therefore hoped the Europeans might find a solution. The secretary also hesitated over further naval disarmament because of the Manchurian crisis; in particular he worried whether the navy possessed enough carriers for possible action in the Far East.|$|R
5000|$|IR {{theories}} can {{be roughly}} divided {{into one of}} two epistemological camps: [...] "positivist" [...] and [...] "post-positivist".

They typically focus on features of international relations such as state interactions, size of <b>military</b> forces, <b>balance</b> of powers etc. Post-positivist epistemology rejects the idea that the social world can be studied in an objective and value-free way. It rejects the central ideas of neo-realism/liberalism, such as rational choice theory, {{on the grounds that the}} scientific method cannot be applied to the social world and that a [...] "science" [...] of IR is impossible.|$|R

25|$|Defence {{spending}} is consistently increasing {{by at least}} a minimum of one-third year-on-year, leading to overall defence expenditure almost quadrupling {{over the past six}} years, and according to Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, this rate is to be sustained through 2010. Official government military spending for 2005 was US $32.4 billion, though various sources, have estimated Russia's military expenditures to be considerably higher than the reported amount. Estimating Russian military expenditure is beset with difficulty; the annual IISS <b>Military</b> <b>Balance</b> has underscored the problem numerous times within its section on Russia. The IISS <b>Military</b> <b>Balance</b> comments - 'By simple observation.. would appear to be lower than is suggested {{by the size of the}} armed forces or the structure of the military-industrial complex, and thus neither of the figures is particularly useful for comparative analysis'.
