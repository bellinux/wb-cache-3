5000|$|At a {{cocktail}} party, {{there is a}} group of people talking at the same time. You have multiple microphones picking up <b>mixed</b> <b>signals,</b> but you want to isolate the speech of a single person. BSS can be used to separate the individual sources by using mixed signals.Figure 2 shows the basic concept of BSS. The individual source signals are shown as well as the <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> which are received signals. BSS is used to separate the <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> with only knowing <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> and nothing about original signal or how they were <b>mixed.</b> The separated <b>signals</b> are only approximations of the source signals. The separated images, were separated using Python and the Shogun toolbox using Joint Approximation Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices (JADE) algorithm which is based off Independent component analysis, ICA. [...] This toolbox method can be used with multi-dimensions but for an easy visual aspect images(2-D) were used.|$|R
25|$|SSB takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} entire original signal is encoded in either one of these sidebands. It is not necessary to broadcast the entire <b>mixed</b> <b>signal,</b> a suitable receiver can extract the entire signal from either the upper or lower sideband. This means that the amplifier can be used much more efficiently. A transmitter can choose to send only the upper or lower sideband, the portion of the signal above or below the carrier. By doing so, the amplifier only has to work effectively on one half the bandwidth, which is generally easier to arrange. More importantly, with the carrier suppressed before it reaches the amplifier, it can amplify the signal itself to higher energy, it is not wasting energy amplifying a signal, the carrier, that can (and will) be re-created by the receiver anyway.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thanks to its {{hierarchical}} and generative nature, Deep Belief Network (DBN) {{is effective}} to feature representation and extraction in signal processing. In this paper, DBN is investigated and implemented to monaural speech separation. Firstly, two separate DBNs {{are trained to}} extract features from <b>mixed</b> noisy <b>signals</b> and target clean speech respectively. Subsequently, {{the two types of}} extracted features are associated together by training a BP neural network to obtain a mapping from the features of <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> to the features of target speech. Finally, by performing DBN and the above mapping neural network, target speech can be estimated from the input <b>mixed</b> <b>signals.</b> Experiments are conducted on different kinds of <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> including female/male speech mixtures, human-speech/Gaussian-noise audio mixtures, and human-speech/music audio mixtures. The PESQ scores of the extracted speech are 3. 32, 2. 59, and 3. 42 respectively, which illustrates that the model performs well on speech separation tasks, especially on the <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> where the inference signals have obvious spectral structures...|$|R

Someone’s ears will process the <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> automatically to get the meant audio signal, so the person can understand the message from the other. The <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> have random variables which aren’t determined before. The <b>mixed</b> <b>signals</b> separation method is called Blind Source Separation (BSS). Independent Component Analysis is a method (algorithm) for performing BSS. The principle of ICA is to estimate un-noised audio signals (closely related to the original signals) from the available <b>mixed</b> <b>signals.</b> A simulation program is needed to execute ICA in offline way. The program in this paper uses Matlab 7. 1. It produces estimated audio signals and MSE (Mean Square Error) value between the estimated and original signals. The result of test indicates that FastICA algorithm is the eficient method to compute parameters quickly to get the right estimated signals. The most efective model of this algorithm is symmetric approach. Kata kunci: audio, offline, FastICA, MS...|$|R

[...] Later the company was renamed as Cirrus Logic when it moved to Silicon Valley in 1984 to focus on solutions for the growing PC components market. Michael Hackworth was named {{president and chief executive}} officer in January 1985, and served as CEO until February 1999. It joined the Nasdaq market listing in 1989 (symbol: CRUS). Cirrus Logic acquired Crystal Semiconductor, a supplier of analog and mixed-signal converter ICs, in 1991. In the early 1990s, Cirrus Logic became a supplier of PC graphics chips, audio converters and chips for magnetic storage products. David D. French joined Cirrus Logic, Inc., as president and chief operating officer in June 1998 and was named chief executive officer in February 1999. Soon after joining the company, through an acquisition strategy Mr. French repositioned the company into a premier supplier of high-performance analog and digital processing chip solutions for consumer entertainment electronics and soon afterwards, Mr. M. Yousuf Palla joined as Vice President of Operations and Manufacturing, contributing further to its success. The company announced in April 2000 that it had completed moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas. In June 2005, Cirrus Logic sold its video products operation to an investment firm, creating privately owned Magnum Semiconductor. After French resigned in March 2007, Jason Rhode, formerly the vice president and general manager of Cirrus Logic's <b>Mixed</b> <b>Signal</b> Audio Division, was named president and CEO in May 2007. Today, Cirrus Logic is focused on its high-precision technologies for digital signal processing components for audio and energy markets. In 2014 Cirrus Logic bought Wolfson Microelectronics for £291 million.|$|E
