40|$|Abstract- The <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> {{technology}} is widely {{adopted in the}} fiber-optical transmission equipments based on TDM(Time Division Multiplexing), such as PDH, SDH/SONET. A variety of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms for Ethernet networks and the progress of standardization are summarized in the document. There are several kinds of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms for Ethernet networks, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP and etc. However, since Ethernet signal move through detour route, it causes much time to recover. Accordingly, {{it is difficult to}} secure a usability of Ethernet networks and QOS(Quality of Service). Also, if the <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> protocol standardized by IEEE and ITU-T is used, it remains a inherent network <b>switching</b> time for <b>protection.</b> Therefore, a specific <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithm for Ethernet are needed for seamless and stable operation of Ethernet networks service for Distribution Automation System(DAS). A reliable protection algorithm with no switching delay time is very important to implement Self-healing service for DAS. This study of FPGA based <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithm for Ethernet networks shows that in case of faults occurrence on distribution power network, immediate fault isolation and restoration are conducted through interaction with distribution equipments using P 2 P(Peer to Peer) communication for protection coordination. It is concluded that FPGA based <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithm for Ethernet networks available 0 ms switching time is crucial technolog...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} provide {{reliable}} services MPLS network uses set of procedures (fault detection, fault notification and fault recovery) which provide appropriate protection to the traffic carried in active LSP (Label Switching Path). When fault occur in active LSP, the recovery scheme must re-direct the affected traffic to the recovery path which bypass the fault. The two basic recovery mechanism defined by IETF used to re-direct affected traffic is rerouting and <b>protection</b> <b>switching.</b> In <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> number of faults can be handled simultaneously in the active and recovery path and is faster as compared to rerouting switching. On the other hand, rerouting switching can utilize resources in an efficient way but is slower than <b>protection</b> <b>switching.</b> In this paper we present a survey of various fault recovery schemes, initially we start reviewing some approaches of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> then we discuss the characteristics of some rerouting approaches.

40|$|MPLS-based {{recovery}} {{is intended to}} effect rapid and complete restoration of traffic affected by a fault in an MPLS network. Two MPLS-based recovery models have been proposed: IP re-routing which establishes recovery paths on demand, and <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> which works with pre-established recovery paths. IP re-routing is robust and frugal since no resources are pre-committed but is inherently slower than <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> which is intended to offer high reliability to premium services where fault recovery {{takes place at the}} 100 ms time scale. We present a model of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> in MPLS networks. A variant of the flow deviation method is used to find and capacitate a set of optimal label switched paths. The traffic is routed over a set of working LSPs. Global repair is implemented by reserving a set of pre-established recovery LSPs. An analytic model is used to evaluate the MPLS-based recovery mechanisms in response to bi-directional link failures. A simulation model is used to evaluate the MPLS recovery cycle in terms of the time needed to restore the traffic after a uni-directional link failure. The models are applied {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> in networks consisting of between 20 and 100 nodes. Conference Pape...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{transmission}} protection {{technology is}} based on the characteristics of SONET/SDH protection mechanism which provides two fiber path rings. A serious problem may arise in the architecture when two fiber links are simultaneously broken. Mesh protection networks can support many protection paths to address above issue, but the key components of optical cross-connect (OXC) or photonic cross-connect (PXC) are expensive for network providers. Therefore, this study proposes a novel protection mechanism with a low-cost equipment of optical <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> (OPS) for building a multiple path protection architecture on DWDM backbone network. The proposed mechanism is named the double 8 -type OPS back to back protection mechanism. It can support eight protection paths to improve the issues of the low-path 1 + 1 dedicated ring and expensive mesh protection networks.

40|$|A fault {{recovery}} {{system that is}} fast and reliable is essential to today's networks, {{as it can be}} used to minimize the impact of the fault on the operation of the network and the services it provides. This paper proposes a methodology for performing automatic <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> (APS) in optical networks with arbitrary mesh topologies in order to protect the network from fiber link failures. All fiber links interconnecting the optical switches are assumed to be bidirectional. In the scenario considered, the layout of the protection fibers and the setup of the <b>protection</b> <b>switches</b> is implemented in nonreal time, during the setup of the network. When a fiber link fails, the connections that use that link are automatically restored and their signals are routed to their original destination using the protection fibers and <b>protection</b> <b>switches.</b> The <b>protection</b> process proposed is fast, distributed, and autonomous. It restores the network in real time, without relying on a central manager or a centralized database.

In this paper, we generalize the disjoint path problem by providing a framework that can model arbitrary types of failures, so that a solution to the problem can be applied to <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> in WDM networks. We prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of disjoint paths that are free from simultaneous disruption by a single failure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} {{network reach}} and customer base of next-generation time and wavelength division multiplexed PON (TWDM-PONs) have necessitated rapid fault detection and subsequent restoration {{of services to}} its users. However, direct application of existing solutions for conventional PONs to TWDM-PONs is unsuitable as these schemes rely on the loss of signal (LOS) of upstream transmissions to trigger <b>protection</b> <b>switching.</b> As TWDM-PONs are required to potentially use sleep/doze mode optical network units (ONU), the loss of upstream transmission from a sleeping or dozing ONU could erroneously trigger <b>protection</b> <b>switching.</b> Further, TWDM-PONs require its monitoring modules for fiber/device fault detection {{to be more sensitive}} than those typically deployed in conventional PONs. To address the above issues, three survivable architectures that are compliant with TWDM-PON specifications are presented in this work. These architectures combine rapid detection and <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> against multipoint failure, and most importantly do not rely on upstream transmissions for LOS activation. Survivability analyses as well as evaluations of the additional costs incurred to achieve survivability are performed and compared to the unprotected TWDM-PON. Network parameters that impact the maximum achievable network reach, maximum split ratio, connection availability, fault impact, and the incremental reliability costs for each proposed survivable architecture are highlighted...|$|R
