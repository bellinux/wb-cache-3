Nonsynaptic plasticity can emerge during learning as a result of cellular processes, although the timing, persistence, and the relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and synaptic output are all poorly understood. Studies have shown that nonsynaptic plasticity plays an indirect but important role in the formation of memories. Learning-induced nonsynaptic plasticity is associated with soma depolarization.|$|E

25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} lot to the {{research}} of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage and forgetting of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a <b>memory</b> <b>trace</b> is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of <b>memory</b> <b>trace,</b> salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E

40|$|Several models {{assume that}} working memory {{development}} depends on age-related increases in {{efficiency and speed}} of processing.

This hypothesis was tested in three experiments by manipulating both the processing duration within a working mem- ory task and the time available to restore <b>memory</b> <b>traces.</b> Third- and sixth-grade children performed a complex span task in which they maintained series of letters while adding numbers to series of digits. When we equated processing and restoration times between ages, the developmental difference in working memory span was reduced but remained significant.

Shallow processing (e.g., processing based on phonemic and orthographic components) leads to a fragile <b>memory</b> <b>trace</b> that is susceptible to rapid decay.

40|$|While NREM sleep {{has been}} {{strongly}} {{implicated in the}} reactivation and consolidation of <b>memory</b> <b>traces,</b> the role of REM sleep remains unclear. A {{growing body of research}} on humans and animals provide behavioral evidence for a role of REM sleep in the strengthening and modulation of emotional memories. Theta activity – which describes low frequency oscillations in the local field potential within the hippocampus, amygdala and neocortex – is a prominent feature of both wake and REM sleep in humans and rodents. Theta coherence between the hippocampus and amygdala drives large-scale PGO waves, the density of which predicts increases in plasticity-related gene expression. This could potentially facilitate the processing of emotional <b>memory</b> <b>traces</b> within the hippocampus during REM sleep. Further, the timing of hippocampal activity in relation to theta phase is vital in determining subsequent potentiation of neuronal activity. This could allow the emotionally modulated strengthening of novel and the gradual weakening of consolidated hippocampal <b>memory</b> <b>traces</b> observed in both wake and REM sleep. Hippocampal theta activity is also correlated with REM sleep acetylcholine levels – which are thought to reduce hippocampal afferent inputs in the neocortex. The additional low levels of noradrenaline during REM sleep, which facilitate recurrent activation within the neocortex, could allow the integration of novel <b>memory</b> <b>traces</b> previously consolidated during NREM sleep. We therefore propose that REM sleep mediates the prioritized processing of emotional memories within the hippocampus, the integration of previously consolidated <b>memory</b> <b>traces</b> within the neocortex, as well as the disengagement of consolidated neocortical <b>memory</b> <b>traces</b> from the hippocampus...|$|R

2500|$|Context-dependency {{effects on}} recall are {{typically}} interpreted {{as evidence that}} the characteristics of the environment are encoded as part of the <b>memory</b> <b>trace</b> and can be used to enhance retrieval of the other information in the trace. In other words, you can recall more when the environments are similar in both the learning and recall phases. Context cues appear to be important in the retrieval of newly learned meaningful information. In a classic study by Godden and Baddelley (1975), they demonstrated that deep-sea divers recalled their training more effectively when trained underwater, rather than being trained on land.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} {{encoding}} specificity finds {{similarities between the}} process of recognition and that of recall. [...] The encoding specificity principle states that memory utilizes information from the <b>memory</b> <b>trace,</b> or {{the situation in which}} it was learned, and from the environment in which it is retrieved. In other words, memory is improved when information available at encoding is also available at retrieval. For example, if one is to learn about a topic and study it in a specific location, but take their exam in a different setting, they would not have had as much of a successful memory recall as if they were in the location that they learned and studied the topic in. [...] Encoding specificity helps to take into account context cues because of its focus on the retrieval environment, and it also accounts for the fact recognition may not always be superior to recall.|$|E

2500|$|Findings {{surrounding}} {{sleep and}} visual memory have been mixed. Studies have reported performance increases after {{a bout of}} sleep {{compared with the same}} period of waking.

Replay has been found to occur during post-training quiet wakefulness as well as sleep. In a recent study where a visual search task was administered quiet rest or sleep is found to be necessary for increasing the amount of associations between configurations and target locations that can be learned within a day. Reactivation in sleep was only observed after extensive training of rodents on familiar tasks. It rapidly dissipates; it also makes up a small proportion of total recorded activity in sleep.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experiment}} of Kemenes et al. {{demonstrated that}} in an extrinsic modulatory neuron, nonsynaptic plasticity influences the expression of long-term associative memory. The relationship between nonsynaptic plasticity and memory was assessed using cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Depolarization from conditioned stimuli increased the neuronal network response. This depolarization lasted {{as long as the}} long-term memory. Persistent depolarization and behavioral memory expression occurred more than 24 hours after training, indicating long-term effects. In this experiment, the electrophysiological expression of the long-term <b>memory</b> <b>trace</b> was a conditioned stimulus induced feeding response. CGCs were significantly more depolarized in the trained organisms than the control group, indicating association with learning and excitability changes. When CGCs were depolarized, they showed an increased response to the conditional stimuli and a stronger fictive feeding response. This demonstrated that the depolarization is enough to produce a significant feeding response to the conditioned stimuli. [...] Additionally, no significant difference was observed in the feeding rates between conditioned organisms and ones that were artificially depolarized, reaffirming that depolarization is sufficient to generate the behavior associated with long-term memory.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{alternate}} model of object recognition by Carbonnel et al. episodic and semantic memory {{arise from the}} same memory traces, and no semantic representations are stored permanently in memory. [...] By this view, the meaning of any stimulus emerges momentarily from reactivation of one's previous experiences with that entity. [...] Each episode is made of several components of many different sensory modalities that are typically engaged during interactions with an object. In this scenario, a retrieval cue triggers reactivation of all episodic memory traces, {{in proportion to the}} similarity between the cue its 'echo,' the components shared by most activated traces. [...] In a process called 're-injection,' the first echo acts as a further retrieval cue, evoking the 'second echo,' the less frequently associated components of the cue. [...] Thus, the 're-injection' process provides a more complete meaning for the object. [...] According to this model, different types of stimuli will evoke differential 'echos' based on typical interactions with them. [...] For example, a distinction is made between functional and visual components of various stimuli, such that impairment to these aspects of the <b>memory</b> <b>trace</b> will inhibit the re-injection process needed to complete the object representation. [...] This theory has been used to explain category-specific agnosias that impair recognition of various object types, such as animals and words, to different degrees.|$|E
40|$|Abstract (176 words) The Time-Based Resource-Sharing {{model of}} working memory assumes that <b>memory</b> <b>traces</b> {{suffer from a}} time-related decay when {{attention}} is occupied by concurrent activities. Using complex continuous span tasks in which temporal parameters are carefully controlled, Barrouillet et al.

However, Oberauer and Kliegl (2006) pointed out that, in this paradigm, increased processing times are accompanied by a corollary decrease of the remaining time during which attention is available to refresh hal- 00824084, version 1 - 21 May 2013 <b>memory</b> <b>traces.</b> As a consequence, the main determinant of recall performance in complex span task {{would not be the}} duration of attentional capture inducing time-related decay as Barrouillet et al.

We demonstrate here that even when the time available to refresh <b>memory</b> <b>traces</b> is kept constant, increasing the processing time still results in poorer recall, confirming that time-related decay is the source of forgetting within working memory...|$|R

2500|$|Synapses may be {{electrical}} or chemical. [...] Electrical synapses make direct {{electrical connections}} between neurons, but chemical synapses {{are much more}} common, and much more diverse in function. [...] At a chemical synapse, the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is called postsynaptic. [...] Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process. [...] The presynaptic area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles, packed with neurotransmitter chemicals. [...] When the presynaptic terminal is electrically stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are activated, and cause {{the contents of the}} vesicles to be released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, called the synaptic cleft. [...] The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the postsynaptic membrane, causing them to enter an activated state. [...] Depending on the type of receptor, the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more complex ways. For example, release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a motor neuron and a muscle cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell. [...] The entire synaptic transmission process takes only a fraction of a millisecond, although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer (even indefinitely, in cases where the synaptic signal leads to the formation of a <b>memory</b> <b>trace).</b>|$|E
