5000|$|This rate, {{known as}} the <b>mint</b> <b>par</b> of exchange, did not {{necessarily}} coincide with the corresponding market exchange rates. The balance of trade between the countries determined the actual rate of exchange. If England has a negative balance of trade with France, for instance, currency of equal magnitude is remitted to France, which thus creates a demand for French currency. Procurement of that currency involves payment of a premium referred to as agio. It refers to exchange rate.|$|E
40|$|Classical economists David Hume, Pehr Niclas Christiernin, Henry Thornton, David Ricardo, Thomas Attwood, and Robert Torrens looked {{beyond the}} redistributive (creditor-debtor) effects of deflationary {{monetary}} contraction to its {{adverse effects on}} output and employment. They attributed these effects to price-wage stickiness; to rises in real debt, tax, and cost burdens; to cash hoarding in anticipation of future price falls; and to other determinants. Addressing deflation associated with post-war resumption of gold convertibility at the old <b>mint</b> <b>par,</b> they advocated policies ranging from gradualism, to devaluation, and even to outright abandonment of the gold standard {{in order to avoid}} or mitigate deflationâ€™s harm.

40|$|Classical {{theories}} of exchange rates, such as <b>Mint</b> <b>Par</b> and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), have the desirable property that they define {{a network of}} exchange rates in which no profit by 'compound arbitration' or 'cyclic arbitrage' is possible. Conversely, it will be shown that any network of exchange rates, satifying the condition that no profit by cyclic arbitrage is possible, can be defined by a 'potential quotient' analogous to the one used in PPP theory. Given a network with specified cash flows between countries, the balance of payments determines a unique system of exchange rates for which no cyclic arbitrage is possible. An explicit formula for the potential of a currency in this situation is obtained by using the matrix-tree theorem. This provides us with a 'universal' form of PPP theory, in which the potential of a currency is {{defined in terms of}} the totality of cash flows in the network...|$|E
