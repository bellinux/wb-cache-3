5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving as}} a county judge, Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast {{rejected}} these ideas. Truman then thought he <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> out his career in some well-paying county sinecure, but circumstances changed when Pendergast reluctantly backed him in the 1934 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate after four other potential candidates turned him down. In the primary, Truman defeated Congressmen John J. Cochran and Jacob L. Milligan with the solid support of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy, as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official, Mason, military reservist, {{and member of the}} American Legion. In the general election, Truman defeated incumbent Republican Roscoe C. Patterson by nearly 20 percentage points as part of a continuing wave of pro-New Deal Democrats elected in response to the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol of the planning. Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E

5|$|The {{context of}} the Confrontation in the murk of Indonesian {{politics}} is extremely layered. Sukarno's choice of pursuing this strategy would {{come at the expense}} of an important program aiming at the rehabilitation of the damaged economy, as it relied upon funding from Britain and America, who would not support the strengthening of another Communist power forming in Asia. However, the Indonesian populace and much of the government, who had recently fought their way from the hands of Dutch rule, would likely not support the economic program as it would seem as if Indonesia was sliding back into the embrace of the 'imperialist' powers of the West. The proposal was also beginning to lose support from the army, as they learned that demobilisation and lessening of funding that the program entailed would affect them adversely. Confrontation, on the other hand, <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> as a far more stabilising force, as it garnered support from both the Communists and the military, whose internecine political conflict weakened Sukarno's government. A campaign could keep the army busy while the Communists became accepted into mainstream Indonesian politics, which the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) found favourable. The nationalist-leaning army was content to fight the Malaysians to both remove British influence from the region as well as to establish Indonesian dominance in Southeast Asia. Some of the military high command thought that conflict could solidify a central role for the army in Indonesian politics, as well as increase their budget and return the country to martial law, which would greatly empower the military. Short of all-out war, the military was largely supportive of Confrontation.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} turmoil of Germany's troubled interwar years greatly affected the School's development. Its thinkers were particularly {{influenced by the}} failure of the communist revolution in Western Europe (precisely where Marx had predicted that a communist revolution would take place) and by the rise of Nazism in such an economically and technologically advanced nation as Germany. This led many of them to take up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> to clarify contemporary social conditions that Marx himself had never seen. Another key influence also came from the publication in the 1930s of Marx's Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts and The German Ideology, which showed the continuity with Hegelianism that underlay Marx's thought.|$|E

Heavy water or possibly graphite <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> as moderator for the fast neutrons.

500|$|At the Milburn House, McKinley {{seemed to}} be recovering. [...] On Saturday, September 7, McKinley was relaxed and conversational. [...] His wife was allowed to see him, as was Cortelyou; the President asked his secretary, [...] "How did they like my speech?" [...] and was pleased on hearing of {{positive}} reactions. [...] Meanwhile, Vice President Roosevelt (who had been in Vermont), much of the Cabinet, and Senator Hanna hurried to Buffalo. [...] Cortelyou continued to issue encouraging bulletins. [...] The President was permitted few visitors, and complained of loneliness. [...] As the crisis seemed to have passed, dignitaries started to leave on September 9, confident of the President's recovery. [...] Roosevelt left for a vacation in the Adirondack Mountains after expressing outrage that Czolgosz <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> {{only a few years}} under New York State law for attempted murder, the maximum penalty for attempted murder in New York at that time being ten years. [...] Attorney General Philander Knox went to Washington, searching for a means to bring Czolgosz under federal law.

500|$|Different {{kinds of}} homosexuals were {{compared}} {{to see whether they}} had differing developmental histories. The [...] "Identification with Father" [...] variable appeared to be important in the development of homosexuality among effeminate, but not non-effeminate, white homosexual men. Bell et al. noted that failure to identify with the father <b>might</b> <b>serve</b> to encourage effeminacy, but that alternatively boys who were effeminate for other reasons might find it difficult to identify with their fathers. Pre-adult homosexual behavior was more important among men who were not effeminate. Bell et al. suggested that for effeminate males early homosexual feelings were the only important predictor of adult homosexuality, while other males were influenced by a combination of homosexual feelings and other factors. Comparing white bisexual men and white homosexual men, Bell et al. found that for the bisexuals sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings. Based on this and other findings, they concluded that exclusive homosexuality tends to emerge from a [...] "deep-seated predisposition" [...] but that bisexuality is [...] "more subject to influence by social and sexual learning." [...] Exclusively homosexual white men tended to report that they had not identified with their fathers, but there was no significant tendency for white bisexual men not to identify with their fathers. Only white homosexual men who had undergone psychotherapy had [...] "paternal variables" [...] that were consistent with what clinicians had considered typical of homosexual males.|$|E
