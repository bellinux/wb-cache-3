All the treatments were evaluated {{on the basis of}} reduction in adult of <b>mushroom</b> <b>flies</b> emergence (RAE), mushroom damage rate (MDR) in percentage and yield in three successive growing periods. Six insecticides viz., Trichlorphon, Malathion, Spinosad, Deltamethrin, Spintoram and Permethrin, out of nine, caused 77. 42 % to 90 % mortality of 3 rd instar larvae of phorid and sciarid fly under lab condition, while 73 % to 88 % in mushroom houses. Four plant extracts [Neem nut, Neem, Tobacco and Kanair (Nerium indicum) ] out of six caused 41 % to 72 % mortality of 3 rd instar larvae of phorid and sciarid fly under lab conditions, while 40 % to 68 % in mushroom houses. Pink colour flap light trap trapped maximum average <b>mushroom</b> <b>flies</b> per week (85. 50) followed by yellow (57. 00), blue (33. 95) and white (19. 45), respectively.

The population levels of L. ingenua developing in compost inoculated with Agaricus mycelium varied with the Agaricus isolate used, with some isolates causing high levels of inhibition. The development of L. ingenua populations and the survival of larval instars were inversely proportional to the amount of Agaricus inoculum applied. There was also a negative relationship between L. ingenua survival and the extension rate of the Agaricus isolate in compost. The results suggest that inhibition of L. ingenua population development by Agaricus is linked to the rate at which compost is colonized by fungal mycelium.

The fungus was cottony on both potato dex-trose agar (PDA) and Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA), but was colored white on PDA and became yellowish green and brown on CYA. Mycelial growth on PDA attained a diameter of 73 mm at 30 o C after 5 days. The fungus grew faster on malt extract agar (> 80 mm, 5 days at 25 o C) compared to CYA and PDA (< 68 mm, 5 days at 25 o C). Penicillate conidiophores of the fungus are hyaline, smooth walled, branching above typically in four stages, and 120 ~ 240 µm in length. Club-shaped or slender phialides are formed on the metulae.

40|$|I {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} deceptive pollination system of Jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisama triphyllum, Araceae) in forests of west-central Indiana. I focused on (a) determining the identities and abundances of insect visitors to spathes, (b) evaluating the success of female spathes in setting fruit, (c) determining the relative importance of pollinator visitation and plant size for fruit number, and (d) investigating the function of the female spathe’s lack of an exit hole, which has been hypothesized to improve pollination success. I found that (a) Jack-in-the-pulpit receives visits from both flies and thrips. Counts of fly corpses from spathes showed the most prevalent families to be Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae with other nematoceran families and a few brachyceran families present as well. Visitation by thrips, determined by visual inspection of spathes, was low, involving only 30 % of plants. (b) Fifty-seven percent of female plants set fruit, with much variation among sites. (c) <b>Mushroom</b> <b>flies,</b> especially the families Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae, were found to be the primary pollinators of Jack-in-thepulpit based on pollen loads, visit rates, and an exclusion experiment. Pollination by thrips, though possible, probably had only a minor effect. (d) An experiment that created an exit hole in female spathes yielded no support for the hypothesis that lack of an exit hole (the natural condition) improves fruit set. Joseph L.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the females of the mushroom sciarid, Lycoriella ingenua (Dufour, 1839) (Diptera: Sciaridae), {{one of the most}} severe pests of the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus (J. E. Lange) Emil J. Imbach (Agaricales: Agaricaceae), are attracted to the mushroom compost that mushrooms are grown on and not to the mushrooms themselves. We also showed that females are attracted to the parasitic green mold, Trichoderma aggressivum. In an attempt to identify what is in the mushroom compost that attracts female L. ingenua, we isolated several species of fungi from adult males and females, third instar larvae, and mushroom compost itself. We then analyzed the attraction of females to these substrates using a static-flow two choice olfactometer, as well as their oviposition tendencies in another type of assay under choice and no-choice conditions. We also assessed the survival of larvae to adulthood when first instar larvae were placed on each of the isolated fungal species. We found that female flies were attracted most to the mycoparasitic green mold, T. aggressivum, to Penicilium citrinum isolated from adult female bodies, and to Scatylidium thermophilium isolated from the mushroom compost. Gravid female flies laid the most eggs on T. aggressivum, Aspergillus flavus isolated from third instar larval frass, Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from adult male bodies, and on P. citrinum. This egg-laying trend remained consistent under no-choice conditions as females aged. First instar larvae developed to adulthood only on S. thermophilium and Chaetomium sp. isolated from mushroom compost, and on P. citrinum. Our results indicate that the volatiles from a suite of different fungal species act in tandem in the natural setting of mushroom compost, with some first attracting gravid female flies and then others causing them to oviposit. The ecological context of these findings is important for creating an optimal strategy for using possible semiochemicals isolated from these fungal species to better monitor and control this pestiferous <b>mushroom</b> <b>fly</b> species...|$|R

Once fully braked, the spores should then drift downward by action of gravity, which in case of upside-down positioned mushrooms would be down into the free gaps between hymenia.

The successes or failures of the nematodes against 24 arthropod pest species of agriculture and animals and against a major slug pest in agriculture are discussed in this review. Commercial successes are documented in markets such as citrus (Diaprepes root weevil), greenhouses and glasshouses (black vine weevil, fungus gnats, thrips, and certain borers), turf (white grubs, billbugs, and mole crickets), and <b>mushrooms</b> (sciarid <b>flies).</b> In addition, the successful commercialization of a nematode (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) against slugs in agricultural systems is presented. Despite this progress, the reality is that nematode-based products have limited market share. Limited share is attributed to higher product cost compared to standard insecticides, low efficacy under unfavorable conditions, application timing and conditions, limited data and cost benefit in IPM programs, refrigeration requirements and limited room temperature shelf life (product quality), use of suboptimum nematode species, and lack of detail application directions. One or more of these factors affected the market introduction of the nematodes despite promising field efficacy against insects such as black cutworm in turf, sugar beet weevil in sugar beet, sweet potato weevil in sweet potato, and house fly adult in animal-rearing farms. Insects such as cabbage root maggots, carrot root weevil, and Colorado potato beetle are listed on the label of certain commercial products despite low efficacy data, due to insect susceptibility, biology, and/or behavior.

40|$|Across bilaterian phyla, {{learning}} and memory allows animals {{to benefit from}} central-place foraging, return to ideal food sources, choose mates and avoid dangerous or harmful external stimuli. Although these behaviors are comparable in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals, it is unknown {{whether or not they}} are mediated by homologous brain structures. In insects, paired, lobate forebrain structures called mushroom bodies receive input from primary sensory neuropils and are necessary for {{learning and}} memory, whereas in crustaceans, this behavior is mediated by paired, compact forebrain structures called hemiellipsoid bodies. Mammalian learning and memory is mediated by the paired, horn-shaped hippocampi, which also receive sensory input and are likewise situated in the forebrain. Did these structures evolve independently along with the ability for animals to learn and remember associations and places? Alternatively, the hypothesis posited in this dissertation is that the last bilaterian ancestor already possessed the ability to learn and adapt to its environment, behavior mediated by paired forebrain structures that evolved divergently into the elaborated forms we observe in extant, crown-group taxa. This hypothesis is investigated and discussed in the following reports: 1) a review of insect brain anatomy and functional connectivity, including a description of mushroom bodies, in the context of arthropod evolution; 2) a comparison of neuroanatomy, circuitry, and protein expression between insect mushroom bodies and Malacostracan crustacean hemiellipsoid bodies, using cockroaches and Caribbean hermit crabs as representatives of their classes; 3) a deeper investigation of the fine structure of neuronal organization in the hemiellipsoid body of the Caribbean hermit crab, focusing on electron microscopical observations and comparisons to the ultrastructure of the fruit <b>fly</b> <b>mushroom</b> body; 4) a survey of four invertebrate Phyla, employing the strategy of comparing neuroanatomy and protein expression to investigate whether higher order forebrain structures in these animals were inherited from a common ancestor; 5) a comparison of neuroanatomy, connectivity, and protein expression in insect mushroom bodies and mammalian hippocampus, including a survey of PKA-Cα in these and corresponding structures across the Chordata.
