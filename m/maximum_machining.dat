In addition, it can provide the reference of machining parameters setting for increasing machining speed and stability. A new on-line WEDM workpiece height estimation system for the iso-energy type wire EDM machine is presented.

They developed a back propagation neural network to establish the process model. The performance of the developed artificial neural network models was compared with the RSM mathematical models of average cutting speed. Sharma et al. (2013) investigated the effect of parameters on metal removal rate for WEDM using high strength low alloy as work-piece and brass wire as electrode. They observed that material removal rate and surface roughness increase with increase in pulse on time and peak current. RSM is used to optimize the process parameter for Material removal rate and surface roughness. They developed a mathematical model which correlates the independent process parameters with the desired metal removal rate and Surface Roughness. The central composite rotatable design has been used to conduct the experiments.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of detecting vector resonances from a strong electroweak sector, {{in the framework of}} the BESS model, at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders up to the TeV range. If the mass $M_V$ of the new vector boson multiplet is not far above or if it is below the <b>maximum</b> <b>machine</b> energy, such a contribution would be manifest. The process of $W$-pair production by $e^+e^-$ annihilation allows for sensitive tests of the strong sector, especially if the $W$ polarizations are reconstructed.

40|$|PaperPg. 123 - 126. There {{are several}} {{acceptable}} alignment methods presently available. Despite their diversity, one common thread of agreement is noted. That is, <b>maximum</b> <b>machine</b> life and optimum runs {{will not be}} attained unless the machines? shafts are essentially collinear at service conditions. The method covered in this paper is the DynAlign Bars (Dodd Bars). These bars are manufactured and marketed under a license granted by Chevron Research Company, U. S. Patent No. 3, 783, 522. The bars provide a direct method for attaining accurate shaft alignment at equilibrium (normal running) conditions and for continuous tracking to ensure that alignment is maintained during actual operation. The bars {{make it possible to}} measure and compensate for the thermal ?growth? that occurs in equipment from the cold state to normal operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|The seal {{strength}} of flexible packaging indicates both functional {{performance and the}} ease of opening. This research aims to compare the seal peeling mechanisms evaluated by human participants and standard machine tests. The tests were conducted on flexible films used for typical packaging applications, LDPE, LLDPE and Nylon/LLDPE. Human peeling was simulated {{through the use of}} novel force measurement equipment. The results showed that the <b>maximum</b> <b>machine</b> peel force set by standard test methods was generally lower than the human peel force for most sealing temperatures. In all film types no significant difference was shown between genders although for people over 65 years peel force was generally lower than for the younger cohort. The results also indicated that peeling speed of human participants was normally higher than the peeling speed set according to the machine test standard...|$|R
