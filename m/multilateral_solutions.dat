40|$|Why are {{international}} financial institutions important? This paper reassesses {{the role of the}} loans issued {{with the support of the}} League of Nations. These long-term loans constituted the financial basis of the League’s strategy to restore the productive basis of countries in Central and Eastern Europe in the aftermath of the war. We argue that the League's loans accomplished the task for which they were conceived because they allowed countries in financial distress to access capital markets. The League adopted an innovative system of funds management and monitoring that ensured compliance of borrowing countries with its programs. We provide empirical evidence that financial markets viewed the League’s role as an external, multilateral agent positively, solving the credibility problem of borrowing countries allowing them to engage in economic and institutional reforms. This success was achieved despite the League’s own lack of lending resources. We also demonstrate that this <b>multilateral</b> <b>solution</b> performed better than the bilateral arrangements adopted by other governments in Eastern Europe because of its lower borrowing and transaction costs...|$|R

40|$|Colegio de Mexico. This paper {{examines}} the policy dilemmas and {{challenges faced by}} developing country governments when confronted with rising food prices, {{especially when it comes}} to the prices of basic foods such as rice and corn. One option for governments is to let domestic prices adjust to reflect the full change in international prices. However, this generates inflationary pressures, and if poor households lack savings or access to credit and social safety nets are inadequate, high food prices can cause severe hardship. Countries with large international reserves could mitigate these effects by appreciating their currency. But an exchange rate appreciation hurts the tradable sector and may cause macroeconomic imbalances down the road. Alternatively, governments can use food subsidies or export restrictions to stabilize domestic prices, shifting the burden of adjustment back on to international markets. The former measures exacerbate global food price fluctuations, hence are a “beggar-thy-neighbor ” policy response which undermines a rules-based trading system and reduces welfare particularly in food importing countries.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the one-seller/two-buyer problem with buyer {{externalities}} is investigated {{under the assumption}} that the two buyers have legal opportunities to cooperate. It is shown that the Competitive equilibrium and the Core are robust with respect to negligible externalities and that the range of market prices in the Core belongs to range of Competitive equilibrium prices. However, these concepts yield no prediction for relatively severe externalities. Therefore, in order to provide a prediction the Bargaining set and the <b>Multilateral</b> Nash (MN) <b>solution</b> are also investigated. Surprisingly, in case of an empty Core the Bargaining set predicts a unique tuple of payofis which are independent of the externalities and each pair of participants is equally likely. Markets with market imperfections are captured by the MN solution concept. The MN solution yields the paradox that the seller's price can be higher under imperfect competition than under perfect competition.

40|$|Multilateralism is at {{the heart}} of the EU’s {{external}} mandate. The TEU directs the EU, working in partnership with countries and organisations which share its principles and values, to ‘promote <b>multilateral</b> <b>solutions</b> to common problems, in particular in the framework of the United Nations’ and to ‘promote an international system based on stronger multilateral cooperation and good global governance. ’ This helps us to understand the two roles which multilateralism plays in EU external policy-making: as a principle underpinning its own policy choices (how the EU prefers to act at a global level), and as an objective of its external policy (what it is trying to achieve). The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) clearly demonstrates both these dimensions. The focus of this chapter is on the interplay between the regional (represented by the ENP) and the multilateral in EU external policy-making. In particular, it examines three aspects of this relation. The first reflects the Treaty injunction to ‘promote <b>multilateral</b> <b>solutions</b> to common problems’, the ENP as a policy framework within which, and with which, the EU seeks to address common problems and shared threats through law. This includes promoting the ratification of key international conventions by ENP partners; supporting international institutions; and enlisting the support of the ENP partners for the EU’s own multilateral legal agendas. The second dimension involves collaboration to ensure effective enforcement of the law. This includes supporting the implementation and enforcement of ratified conventions; collaboration with the Council of Europe and other international bodies and organisations; the use of the EU’s sanctions regimes to enforce international anti-corruption conventions. The third dimension involves building active support among the ENP partners for the EU’s own multilateral security agenda. Here the EU is building relationship with the aim (inter alia) of ‘safeguard[ing] its values, fundamental interests, security, independence and integrity’. These mechanisms include seeking support from the ENP partners for the EU’s sanctions regimes; and seeking the participation of ENP states in EU-led crisis missions...|$|E

It also becomes evident that there is a largely unsettled relationship between multilateral efforts, including those approved by the UN Security Council, and regional approaches to conflict management and prevention...|$|E
40|$|World {{economic}} {{relationships have}} recently been transformed by a process of globalisation whereby economic activity between nations and blocs of nations has become influenced by and (arguably) inextricably linked to the resurgence of the re-gional integration arrangements (RIAs). This article postulates that, {{despite the fact that}} regional bloc formation is not something new, the old theory and practice of re-gionalism cannot adequately describe the spirit and structure of modern RIAs. This study attempts to assess what countries expect to gain from membership of RIAs and tries to distinguish the motives and forces which derive them towards such or-ganisations. In this respect, modern RIAs are compared with the initial, post-war, model of regional integration.

40|$|Throughout the Cold War, Italy {{was one of}} {{the most}} steadfast NATO allies in hosting American nuclear weapons on its territory. Such a policy could easily be {{construed}} as an example of almost automatic confidence in the US nuclear umbrella, yet only on the surface did extended deterrence appease Italian anxieties about the uncertainties of the American nuclear guarantee. The Italian rationale for accepting a large array of US nuclear weapon s did as a matter of fact involve a complex mix of reasons, ranging from trying to ensure that the Italian government would be consulted in the event of a major crisis, to willingness to enhance the country’s profile inside any Western multilateral fora. The paper will investigate this policy by looking at how the Italian government behaved at the height of the NATO nuclear sharing debate, between 1957 and 1962, arguably one of the historical moments in the Cold War when the concept of extended deterrence was most intensely discussed. Drawing upon hitherto classified archival sources as well as on some less-known public ones, the paper will show how Italian diplomats, military leaders and policymakers understood the dangers and political implications of US nuclear policies. It will, hopefully, demonstrate that Italy’s persistent search for a <b>multilateral</b> <b>solution</b> to the nuclearisation of NATO strategy shows that Italy never saw extended deterrence as a solution per se, but only as a temporary means to an end...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent well {{systems are}} {{installed}} in production or injection wells, to increase {{the total amount of}} produced hydrocarbons. An intelligent well system has the advantages of being able to set different choke openings, using hydraulic operated sleeves to regulate the flow of produced or injected fluids. The procedure of operating the choke from surface without the use of any intervention work, is both economical and less time consuming. Combining the efficiency of intelligent well systems and down hole monitoring systems, such as pressure and temperature gauges, allows for production optimisation. If the down hole monitoring system also is fitted with a multiphase flow meter, surface test separators could be unnecessary. Multilateral wells are used to reach several pay zones, either within the same reservoir or in different smaller reservoirs. A multilateral well is a single bore well, at the surface, with one or several branches going out from the main bore. This method of drilling is economical and less time consuming. The equipment costs are lower, due to the need for only one wellhead, less casing costs, lower rig charge etc. Seeing as one only have to drill one main bore, as opposed to drilling separate wells where all wells must be drilled from the seabed, the method is also time saving. Combining these two solutions, the well will produce from several zones in different reservoirs into one main bore. The production can be controlled and regulated for each zone continuously. This thesis will describe the equipment used in a combined intelligent well and <b>multilateral</b> <b>solution...</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decades {{there has been}} a wide debate on which {{economic}} instruments are more suitable to fight climate change {{in a way that is}} both economically efficient and legally rigorous. Among the various instruments, Emission Trading has gained increasing importance worldwide. Following the example of the European Emission Trading System (henceforth EU ETS), which set up in 2005 the first international carbon market, many other countries have decided to set up their own ETS at the national or regional level, generating a sort of rapid sprawling of the ETSs around the world. Given the difficulties encountered in the post-Kyoto phase (and actually during the Kyoto phase too) to pursue a <b>multilateral</b> <b>solution</b> to climate change problems, many scholars and policy-makers started looking at linking ETSs as a possible way to progressively achieve a common instrument to reduce polluting emissions. Linking ETSs implies deep economic and legal difficulties: it requires a rigorous legal framework for its proper economic functioning. Still, it might become one of the main routes to fight climate change in the near future. To get a deeper understanding on this issue, this book provides a detailed analysis of the main ETSs from both the legal and economic perspectives with the intent to compare their features and examine whether and how to link them in the future.
