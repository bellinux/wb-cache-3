5|$|After {{their initial}} advances, the 342nd Infantry Division {{spent the next}} few days <b>mopping</b> up the areas they had entered. The 697th Regiment {{advanced}} south from Vlasenica through the Javor Mountains, meeting little resistance and capturing Han Pijesak on 22 January. Elements of the 697th Regiment pushed west towards Olovo the same day. The 698th Regiment cleared the area around Rogatica, killing 50 and capturing 200 insurgents, and liberating 63 captured Croatian Home Guard soldiers. The 699th Regiment patrolled the area as far as Vlasenica and Srebrenica. These <b>mopping</b> up operations achieved little, as most of the insurgents had escaped the encirclement before it was completed.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Save, the {{division}} remained relatively static {{for more than}} three weeks, <b>mopping</b> up and repelling local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on {{the division}}al western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji Rahić on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|In June, major combat {{operations}} {{on the island}} ceased and the Australians began the <b>mopping</b> up phase of the campaign as the Australians sought to clear isolated pockets of Japanese troops that had evaded capture. These operations continued into July. During this time, the 2/48th was assigned a sector near the Pamusian River on the eastern coast, as well as Tarakan town and {{the centre of the}} island. The battalion's involvement in the Borneo campaign resulted in 174 casualties, including 37 killed and nine died of wounds or from accident.|$|E

40|$|Catabolic mannopine (<b>MOP)</b> cyclase encoded by Ti or Ri {{plasmids}} lactonizes <b>MOP</b> to agropine (AGR). The gene of the octopine-type Ti plasmid pTi 15955 encoding the catabolic <b>MOP</b> cyclase enzyme previously was localized to a 1. 6 -kb segment {{within a}} cosmid clone, pYDH 208. A subclone containing only this region complemented the AGR catabolism-negative phenotype conferred by a derivative of the octopine-type plasmid pTiB 6 S 3 containing a Tn 7 insertion {{in the region}} encoding the <b>MOP</b> cyclase enzyme. Uptake assays of strains harboring pRiA 4 or pArA 4 a, along with complementation analyses, indicate that <b>MOP</b> cyclase is not sufficient for catabolism of AGR but that the strains must also express an AGR transport system. To determine the requirement for <b>MOP</b> cyclase in opine catabolism unequivocally, a site-specific, nonpolar deletion mutation abolishing only <b>MOP</b> cyclase activity was introduced into pYDH 208, a cosmid clone that confers utilization of <b>MOP,</b> AGR, and mannopinic acid (MOA). Strains harboring this <b>MOP</b> cyclase-negative mutant clone, pYDPH 208, did not utilize AGR but continued to utilize <b>MOP.</b> Growth on AGR was restored in this strain upon introduction of clones encoding the pTi 15955 -derived catabolic or anabolic <b>MOP</b> cyclase genes. The induction pattern of MOA catabolism shown by strain NT 1 harboring the <b>MOP</b> cyclase-deficient pYDPH 208 suggests that AGR is converted into <b>MOP</b> by <b>MOP</b> cyclase and that <b>MOP,</b> but not AGR, induces catabolism of MOA. Genetic and biochemical analyses of <b>MOP</b> and AGR metabolism suggest that only the conversion of AGR to <b>MOP</b> is directly involved in catabolism of AGR, even though the reaction catalyzed by <b>MOP</b> cyclase predominantly lies in the lactonization of <b>MOP</b> to AGR...|$|R

5|$|The {{final stage}} of the {{campaign}} saw the Japanese resistance finally break. A swift advance by the Australians along the northern coast of the peninsula followed and in January 1944 they captured Sio. At the same time, the Americans landed at Saidor. After this, <b>mopping</b> up operations were undertaken by Allied forces around Sio until March and Madang was captured in April. A lull period then followed in northern New Guinea until July when US forces clashed with the Japanese around the Driniumor River. This was followed by further fighting in November 1944 when the Australians opened a fresh campaign in Aitape–Wewak.|$|E

5|$|Baum's {{detachment}} was a mixed {{force of}} 700 composed primarily of Hessians but also including {{small amounts of}} dismounted Brunswick dragoons, Canadians, Loyalists, and Indians. He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area for horses, draft animals, provisions, and other supplies. Believing the town to be only lightly defended, Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there. After a rain-caused standoff, Stark's men enveloped Baum's position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were <b>mopping</b> up, and the battle restarted, with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann's reinforcements with heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|By 22 May, {{although}} there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications, most of the Australian objectives had been secured and <b>mopping</b> up operations began. The last remaining defensive location before the Hongorai was Egan's Ridge, where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels. A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge. It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry. Within {{a short period of}} time the Buin Road was subsequently opened, providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign, being the advance to the Hari, Mobiai, and Mivo Rivers. The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed, while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded.|$|E

A battalion of the 11th Motorised Brigade performed <b>mopping</b> up operations in the Zlosela area. A part of the Bosnian Croat TO force was retreating in disarray, while a portion of the force was trapped in Kupres and Zlosela, trying to break out. In the evening, as the mop-up of the Olovo and Osmanlije area was completed, the OG-11 ordered attacks against Gornji Malovan and Donji Malovan.

5|$|Situated along vital air and sea {{lanes of}} {{communication}} {{in the middle of}} the Mediterranean, Crete was of considerable strategic importance to both sides and, after the conclusion of the campaign in Greece, the Allies fully expected that the Germans would attempt an invasion. The 4th Brigade was stationed as a reserve force in the area around Galatas with the 18th Battalion near the newly established general hospital. When the airborne invasion began on 20 May, the battalion quickly dealt with a company of Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) that landed near them.

40|$|The {{analgesic}} {{effect of}} buprenorphine is mediated via the mu opioid receptor (<b>MOP).</b> In the present study, using mice lacking the <b>MOP</b> and their wild-type littermates, we determined {{the role of}} the <b>MOP</b> in buprenorphine-induced locomotor stimulation and conditioned place preference (CPP). Buprenorphine (3 mg/kg) increased motor activity in wild-type but not in <b>MOP</b> knockout mice, showing the motor stimulatory action of buprenorphine is mediated via the <b>MOP.</b> When the mice were given the same treatment once daily for 5 consecutive days and challenged with buprenorphine on day 11, the motor stimulatory action of buprenorphine was enhanced in wild-type but not in <b>MOP</b> knockout mice, showing sensitization developed to the motor stimulatory action of buprenorphine and this phenomenon was mediated via the <b>MOP.</b> Likewise, buprenorphine induced CPP in wild-type mice after four alternate-day saline/buprenorphine (3 mg/kg) injections paired with olfactory and visual cues. However, buprenorphine failed to induce CPP in <b>MOP</b> knockout mice. In contrast, amphetamine (1 mg/kg) induced a comparable CPP in wild-type and <b>MOP</b> knockout mice.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (modern Huehuetenango city), but Zaculeu's fortifications led to its use as a refuge during the conquest. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 40 Spanish cavalry and 80 Spanish infantry, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. Gonzalo de Alvarado left the Spanish camp at Tecpán Guatemala in July 1525 and marched to Momostenango, which quickly fell to the Spanish after a four-hour battle. The following day Gonzalo de Alvarado marched on Huehuetenango and was confronted by a Mam army of 5,000 warriors from Malacatán. The Mam army advanced across the plain in battle formation and was met by a Spanish cavalry charge that threw them into disarray, with the infantry <b>mopping</b> up those Mam that survived the cavalry. The Mam leader Canil Acab was killed and the surviving warriors fled to the hills. The Spanish army rested for a few days, then continued onwards to Huehuetenango only to find it deserted.|$|E
5|$|Back on Guam, 3rd Battalion began {{training}} for a landing on Miyako Jima, an island just south of Okinawa. Those orders were eventually cancelled, but the battalion still saw minor combat in 1945, participating in two operations on Guam designed to capture Japanese soldiers still holding out in the hills. These sweeps took place in April and December 1945. 3rd Battalion also began preparing for Operation Olympic, where as part of V Amphibious Corps, it would have landed at Kushikino, Kagoshima on Kyūshū. After the dropping of the atomic bombs in August 1945, and Japan's surrender, 3rd Battalion was detached from the 3rd Marine Division in November 1945 and deactivated the following month on 12 December 1945. Shortly before it was deactivated, however, 3rd Battalion suffered the dubious honor of having the last American killed in World War II, when PFC W.C. Patrick Bates of Kilo Company was shot by a Japanese sniper on 14 December during a <b>mopping</b> up operation on Guam (three months after the formal end of hostilities).|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{late in the}} war, the {{battalion}} received orders to deploy overseas again. Boarding the Duntroon on 24 November 1944, a week later {{the battalion}} arrived at Aitape in New Guinea. There, the 6th Division took over from the American garrison in order to free up the US troops for further fighting in the Philippines. Following disembarkation, the 2/5th concentrated around Tadji airstrip. In December, the Australians began offensive operations against the Japanese forces that were operating in the surrounding areas. For the next seven months until the war ended the 2/5th undertook patrols through the Torricelli and Prince Alexander mountain ranges, as the 17th Brigade worked to initially establish and hold the Australian base around Aitape, before moving inland towards Maprik {{and then on to}} Kiarivu to pursue the Japanese forces that had withdrawn into the interior. Although only intended as a <b>mopping</b> up campaign, it was an arduous and costly period. Consisting primarily of small unit actions which resulted in disproportionately heavy casualties for the Australians, throughout the course of the campaign the 2/5th suffered 146 casualties, including eight officers killed or wounded.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGITAST) for susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MethodsSeventy strains of M. tuberculosis were tested for susceptibility to streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol by comparing MGITAST results to those obtained by the method of proportion (<b>MOP)</b> on Lowenstein–Jensen (LJ) and Middlebrook 7 H 10 media. The 7 H 10 <b>MOP</b> was considered the method of reference. ResultsThe turnaround time for MGITAST was 6. 2 days (5 – 10 days) and for <b>MOP</b> it was 18 – 21 days. With rifampicin, MGITAST agreed for all isolates with both <b>MOP.</b> For streptomycin, MGITAST and 7 H 10 <b>MOP</b> agreed for 64 isolates (91. 4 %); 61 were susceptible and three resistant. LJ <b>MOP</b> and 7 H 10 <b>MOP</b> agreed for 64 isolates (92. 2 %); 62 were susceptible and three resistant. With isoniazid, both <b>MOP</b> agreed for all isolates, while MGITAST and 7 H 10 <b>MOP</b> had two discrepancies. For ethambutol, MGITAST and 7 H 10 <b>MOP</b> were concordant for 66 isolates; 65 were susceptible and one resistant. Both <b>MOP</b> were concordant for 67 isolates; 66 were susceptible and one resistant. ConclusionsBased on these results, MGITAST is a time-saving method and can be used {{as an alternative to the}} BACTEC System.

5|$|In {{the first}} days of the operation, the 697th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division, {{supported}} by NDH units, thrust out of their bridgehead over the Drina at Zvornik and cleared the high ground southwest and south of that town, and south along the Drina valley road, hindered by roadblocks and destroyed bridges. It then followed up the retreating insurgents, <b>mopping</b> up the Drinjača valley, before pushing southwest through the mountains and reaching Vlasenica on 18 January. Parts of the 698th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division fought southwest from Višegrad along the upper Drina valley to Međeđa, while other elements pushed west towards Rogatica, followed by an Italian Alpini battalion. The 699th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division advanced along the Drina valley past the confluence with the Drinjača to the area west of Ljubovija, clearing roadblocks as they went. In the area of Milići, they captured about 400 insurgents, mostly Chetniks loyal to Jezdimir Dangić, along with a tank, two machine guns, about 160 rifles and a large amount of ammunition.

5|$|The {{third and}} final stage of the Borneo Campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of the island. This {{operation}} had been opposed by General Blamey, who {{believed that it was}} unnecessary, but went ahead on the orders of Macarthur. After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July. Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 July but <b>mopping</b> up continued {{until the end of the}} war. The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World WarII. Although the Borneo Campaign was criticised in Australia at the time, and in subsequent years, as pointless or a waste of the lives of soldiers, it did achieve a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the Dutch East Indies, capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in deteriorating conditions.|$|E
5|$|As {{operations}} continued {{throughout the}} month, casualties amongst the Australian Corps became critical {{and the decision}} was made to disband some of the 3rd Division's battalions and use them to reinforce the remaining units. This decision saw the reduction of the strength of division's infantry brigades from four battalions to three, bringing the Australians into line with the British, who had made a similar decision earlier in the war. Nevertheless, the decision was not popular amongst the soldiers and when the 42nd Battalion received the order to disband, the attempt was rejected by its personnel and the order disobeyed. As a result, the proposed reorganisation was postponed until after the division's final offensive actions were fought in early October 1918. These came around the St Quentin Canal when the division attacked the Beaurevoir Line in concert with American troops from the US 27th Division, who would lead the assault in. The attack went awry, however, when the lead assault units failed to adequately clear the forward positions and subsequently when the 3rd Division was committed they came under fire almost immediately and instead of passing through the American positions, they had to complete the <b>mopping</b> up process before they could advance. Nevertheless, by nightfall on 1 October, the division had captured the northern end of the tunnel that ran under the canal.|$|E
