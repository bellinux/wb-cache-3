25|$|The {{trouble with}} our genial humorist {{is that he}} is beyond his depth. He would not make a success if he turned statesman. He would not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> success if he turned missionary; as a humorist he is incomparable. Every man to his trade. Let Mark {{remember}} this, and let him choose as a target for his satire something other than the heroic men who have been through the nightmare of blood and ruin in China, while he has been comfortably basking in the sunlight that makes eternal summer for a genius admired of both old world and new.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{documentation}} of the history and necessity of the Declaration of Helsinki. The first code of conduct for research including medical ethics was the Nuremberg Code. This document had large ties to Nazi war crimes, as it was introduced in 1947, so it didn’t <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{difference in terms of}} regulating practice. This issue called for the creation of the Declaration. There are some stark differences between the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki, including the way it is written. Nuremberg was written in a very concise manner, with simple explanation. The Declaration of Helsinki is written with thorough explanation in mind and including many specific commentaries.|$|E
25|$|Coulthard {{was brought}} into a Victoria XV in March 1880 to take on that season's Australian {{representative}} team. He was the leading wicket-taker for his side with 5/52 and 4/28. In his first-class debut for Victoria later that year, against South Australia on the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, he took 3/29 and contributed 31 runs to a first innings total of 329, but his performance with the leather slumped in the second innings, conceding 49 runs for a single wicket. The following month, after top scoring (51) for a Victorian XV in a match against the Australian XI, Coulthard played in his first of three first-class contests against New South Wales. He failed to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statistical impact for Victoria {{in any of these}} intercolonials.|$|E

25|$|Krause shocked Bulls fans on draft day in 2001 when he traded {{franchise}} player Brand to the Los Angeles Clippers for {{the second}} pick in the draft, Tyson Chandler. He also selected Eddy Curry with the fourth pick. Since both Chandler and Curry came straight out of high school, neither was expected to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contribution for several years, but they were seen as potential franchise players. The team floundered without veteran leadership. At mid-season, the Bulls traded their top three scorers—Mercer, Artest, and Miller along with Kevin Ollie—to the Indiana Pacers for veteran guard Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Norman Richardson. There was also a change in coaching, with Floyd being dismissed in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright, following a series of arguments with players and management. The Bulls improved from 15 to 21 wins, although they were still tied for last in the league.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the series}} {{from which it}} originated, [...] "I've Got Nothing" [...] was poorly {{received}} by critics. Some called the effort [...] "very bad" [...] and others predicted that it was [...] "unlikely to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> top 40 impact". The music video for [...] "I've Got Nothing" [...] featured footage of Chartrand and Nichols singing the song in a London park, along with an actor dressed as Children in Need mascot Pudsey Bear. This footage, along with clips of viewers miming to the song, was then used to construct the final music video for the single, which McDonnell edited.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, yet not as favorable {{for many of}} the band's previous records. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor for AllMusic, noted that the Ramones desired mainstream success much more and were recording music in such a fashion as to expand their fan-base. Another AllMusic editor, T. Donald Guarisco, noted that the [...] "entire album is pretty controversial in the world of Ramones fandom." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau called the album [...] "sad", noting that his favorite songs were [...] "I'm Affected", [...] "Baby, I Love You", and [...] "Danny Says". He also pointed out that Spector's production failed to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difference in the band's overall sound, saying [...] "his guitar overdubs are worse than his orchestrations, and they're not uncute." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I've Got Nothing" [...] {{was largely}} {{ignored by the}} {{mainstream}} media and did not receive many reviews—the reviews that it did receive from critics were generally negative. British music website Popjustice called the effort [...] "very bad", and Ellie Halfacre of Tower Review explained that [...] "some commented that the melody was bad, and others {{said it was the}} lyrics". Halfacre also questioned whether the project was about self-promotion or charity. David Balls of Digital Spy gave the single three stars out of five, predicting that it was [...] "unlikely to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> top 40 impact". James Masterton of Yahoo! Music felt that the song had [...] "fallen a long way short of" [...] the goal of reaching number one because it {{had not been able to}} [...] "guarantee mass public support". Record producer Mike Stock said that the song had [...] "no killer melody" [...] and singer VV Brown suggested that [...] "the lyrics could be better".|$|E
500|$|Einarr's brother Hallad {{was unable}} to {{maintain}} control in Orkney due to the predations of Danish pirates. He resigned his earldom and returned to Norway as a common landholder, which [...] "everyone thought was a huge joke." [...] Hallad's failure led to Rognvald flying into a rage and summoning his sons Thorir and Hrolluag. He asked which of them wanted the islands but Thorir said the decision {{was up to the}} earl himself. Rognvald predicted that Thorir's path would keep him in Norway and that Hrolluag was destined seek his fortune in Iceland. Einarr, the youngest of the natural sons, then came forward and offered to go to the islands. Rognvald said: [...] "Considering the kind of mother you have, slave-born on each side of her family, you are not likely to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ruler. But I agree, the sooner you leave and the later you return the happier I'll be." ...|$|E
500|$|Fuchs {{arrived in}} England on 24 September 1933. Jessie Gunn {{was a member}} of the Wills family, the heirs to Imperial Tobacco and benefactors of the University of Bristol. She {{arranged}} for Fuchs to meet Nevill Mott, Bristol's professor of physics, and he agreed to take Fuchs on as a research assistant. [...] Fuchs earned his Ph.D. in physics there in 1937. A paper on [...] "A Quantum Mechanical Calculation of the Elastic Constants of Monovalent Metals" [...] was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1936. By this time, Mott had a number of German refugees working for him, and lacked positions for them all. He did not think that Fuchs would <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> teacher, so he arranged a research post for Fuchs, at the University of Edinburgh working under Max Born, who was himself a German refugee. Fuchs published papers with Born on [...] "The Statistical Mechanics of Condensing Systems" [...] and [...] "On Fluctuations in Electromagnetic radiation" [...] in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. He also received a Doctorate in Science degree from Edinburgh. Fuchs proudly mailed copies back to his father in Germany.|$|E

500|$|Upon first listen, Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{said that}} she was [...] "semi-horrified" [...] at the song, but since it was a Max Martin-produced track she [...] "gave it another chance", and commented: [...] "It’s {{definitely}} a Max Martin song. It has a good beat and cheesy, yet catchy lyrics." [...] However, Coachman said that the song should have been sung by Mark Salling (Puck) and Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina) rather than Monteith and Michele. Coachman liked the fact that this song and [...] "Get It Right" [...] fit in with the episode, and wrote, [...] "I think both songs are pretty good anthems, and hopefully they do speak to the audience. She stated, however, that she [...] "probably won’t be singing along to them in my car anytime soon". In an album review giving Glee: The Music, Vol. 5 a total of two out of five stars, Andrew Leahey of Allmusic said that the new Glee songs [...] "aren’t good enough to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difference". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the song four stars for its lyrics, but said that the tune [...] "sucked".|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it for you, that doesn't <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 Styx {{released}} {{an album of}} cover tunes, Big Bang Theory, which reached the Billboard Top 50 on the album charts, their highest charting album since 1990.

2500|$|The overall {{reception}} of Art of Conquest was lukewarm. GameRankings averaged it at 66%, and Metacritic averaged it slightly lower, at 63%. IGN, {{who gave it}} a 7.8 out of 10, stated [...] "While it's a solid game, there's just not enough here to compel me to reawaken the substantial addiction the first game generated. Whether or not it's worth it for you to pick this one up depends almost entirely {{on how much you}} enjoyed the original game. With so few significant changes it plays almost exactly the same. For those who couldn't get enough of Empire Earth, the expansion should be a perfect fit. Just don't expect the breadth and scope of the first game." [...] Finally, GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10, and said [...] "Ultimately, The Art of Conquest doesn't add enough to <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difference." [...] A notable criticism from GameSpot was regarding the way Space was implemented in the game. Spaceships were only available on certain maps and the gameplay was very similar to water—a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships. Other reviewers found fault with the game's price of 30 USD. The IGN reviewer said [...] "I like Art of Conquest enough but it just falls short of being worth the $30 price tag." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got in sort of a groove. Once you get going like that you gain confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense. It's a snowball kind of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 May 1918 {{a letter}} from a serving officer, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice {{appeared}} in four London newspapers, accusing Lloyd George and Bonar Law of having misled the House of Commons in debates the previous month as to the manpower strength of the army in France. Asquith, who had seen Maurice on 6 May, and had also been in contact with the sacked Robertson, with whom Maurice discussed the letter, called for a Select Committee of the House to investigate the charges. Prior to the debate, he received a surprising communication from H.A. Gwynne, the editor of the Morning Post, and previously a fervent opponent. [...] "The effect of the Maurice letter, and your motion, must be the dissolution of the present government (and) your accession to power." [...] Asquith's opening speech on the Select Committee motion was lengthy and lacked punch. Bridgeman recorded; [...] "He did not <b>make</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> case, and did not even condemn Maurice's breach of the King's Regulations, for which he got a very heavy blow from L.G.". Lloyd George's one and a quarter-hour long reply was [...] "a stunning solo display by the greatest rhetorician of his age" [...] in which he threatened the House with the inevitable political consequence of a vote for Asquith's motion. [...] "… if this motion is carried, he (Asquith) will again be responsible for the conduct of the War. Make no mistake!" [...] John Ramsden summed up the opinion in the House of Commons; [...] "Lloyd George's lies were (preferred to) Asquith's half-measures." [...] The motion was defeated by 293 votes to 106, more an [...] "utter rejection of Asquith, than (a) wholehearted endorsement of Lloyd George", and the latter's position in Parliament was not seriously threatened {{for the remainder of the}} War.|$|E
