50|$|In mid 2011 Hitachi Rail Europe {{began the}} formal {{application}} process with South Gloucestershire Council {{for the construction}} of a rail depot at the 'Stoke Gifford Triangle'. In September 2011 a planning application was submitted; as specified, the depot was designed for a <b>maximum</b> <b>train</b> <b>length</b> of around 270 m (10 car, 26m carriage trains) with stabling for 17 trains. The maintenance building was a two road 281.2 by 21 m structure including staff and office buildings, other facilities included a train washing building 43.5 by 7.6 m, a wheel lathe building 54.7 by 12.4 m, a two-floor accommodation building 9.9 by 3.6 m as well as smaller structures including pump rooms (fuel, oil, waste water), and a shunters' cabin. Other structures included electricity substations, and tank farms. The entire site's working track was to have overhead line electrification.|$|E

30|$|Twin stack {{has been}} a {{relatively}} new but eminently successful development (30 + years in the making) in North America for domestic and international container traffic where the generosity of the loading gauge has allowed this option to be exploited. <b>Maximum</b> <b>train</b> <b>lengths</b> in Europe reflect {{the constraints of the}} existing technology; operations and commercial models the rail operators have perforce to work within. The increasing use of block trains and wagonload/carload blocks with a minimum requirement for intermediate marshalling or re-classification offers a means of enhancing competitiveness within these constraints. The economic impact that resulted in the withdrawal of rail facilities in much of Western Europe to service industrial and commercial sites is to be regretted. Rail will have to re-position itself to this either by re-investment and the re-commissioning (e.g. being done in the UK) of such links or advocate the inclusion of rail lines in any new major logistics developments as an integral planning requirement if it is to come back into contention with wagon/carload based traffic and commodities. Inter-modal as an option has major advantages but is not wholly appropriate for all traffic applications.|$|R
50|$|The <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>train</b> <b>length</b> was 312 m, {{the minimum}} ('half-length') {{approximately}} 130 m. Trainsets {{were to be}} available in half-length, full-length (260 m), or intermediate-length versions, {{with the ability to}} lengthen and shorten trains in a time which would minimise that spent out of service. Also specified was the ability for multiple working within any vehicle of the class (two units), with the time taken to couple or uncouple being 180 seconds or better, and the ability convert a bi-mode or self-powered train to an electrically powered version in the future. Bi-mode trains were required to be able to switch between power sources both whilst stationary and at speed. AWS, TPWS signalling was to be fitted dependent on route as well as ETCS Level 2 equipment.|$|R
50|$|Another {{consideration}} is the maximum {{weight of a}} <b>train.</b> A <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> <b>train</b> in Europe, 750 m long can have 50 container cars with a total weight of 2250 t, and more if 20 ft containers are included. This is not {{so far from the}} limit using standard European couplers. Double-stacking requires allowing higher train weight to be meaningful, since it is higher train weights that saves costs. In the U.S., the AAR coupler used allows much higher train weight.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{algorithms}} for measuring available path capacity at the IP layer by active probing tend to be more accurate when using long probe trains. This is due to the bias errors introduced by short probe trains. However, long trains have other disadvantages, such as delay, overhead, and increased risk for packet loss, especially for high probe rates. Router queue sizes also limit the <b>maximum</b> probe <b>train</b> <b>length.</b> In this paper, a robust method is proposed for reducing measurement bias caused by short probe trains. The method is robust {{in the sense that it}} gracefully handles lost packets and outliers, such as caused by non-Poisson cross traffic. The proposed method has been combined with the BART estimator for measuring available path capacity, and successfully tested in a multi-hop local IP network for industrial use. The principle should be generally applicable to estimators of available path capacity based on active probe trains. ...|$|R

This permitted several of the A/B units used in these services to be transferred to East New York, and in turn permitted the removal of the last BU wooden el cars from service in the BMT Nassau Street Line. Other service improvements included the extension of various lines â€” the BMT Fourth Avenue Line one station from 86th Street to Bay Ridge - 95th Street and the BMT Canarsie Line from Montrose Avenue to a connection at East New York with the other lines operating out of that point.

50|$|At first {{plans were}} made for a three-car EMU, but in the end, {{capacity}} considerations led to a decision to create trains of two different lengths, five (later class 415) and seven (later class 411) cars, the combinations of which allow a sufficient variety of <b>train</b> <b>lengths</b> with a <b>maximum</b> of three <b>trains</b> coupled (possible variations are: 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15 cars total).|$|R

The <b>train</b> <b>length</b> of the 6000 foot train is now {{expressed}} as being 6180 {{feet in length}} when the 3% factor is included and thus the train is now considered as oversize for a siding such as Middleton which is 6077 feet in length.

50|$|The first {{element of}} {{controlling}} <b>train</b> <b>lengths</b> was {{to place a}} cap on train size. To avoid train meets where both trains were overlength for a sidingâ€™s capacity, an instruction was issued to the Thunder Bay yardmasters to ensure that eastward trains leaving their terminal for the Nipigon Subdivision did not exceed a length of 6200 feet. This capping of the <b>length</b> of eastward <b>trains</b> also tacitly acknowledged that westward trains would have no length restrictions. When first implemented, this length target was difficult to meet as there was no process in place to deliver an accurate <b>train</b> <b>length</b> measurement. Thus sometimes there were surprises when, on a planned meet, a train did not fit into a siding. In such instances, the excess length {{would have to be}} moved into the sidingâ€™s back track, if possible, until the opposing train had passed. Under such a scenario, delays could be incurred by both trains. Canadian Pacific Railway took <b>train</b> <b>length</b> determination a step further and implemented on the Division a basic process to capture actual <b>train</b> <b>lengths</b> and pass this information along to the train dispatcher to assist in train planning while limiting train delays.|$|R

50|$|The {{tracks and}} {{junctions}} in the Chicago area have grown with little coordination between the railroads {{and the city}} since the first railroads arrived in the 1830s.

50|$|Since central {{operation}} of the points and signals from a single signal box is convenient, and since there are practical limits for the distance to these points and signals, crossing loops can have a system-wide effect on train sizes. In New South Wales, mechanical {{operation of}} points and signals limited <b>train</b> <b>lengths</b> in the steam era to about 400 m, which was only eased {{with the introduction of}} power-operated points and centralized traffic control. <b>Train</b> <b>lengths</b> are now as much as 1&thinsp;500 m or 1&thinsp;800 m.|$|R
