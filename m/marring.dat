25|$|Faber {{and other}} metalcutters may have {{influenced}} Lützelburger in turn, challenging him to further refine his technique. The metalcut possessed an advantage over the woodcut in close hatching because fine print lines between the furrows in the wood would sometimes break, <b>marring</b> the print.

25|$|Face {{covering}} veils with caps of otter {{were worn}} {{in the streets}} by women in public in Xinjiang as witnessed by Ahmad Kamal in the 1930s.

Nura Han removed her face veil after <b>marring</b> Ahmad Kamal. A cap of otter and a veil was worn by Nura Han.

25|$|TCKs {{who have}} {{parents or guardians}} {{affiliated}} with the military have varying levels of exposure to local culture. This {{is due to the}} possibility of living on base or off base. TCKs who live off base or who are not closely affiliated with the military (such as contractors) will have higher exposure and cultural shaping, while those who spend the majority of their time on the base will have lower exposure and minimal cultural shaping. Military children who are immersed in local culture from birth tend to show an extremely high level of cultural shaping, and upon relocation they are likely to cling to said culture for years, if not their lifetime. Relocation for these particular TCKs has shown to be particularly <b>marring</b> for them emotionally.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of {{otherwise}} gem-quality stones that possess a brown body color can have their color significantly lightened or altogether removed by HPHT treatment, or, {{depending on the type}} of diamond, improve existing color to a more desirable saturation. The process was introduced by General Electric in 1999. Diamonds treated to become colorless are all Type IIa and owe their <b>marring</b> color to structural defects that arose during crystal growth, known as plastic deformations, rather than to interstitial nitrogen impurities as is the case in most diamonds with brown color. HPHT treatment is believed to repair these deformations, and thus whiten the stone. (This is probably an incorrect conclusion, the whitening due to destruction of stable vacancy clusters according to one of the researchers). Type Ia diamonds, which have nitrogen impurities present in clusters that do not normally affect body color, can also have their color altered by HPHT. Some synthetic diamonds have also been given HPHT treatment to alter their optical properties and thus make them harder to differentiate from natural diamonds. Pressures of up to 70,000 atmospheres and temperatures of up to 2,000°C (3,632°F) are used in HPHT procedure.|$|E

500|$|In 1959, John Kundla {{stayed behind}} in Minneapolis as the Lakers {{prepared}} to leave town and succeeded O. B. Cowles as {{head coach of the}} Golden Gophers. Kundla remained head coach until 1968. [...] In 1963, he broke the color barrier in the Minnesota program and recruited three African-American players to come to the school. One of these first three players was Lou Hudson, who played in the NBA and was the first Gopher to have his number retired by the school. The other two players recruited by Kundla, Archie Clark and Don Yates, also were both drafted by NBA teams. That trio helped the Gophers to a third place Big Ten finish in 1963–64 and a second-place finish in 1964–65, but those were the high points for Kundla's collegiate career.

500|$|The next Crass single, 1980's [...] "Bloody Revolutions", was {{a benefit}} release with Poison Girls which raised £20,000 {{to fund the}} Wapping Autonomy Centre. The words were a {{critique}} (from an anarchist-pacifist perspective) of the traditional Marxist view of revolutionary struggle, and were (in part) a response to violence <b>marring</b> a gig at Conway Hall in London's Red Lion Square at which both bands performed in September 1979. The show {{was intended as a}} benefit for the so-called [...] "Persons Unknown", a group of anarchists facing conspiracy charges. During the performance Socialist Workers Party supporters and other anti-fascists attacked British Movement neo-Nazis, triggering violence. Crass afterwards argued that the leftists were largely to blame for the fighting, and organizations such as Rock Against Racism were causing audiences to become polarised into left- and right-wing factions. Others (including the anarchist organisation Class War) were critical of Crass's position, stating that [...] "like Kropotkin, their politics are up shit creek".
