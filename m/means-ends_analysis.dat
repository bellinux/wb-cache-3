For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule. Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called <b>means-ends</b> <b>analysis.</b> Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s John Sweller {{developed}} cognitive load theory (CLT) while studying problem solving. Studying learners as they solved problems, {{he and his}} associates found that learners often use a problem solving strategy called <b>means-ends</b> <b>analysis.</b> He suggests problem solving by <b>means-ends</b> <b>analysis</b> requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity, {{which may not be}} devoted to schema construction. Sweller suggests that instructional designers should prevent this unnecessary cognitive load by designing instructional materials which do not involve problem solving. Examples of alternative instructional materials include what are known as worked-examples and goal-free problems.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} investigating the effectiveness of outdoor orientation programs. Specifically, there is an absence {{of research}} examining what program elements contribute to student development and how those elements support that growth. Programs have relied on anecdotal evidence of outcome achievement but these indicators do not sufficiently identify the processes that specifically influence participant development. This study uses means-end theory to assess an outdoor orientation program at a large public university. Participant interviews identified meaningful features of their program experience and explained what outcomes were achieved as a result of those specific features. Laddering and <b>means-end</b> <b>analysis</b> were used to generate a hierarchical value map and identify participant development trends. The findings revealed that adventure elements were the most meaningful features and contributed to a diverse set of outcomes. Additionally, results showed that participants attributed growth to other features; however, they were not highlighted as the most meaningful. Conclusions drawn from the study indicate that the outdoor orientation program studied is successful in assisting student transition. Additionally, the study demonstrated that <b>means-end</b> <b>analysis</b> provides clear and detailed data associations for future investigation within this program. Additional empirically designed research examining individual program elements is required to expand upon results and develop broader conclusions regarding outdoor orientation program elements...|$|R

40|$|There is scant {{research}} on the broader outcomes of IT in users’ life contexts beyond adoption. This study uses a goal hierarchy approach to deepen {{our understanding of the}} relationship between the use of Facebook and psychological well-being (PWB) in young adults. The study applies a mixed-method design that combines <b>means-end</b> <b>analysis</b> and regression analysis to examine data collected from laddering interviews with 161 Facebook users. The <b>means-end</b> chain <b>analysis</b> provided knowledge of the hierarchical goal structure in Facebook (i. e., activities → mediated goals → ultimate goals). Regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between the ultimate goals of Facebook use (e. g., psychological stability, belongingness) and the dimensions of PWB (e. g., self-acceptance, autonomy). The findings explain the significant association of Facebook use with well-being and the dual outcomes of enjoyment (positive in SNS; negative in users’ lives). Prior research focused on relationships among abstract factors, but this study delivers a more specific and nuanced explanation of user behavior on SNSs by providing knowledge of how specific Facebook activities relate to goals and PWB. clos...|$|R

When no continuous space is large enough for direct placement, the planner leverages <b>means-end</b> <b>analysis</b> and dynamic simulation to find a sequence of linear pushes that clears the necessary space. Our heuristic for determining candidate placement poses for the target object is used to guide the manipulation search. We show successful results for our algorithm in simulation. I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Means-ends</b> <b>analysis</b> is a {{seemingly}} well understood search technique, {{which can be}} described, using planning terminology, as: keep adding actions that are feasible and achieve pieces of the goal. Unfortunately, it {{is often the case}} that no action is both feasible and relevant in this sense. The traditional answer is to make subgoals out of the preconditions of relevant but infeasible actions. These subgoals become part of the search state. An alternative, surprisingly good, idea is to recompute the entire subgoal hierarchy after every action. This hierarchy is represented by a greedy regression-match graph. The actions near the leaves of this graph are feasible and relevant to a sub... subgoals of the original goal. Furthermore, each subgoal is assigned an estimate of the number of actions required to achieve it. This number can be shown in practice to be a useful heuristic estimator for domains that are otherwise intractable. Keywords: planning, search, <b>means-ends</b> <b>analysis</b> Reinven [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{learning}} {{problem solver}} {{consists of three}} components: (1) a problem solver, (2) a memory of problem-solving knowledge, and (3) a learning component for deriving new problemsolving knowledge from experience. Previous learning problem solvers have acquired knowledge as macros, control knowledge, or cases. SteppingStone is a general learning problem solver that improves its performance by learning subgoal sequences. The underlying problem solver for SteppingStone {{is a combination of}} <b>means-ends</b> <b>analysis</b> and brute-force search. It depends primarily upon <b>means-ends</b> <b>analysis</b> and its problem-solving knowledge to solve the subgoals of the problem. Learning occurs only when this approach fails. Upon failure, search is applied and a new subgoal sequence is derived and added to its problem-solving knowledge. Before SteppingStone attempts to solve any of the problem subgoals, it first orders them with a domain independent heuristic which we call openness. Openness is used to order the subgoals to minimize interactions. Stepping-Stone's ability to improve its performance and scale to difficult problems is demonstrated with an implemented system. We show that a small memory of appropriate subgoals yields multiple orders of magnitude savings in problem-solving cost. ...|$|E
