40|$|A {{glycoprotein}} of 25, 000 daltons {{was isolated}} {{from a human}} T lymphoblastoid cell line (MOLT- 3). A <b>monovalent</b> <b>antiserum</b> raised against this antigen precipitated mouse Thy- 1. 1 antigen {{as well as a}} 25, 000 -dalton antigen from human blood T cells. The unabsorbed serum was also cytotoxic for both mouse and human T cells. By multiple criteria, this human T antigen appears to be homologous with mouse Thy- 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with humoral {{factors in the}} sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis were investigated by using an indirect immunofluorescent technique. Fluorescein-conjugated, <b>monovalent</b> <b>antiserum</b> specific to heavy chains of human immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM and to complement C 3 were used. All strains of P. aeruginosa recovered from the sputum specimens of patients with cystic fibrosis {{were found to be}} coated with antibodies of IgA, IgG, and IgM classes and with C 3. The specificity of the antibody coating was determined. The fluorescence was most intense with IgA and was followed in intensity by IgG, IgM, and C 3. No difference was noted between rough and mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa. When the subcultured P. aeruginosa was incubated with the sputum eluates, a similar pattern of fluorescence was demonstrated, indicating that these humoral factors are present in the sputum and that the coating process can take place in the lower respiratory tract of the patients. By single radial immunodiffusion, significant quantities of the humoral factors in the sputum eluates were detected. These findings suggest that P. aeruginosa is opsonized in sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|Although direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) {{testing has}} been used {{successfully}} {{for a number of}} years to detect legionellae in clinical specimens, the number of known species and serogroups of Legionella has now increased to such an extent that the performance of DFA testing for all serological variants is impractical. Lung homogenates that were submitted to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga., from patients with suspected legionellosis, from November 1977 through May 1982, were originally screened by DFA testing. In our study 498 of these lung homogenates were screened by indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) testing, using a panvalent antiserum pool containing antibodies to 25 serological variants of Legionella spp. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was used as the second antibody of the sandwich system. For positive homogenates, i. e., those containing Legionella organisms, species and serogroup identification was made by IFA staining with polyvalent serum pools and then with <b>monovalent</b> <b>antiserum.</b> Of the 498 homogenates screened, 39 (7. 8 %) were positive by IFA testing. Four (0. 8 % of total; 10. 3 % of positive homogenates) of these had previously been negative by DFA testing, but subsequent testing showed that they contained Legionella organisms for which DFA reagents were not available at the initial screening. All specimens that were positive by DFA testing were also positive by IFA testing. IFA testing with polyvalent antisera is a simple, efficient method which is at least as sensitive as DFA testing and which can be used by clinical laboratories to cope with the increasing number of known serological variants of Legionella spp...|$|E
40|$|The pneumococci {{hitherto}} {{known as}} Group IV have been separated into ten types {{which have been}} designated by Roman numerals from IV to XIII. These have been correlated {{as far as possible}} with the types described by others. The prevalence and mortality of cases due to each type have been estimated in the limited number of cases studied. Laboratory tests indicated that therapeutic antiserums for Types I, II and III have very little protective power against the recently separated types. <b>Monovalent</b> <b>antiserums</b> of high agglutinative and protective power were prepared in rabbits for each type. Several <b>monovalent</b> <b>antiserums</b> each specific for a type, which are suitable for agglutination and experimental therapeutic use, have been obtained by immunizing horses. An antiserum prepared for one type had very little cross-protective power against other types...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the nature of}} the organisms associated with outbreaks of rheumatism at The Pelham Home, in a large number of individuals at the Presbyterian Hospital Nurses' Training School and among rheumatic subjects in New York City under continuous clinical observation, studies of the throat flora have been conducted. Hemolytic streptococcus in most instances appeared in the pharynx from 1 to 5 weeks before the onset of the rheumatic attack. These organisms have been investigated with the usual types of bacteriological tests and, in addition, have been classified serologically according to Lancefield's technique. The results have demonstrated that the organisms were not of a single type, but fell into six antigenic groups. The majority of the freshly isolated strains tested were strong toxin producers. The organisms producing the strongest toxin were cultures from the patients who developed extremely intense rheumatism. About 70 per cent of these toxins were neutralized by a <b>monovalent</b> streptococcus <b>antiserum...</b>|$|R
40|$|Venoms {{of snakes}} {{belonging}} to the same Genera tend to share biochemical, toxinological and antigenic characteristics. Accordingly, paraspecific neutralization of venom lethality by experimental antisera and commercial antivenoms has been reported. We studied the spectrum of neutralization of lethality of an experimental <b>monovalent</b> equine <b>antiserum</b> against the strongly neurotoxic African forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca) when tested against venoms of most species of African Naja, both neuro and cytotoxic as described by some authors. We report {{a comparison of the}} median lethal doses (LD 50) of the venoms and the paraspecific median effective doses (ED 50) of the antiserum calculated using three methods: Spearman-Karber and Probit (currently recommended by the World Health Organization), and non-linear regression. An ample - but not complete - spectrum of paraspecific neutralization of lethality was observed against both spitting and non-spitting species of African Naja with a clearly more efficient neutralization of the more potent venoms, the implications of which are discussed. The median lethal and effective doses calculated by the three methods are remarkably consistent and may warrant consideration of non-linear regression methods for the calculation of venom lethality and antivenom potency by venom/antivenom researchers and producers...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequencing}} of the VP 1 hypervariable {{region of the}} human enterovirus (HEV) genome has become the reference test for typing field isolates. This study describes a new strategy for typing HEV at the serotype level that uses a reverse transcription-PCR assay targeting {{the central part of}} the VP 2 capsid protein. Two pairs of primers were used to amplify a fragment of 584 bp (with reference to the PV- 1 sequence) or a part of it (368 bp) for typing. For a few strains not amplified by the first PCR, seminested primers enhanced the sensitivity (which was found to be approximately 10 − 1 and 10 − 4 50 % tissue culture infective dose per reaction tube for the first and seminested assay, respectively). The typing method was then applied to 116 clinical and environmental strains of HEV. Sixty-one typeable isolates were correctly identified at the serotype level by comparison to seroneutralization. Forty-eight of 55 “untypeable” strains (87. 3 %) exhibited the same serotype using VP 1 and VP 2 sequencing methods. For six strains (four identified as EV- 71, one as E- 9, and one as E- 30 by the VP 2 method), no amplification was obtained by the VP 1 method. The last strain, typed as CV-B 4 by VP 1 and CV-B 3 by VP 2 and <b>monovalent</b> <b>antiserum,</b> could exhibit recombination within the capsid region. Although the VP 2 method was tested on only 36 of the 68 HEV serotypes, it appears to be a promising strategy for typing HEV strains isolated on a routine basis. The good sensitivity of the seminested technique could avoid cell culture and allow HEV typing directly from PCR products...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out the {{frequency}} of different serotypes of enteropathogenic Es-cherichia coli (EPEC) among healthy/diarrheal cases. Methods: A total of 191 strains, 111 from diarrheal and 80 from asymptomatic persons were examined. Determination of the EPEC serogroups was performed by agglutination tests using polyvalent and <b>monovalent</b> O <b>antiserum.</b> PCR-RFLP analysis of the flagellin-encoding (fliC) gene and agglutination tests using polyvalent and monovalent sera against H antigens (H 1 to H 56) according to the instructions of the manufacturer was performed. Results: Seventeen (8. 9 %) strains were non-motile and untypable with conventional serotyping method that showed as H-. Forty-three fliC restriction patterns were found for motile and non-motile serotypes. Each motile serotype was characterized by one or two fliC specific restriction patterns. O 142 :H 48 (6. 8 %), O 86 :H 48 (6. 3 %), O 111 :H 21 (4. 7 %) and O 127 :H 21 (4. 2 %) were the most prevalent serotypes, and O 55 :H 12 / 45, O 86 :H 48, O 127 :H 21, O 142 :H 48, O 126 :H 48 and O 126 :H 19 serotypes were the most frequently agents in diarrheal cases, compared to asymptomatic children (P< 0. 05). There were common EPEC serotypes in diarrheal and asymptomatic children, however some serotypes either found only in diarrheal cases or isolated from asymptomatic persons. Conclusion: Some serotypes were isolated more frequently from diarrheal cases than asymptomatic persons. The conven-tional serological method using antisera is the basis for the H typing system in E-coli, but it is impossible to serotype non-motile bacteria. PCR-RFLP analysis of fliC gene is a practical method in identifying the H variant in motile and non-motile EPEC serotypes and is useful for epidemiological studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} two papers {{findings}} were presented which point to a close relationship between the incidence of rheumatic fever {{and the distribution of}} Streptococcus hemolyticus. The fact was emphasized that in the rheumatic subject a recrudescence of the disease process is usually preceded by pharyngeal infection with hemolytic streptococci. These organisms conspicuous in the throat flora during the period of infection preliminary to an attack of acute rheumatism fell into six antigenic groups and produced toxins which in 70 per cent were neutralized by a <b>monovalent</b> streptococcus <b>antiserum.</b> In the present study, four series of observations have been presented, demonstrating the development of immune bodies to hemolytic streptococcus during the course of rheumatic fever. The agglutination and complement fixation reactions of sera from patients with acute rheumatism suggest recent infection with streptococcus. Precipitin tests indicate {{that at the time of}} appearance of the rheumatic attack, individuals develop, in their blood, precipitins to the protein fractions of hemolytic streptococcus. That these precipitins may not be entirely specific is recognized from their cross-reactions with antigens of chemically related organisms. The studies made in association with E. W. Todd of England have demonstrated that at the onset of an attack of acute rheumatism, there occurs in each instance a rise in the antistreptolysin titer of the patient's serum. This titer is much higher than that observed in normal subjects or in patients with bacterial infection other than hemolytic streptococcus. This presence of antistreptolysin with an N. D. of 0. 005 cc. is considered strong evidence of recent infection by hemolytic streptococcus. In conclusion, the relationship between the incidence of hemolytic streptococcus and the geographical distribution of rheumatic fever, the relationship between the recrudescence in the rheumatic subject and infection of the throat with hemolytic streptococcus, the development of immune bodies for hemolytic streptococcus at the onset of the rheumatic attack and the apparently specific relationship of antistreptolysin formation to infection with hemolytic streptococcus,—together this combined evidence indicates that the infectious agent initiating the rheumatic process is Streptococcus hemolyticus...|$|R
40|$|Shigella spp. are the causative {{agent of}} {{shigellosis}} with Shigella flexneri serotype 2 a {{being the most}} prevalent in developing countries. Epidemiological surveillance in China found that a new serotype of S. flexneri appeared in 2001 and replaced serotype 2 a in 2003 as the most prevalent serotype in Henan Province. The new serotype also became the dominant serotype in 7 of the 10 other provinces under surveillance in China by 2007. The serotype {{was identified as a}} variant of serotype X. It differs from serotype X by agglutination to the <b>monovalent</b> anti-IV type <b>antiserum</b> and the group antigen-specific monoclonal antibody MASF IV-I. Genome sequencing of a serotype X variant isolate, 2002017, showed that it acquired a Shigella serotype conversion island, also as an SfX bacteriophage, containing gtr genes for type X-specific glucosylation. Multilocus sequence typing of 15 genes from 37 serotype X variant isolates and 69 isolates of eight other serotypes, 1 a, 2 a, 2 b, 3 a, 4 a, 5 b, X, and Y, found that all belong to a new sequence type (ST), ST 91. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 154 pulse types with 655 S. flexneri isolates analyzed and identified 57 serotype switching events. The data suggest that S. flexneri epidemics in China have been caused by a single epidemic clone, ST 91, with frequent serotype switching to evade infection-induced immunity to serotypes to which the population was exposed previously. The clone has also acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics. These findings underscore the challenges to the current vaccine development and control strategies for shigellosis...|$|R
