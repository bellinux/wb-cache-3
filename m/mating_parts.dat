5000|$|The terms [...] "clearance" [...] and [...] "tolerance" [...] {{are very}} often {{confused}} and misused. Clearance is {{the distance between}} the surfaces of <b>mating</b> <b>parts.</b> Tolerance is the allowable variation of a dimension from its nominal (desired) value.|$|E

50|$|In engineering, a boss is a {{protruding}} {{feature on}} a workpiece. A common {{use for a}} boss is to locate one object within a pocket or hole of another object.

50|$|Ultrasonic welding {{utilizes}} high frequency, {{vertical motion}} to produce {{heat and the}} flow of thermoplastic material at the interface of <b>mated</b> <b>parts.</b> Pressure is maintained after the delivery of energy is stopped to allow re-solidification of interwoven plastic at the joint, securing the parts with a homogeneous or mechanical bond. This process offers an environmentally friendly means of assembly as opposed to conventional adhesives or mechanical fasteners.|$|R

50|$|Ortman Key is a {{coupling}} device used to secure two adjacent cylindrical segments of a pressure vessel common in tactical rocket motors. An Ortman Key is made of elongated rectangular metal bar stock, such as steel, and is inserted into juxtaposed annular grooves around the circumference of the <b>mating</b> <b>parts.</b> The Ortman Key assembly is used in high pressure applications where packaging, strength and mass are important.|$|E
50|$|Parallel {{keys are}} the most widely used. They have a square or {{rectangular}} cross-section. Square keys are used for smaller shafts and rectangular faced keys are used for shaft diameters over 6.5 in or when the wall thickness of the mating hub is an issue. Set screws often accompany parallel keys to lock the <b>mating</b> <b>parts</b> into place. The keyway is a longitudinal slot in both the shaft and mating part.|$|E
50|$|Spiral welding is {{a process}} where a {{continuous}} full penetration MIG weld overlay is used to rebuild damage from wear, erosion, corrosion or cracking, or to increase the dimensions of a component to match an increased dimension on a <b>mating</b> <b>part.</b> Using the Spiral weld process eliminates the possible distortion of the component due to unbalanced stresses from normal welding processes. Spiral welding is a low energy input process, during which individual layers of weld and their associated heat affected zones are tempered and the grain structures refined by subsequent and overlapping temper beads.|$|R
50|$|The {{principals}} of this {{coupling system}} were originally published by James Clerk Maxwell in 1871. The Maxwell Kinematic system {{consists of three}} V-shaped grooves that are oriented {{to the center of}} the <b>part,</b> while the <b>mating</b> <b>part</b> has three curved surfaces that sit down into the three grooves. Each of the three v-grooves provides two contact points for a total of six. This design benefits from symmetry and therefore easier manufacturing techniques. Also the Maxwell Coupling is thermally stable due to this symmetry as the curved surfaces can expand or contract in unison in the v-grooves.|$|R

[...] The latter is particularly important for high speed operation. The more exact fit of the key and keyway also reduces play, and stress concentrations in, and improves {{the reliability of the}} key.
