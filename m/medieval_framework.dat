50|$|The small parish church, {{dedicated}} to St Michael and All Angels, has a finely carved Anglo-Saxon font and two surviving Anglo-Saxon {{windows in the}} chancel, which exceptionally retain their original wooden frames. Its small wooden shingled belfry is strangely underpinned by an unnecessarily large and sturdy late <b>medieval</b> <b>framework</b> of heavy timber. The remains of a gnarled ancient tree are nearby. In the churchyard there is the gravestone of the Unknown Sailor.|$|E

In this very short treatise of the mid- 1220 s, Grosseteste continued the discussion on light and colours he started in the De Iride. He describes two manners of counting colours: one gives an infinity of tones, the other counts seven colours. In both cases, colours are created by the purity or impurity of the transparent medium when light is passing through it. This <b>medieval</b> <b>framework</b> survived until Newton's experiments with prisms. Comment: Robert Grosseteste, circle of colour...|$|E

500|$|While the {{character}} of the Green Knight is usually not viewed as a representation of Christ in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, critics do acknowledge a parallel. Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that [...] "the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ's divine/human nature provides a <b>medieval</b> conceptual <b>framework</b> that supports the poet's serious/comic account of the Green Knight's supernatural/human qualities and actions." [...] This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.|$|R
40|$|Jacob Ruff's Adam und Heva, {{written in}} 1550 by the Zurich town surgeon with the dual purpose of {{entertaining}} and instructing Zurich's {{citizens in the}} new Protestant faith, {{is important for the}} way in which Ruff, a follower of the Swiss reformer, Zwingli, was intent on using images from the Old Testament to dramatise the Reformation tenets of sola scriptura, sola fide and sola gratia on the open-air stage of the Miinsterhof in Zurich. The original Froschauer print of 1550, of which there are four copies still extant in libraries in Zurich, St. Gallen, Munich and Berlin, has, until more recent years, been neglected by scholarship, and the last major study of the drama, which takes place over two days and involves a cast of one hundred and six, was the 1848 edition by the German literary historian, Hermann Marcus Kottinger. In the present study, I provide a critical edition which seeks to make the Adam und Heva more accessible to the modern reader, and also a commentary, in which I undertake a detailed analysis {{of the way in which}} Ruff pursues a more medieval syncretism by fusing various dramatic elements of the Middle Ages with what is nevertheless a Reformation theology, thereby incoporporating medieval and contemporary thought in a <b>medieval</b> and modern <b>framework,</b> and creating some of the most innovative scenes in the long tradition of medieval creation literature. In addition, by comparing the Adam una Heva to the works of contemporaries of Ruff, namely the Swiss Reformation dramatists Hans von Rote and Jos Murer, and the Germans, Valten Voith and Hans Sachs, I study how elements of the drama of the Middle Ages could exist alongside the external and contemporary influences of the Swiss and German literary traditions, and how Swiss drama, largely neglected by the literary historian, may be placed firmly within the German evangelical dramatic tradition...|$|R
