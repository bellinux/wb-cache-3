5|$|Volcanic ash {{particles}} erupted during magmatic eruptions {{are made}} up of various fractions of vitric (glassy, non-crystalline), crystalline or lithic (non-magmatic) particles. Ash produced during low viscosity magmatic eruptions (e.g., Hawaiian and Strombolian basaltic eruptions) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process. For example, ash collected from Hawaiian lava fountains consists of sideromelane (light brown basaltic glass) pyroclasts which contain rare microlites (small quench crystals) and phenocrysts. Slightly more viscous eruptions of basalt (e.g., Strombolian) form a variety of pyroclasts from irregular sideromelane droplets to blocky tachylite (black to dark brown <b>microcrystalline</b> pyroclasts). In contrast, most high-silica ash (e.g. rhyolite) consists of pulverised products of pumice (vitric shards), individual phenocrysts (crystal fraction) and some lithic fragments (xenoliths).|$|E

25|$|<b>Microcrystalline</b> silica {{consists}} of minute quartz crystals bonded together with amorphous silica. Examples include flint and chert.|$|E
25|$|Jadeite is a sodium- and aluminium-rich pyroxene. The {{precious}} form of jadeite jade is a <b>microcrystalline</b> interlocking {{growth of}} jadeite crystals.|$|E
25|$|Polymers with <b>microcrystalline</b> {{regions are}} {{generally}} tougher (can be bent more without breaking) and more impact-resistant than totally amorphous polymers.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation is the {{formation}} of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or <b>microcrystalline</b> residue and slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from <b>microcrystalline</b> salts.|$|E
25|$|Among petrologists, {{chalcedony}} {{is sometimes}} considered separately from chert {{due to its}} fibrous structure. Since many cherts contain both <b>microcrystalline</b> and microfibrous quartz, it is sometimes difficult to classify a rock as completely chalcedony, thus its general inclusion as a variety of chert.|$|E
25|$|Silicon {{thin-film}} {{cells are}} mainly deposited by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (typically plasma-enhanced, PE-CVD) from silane gas and hydrogen gas. Depending on the deposition parameters, this can yield amorphous silicon (a-Si or a-Si:H), protocrystalline silicon or nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si or nc-Si:H), also called <b>microcrystalline</b> silicon.|$|E
25|$|Flint is {{a compact}} <b>microcrystalline</b> quartz. It {{is found in}} chalk or marly {{limestone}} formations and is formed by a replacement of calcium carbonate with silica. It is commonly found as nodules. This variety was often used in past times to make bladed tools.|$|E
25|$|They are {{commonly}} {{composed of a}} carbonate mineral such as calcite; an amorphous or <b>microcrystalline</b> form of silica such as chert, flint, or jasper; or an iron oxide or hydroxide such as goethite and hematite. They can also be composed of other minerals that include dolomite, ankerite, siderite, pyrite, marcasite, barite and gypsum.|$|E
25|$|Nephrite {{consists}} of a <b>microcrystalline</b> interlocking fibrous matrix of the calcium, magnesium-iron rich amphibole mineral series tremolite (calcium-magnesium)-ferroactinolite (calcium-magnesium-iron). The middle member of this series with an intermediate composition is called actinolite (the silky fibrous mineral form is one form of asbestos). The higher the iron content, the greener the colour.|$|E
25|$|Phenyldichloroarsine {{is one of}} four organic arsenicals, {{the other}} three are {{lewisite}} (L), methyldichloroarsine (MD), and ethyldichloroarsine (ED). PD is considered an analog of lewisite. At its freezing point, -20°C, PD becomes a <b>microcrystalline</b> solid mass. The compound has a C-metalloid bond between the phenyl group and the arsenic and two covalent bonds between the arsenic and the chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, results {{indicate}} that microscopic pores in sintered ceramic nanomaterials, mainly trapped at the junctions of <b>microcrystalline</b> grains, cause light to scatter and prevented true transparency. {{it has been observed}} that the total volume fraction of these nanoscale pores (both intergranular and intragranular porosity) must be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission. I.E. The density has to be 99.99% of the theoretical crystalline density.|$|E
25|$|Opal is a {{hydrated}} silicon dioxide. It {{is often}} of a Neogenic origin. In fact {{is not a}} mineral (it is a mineraloid) and it is generally not considered a variety of chert, although some varieties of opal (opal-C and opal-CT) are <b>microcrystalline</b> and contain much less water (sometime none). Often people without petrological training confuse opal with chert due to similar visible and physical characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Amorphous silicon is {{the most}} {{well-developed}} thin film technology to-date. An amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or <b>microcrystalline</b> silicon. Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density infrared portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{physical}} circumstances {{do not allow}} molecules to be studied in solution, {{and at the same}} time not by other spectroscopic techniques to an atomic level, either. In solid-phase media, such as crystals, <b>microcrystalline</b> powders, gels, anisotropic solutions, etc., it is in particular the dipolar coupling and chemical shift anisotropy that become dominant to the behaviour of the nuclear spin systems. In conventional solution-state NMR spectroscopy, these additional interactions would lead to a significant broadening of spectral lines. A variety of techniques allows establishing high-resolution conditions, that can, at least for 13C spectra, be comparable to solution-state NMR spectra.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{borohydride}} is an odorless {{white to}} gray-white <b>microcrystalline</b> powder which often forms lumps. It can be purified by recrystallization from warm (50°C) diglyme. Sodium borohydride is soluble in protic solvents {{such as water}} and lower alcohols; it will also react with these solvents to produce H2; however, these reactions are fairly slow. Complete decomposition in excess methanol can take nearly 90min at 20°C. It will decompose in neutral or acidic aqueous solutions but is stable at pH 14. These conditions can be exploited to allow sodium borohydride to react in a homogeneous manner, with reduced lifespan being traded against increased reactivity.|$|E
25|$|The Triton figures {{began to}} be {{dismantled}} on 4 February 2017, and they were later sent in Florence to be cleaned. The concrete {{that was used to}} fill the brass figures has been removed. A steel structure has been built inside the figures so as to support the weight of the plate, and each figure will be covered in <b>microcrystalline</b> wax for protection and painted in azurite blue as was their original colour in 1959. The massive base of the fountain are being restored by the De Feo Restauri of Rome, a specialized company in restoration of monuments. A new plant room has been constructed, which is connected to the new pump room through a tunnel. Restoration works of the massive base of the fountain and its basins, as the electrical and mechanical installations, are expected to be ready {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, <b>microcrystalline</b> waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E
500|$|Suillus americanus {{contains}} a polysaccharide {{known as a}} beta glucan that laboratory tests suggest may have anti-inflammatory activity. Known specifically as a (1→3)-, (1→4)-β-D-glucan, its natural function is {{as a component of}} the fungal cell wall, where it forms <b>microcrystalline</b> [...] in the wall that give it rigidity and strength. The anti-inflammatory activity results from the polysaccharide's ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide in activated macrophages, a cell of the immune system.|$|E
500|$|Llullaillaco {{has mostly}} erupted dacites with medium {{potassium}} content, with rocks becoming more felsic the younger they are. Rock samples taken from Llullaillaco are mostly porphyritic or vitrophyric, with a glassy or <b>microcrystalline</b> matrix. Phenocrysts are mostly plagioclase, with mafic phenocrysts being dominated by orthopyroxene and smaller amounts of biotite, clinopyroxene, and hornblende. Ilmenite, magnetite, and sulfide minerals are also present, magnetite {{especially in the}} more oxidized older lavas. Some phenocrysts show evidence of a complex history. Quartz is rare. Older lavas have developed a red colour and contain oxidized iron in form of hematite. Lavas from Llullaillaco I are grey. The content of [...] is 65–67%.|$|E
500|$|In {{recent years}} it has been {{demonstrated}} that nanocrystalline BaFCl:Sm as prepared by a co-precipitation {{can serve as a}} very efficient x-ray storage phosphor. The co-precipitation leads to nanocrystallites of the order of 100-200nm in size and their sensitivity as x-ray storage phosphors is increased an astounding ∼500,000 times because of the specific arrangements and density of defect centres in comparison with <b>microcrystalline</b> samples prepared by sintering at high temperature. The mechanism is based on the reduction of Sm to Sm by trapping electrons that are created upon exposure to ionizing radiation in the BaFCl host. The [...] D- F f-f luminescence lines can be very efficiently excited via the parity allowed 4f →4f 5d transition at around 417nm. The latter wavelength is ideal for efficient excitation by blue-violet laser diodes as the transition is electric dipole allowed and thus relatively intense (400 l/(mol⋅cm)).|$|E
500|$|The {{faces of}} diamond octahedrons are highly lustrous owing to their hardness; {{triangular}} shaped growth defects (trigons) or etch pits are often {{present on the}} faces. A diamond's fracture may be step-like, conchoidal (shell-like, similar to glass) or irregular. Diamonds which are nearly round, due {{to the formation of}} multiple steps on octahedral faces, are commonly coated in a gum-like skin (nyf). The combination of stepped faces, growth defects, and nyf produces a [...] "scaly" [...] or corrugated appearance. Many diamonds are so distorted that few crystal faces are discernible. Some diamonds found in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are polycrystalline and occur as opaque, darkly colored, spherical, radial masses of tiny crystals; these are known as ballas and are important to industry as they lack the cleavage planes of single-crystal diamond. Carbonado is a similar opaque <b>microcrystalline</b> form which occurs in shapeless masses. Like ballas diamond, carbonado lacks cleavage planes and its specific gravity varies widely from 2.9 to 3.5. Bort diamonds, found in Brazil, Venezuela, and Guyana, are {{the most common type of}} industrial-grade diamond. They are also polycrystalline and often poorly crystallized; they are translucent and cleave easily.|$|E

2500|$|Although non-nacreous, {{the surface}} of fine conch pearls has a unique and {{attractive}} appearance of its own. The microstructure of conch pearls comprises partly aligned bundles of <b>microcrystalline</b> fibres that create a shimmering, slightly iridescent effect known as [...] "flame structure". The effect {{is a form of}} chatoyancy, caused by the interaction of light rays with the microcrystals in the pearl's surface, and it somewhat resembles moiré silk.|$|E
2500|$|Chert (...) is a {{fine-grained}} [...] {{sedimentary rock}} composed of <b>microcrystalline</b> or cryptocrystalline silica. Depending on its origin, it can contain either microfossils, small macrofossils, or both. It varies greatly in color (from white to black), but most often manifests as gray, brown, grayish brown and light green to rusty red; its color {{is an expression}} of trace elements present in the rock, and both red and green are most often related to traces of iron (in its oxidized and reduced forms respectively).|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} distinction between types of quartz {{is that of}} macrocrystalline (individual crystals visible to the unaided eye) and the <b>microcrystalline</b> or cryptocrystalline varieties (aggregates of crystals visible only under high magnification). The cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque, while the transparent varieties tend to be macrocrystalline. Chalcedony is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz, and its monoclinic polymorph moganite. Other opaque gemstone varieties of quartz, or mixed rocks including quartz, often including contrasting bands or patterns of color, are agate, carnelian or sard, onyx, [...] heliotrope, and jasper.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is used as}} an {{infrared}} optical material with a remarkably wide transmission wavelength range (0.45µm to 21.5µm). The refractive index is about 2.67 at 550nm (green), and about 2.40 at 10.6µm (LWIR). Similar to zinc sulfide, ZnSe is produced as <b>microcrystalline</b> sheets by synthesis from hydrogen selenide gas and zinc vapour. Another method of producing is a growth from melt under excessive pressure of inert gas (Ar usually). When free of absorption and inclusions it is ideally suited for CO2 laser optics at 10.6µm wavelength. It is thus a very important IR material. In daily life, {{it can be found}} as the entrance optic in the new range of [...] "in-ear" [...] clinical thermometers, seen as a small yellow window. Zinc selenide can slowly react with atmospheric moisture if poorly polished, but this is not generally a serious problem. Except where optics are used in spectroscopy or at the Brewster angle, antireflection or beamsplitting optical coatings are generally employed.|$|E
