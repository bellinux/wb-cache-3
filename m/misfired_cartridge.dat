5000|$|The FN Forty-Nine is a recoil operated, locked breech {{semi-automatic}} pistol {{developed by}} the Belgium company Fabrique Nationale (FN). The Forty-Nine uses an improved linkless locking principle intended for police use. The pistol is striker fired and uses FN's Repeatable Secure Striker mechanism. This means that unlike many other striker-fired pistols, such as the Glock family, the Forty-Nine operates on a double-action only (DAO) trigger mechanism, meaning that the hammer is cocked by the trigger pull before every shot. This allows the user to re-strike a <b>misfired</b> <b>cartridge</b> simply by pulling the trigger again. The Forty-Nine has no external (manual) safety switches. The double-stacked detachable magazine holds sixteen rounds in 9mm caliber and fourteen in [...]40 S&W. The frame is constructed of polymer and the slide of stainless steel. An accessory rail under the barrel allows for quick and easy mounting of laser aiming modules and flashlights.|$|E
50|$|Gebauer {{concluded}} that the then-common practice of converting infantry machine guns for aircraft use was outdated. The most common problem with such converted weapons was that {{the position of the}} aircraft's propeller controlled the time of firing only, {{with the rest of the}} gun's operation depending on the force of propellant gases; a late-firing cartridge could cause damage to the propeller blades, while misfires stopped operation altogether. Gebauer had the idea to directly power a machine gun from the aircraft's engine, independently of the gas produced by the gun's cartridges. This meant that <b>misfired</b> <b>cartridges</b> would be automatically ejected and the next loaded. He called it the direct-driven motor machine gun.|$|R
50|$|In each case, {{the shooter}} should {{wait for a}} period of time, {{commonly}} recommended between 25 seconds, up to two minutes, with the firearm pointed in a safe direction, then carefully remove the magazine, extract any mis-fed or <b>misfired</b> <b>cartridge(s),</b> and, with the breech opened carefully, check to ensure there is not a bullet or other obstruction lodged in the bore of the barrel. If there is an obstruction, and a subsequent round is fired, the firearm can fail explosively resulting in serious injury. Misfired rounds should be disposed of properly, usually in a special container for live ammo that failed to fire after ejecting round; such rounds should not be simply disposed of in the trash.|$|R
5000|$|This German [...] "Einhand" [...] {{system allows}} {{the user to}} single-handedly chamber a {{cartridge}} by pulling the trigger guard back, which {{is connected to the}} slide. This pulling action will retract the slide back against the return spring. When the trigger guard is released, the slide will return and chamber the cartridge almost instantaneously. The chamber is fluted to reduce slide recoil, this reduces gas pressure acting on the base of the cartridge case. The trigger is then pulled to fire in single-action and the trigger guard is then automatically locked forward as to not strain the index finger during normal firing. An advantage of this system is that <b>misfired</b> <b>cartridges</b> can be quickly discharged with only one hand. If one prefers to carry with a loaded chamber, a traditional, manual safety exists above the left grip panel on the frame.|$|R
50|$|Centerfire {{cartridges}} {{are more}} reliable {{for military purposes}} because the thicker metal cartridge cases can withstand rougher handling without damage, and safer to handle because explosive priming compound in a protruding rim {{is more likely to}} be triggered by impact if a rimfire cartridge is dropped or pinched. The stronger base of a centerfire cartridge is able to withstand higher pressures which in turn give a bullet greater velocity and energy. While centerfire cartridge cases require a complex and expensive manufacturing process, explosive handling is simplified by avoiding the spinning process required to uniformly distribute priming explosive into the rim because of uncertainty about which angular segment of a rimfire cartridge rim will be struck by the firing pin. Larger caliber rimfire cartridges require greater volumes of priming explosive than centerfire cartridges, and the required volume may cause an undesirably high pressure during ignition. Reducing the amount of priming explosive would reduce the reliability of rimfire cartridge ignition, and increase the probability of <b>misfire</b> or dud <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Early primers {{used the}} same mercury {{fulminate}} used in 19th century percussion caps. Black powder could be effectively ignited by hot mercury released upon decomposition. Disadvantages of mercuric primers became evident with smokeless powder loadings. Mercury fulminate slowly decomposed in storage until the remaining energy was insufficient for reliable ignition. [...] Decreased ignition energy with age had not been recognized as a problem with black-powder loadings because black powder could be ignited by as little energy as a static electricity discharge. Smokeless powder often required more thermal energy for ignition. [...] Misfires and hang fires became common as the remaining priming compound sputtered in old primers. A misfire would result if the priming compound either failed {{to react to the}} firing pin fall or extinguished prior to igniting the powder charge. A hang fire is a perceptible delay between the fall of the firing pin and discharge of the firearm. In extreme cases, the delay might be sufficient to be interpreted as a <b>misfire,</b> and the <b>cartridge</b> could fire as the action was being opened or the firearm pointed in an inappropriate direction.|$|R
30|$|Linking of the firearm, fired {{cartridge}} case and bullet is a classical example of tool mark identification. It follows the forensic science basic principle of individuality that no two tools marks should {{produce the same}} microscopic marks on two separate objects {{that they would be}} inaccurately or wrongly identified (Smith et al., 2016). Fired {{cartridge case}}s and bullets bear characteristic marks, which enable firearm examiners to identify the firearm that fired them (Kinder et al., 2004). Examination of firing pin and breech face impression on the fired cartridge case is essential link for the linkage of firearm with the fired cartridges (Sharma, 1963). But in few cases it becomes difficult to match the fired cartridge with the alleged firearm due to malfunctioning of firearm or in cases where the firearm <b>misfires</b> live test <b>cartridges.</b> In such cases the firing impressions could be reproduced on various soft surfaces without damaging the firing pin. Firing pin impressions are generated because of striking of firing pin on the percussion cap of the cartridge. Similarly breech face impression are obtained when a cartridge is fired in the gun the very heavy pressure of the gas generated inside the cartridge force the head of the cartridge back against the head of the breech block which imprints the impression on the breech on the brittle material commonly brass or germanium silver (Harding-Barlow, 1950).|$|R
