5|$|This New Life is endless, {{and even}} after <b>my</b> <b>physical</b> death it will be kept alive by those who live the life of {{complete}} renunciation of falsehood, lies, hatred, anger, greed and lust; and who, to accomplish all this, do no lustful actions, do no harm to anyone, do no backbiting, do not seek material possessions or power, who accept no homage, neither covet honor nor shun disgrace, and fear no one and nothing; by those who rely wholly and solely on God, and who love God purely {{for the sake of}} loving; who believe in the lovers of God and in the reality of Manifestation, and yet do not expect any spiritual or material reward; who do not let go the hand of Truth, and who, without being upset by calamities, bravely and wholeheartedly face all hardships with one hundred percent cheerfulness, and give no importance to caste, creed and religious ceremonies. This New Life will live by itself eternally, even if there is no one to live it.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} is essentially whether correlations between base and supervenient properties hold within actual worlds only, or across possible worlds. For example, if psychological properties strongly locally supervene on physical properties, then any two people physically the same, in any two worlds, {{will also be}} psychologically the same. On the other hand, if psychological properties only weakly locally supervene on physical properties, then those correlations between base and supervenient properties that hold in virtue of the supervenience relation are maintained within each world, but can be different in different worlds. For example, <b>my</b> <b>physical</b> duplicates in the actual world {{will have the same}} thoughts as I have; but <b>my</b> <b>physical</b> duplicates in other possible worlds may have different thoughts than I have in the actual world.|$|E

500|$|Del Potro's {{first half}} of the season was {{hampered}} by injuries and a change of coach, starting with a first-round loss in Adelaide, where he was the seventh seed. He then made it to {{the second round of the}} Australian Open in January, only to retire against David Ferrer due to an injury. Del Potro returned to the circuit in March, winning his first match against Jesse Levine at the Sony Ericsson Open, before losing in the second round to López. Struggling with injuries, his ranking fell as low as no. 81 in April. [...] "At the start of the year, I was playing good, but I had many injuries, many problems with my body, with my physique", said del Potro.

60|$|How brief {{the span}} of a year! Here I was in Flagstaff again {{outfitting}} for another hunt. It seemed incredible. It revived that old haunting thought about the shortness of life.

2500|$|Trier had not {{recovered}} completely {{from his}} depression when filming started.

2500|$|Bourguiba was {{satisfied}} with his journey to Kef: [...] "My journey in Kef cured my health. But {{it was too late}} for <b>my</b> <b>physical</b> development. My height did not grow from 1m 65, which meant 5 centimeters less from normal. Because in my teenage years, I lacked vitamins now available to young people and granted to them free of charge in hospitals and by national organizations", he stated years later. While he was in Kef, the Destour party was founded aiming independence. Since then, Bourguiba showed interest in activism and declared to one of his friends in Kef, Othman Kaak: [...] "You love literature. I, myself, like it, I even love it. But I have other goals. I want to enroll in law school to fight against France". His goals were, however, thwarted by his non-studious educations, unlike his old mates of Sadiki, who became bureaucrats in the colonial administration.|$|E

60|$|The {{thought of}} Nettie's shining form, of her {{shrinking}} bold abandon to her easy conqueror, gave me now {{a body of}} rage that was nearly too strong for my heart and nerves and the tense powers of <b>my</b> merely <b>physical</b> being.

She went on to say following the incident, [...] "what really hurt was that he was not sensitive to me as a woman and his attempt at reconciliation had come too late" [...] suggesting that his actions were a deliberate attempt at reconciliation or compensation for his lack of sexual interest in Priscilla which had been a source of hurt and discontent for her for years. Priscilla states in her book [...] "He had mentioned to me before we were married that he {{had never been able to}} make love to a woman who had a child" [...] and she later expressed the personal repercussions of their sexual dysfunction [...] "I am beginning to doubt my own sexuality as a woman. <b>My</b> <b>physical</b> and emotional needs were unfulfilled."

2500|$|He {{knew his}} stay in Paris {{might be a}} long one and he {{proceeded}} accordingly: [...] "I saw that to accomplish anything I must bring all <b>my</b> <b>physical</b> and moral faculties in play, make the acquaintance of the great and the powerful, exercise strict self-control, and play the chameleon." [...] Casanova had matured, and this time in Paris, though still depending at times on quick thinking and decisive action, he was more calculating and deliberate. His first task {{was to find a}} new patron. He reconnected with old friend de Bernis, now the Foreign Minister of France. Casanova was advised by his patron to find a means of raising funds for the state as a way to gain instant favor. Casanova promptly became one of the trustees of the first state lottery, and one of its best ticket salesmen. The enterprise earned him a large fortune quickly. With money in hand, he traveled in high circles and undertook new seductions. He duped many socialites with his occultism, particularly the Marquise Jeanne d'Urfé, using his excellent memory which made him appear to have a sorcerer's power of numerology. In Casanova's view, [...] "deceiving a fool is an exploit worthy of an intelligent man".|$|E
