The Early Nationalists failed to draw the masses into the mainstream of the national movement such that their area of influence remained limited to urban educated Indians. In particular, their leadership comprised only members of professional groups such as lawyers, doctors, journalists and teachers.|$|E

500|$|Given the {{ubiquity of}} the wheel in human technology, and the {{existence}} of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as wings and lenses), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several developmental and evolutionary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by natural selection, addressing the question [...] "Why can't life evolve wheels?" [...] Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as walking, running, or slithering) in natural environments, addressing the question [...] "If wheels could evolve, why <b>might</b> <b>they</b> be rare nonetheless?" [...] This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.|$|E
500|$|Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", {{was given}} during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. It {{primarily}} addresses {{an audience of}} African-American women. [...] Pauli Murray acknowledges the fact that African-American women always {{have contributed to the}} progress of the Civil Rights Movement. She asserted that African-American women have worked just as hard as, if not harder than, African-American men to achieve equal rights among black people and white people. According to Murray, [...] "Not only have they stood...with Negro men in every phase of the battle, but they have also continued to stand when their men were destroyed by it." [...] The black women decided to [...] "...continue......" [...] for their freedom and liberty even when [...] "...their men..." [...] began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights. These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious [...] "battle". [...] Murray continued her praise for black women when she stated that [...] "...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have come this far without the indomitable determination of its women?" [...] The [...] "Negro struggle" [...] was able to progress partly because of [...] "...the indomitable determination of its women." [...] African-American women were vital to the Civil Rights Movement and pushed it forward with their own <b>might.</b> <b>They</b> were just as important to the black struggle for racial justice as their male counterparts. Their work ethic and persistence defined African-American women as important to a long fight against racism in America.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "ship portrait" [...] had a {{long history}} in {{maritime}} art, from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels. [...] The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military <b>might</b> <b>they</b> could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or [...] "plats", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during King Henry's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.|$|E

"In the {{beginning}} of barley harvest" [...] or [...] "at the commencement of barley-harvest": Barley ripened before wheat, and began to be reaped sometimes as early as March, but generally in April, or Abib. By {{the time that the}} barley-harvest was finished the wheat crop would be ready for the sickle. Barley was the first crop to be cut, , [...] [...] "The beginning of barley harvest" [...] which, according to Josephus, began {{on the second day of}} the [...] "feast of unleavened bread", on the [...] "sixteenth" [...] of Nisan, which answers to our March, and part of April, when they offered the sheaf of the firstfruits to the Lord, and then, and not till then, <b>might</b> <b>they</b> begin their harvest (see Gill on Leviticus 23:10; see Gill on Leviticus 23:14), hence the Targum here is,"they came to Bethlehem at {{the beginning}} of the day of the passover, and on that day the children of Israel began to reap the wave sheaf, which was of barley." [...] So the Egyptians and Phoenicians, near neighbours of the Jews, went about cutting down their barley as soon as the cuckoo was heard, which was the same time of the year; hence the comedian calls that bird the king of Egypt and Phoenicia. This circumstance is observed for the sake of the following account in the next chapter.

The offering of the wave-sheaf sanctified the whole harvest (...) [...] At the same time, this feast had a typical character, and pre-intimated the resurrection of Christ (...) , who rose from the dead on the very day the first-fruits were offered.|$|E
