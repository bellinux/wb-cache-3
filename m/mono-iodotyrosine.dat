40|$|Isolation of <b>mono-iodotyrosine</b> from {{slightly}} iodinated pepsin {{has been}} repeated and {{the properties of}} the product compared with those of synthetic dl- 3 -iodotyrosine. Ultraviolet absorption spectra, pK values of the phenol group, solubility measurements, and partition coefficients were so nearly identical for the two materials that there is now no reason to doubt that the product from pepsin is 3 -iodotyrosine...|$|E
40|$|Iodination of {{tyrosine}} {{was recently}} discovered {{as a useful}} method for generating radical peptides via photodissociation of carbon–iodine bonds by an ultraviolet photon in the gas phase. The subsequent fragmentation behavior of the resulting odd-electron peptides is largely controlled by the radical. Although previous experiments have focused on mono-iodination of tyrosine, peptides and proteins can also be multiply iodinated. Tyrosine and, to a lesser extent, histidine can both be iodinated or doubly iodinated. The behavior of doubly iodinated residues is explored under conditions where the sites of iodination are carefully controlled. It is found that radical peptides generated {{by the loss of}} a single iodine from doubly iodinated tyrosine behave effectively identically to singly iodinated peptides. This suggests that the remaining iodine does not interfere with radical directed dissociation pathways. In contrast, the concerted loss of two iodines from doubly iodinated peptides yields substantially different results that suggest that radical recombination can occur. However, sequential activation can be used to generate multiple usable radicals in different steps of an MSn experiment. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that in actual peptides, the rate of iodination for tyrosine versus <b>mono-iodotyrosine</b> cannot be predicted easily a priori. In other words, previous assumptions that mono-iodination of tyrosine is the rate-limiting step to the formation of doubly iodinated tyrosine are incorrect...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] has been demonstrated that the H 2 O 2 /l- ratio is {{a critical factor in}} the control of iodination and deiodination of covalently bound tyrosyl residues in proteins and free iodotyrosines by peroxidase enzymes. This has been shown for myeloperoxidase (MPO) isolated from normal human polymorphonuclear lymphocytes in particular, and also for peroxidases of animal origin such as thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and lactoperoxidase (LPO). It has also been shown that the H 2 O 2 /l ratio exerts a controlling influence on MPO-catalysed reactions of fully iodinated tyrosines, e. g. di-iodotyrosine, and of partially and completely iodinated thyronines such as thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine. Using an in vivo model system {{it has been shown that}} MPO catalyses the sequential events of iodination, iodine exchange and de-iodination of tyrosines and, furthermore, that all three reactions are influenced by the rate of H 2 O 2 generation and the iodide concentration of the reaction medium. The action of MPO on iodothyronine substrates only affects de-iodination irrespective of whether the iodothyronine is partially iodinated, as in triiodothyronine, or completely iodinated, as in thyroxine. This MPO-catalysed de-iodination of thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine can also be regulated by the H 2 O 2 /l- ratio. Moreover, the results show that MPO-catalysed iodine exchange can only occur in completely iodinated tyrosines such as diiodotyrosine (DIT). Iodine exchange in partially iodinated tyrosines such as <b>mono-iodotyrosine</b> (MIT) or in iodothyronines (T 3 and T 4) cannot be catalysed by MPO irrespective of the H 2 O 2 /l- ratio. These results introduce a new concept which may be important in understanding the control of thyroid activity in thyroid disease and the control of MPO activity in biological defence mechanisms in man.
