5|$|The University {{has been}} {{charging}} all U of M students a mandatory stadium fee of $12.50 every semester since {{planning for the}} project began, and is continuing this fee despite the stadium being finished. The cost of the stadium was $288.5 million of which the university had to pay 52%, and {{with an average of}} more than 50,000 students in a given year, in one semester the university <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> than $625,000 from the stadium fee, meaning they receive more than $12.5 million every 10 years from students.|$|E
5|$|Over {{half the}} red-backed fairywrens {{in an area}} {{can be found in}} pairs during the mating season. This is {{apparently}} a defence against the resource-limited nature of the environment. It is more difficult to maintain a larger interdependent group during dry spells, so the birds try to stay in pairs or smaller groups, which include adults that help parents look after young. Paternity tests have shown that an older male with bright plumage has much more success in the mating season and can mate with more than one female. Accordingly, it has higher sperm storage and <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> mating overtures towards females. A male with browner and less bright plumage or a younger male with bright plumage has a much lower success rate than a bright, older male for mating. Further, an unpaired male serves as a helper to a mated pair in feeding and care of young. When the male pairs his bill darkens, and this happens within three weeks. This is much easier to control than plumage, as moulting takes time and is controlled by seasonality. The bill is vascular and much easier to change in response to the pairings.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} of the Navier–Stokes equations is a flow velocity. It is a field, since it is defined at every point in a region of space and an interval of time. Once the velocity field is calculated other quantities of interest, such as pressure or temperature, may be found using additional equations and relations. This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics, where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a particle or deflection of a continuum. Studying velocity instead of position <b>makes</b> <b>more</b> sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories.|$|E
