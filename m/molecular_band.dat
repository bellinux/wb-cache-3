50|$|A {{second problem}} {{is related to}} the {{conservation}} of angular momentum. <b>Molecular</b> <b>band</b> spectra showed that the nuclear spin of nitrogen-14 is 1 (i.e. equal to the reduced Planck constant) and more generally that the spin is integral for nuclei of even mass number and half-integral for nuclei of odd mass number.

However, the electron spin is 1/2, hence angular momentum would not be conserved if beta decay were simply electron emission.|$|E
40|$|V 838 Mon erupted at the {{beginning}} of 2002. In the course of the outburst the object evolved to low effective temperatures and declined as a very late M-type supergiant. Among various scenarios proposed to explain the nature of the outburst, the most promising is a stellar merger event. We aim at studying the structure and evolution of the object in the decline from the 2002 eruption. We obtained spectroscopic observations of V 838 Mon in January [...] March 2009 with UVES/VLT. The results are analysed and compared with similar observations obtained in October 2005 with HIRES/Keck. The most striking difference between 2009 and 2005 is a complete absence of the B 3 V component and of the [FeII] emission lines in 2009. The present spectrum displays only the spectrum of the 2002 eruption remnant. It resembles that of an M 6 giant, although the <b>molecular</b> <b>bands</b> in V 838 Mon are deeper than those in standard stellar spectra of a similar spectral class. Several atomic lines, which displayed P-Cyg profiles in 2005, are now dominated by pure absorptions. Some of these lines, however, show a narrow emission component, which, as we argue, measures the radial velocity of V 838 Mon. The resulting heliocentric velocity is 71 km/s, which very well agrees with the velocity obtained from SiO maser observations. The atomic lines and the <b>molecular</b> <b>bands</b> show very complex kinematics. In some atomic lines and high-excitation <b>molecular</b> <b>bands</b> we observe matter infalling in the object atmosphere. The infall components were already observed in 2005, but were less pronounced and present in fewer lines than in 2009. We argue that the most negative radial velocity components seen in the resonance atomic lines and in the low-excitation <b>molecular</b> <b>bands</b> were formed in the ejecta of the 2002 eruption. The B 3 V companion most probably became engulfed in an opaque dusty matter of the 2002 V 838 Mon ejecta. Comment: A&A, in pres...|$|R

5000|$|His spectroscopic {{observations}} of the Orion nebula showed that the green nebular line is sharp, symmetrical and narrow and not ‘fluted’ under examination with several spectroscopes and magnifications with the 16½ inch telescope, thus putting the ‘meteoric hypothesis’ of the nebulae by Norman Lockyer to the sword. According to this hypothesis, the lines arise from collisional heat of the meteoric particles, and require the nebular line to be fluted (extended or shaded like molecular bands-the likely <b>molecular</b> <b>band</b> at this wavelength is that of MgO). Even before Naegamvala’s observations, others, notably Huggins, Vogeland, and James Keeler at Lick showed the lines to be sharp, {{there was still a}} major controversy. As Osterbrock says [...] "although Keeler’s paper convinced most of his contemporaries, Lockyer and his partisans could not accept the result, and {{at a meeting of the}} Royal Astronomical Society on 8 May 1891, with neither Huggins nor Lockyer present, an argument welled up. It began with the reading of a paper from K.D.Naegamvala of Poonah, India, who had been observing the Orion nebula with his 16½-inch telescope and three prism spectroscope and found that the chief nebular line was sharp under all circumstances, and therefore not the remnant of magnesium fluting, as Lockyer had suggested. Captain William Noble, a friend and partisan of Huggins, rose and smoothly congratulated Naegamvala, through the Secretary who had read the paper." [...] Noble is supposed to have said [...] "The theory (meteoric)... has been already three times killed by Dr Huggins in England, Dr Vogel in Germany and Professor Keeler at Lick observatory, and I think that we must look on Mr Naegamvala as having finally killed and buried it".

40|$|This thesis {{covers a}} {{research}} effort to study <b>molecular</b> <b>band</b> offsets and the interplay with interface dipoles. Inorganic electrets and ferroelectrics typically have very poorly characterized surfaces and interfaces. In particular for the perovskites, surface and interface composition {{is more of}} a hope than a serial of materials with a good history of reproducible experimental characterization. To address these complexities, I have first focused on molecular systems and molecular heterostructures. ^ Obviously, strong interface dipoles are desirable for such studies. Such systems like polymethylvinylidenecyanide and a variety of ferroelectric polymers are described. All would serve as a suitable substrate. ^ My choice of adsorbate is the planar molecular metal centered macrocyclic semiconductor metal (II) phthalocyanines. The different metal phthalocyanines are compared, particularly with respect to the changes in 3 d band filling/depletion, on a conducting substrate Au(111). This provides a benchmark for comparison of metal (II) phthalocyanine adsorption on the molecular ferroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride. There are changes in both of the <b>molecular</b> <b>band</b> offsets and the preferential orientations in the metal (II) phthalocyanines. ^ To add support to the idea that the <b>molecular</b> <b>band</b> offsets can be manipulated by altering the interface dipoles, I fabricated several heterostructure devices.
