40|$|Abstract- 3 D {{stacking}} of dies is {{a promising}} technique to allow miniaturization and performance enhancement of electronic systems. Key technologies for realizing 3 D interconnect schemes are {{the realization of}} vertical connections, either through the Si-die or through the <b>multilayer</b> <b>interconnections.</b> The complexity of these structures combined with reduced thermal spreading in the thinned dies complicate the thermal analysis of a stacked die structure. In this paper a methodology is presented to perform a detailed thermal analysis of stacked die packages including the complete back end of line structure (BEOL), interconnection between the dies and the complete electrical design layout of all the stacked dies. The calculations are performed by 3 D numerical techniques and the approach allows importing the full electrical design of all the dies in the stack. The methodology is demonstrated on a 2 stacked die structure in a BGA package. For this case the influence of through-Si vias (TSVs) on the temperature distribution is studied...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{methods that}} are used to perform simulations of the electromagnetic behavior (EMC) of <b>multilayer</b> <b>interconnection</b> systems. Such a system consists of a number of planar conductors immersed in a configuration of homogeneous media of different permittivity bound by parallel planes. Examples of such systems are printed circuit boards, integrated circuit (IC) packages, filters, and passive IC's. A strong interplay is required between analytical and numerical techniques to obtain an efficient way of simulating devices. The fourfold integrals that represent the electromagnetic interaction between charges and currents in two elements of the discrete domain can be called as interaction integrals. Evaluating fourfold integral with singularities is not a trivial task, and requires a lot of tedious work. The chapter also shows that, even in rather elementary tasks like numerical integration, sophisticated algorithms must be used to handle the complexity of the problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} {{significant}} {{effort has been}} obtained on the miniaturization of electronic devices, for example {{in the field of}} cellular phones or other portables devices. Mainspring of this process is the huge success that has been obtained with giant integration densities on chip level. In contrast passive components are actually the most important bottlenecks in the upcoming miniaturization process, first of all for applications in power electronics. Especially in the field of electric mobility and innovative lighting technologies an increasing demand arises for miniaturized transformers and converters. Miniaturization of power electronic devices concentrates however the dissipation heat in a smaller volume, leading in most cases to higher operation temperatures. LTCC (Low-Temperature-Cofir ing-Ceramic) as a ceramic <b>multilayer</b> <b>interconnection</b> technology has been employed for the development of 3 D-high integrated electronic modules, marked by an excellent thermal robustness. Actual integration of inductors or capacitors in LTCC-boards is restricted to SMD's, Iimiting further miniaturization in an important manner. Hence the monolithic integration of inductors and capacitors into ceramic multilayer circuit boards is a straightforward approach to gain higher integration Ievels in power electronics. We report on the preparation and processing of low sintering materials for the implementation of ferrite cores into LTCC multilayer boards. Different semi-finished products based on ferrite powders have been elaborated. Sintering behavior of these materials has been studied and mater ial compatibility with different standard LTCC materials was tested...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} the Internet by social movements in Morocco {{and the extent to which}} it has empowered them in various struggles against political and social injustices. More specifically, it explores whether the Internet has transformed the collective action repertoire and enhanced social movements’ capacity to challenge Morocco’s semi-authoritarian regime and erode the hegemonic social orders in the country. In so doing, the thesis addresses some key polemical issues and questions germane to the topic, mainly the dialectic between technological and social determinisms and agency, the role of technology in development, and collective action and democratic change in the context of Muslim-majority societies. The thesis uses a combination of methodological approaches to explore the structural, textual and contextual dimensions of the Internet’s implications and impact. Through feature analysis, and framing analysis, the research studies 18 websites, collective blogs and wikis belonging to eight key Moroccan social movements. It equally draws on rich data derived from 37 semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted with Moroccan social movement activists, journalists and international NGOs’ officials. It offers insights into the embeddedness of the Internet as a technology and medium, and into the interplay between activists’ and users’ practices and their social environment and physical world. Moreover, using a multidisciplinary conceptual framework, namely social movement theory, the social study of technology, alternative media studies, radical democracy theory and community informatics, the thesis {{examines the}} complex and <b>multilayered</b> <b>interconnections</b> between the Internet and the various social, economic and cultural processes shaping its appropriation and its potential for social change. It concludes that the Internet plays a significant role in enhancing Moroccan social movements’ collective action capabilities by favouring various forms of mobilization, and facilitating linkages between dispersed constituencies and translocal public spheres. The thesis argues, however, that the medium does not impact in any radical way the dominant political and social orders inasmuch as its implications and potential remain considerably limited by the various digital divides, and are mediated through the power relations characterizing society. ...|$|R
40|$|The Cu <b>multilayer</b> (TiWN/Cu/TwWN) <b>interconnections</b> were {{fabricated}} on polyimide coated Si substrate with DC sputtering. The electromigration (EM) {{measurements were}} carried out on a wafer level at various temperatures (170 °C~ 230 °C) and current densities (2. 28 ~ 4. 0 MA/cm 2). Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profile suggests that the underlayer TiWN blocks the diffusion of Cu into polyimide and retards the degradation of the polymer dielectric. The activation energy of EM for Cu multilayer on polyimide is smaller than that reported in literature for Cu multilayer on SiO 2. The small thermal conductivity of polyimide causes a tempera-ture gradient and accelerates the electromigration process. Both the SEM micrographs of the failed sample and the calculated current exponent confirm {{the presence of the}} thermomigration. The rigidity of the polyimide affects the lifetime of the Cu multilayer interconnects at low temperatures (T! 190 °C) but has no influence on lifetime at high temperatures (T" 210 °C). The Cu multilayer structure proves to be adequate in both preventing Cu from diffusing into the underlying devices and promoting the adhesion strength between Cu and the dielectric layer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{attractive}} {{properties of}} Al-Ni intermetallic phases and their extensive field of technological applications demands {{a thorough understanding}} of the system.

Nevertheless, singular layer experiments are required for Ni-rich phases identification...|$|R
40|$|NASAs future {{exploration}} missions {{focus on}} the manned exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond, which will rely heavily {{on the development of}} a reliable communications infrastructure from planetary surface-to-surface, surface-to-orbit, and back to Earth. Flexible antennas are highly desired in many scenarios. Active phased array antennas (active PAAs) with distributed control and processing electronics at the surface of an antenna aperture offer numerous advantages for radar communications. Large-area active PAAs on flexible substrates are of particular interest in NASA s space radars due to their efficient inflatable package that can be rolled up during transportation and deployed in space. Such an inflatable package significantly reduces stowage volume and mass. Because of these performance and packaging advantages, large-area inflatable active PAAs are highly desired in NASA s surface-to-orbit and surface-to-relay communications. To address the issues of flexible electronics, a room-temperature printing process of active phased-array antennas on a flexible Kapton substrate was developed. Field effect transistors (FETs) based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with many unique physical properties, were successfully proved feasible for the PAA system. This innovation is a new type of fully inkjet-printable, two-dimensional, high-frequency PAA on a flexible substrate at room temperature. The designed electronic circuit components, such as the FET switches in the phase shifter, metal interconnection lines, microstrip transmission lines, etc., are all printed using a special inkjet printer. Using the developed technology, entire 1 x 4, 2 x 2, and 4 x 4 PAA systems were developed, packaged, and demonstrated at 5. 3 GHz. Several key solutions are addressed in this work to solve the fabrication issues. The source/drain contact is developed using droplets of silver ink printed on the source/drain areas prior to applying CNT thin-film. The wet silver ink droplets allow the silver to wet the CNT thin-film area and enable good contact with the source and drain contact after annealing. A passivation layer to protect the device channel is developed by bonding a thin Kapton film on top of the device channel. This film is also used as the media for transferring the aligned CNT thin-film on the device substrate. A simple and cost-effective technique to form <b>multilayer</b> metal <b>interconnections</b> on flexible substrate is developed and demonstrated. Contact vias are formed on the second substrate prior to bonding on the first substrate. Inkjet printing is used to fill the silver ink into the via structure. The printed silver ink penetrates through the vias to contact with the contact pads on the bottom layer. It is then annealed to form a good connection. One-dimensional and two-dimensional PAAs were fabricated and characterized. In these circuits, multilayer metal interconnects were used to make a complete PAA system...|$|R
