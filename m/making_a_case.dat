5|$|Wilfrid left {{large sums}} of money to his monastic foundations, {{enabling}} them to purchase royal favour. Soon after his death a Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, was written by Stephen of Ripon, a monk of Ripon. The first version appeared in about 715 followed by a later revision in the 730s, the first biography written by a contemporary to appear in England. It was commissioned by two of Wilfrid's followers, Acca of Hexham, and the Abbot of Ripon, Tatbert. Stephen's Vita is concerned with vindicating Wilfrid and <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for his sainthood, and so is used with caution by historians, although it is nevertheless an invaluable source for Wilfrid's life and the history of the time.|$|E

During this series, he spoke frankly about his homesickness on foreign tours. However, his solid performances with the bat, including an innings high score of 42 in the 3rd Test, led some commentators to note, not altogether jokingly, that he was now <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> to be considered a tail all-rounder.

He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards, and advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups sometime later. During this time, Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II, by successfully <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation, by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort.|$|E
25|$|Lewis led {{a strong}} {{campaign}} during the 1975 election with his oratory and passion bringing new supporters to the party.

Polls showed the NDP surging and the incumbent Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in freefall and in the course of the campaign Premier William Davis was forced to commit his party to bringing in rent control and other progressive reforms in order to retain power. When the ballots were counted the Tories were reduced to a minority government. Lewis' NDP had doubled its seats from 19 to 38, surpassing the Ontario Liberal Party to become the Official Opposition. To some it appeared that it was only a matter of time before the NDP would form the government.|$|E

25|$|The first {{seeks to}} resolve a longstanding debate in {{historical}} linguistics by <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for the Kurgan hypothesis {{on the origins of}} the Indo-European language group. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the Black and Caspian seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history’s greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, Scythians, Arabs, or Mongols. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors’ argument makes it difficult to imagine the language in which their book would have been written, {{were it not for the}} ability to digest milk.|$|E

[...] "By {{focusing on the}} famed reign of Tsar Dušan," [...] she writes, [...] "Jovanović was <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for the respect with which Serbia should be regarded." [...] The painting, she argues, is both a history lesson and a [...] "patriotic declaration". For Serbian audiences in particular, she continues, it alluded to the greatness of Serbia's past and implied that the country's restoration as a free, modern nation was within reach. In her opinion, it is an inherently optimistic work.|$|E

2500|$|The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial's {{surviving}} manuscripts {{provide a}} rare instance of self-criticism by a poet. Su Shi {{was forced to}} defend himself against charges for which the chief evidence was his poetry. The surviving records of the case include detailed commentary by Su Shi on his own poems. The context in which his self-commentary is made tends to emphasize {{the political and social}} criticism implied in many of his poems, which may not otherwise be so evident today (Hartman, 24). Also, Su Shi's defence relies on <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> that his socio-political criticism is directed toward New Policy supporters as court, and not against the emperor himself or the state itself, rather that he was fulfilling a time-honored and legally acceptable function (if not indeed a duty), in which his poetry was intended as a service toward the emperor and the state (the [...] "imperial chariot"), intended to advise rather than illegally criticize the emperor or the dynasty (criticism of Wang Anshi and other officials was legally permissible, as such, so long as no blame appeared to be directed towards the emperor for retaining their services).|$|E
2500|$|Heather Ousby {{points out}} that the {{identity}} of the [...] "subbornd Informer" [...] has proved especially contentious for critics. She points to several interpretations of the informer which include the Friend, some sort of spy, and [...] "an abstract force such as jealousy". In her interpretation of the Sonnet, Ousby settles on the idea that the informer represents the Friend. She bases this thought on the various meanings of the word [...] "suborn" [...] during this time period. Rather than spying, informing could also be seen as inspiring and thus it would refer to the inspiration for the sonnet. Likewise, the term suborn meant corruption in loyalty which the Speaker accuses the Friend of in other sonnets. Ousby is <b>making</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for eliminating the informer as some third party, much like Greene. The difference is that Ousby uses the subtraction of this would-be character to shift the tone of the sonnet. She agrees that the first two quatrains concern how the [...] "dwellers on form and favor are destroyed by that humiliating process" [...] of giving unreciprocated affection. She sees the third quatrain as a plea to the Friend or as a directive to both of them. The couplet, however, becomes a means of stating the Speaker's independence from the Friend due to his [...] "poor but free" [...] oblations which mean a lot but cost so little. For Ousby, the Speaker seems to be separating himself from a disloyal patron who demeans his work.|$|E
