Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
25|$|After medical {{treatment}} in Chichester and recuperation Carey was posted back to 43 Squadron {{but did not}} fly again for a month. The Squadron suffered increasing casualties as the battle wore on. Squadron Leader Badger baled out on 30 August wounded and later died on 30 June 1941. On 7 September 1940 Frank was lunching with other pilots at Tangmere's <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> afternoon while the Adjutant took pictures of the semi-formal gathering sitting in deck chairs and drinking from tankards. That same after noon, Caesar Hull and two other pilots were killed when the Luftwaffe began its first deliberate attack on London, initiating The Blitz. Morale sank and the squadron was sent north to Newcastle to rest on 8 September. Thomas Dalton-Morgan took command of 43 Squadron at Newcastle and Carey flew again {{for the first time}} on 23 September 1940 and was promoted to Flight commander, but the squadron remained in the north until the end of the Battle of Britain in October 1940. On 20 January 1941 Carey and another pilot (Pilot Officer Tufnell) chased a Ju 88 out over the North Sea and claimed it damaged before it escaped into cloud.|$|E

Maruri and Noboa (Barcelona's Vice President) {{introduced}} the slogan La Renovación (The Renovation), thereby promising {{to bring in}} key international players {{as well as the}} best Ecuadorian players and to clean up the <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> had prevented Barcelona from winning the national title. However, the 2009 season was Barcelona's worst season in its history in the Serie A. Such teams as Deportivo Quito, ESPOLI, Deportivo Cuenca and LDU Portoviejo came out and spoke about their concern: if Barcelona were relegated, it would enormously impact those teams' economic situations, since when they would play at home against Barcelona it would almost guarantee a sell-out. (This was because Barcelona had the most fans of any team in Ecuador.) On October 3, 2009, more than 70,000 fans showed up at the Estadio Monumental Banco del Pichincha to support El Idolo del Ecuador so {{that it would not be}} relegated to the Serie B. In an intense match, Barcelona defeated LDU Portoviejo 2–0 with goals from José Luis Perlaza (46th minute) and Juan Samudio (90th minute). This allowed Barcelona to remain the only Ecuadorian team that has never played a game in Serie B.|$|E

500|$|Through the {{character}} of Hud, Ritt and Newman had intended to show the corruption of modern capitalism and the pitfalls of admiring an individual blindly, without observing his character. Critics, however, did not universally echo this view. Lifes review described Hud as [...] "likable, smart, and [...] the potential to measure up to his tough, honorable father" [...] and Saturday Review called him a [...] "charming, raffish monster". According to Outlook, [...] "Hud Bannon is a mean, unscrupulous man who never has even a momentary twinge of conscience or change of heart"; in the end scene, Hud [...] "ulls down the shade on the world of goodness and decency". Pauline Kael initially described the film as an [...] "anti-Western"; she called it an [...] "anti-American film", which was [...] "so astutely made and yet such a <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> it (was) redeemed by its fundamental dishonesty." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Moody of AOLTV {{felt that}} the season finale alternated between [...] "exciting and disappointing", with the final 15 minutes being {{particularly}} good due to the celebration of [...] "what we love most about Clark Kent/Superman – his power to delight and inspire us". However, Moody was critical that the substantial scenes in the episode were surrounded by [...] "countless minutes of poorly paced padding, filler, and manufactured conflict", and that [...] "the bulk of this two-hour finale was just painful to watch". Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+" [...] and called it [...] "a sodden <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> mostly points up how off-balance the show became". He heavily criticized the show for focusing {{so much of the}} romance between Clark and Lois, and wrote that it detracted from the [...] "better" [...] plot concerning Darkseid and his minions.|$|E

[...] Balls also noted that Ciara tends to rely on guest artists to guarantee a hit. The Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra called the song a [...] "blast of energy", but observed that it is [...] "too reminiscent of past Ciara/Elliott hits". Guerra said that [...] "A little variation would have made for a more dynamic tune." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic was more critical and called the song an [...] "over-stuffed dancefloor <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> does not benefit from Missy Elliott's hoarse hectorin". Jordan Sargent of PopMatters considered the song a letdown due to Ciara's [...] "lifeless" [...] vocal delivery. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo!

500|$|Negative reviews, on {{the other}} hand, mainly criticized the film's dark humor and the unlikeability of the main character. USA Today Claudia Puig found the film [...] "neither {{believable}} nor funny" [...] and wrote that [...] "it's tough to summon sufficiently negative language to describe the unfunny, desperate <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> is Bad Words". The Boston Globe critic Peter Keough gave the film 1 star out of 4, finding it unfunny, clichéd and offensive with an unlikeable [...] "sociopath" [...] as the main character. Richard Corliss of Time thought that the film failed to redeem Guy's character or justify his [...] "deification", ultimately making it boring and unsatisfying. Similarly, Joe Morgenstern described Guy in a review for The Wall Street Journal as [...] "downright vile, a self-created pariah, and funny enough for a reasonable stretch of time" [...] before the plot becomes [...] "both implausible and banal". The Globe and Mail Robert Everett-Green gave Bad Words 1 out of 4 stars, deeming it [...] "a shallow remix" [...] of offensive and clichéd characters with poor acting and [...] "mean-spirited" [...] humor.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club [...] Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a C, {{comparing it to}} the first act of Shaffer's Equus. VanDerWerff described the episode as [...] "a bland, boring <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> ends {{with one of the}} most ridiculous deux ex machinas [...] I’ve seen in ages", and felt that [...] "the guest cast is uniformly poor", singling out Van Quattro as being [...] "laughably bad". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 3 out of 5, calling it [...] " [...] enthralling" [...] but [...] "not completely successful". Gibron felt that elements of the setting were [...] "very sinister", but found the [...] "overwhelming pro-horse mantras" [...] of some characters to be [...] "silly". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Broken World" [...] three stars out of five, finding it [...] "too familiar and too tentative to make much impact". Shearman felt that the episode would have been better placed earlier in the series' broadcast order, but by this stage in the first season it had been [...] "outgrown".|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson's {{performance}} as the Scarecrow {{was one of the}} only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed [...] "genuine acting talent" [...] and [...] "provided the only genuinely memorable moments." [...] Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: [...] "I don't think it could have been any better, I really don't." [...] In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on The Wiz was [...] "my greatest experience so far [...] [...] [...] I'll never forget that." [...] The film received a positive critique for its elaborate set design, and the book American Jewish Filmmakers noted that it [...] "features some of the most imaginative adaptations of New York locales since the glory days of the Astaire-Rogers films." [...] In a 2004 review of the film, Christopher Null wrote positively of Ted Ross and Richard Pryor's performances. However, Null's overall review of the film was critical, and he wrote that other than the song [...] "Ease on Down the Road", [...] "the rest is an acid trip of bad dancing, garish sets, and a Joel Schumacher-scripted <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> runs 135 agonizing minutes." [...] A 2005 piece by Hank Stuever in The Washington Post described the film as [...] "a rather appreciable delight, even when it's a mess", and felt that the singing – especially Diana Ross's – was [...] "a marvel".|$|E

500|$|Barrymore decided next {{to star in}} Hamlet on stage, with Arthur Hopkins directing. They {{spent six}} months preparing, cutting over 1,250 lines from the text as they did so, and Barrymore opted to play Hamlet as [...] "a man's man", {{according}} to Norden. Barrymore later described his Hamlet as a [...] "normal, healthy, lusty young fellow who simply got into a <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> was too thick for him... {{he was a great}} fencer, an athlete, a man who led an active, healthy life. How can you make a sickly half-wit out of a man like that?" [...] Barrymore again used Carrington as a vocal coach; rehearsals started in October, and the play opened on November 16. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. Woollcott, writing for the New York Herald, opined that it was [...] "an evening that will be memorable {{in the history of the}} American theater". while John Corbin, the drama critic for The New York Times, agreed, writing that [...] "in all likelihood we have a new and a lasting Hamlet". The reviewer for Brooklyn Life stated that Barrymore had [...] "doubtless won the right to be called the greatest living American tragedian". In 1963, Orson Welles said that Barrymore was the best Hamlet he had seen, describing the character as [...] "not so much princely– he was a man of genius who happened to be a prince, and he was tender, and virile, and witty, and dangerous".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. VanDerWerff graded the episode [...] "A−". He {{felt it was}} imperfect, but that [...] "Audition" [...] demonstrated the Glee executives had learned [...] "a surprising amount about what does and doesn't work within its format". He added, [...] "as a season premiere and promise for what's to come? 'Audition' is very good indeed." [...] David Hinckley of the Daily News rated [...] "Audition" [...] 4/5. He felt that the episode was [...] "a little self-indulgent" [...] with [...] "a dizzying series of cross-plots", but hoped that it was setting the foundations for an [...] "interesting, evolving story" [...] in the season to come. Bianco called the episode a [...] "heady, sometimes-too-rich mix of song-and-dance magic, high school musical spoof and overall excess", and concluded: [...] "It's a mess, but it's the kind of joyous <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> makes you think order can be overrated." [...] Both Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times and Jessica Derschwitz of CBS News praised the episode's musical numbers and Sue's lines, while Stack and the New York Post Jarett Wieselman deemed the episode to have assuaged their worries about Glee experiencing a [...] "sophomore slump" [...] and commented positively on the opening scene that directly addressed criticism of the first season. Vanity Fair Brett Berk received the episode positively, despite having been disappointed with {{the second half of}} the first season, a sentiment shared by Futterman, who deemed [...] "Audition" [...] a [...] "fresh start" [...] after [...] "a first season that devolved into a frenzy of too many songs and not enough long-term plot".|$|E

2500|$|Stephanie Zacharek, of Salon.com, {{viewed the}} film as being [...] "an expensive-looking <b>mess</b> <b>that</b> fails to capture the mood, and the poetry, of its source material" [...] because [...] "good actors {{fighting}} a poorly conceived script, {{under the guidance of}} a director who can no longer make the distinction between imaginativeness and computer-generated effects." [...] Todd McCarthy, of Variety, felt that Jackson had undermined the [...] "solid work from a good cast" [...] with [...] "show-offy celestial evocations" [...] that [...] "severely disrupt the emotional connections with the characters." [...] McCarthy stated that he felt that the film, overall, was a [...] "significant artistic disappointment." [...] Joe Neumaier, of New York Daily News, described Jackson as having [...] "siphoned out all the soulfulness" [...] that made the author's [...] "combination thriller/afterlife fantasy a best-seller" [...] and that the film was [...] "a gumball-colored potboiler that's more squalid than truly mournful." [...] Neumaier also wrote that the film and Jackson [...] "wasted" [...] a [...] "good cast." [...] Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "deplorable", and criticizing the apparent message that Susie's murder eventually made her happier. He was also critical of the film's portrayal of Heaven, which he compared to [...] "happy gathering of new Facebook friends". However, he praised the acting, stating that [...] "this whole film is Jackson's fault".|$|E
