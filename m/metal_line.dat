40|$|A novel {{technique}} for formation of <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> for electronic devices, and for reduction of resistivity in such <b>metal</b> <b>lines,</b> is proposed. In the technique, the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are formed in trenches by using functional liquids containing metal nanoparticles. The trenches are constructed on a plastic substrate by imprint of a patterned mold. When the whole {{surface of the}} plastic substrate {{is covered with a}} hydrophobic film, the hydrophobic property disappears only in the trenches due to the pressing process of the imprint, and thus the functional liquid automatically accumulates into the trenches. When the metallic functional liquid is modified with tween- 20 (polyoxyethylene- 20), <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> with a width of 10  μm are formed by capillary effect.

50|$|A {{metal hose}} is a {{flexible}} <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> element. There {{are two basic}} types of metal hose that differ in their design and application: stripwound hoses and corrugated hoses. Stripwound hoses have a high mechanical strength (e.g. tensile strength and tear strength). Corrugated hoses can withstand high pressure and provide maximum leak tightness on account of their material. Corrugated hoses also exhibit corrosion resistance and pressure tightness under the most extreme conditions, such as in aggressive seawater or at extreme temperatures such as found in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas. They are particularly well suited for conveying hot and cold substances.|$|E

40|$|In {{applications}} such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) or photovoltaic cells a homogenous voltage distribution in the large anode layer needs to be ensured by including a metal grid with a transparent conductor layer. To ensure sufficient conductivity, relatively thick <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are used, which increases the risk of electrical shorts between the anode and the cathode. For this reason an insulating layer is needed on top of the <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> The thick <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> limit the choice of deposition method, since some methods such as spin coating require smooth surfaces and cannot be used for applying the insulator. Here, a spray coating process has been studied as a potential alternative deposition method to create thin resistive layers on rough surfaces. Spray coating and Joule heating has been used for the alignment of insulator films on printed <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> It was demonstrated that spray coating can be used to cover the printed <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> which have high peaks on them.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we develop}} a novel process {{to fill the}} {{interline}} space with air (dielectric constant = 1). A silicon wafer, whose face is downward, patterned with <b>metal</b> <b>lines,</b> {{is placed on the}} top of another silicon wafer coated with dry polyimide. Hydrogen silsesquioxanes (HSQ), FOx- 16, is diluted and trickled through the slit between the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> and the polyimide. Then the HSQ forms an ultrathin liquid layer on the dry polyimide and contacts with the top of the <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> After the liquid HSQ becomes dry, the air gap is formed. The dry polyimide has good adhesion to silicon substrate but not to the dry FOx- 16, so we can separate the polyimide from the dry FOx- 16 and get the air gap.

50|$|Recent {{advances}} in design-technology co-optimization {{have led to}} SAQP-friendly layouts, which do not lead to dramatic mask count increases. Such advances also include reductions of cell height {{through the use of}} fewer metal tracks within the cell. The new cell designs result in fewer cut locations and via connections within the cell, while reducing cell area. Essentially, the SAQP metal layers are horizontal lines with at most one connection {{in the middle of the}} cell, so that only one block/cut mask is needed without changing lithography tool. Likewise, only diagonally adjacent vias are placed on different masks; vias for every other vertical <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> (corresponding to two gate pitches) may be placed on the same mask.|$|E
50|$|The {{electron}} beam prober (e-beam prober) is a specialized adaption {{of a standard}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) that is used for semiconductor failure analysis. While a conventional SEM may be operated in a voltage range of 10-30 keV, the e-beam Prober typically operates at 1 keV. The e-beam prober is capable of measuring voltage and timing waveforms on internal semiconductor signal structures. Waveforms may be measured on <b>metal</b> <b>line,</b> polysilicon and diffusion structures that have an electrically active, changing signal. The operation of the prober {{is similar to that}} of a sampling oscilloscope. A continuously looping, repeating test pattern must be applied to the device-under-test (DUT). E-beam probers are used primarily for front side semiconductor analysis. With the advent of flip-chip technology, many e-beam probers have been replaced with back side analysis instruments.|$|E

5000|$|California Metal, {{the first}} of five {{compilation}} albums released by Regency Records in the late eighties, was designed primarily to showcase the talents of the numerous unsigned Christian metal bands that had {{arrived on the scene}} following the success of Stryper. California Metal was quickly followed by California Metal Volume II (1988), East Coast Metal (1988), Underground Metal (1989) and Underground Metal 2 (1989). As a bonus, another album released by Regency along the preceding <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> was Classic Metal (1990). As far as the title [...] "California Metal" [...] implies, all of the artists participating on the project come from the state of music in question and bring a variety of metal styles ranging from classic metal, melodic metal, speed metal and commercial hard rock to it. What makes California Metal such a noteworthy release, nevertheless, is the fact it introduced several bands that in time would become household names in the growing Christian rock, hard rock and metal music communities: [...] "Gardian" [...] (soon to correctly rename itself as [...] "Guardian"), Deliverance and Neon Cross. Other artists participating on the project include Barren Cross (who debuted the previous year with its Star Song release [...] "Rock For The King") and Mastedon which is the studio project of former Kansas vocalist John Elefante and his brother Dino.

Flash and racetrack both store multiple bits per cell, but the comparison can still be made.

NAND flash memory is currently the densest form of non-volatile memory in widespread use, with a cell size of about 4.5 F², but storing three bits per cell for an effective size of 1.5 F². NOR flash memory is slightly less dense, at an effective 4.75 F², accounting for 2-bit operation on a 9.5 F² cell size.

Inside, {{there was a new}} dashboard for the base models, while the top-of-the-range cars had luxuries such as body-coloured bumpers, rear head restraints, a radio-cassette, hubcaps, and the ever-present CN1 dashboard, this time in black plastic. This model was not to stay in production for very long; in 1995 the CN3 type was introduced. Practically the only differences were those of trim level and the radiator grille.From late 1994 little attention was paid to the improvement of the 1310 range, as Dacia launched a new model, the Dacia Nova. This was a compact saloon/sedan or hatchback with a three-box design. The design was rather outdated, because development work had started in 1983. The Nova is a 100% Romanian design, started after the end of any French involvement in Dacia. The model was unpopular, due to reliability and rustproofing issues. However, after improvements in 1996, the Nova became more often seen on Romanian roads. In 1998 a seven-seater prototype was produced using the panels and windows from the standard Nova saloon.In 1998, the anniversary year of three decades of production since the first Dacia rolled off the assembly line, vehicle number 2,000,000 emerged from the plant; this year saw the last restyling of the 1310. It was known as CN4 and involved a comprehensive restyling of the front end, new door handles, and a lightly restyled rear view mirror. The estate version was fitted with larger tail lights. Even though the model was over thirty years old, it sold exceptionally well due to a starting price of about 4,200 Euros and high availability of parts.

40|$|Aluminium and aluminium-alloys are {{commonly}} used as metallizations for electrical connections of electronic devices in integrated circuits. Two related effects can reduce the lifetime of these lines: thermally induced mechanical stress and electromigration. Mechanical stresses are imposed on the lines after cooling from processing temperature down to room temperature due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the metal and the surroundings (Si substrate and the passivation). The relaxation of these tri-axial stresses may induce voiding and subsequently damage the lines leading to complete failures in the worst case. Electromigration-damage can occur whenever the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are stressed by very high DC-current-densities (#>=# 10 " 5 A/cm" 2). Electromigration-driven mass transport divergencies induce local mechanical stresses in the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> which also may relax by voiding.
