5|$|The Rhind Papyrus {{illustrates}} some of Ahmose's {{military strategy}} when attacking the Delta. Entering Heliopolis in July, he <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> eastern delta to take Tjaru, the major border fortification on the Horus Road, {{the road from}} Egypt to Canaan, in October, totally avoiding Avaris. In taking Tjaru he cut off all traffic between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from help or supplies coming from Canaan.|$|E
5|$|In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy {{turned to}} the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of the}} sixteenth century, but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded by a series of portrait painters as the fashion <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> social scale to lairds and burgesses.|$|E

On the first play of their drive, Nevada took a 21-0 lead on a 28-yard touchdown pass to Sudfeld. All-American running back Ka'Deem Carey finally got Arizona on the board with a 21-yard touchdown run {{late in the first}} quarter.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two days}} later, on Sunday 18 June, the Duke of Wellington {{positioned}} his Anglo-allied army along a ridge {{near the village}} of Waterloo, in order to block Napoleon's advance along the road to Brussels. The Brunswick Corps formed part of Wellington's reserve corps, under his personal command. In that capacity, they were kept well behind the crest of the ridge and avoided casualties during the opening French bombardment. In {{the early part of the}} afternoon, the British Foot Guards <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope to reinforce the Château d'Hougoumont, which was under fierce French attack; the Brunswick Corps was brought forward to take their place.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the rail {{connections}} was a death blow to the stage road. Gold production in Independence had declined sharply after 1884, {{and many of the}} town's early settlers had <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> valley to Aspen. With the corresponding reduction in stage traffic and tolls, the Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company could not afford to keep the road clear over the winter of 1886. Two years later, after the railroads began service, the company folded and abandoned the road. Independence itself met the same fate a decade later when its remaining population decamped to Aspen during the severe winter of 1899, leaving its buildings standing as a ghost town (one remaining resident lingered until 1920).|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten back but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|When the East India Company {{was taken}} over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, Whitehall until 1868, when it <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road to the new India Office, which {{occupied}} part of the building still used by today's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in South Kensington, which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the Museum of Modern Art through the summer and spring.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch {{moved into}} the lead on the 18th lap, while Logano <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field. After {{starting}} from 14th, Dave Blaney had moved up nine positions to fifth by lap 21; Logano had moved into third by the same lap. Biffle {{moved into the}} lead on lap 23. Kenseth, who was drafting off teammate Biffle, encountered overheating problems and fell to ninth position. Biffle and Kyle Busch started to contest the lead through the fourth turn on lap 26, and the pair traded the position over the following two laps. Biffle gained the lead position on the 29th lap. By lap 33, Regan Smith and Sadler had moved into third and fourth positions respectively. Biffle had reported debris in turn two but officials could not locate it. Green flag pit stops began on lap 40; Kenseth, Logano and Kyle Busch made their pit stops on lap 42 while Biffle, Smith and Jimmie Johnson made pit stops on the following lap. After the pit stops had been completed, Biffle reclaimed the first position, while Smith moved into second and Johnson was in third. The top three drivers were followed by Sadler and Kenseth. Kyle Busch was drafting off Logano throughout lap 46 but suffered with engine problems, allowing Logano to pull away. By the 50th lap, the top five were Biffle, Smith, Johnson, Sadler and Kenseth.|$|E

5|$|The German {{artillery}} bombardment was heaviest in {{the sector}} {{held by the}} right company of the 47th Battalion and the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers {{on either side of}} the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. I/230 RIR had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It advanced through the British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, with part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw a number of German bayonets sticking up on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the pioneers in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of Highland Light Infantry were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they <b>moved</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.|$|E
