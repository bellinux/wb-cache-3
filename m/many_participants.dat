5|$|After the Camp returned, Smith drew {{heavily from}} its {{participants}} to establish five governing {{bodies in the}} church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, <b>many</b> <b>participants</b> in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke in tongues, and prophesied.|$|E

Examples of this include limits imposed {{on the federal government}} on the amount of federal funds to cover administrative expenses, or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients. Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered (e.g. a limit on how <b>many</b> <b>participants</b> a recipient can provide assistance to).|$|E

5|$|Soon after, the Friends of the Constitution (Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej)which {{included}} <b>many</b> <b>participants</b> in the Great Sejmwas organised {{to defend}} the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. It is now regarded as the first modern-style political party in Poland's history. The response to the new constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party enjoyed considerable influence. General support among the middle nobility was crucial and still very substantial; most of the provincial sejmiks deliberating in 1791 and early 1792 supported the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, the Friends of the Constitution, {{regarded}} as the first Polish political party, and including <b>many</b> <b>participants</b> of the Great Sejm, was formed to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. The response to the new Constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party exerted stronger influence. The Great Sejm's reforms were brought down by the Targowica Confederation and {{the intervention of the}} Russian Empire. On 23 November 1793 the Grodno Sejm annulled all the enactments of the Great Sejm, including the Constitution of May 3, 1791.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained <b>many</b> <b>participants</b> in the 1960s. It {{achieved}} the moral force {{and support to}} gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved.

5|$|The Dixie Mission had {{consequences}} for individuals, {{and for the}} nation. <b>Many</b> <b>participants</b> were accused of being communists, such as John Davies and John Service. Both were subjected to multiple Congressional investigations that consistently found {{that they were not}} Communist Party members, agents of foreign powers, or disloyal to the United States. This did not spare Service from termination at the State Department. He appealed this decision and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in his favor. Davies was exiled from China, his field of expertise, by Hurley. Then he was hounded from a position in Russia to an inconsequential post in South America. Davies resigned that position and began manufacturing furniture. Hurley accused Colonel David Barrett of sabotaging his diplomacy with the KMT and the CPC. He succeeded in preventing Barrett from promotion to brigadier general, even though Barrett's promotion was endorsed by the theater commander, General Albert C. Wedemeyer. Barrett was retained in the China Theater, but placed in an inferior position.|$|E
5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively {{small percentage of the}} 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after <b>many</b> <b>participants</b> had left or were preparing to leave. The claim is that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E
