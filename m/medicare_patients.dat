Sometimes patients live longer. <b>Medicare</b> <b>patients</b> who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} errors anonymously reported by general practitioners in NSW. DESIGN: The Threats to Australian Patient Safety (TAPS) study used anonymous reporting of errors by GPs via a secure web-based questionnaire for 12 months from October 2003. SETTING: General practices in NSW from three groupings: major urban centres (RRMA 1), large regional areas (RRMA 2 - 3), and rural and remote areas (RRMA 4 - 7). PARTICIPANTS: 84 GPs from a stratified random sample {{of the population of}} 4666 NSW GPs - 41 (49 %) from RRMA 1, 22 (26 %) from RRMA 2 - 3, and 21 (25 %) from RRMA 4 - 7. Participants were representative of the GP source population of 4666 doctors in NSW (Medicare items billed, participant age and sex). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number of error reports and incidence of reported errors per <b>Medicare</b> <b>patient</b> encounter item and per patient seen per year. RESULTS: 84 GPs submitted 418 error reports, claimed 490 864 <b>Medicare</b> <b>patient</b> encounter items, and saw 166 569 individual patients over 12 months. The incidence of reported error per <b>Medicare</b> <b>patient</b> encounter item per year was 0. 078 % (95 % CI, 0. 076 %- 0. 080 %). The incidence of reported errors per patient seen per year was 0. 240 % (95 % CI, 0. 235 %- 0. 245 %). No significant difference was seen in error reporting frequency between RRMA groupings. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study describing the incidence of GP-reported errors in a representative sample.

2500|$|The AMA's vehement {{campaign}} against Medicare in the 1950s and 1960s included the Operation Coffee Cup supported by Ronald Reagan.

2500|$|The Department of Health and Human Services, {{primarily}} Medicare, {{funds the}} vast majority of residency training in the US. [...] This tax-based financing covers resident salaries and benefits through payments called Direct Medical Education or DME payments. [...] Medicare also uses taxes for Indirect Medical Education or IME payments, a subsidy paid to teaching hospitals that is tied to admissions of <b>Medicare</b> <b>patients</b> in exchange for training resident physicians in certain selected specialties. [...] Overall funding levels, however, have remained frozen over the last ten years, creating a bottleneck in the training of new physicians in the US, according to the AMA. On the other hand, some argue that Medicare subsidies for training residents simply provide surplus revenue for hospitals which recoup their training costs by paying residents salaries (roughly $45,000 per year) that are far below the residents' market value. Nicholson concludes that residency bottlenecks are not caused by a Medicare funding cap, but rather, by Residency Review Committees (which approve new residencies in each specialty) which seek {{to limit the number of}} specialists in their field to maintain high incomes. In any case, hospitals trained residents long before Medicare provided additional subsidies for that purpose. [...] A large number of teaching hospitals fund resident training to increase the supply of residency slots, leading to the modest 4% total growth in slots from 1998–2004.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. We compare case mix of <b>Medicare</b> {{home health}} <b>patients</b> under HMO and FFS payment. STUDY DESIGN. A pseudo-experimental design was {{employed}} to study case mix using three types of Medicare-certified home health agencies (HHAs) : HMO-owned agencies, pure FFS agencies that admit few <b>Medicare</b> HMO <b>patients</b> (less than 5 percent of admissions are <b>Medicare</b> HMO <b>patients),</b> and mixed (or contractual) agencies that admit at least 15 <b>Medicare</b> FFS <b>patients</b> and 15 <b>Medicare</b> HMO <b>patients</b> per month. SAMPLES OF PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. Random samples of Medicare-aged patients (> or = 65 years) were selected at admission between June 1989 and November 1991 from the 38 study HHAs. Sample sizes by agency type were: 308 patients from 9 HMO-owned agencies; 529 patients from 15 pure FFS agencies; and 381 HMO patients and 414 FFS patients from 14 contractual agencies. DATA. Primary longitudinal data were prospectively collected at admission for all patients on health status indicators, demographics, admission source, and home environment. MEASURES. The most important case-mix measures were functional and physiologic indicators of health status, including (instrumental) {{activities of daily living}} ([I]ADLs). Selected indicators of demographic variables, prior location, living situation, characteristics of informal caregivers, mental/behavioral factors, and resource needs were also used. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. (a) The case mix of <b>Medicare</b> FFS <b>patients</b> compared with <b>Medicare</b> HMO <b>patients</b> was more intense in terms of impairments in ADLs, IADLs, and various physiologic conditions. Pressure ulcers as well as neurological and orthopedic impairments requiring rehabilitation care were also more prevalent among FFS patients. (b) Relative to HMO patients admitted to contractual agencies, HMO patients admitted to HMO-owned agencies were moderately more dependent in ADLs and IADLs. However, only 62 percent of HMO patients admitted to HMO-owned agencies, in contrast to 77 percent of HMO patients admitted to contractual agencies, had been hospitalized during the 30 days prior to home health admission. (c) In all, the case mix of patients receiving care from HMO-owned agencies is more heterogeneous than the case mix of HMO patients receiving care from contractual agencies. CONCLUSIONS. The case-mix (and selected utilization) findings indicate that HMOs use home health care differently than does the FFS sector. The greater diversity of case mix for HMO-owned agencies and the narrower or less diverse case mix that characterizes HMO patients receiving home care on a contractual basis point to the likelihood of cost differences among the two types of HMO patients and FFS patients, and raise the question of possible outcome differences...|$|R
