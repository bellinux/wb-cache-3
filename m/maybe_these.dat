2500|$|Boyle {{also had}} a monogenist {{perspective}} about race origin. He was a pioneer studying races, and he believed that all human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, {{came from the same}} source: Adam and Eve. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured albinos, so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Boyle also extended the theories of Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton about colour and light via optical projection (in physics) into discourses of polygenesis, speculating that <b>maybe</b> <b>these</b> differences were due to [...] "seminal impressions". Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for complexion at his time, {{due to the fact that}} now we know that skin colour is disposed by genes, which are actually contained in the semen. Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for [...] "European Eyes", beauty was not measured so much in colour of skin, but in [...] "stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face". Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as [...] "disturbing" [...] or [...] "amusing".|$|E

Speaking Ladino language and having Sephardic customs, {{they found the}} Malabari Jewish community as established in Cochin to be quite different. According to the historian Mandelbaum, there were resulting tensions between the two ethnic communities. The European Jews had some trade links to Europe and useful languages to conduct international trade, i.e. Arabic, Portuguese and Spanish, later on <b>maybe</b> Dutch. <b>These</b> attributes helped their position both financially and politically.|$|R
30|$|Persons {{living in}} or {{traveling}} to mosquito-infested areas must use protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. <b>These</b> <b>maybe</b> {{in the form}} of insecticide-treated nets, use of mosquito repellant creams (such as those containing N N-diethyl-m-toluamide) on the exposed skin, and even insecticide spraying to kill the mosquitoes [74].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{that the}} two-dimensional Fourier transform, spectral-maximum-based extraction of thread density appears suited to automatic thread counting from scanned X-radiographs of paintings {{for a range}} of European painters from the seventeenth century to the early twentieth century. With regularly woven canvas, striping occurring in color-coded maps of local thread count can be used to identify rollmate candidates originally separated by as much as a few meters, <b>maybe</b> more. <b>These</b> results suggest that recently developed spectral-maximum-based thread counting algorithms are sufficiently sophisticated to support major efforts in archival thread counting as key forensic data in a variety of art historical investigations. Still, the canvas and priming used by some artists require a more refined approach to automated thread counting than a simple spectral-maximum-based scheme...|$|R

50|$|This {{mechanism}} of transduction is somewhat unusual, in that cAMP works by directly binding to the ion channel {{rather than through}} activation of protein kinase A.
