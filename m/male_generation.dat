40|$|Although feminists in the West {{have played}} a major part in the rediscovery of women writers in Russia, and since glasnost women’s writing has flourished more in Russia {{than in any other}} {{cultural}} period, there have still been relatively few studies focusing specifically on the representation of mothers in Russian culture.

The absence of a female genealogy is particularly evident in Russian literature, which has devoted considerable attention to “fathers and sons”: the relations between <b>male</b> <b>generations</b> of intellectuals, and their interaction with the state. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that relationships between mothers and daughters – largely ignored in women’s writings of the Soviet period – constitute a significant theme in the writings of contemporary women writers in post-Soviet Russia, as in Western Europe.

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{striking}} demographic shifts {{evident in}} today's workforce are also {{apparent in the}} medical profession. One is the entry {{of a new generation}} of physicians, Gen Xers, and the other is the influx of women. Both shifts are argued to have significant implications for recruitment and retention because of assumptions regarding the younger generation's and women's attitudes towards work and patient care. This paper explores two questions regarding the generations: (1) How do Baby Boomer and Generation X physicians perceive the generation shift in work attitudes and behaviours? and (2) Do Baby Boomer and Generation X physicians differ significantly in their work hours and work attitudes regarding patient care and life balance? Gen Xers include those born between 1965 and 1980; Baby Boomers are those born between 1945 and 1964. We also ask: Do female and <b>male</b> <b>Generation</b> X physicians differ significantly in their work hours and work attitudes regarding patient care and life balance? Methods We conducted exploratory interviews with 54 physicians and residents from the Department of Medicine (response rate 91 %) and asked about their perceptions regarding the generation and gender shifts in medicine. We limit the analyses to interview responses of 34 Baby Boomers and 18 Generation Xers. We also sent questionnaires to Department members (response rate 66 %), and this analysis is limited to 87 Baby Boomers' and 65 Generation Xers' responses. Results The qualitative interview data suggest significant generation and gender shifts in physicians' attitudes. Baby Boomers generally view Gen Xer physicians as less committed to their medical careers. The quantitative questionnaire data suggest that there are few significant differences in the generations' and genders' reports of work-life balance, work hours and attitudes towards patient care. Conclusion A combined qualitative and quantitative approach to the generation shift and gender shift in medicine is helpful in revealing that the widely held assumptions are not necessarily reflective of any significant differences in actual work attitudes or behaviours of Boomer and Gen X physicians or of the younger generation of women entering medicine. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{average length}} of life from birth until death in a human {{population}} is a single statistic that {{is often used to}} characterise the prevailing health status of the population. It is one of many statistics calculated from an analysis that, for each age, combines the number of deaths with the size of the population in which these deaths occur. This analysis is generally known as life table analysis. Life tables have only occasionally been produced specifically for South Australia, although the necessary data has been routinely collected since 1842. In this thesis, the mortality pattern of South Australia over the period of 150 years of European settlement is quantified by using life table analyses and estimates of {{average length of}} life. In Chapter 1, a mathematical derivation is given for the lifetime statistical distribution function that is the basis of life table analysis, and from which the average length of life or current expected life is calculated. This derivation uses mathematical notation that clearly shows the deficiency of current expected life as a measure of the life expectancy of an existing population. Four statistical estimation procedures are defined, and the computationally intensive method of bootstrapping is discussed as an estimation procedure for the standard error of each of the estimates of expected life. A generalisation of this method is given to examine the robustness of the estimate of current expected life. In Chapter 2, gender and age-specific mortality and population data are presented for twenty five three-year periods; each period encompassing one of the colonial (1841 - 1901) or post-Federation (1911 - 96) censuses that have been taken in South Australia. For both genders within a census period, four types of estimate of current expected life, each with a bootstrap standard error, are calculated and compared, and a robustness assessment is made. In Chapter 3, an alternate measure of life expectancy known as generation expected life is considered. Generation expected life is derived by extracting, from official records arranged in temporal order, the mortality pattern of a notional group of individuals who were born in the same calendar year. Several estimates of generation expected life are calculated using South Australian data, and each estimate is compared to the corresponding estimate of current expected life. Additional estimates of generation expected life calculated using data obtained from the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial quantify the reduction in <b>male</b> <b>generation</b> expected life for 1881 - 1900 as a consequence of military service during World War I, 1914 - 18, and the Influenza Pandemic, 1919.

Miesten ollessa vuosikausia sodassa heillä ei ollut aikaa tai mahdollisuutta olla lastensa kanssa, mistä johtuen isä-poika-suhde jäi usein etäiseksi. Kujala tutki väitöskirjassaan sota-ajan pikkupoikien, nyt yli 60 -vuotiaiden miesten, kokemuksia sodasta, sen vaikutuksista isyyteen ja sitä kautta suomalaisen miehen tunne-elämään. Monetkaan miehet eivät muistele kaikkia sota-ajan kokemuksia pahalla, sillä puute ja lapsena töihin joutuminen opetti heidät kekseliäiksi ja selviytymään vaikeissakin tilanteissa. Sota opetti myös yhteisvastuuta ja yhteistyötä, sillä tuolloin oli tavallista, että naapurit kantoivat huolta toisistaan. Kujalan väitöstutkimuksen mukaan haastatelluista vain harva oli edelleen katkera, vaikka useimmat totesivatkin, ettei heillä ollut normaalia lapsuutta lainkaan. The sons {{of war is}} a study {{about the}} effect of war on {{fatherhood}} and on the emotional life of Finnish men during the last generations. The basis of this research are the child-hood experiences of 23 Finnish men during the Second World War in 1939 – 1945. The method of choosing the target group was the fact that men from all the provinces in different parts of Finland, were during the war little boys whose fathers were soldiers in the war and now these boys are fathers themselves. Naturally a prereguisite was also that they can remember events, their own life and the life of their families during that time period. In addition, I have also interviewed the sons of these men and the descriptions of two of these sons concerning both their fathers and their feelings about the war are included in the study. I myself was a child during the war and I have always been amazed how Finnish people in general got through those difficult years when at the homefront there were only women, children and old people fighting their own battle for everyday bread. In this research I try to explain that situation through children’s experiences, {{through the eyes of the}} little boys of that time. Because of the many years that have passed since the war, the elderly men I interviewed were at this time in their late fifties or early sixties, so the memory of the human mind has a very great influence on the events and what kind of picture of that time is conveyed to us. This is why in the theoretical part of the research I have used a lot of time to clarify the function and believability of our memory. As a result of my clarification I am convinced the childhood experiences presented in this research, give a good and truthful picture about the life and emotions of Finnish boys during the war. This is everyday history. The impact of war on the emotional life of men and through that on fatherhood is the key thought running through this whole book. Very little studies have been made in Finland from this point of view and for this reason I believe my study will bring something new to the current study of men and fatherhood. I have done my life’s work as a reporter in the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation (YLE) concerning, as I mentioned above, my interests in the influence of the war on fatherhood and on Finnish people’s ability to get through the wartime difficulties, in the autumn of 1999 I made an extensive series of the sons of the war for the radio as a 60 -year anniversary of the start of the Winter War. At this point came also the idea of writing a dissertation on this topic, when I noticed the area is hardly researched in spite of the increasing studies on men and manhood. Then I was able to gather a great amount of my material which I have later complemented with the interviews. I have done this research as a postgraduate student at the University of Jyväskylä, in addition to my daily work. I would like to thank my fellow seminar students for the joint effort and encouragement during the different stages of my study. And I would also like to thank the Fund of Central Ostrobothnia of the Finnish Cultural Foundation for the grant I received. I especially want to thank my instructor, Professor Marja Järvelä, for all her valuable advice and Professor Risto Heiskala for reading my research and for the useful instruction at the end of my study. At last I would like to thank the censors of my dissertation Docent Tommi Hoikkala and Doctor Arto Tiihonen for attending to my study carefully and for all their helpful comments. I also warmly thank all the sons of the war I interviewed in different parts of Finland, for welcoming me and recalling, with great effort, all those hard war years. In the narrative theme interview they opened up and often told me even about painful childhood experiences, quite often with tears in their eyes. However, this was very valuable for in this way we have been able to gather together the common memories and experiences of one Finnish <b>male</b> <b>generation,</b> the influence of which reflects on the emotions of men even up to this time...|$|E

This situation was achieved by using a translocation which links the second chromosome to the X chromosome; however, only untranslocated second chromosomes were mutagenized.

Chromosomes that were nondrastic after treatment were found to reduce the fitness of their heterozygous carriers by 3 – 5 %. The data show that flies homozygous for these chromosomes were about 2. 7 % less viable per treatment with 1 mm EMS than flies homozygous for untreated chromosomes. By comparing the fitness-depressing effects of nondrastic EMS-induced mutants in heterozygous condition with the corresponding viability-depressing effects measured by Temin, {{it is apparent that}} the total fitness effects are several times larger than the viability effects alone. Completely lethal chromosomes derived from the most heavily treated material reduced fitness by 11 % in heterozygous condition; approximately half of this reduction was due to the lethal mutations themselves...|$|R
