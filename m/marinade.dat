5|$|Chef François Massialot wrote Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois in 1691, {{during the}} reign of Louis XIV. The book {{contains}} menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a <b>marinade</b> is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.|$|E

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used poultry <b>marinades</b> include salt and sodium tripolyphosphate, which {{have been shown to}} increase meat yield and water-holding capacity, as well as improve color and texture. Recently, several poultry further-processing facilities have begun using more acidic (pH ∼ 4) type <b>marinades</b> such as sodium lactate, sodium citrate, and sodium diacetate (alone or in combination) to combat the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in further-processed meat loaves. Because the acidic <b>marinades</b> currently used in turkey further-processing have a low pH (∼ 4) compared with the previously used salt and sodium tripolyphosphate (∼pH 9), these <b>marinades</b> may cause meat quality problems. This review paper will discuss aspects of poultry food safety and meat quality and how acidic <b>marinades</b> can be used to improve safety, specifically by controlling L. monocytogenes growth, and how they affect quality of the meat products. Current industry practices will be discussed and reviewed...|$|R

500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a <b>marinade</b> that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the <b>marinade</b> for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of all-purpose flour, white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E

500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare kvass) and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast <b>marinade.</b>|$|E
