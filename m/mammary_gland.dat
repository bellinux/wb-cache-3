50|$|A {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} the class Mammalia {{is the presence of}} <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> The <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are modified sweat glands that produce milk, which is used to feed the young for some time after birth. Only mammals produce milk. <b>Mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are most obvious in humans, as the female human body stores large amounts of fatty tissue near the nipples, resulting in prominent breasts. <b>Mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are present in all mammals, although they are vestigial in the male of the species.|$|R

40|$|To obtain B-mode {{ultrasound}} {{images of}} <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> in dairy heifers {{at different stages}} of growth, 25 clinically normal Holstein heifers were used. The heifers were divided into 5 groups (n= 5 /group) by stage of their growth: 2 -month-old (group 1), 5 -month-old (group 2), postpuberty (group 3), mid (group 4), and late (group 5) pregnancy. Furthermore, the sections of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> were observed grossly at postmortem examination in one heifer in each group. Ultrasound images varied with the development of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> In group 1, the <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> had distinctive ultrasonographic findings: an oval to fusiform homogeneous hypoechoic structure. In all groups except group 1, mammary tissue consists of two major areas: a homogeneous, medium echogenic area and a poorly-defined, heterogeneous, hypoechoic area mostly in the superficial part. The superficial hypoechoic area spread more extensively and more irregularly with the development of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> Most pregnant heifers had irregular and extremely hypoechoic or anechoic areas like lactiferous sinus in the glands. The gross findings of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> suggested that the hypoechoic areas of various shapes represented the lactiferous sinus and ducts. Thus, these results indicate that B-mode ultrasound imaging can visualize the internal structures of udders and could be a useful tool for evaluation of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> in heifers.

25|$|While living mammal {{species can}} be {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} milk-producing <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> in the females, other features are required when classifying fossils, because <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> and other soft-tissue features are not visible in fossils.|$|R
25|$|The vixen {{has four}} pairs of teats. Each teat has 8 to 20 lactiferous ducts, which connect the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> to the nipple, {{allowing}} for milk {{to be carried}} to the nipple.|$|E
25|$|Glandular tissue. As a <b>mammary</b> <b>gland,</b> {{the breast}} {{comprises}} lobules (milk glands at each lobe-tip) and the lactiferous ducts (milk passages), which widen {{to form an}} ampulla (sac) at the nipple.|$|E
25|$|The breast {{is one of}} two {{prominences}} {{located on}} the upper ventral region of the torso of primates. In females, it serves as the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland,</b> which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in females.|$|E
50|$|An udder is {{an organ}} formed of the <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of female four-legged mammals, {{particularly}} ruminants such as cattle, goats, sheep and deer. It {{is equivalent to}} the breast in primates. The udder is a single mass hanging beneath the animal, consisting of pairs of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands.</b> In cattle there are normally two pairs, in sheep, goats and deer there is one pair, and in some animals such as pigs there are many pairs. In animals with udders, the <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> develop on the milk line near the groin, and <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> that develop on the chest (such as in humans and apes) are generally referred to as breasts.|$|R
50|$|Females have {{enlarged}} breasts due to functional <b>mammary</b> <b>glands,</b> which develop from puberty onward due to {{the effects}} of estrogen. <b>Mammary</b> <b>glands</b> do not contain muscle tissue. The shape of female breasts is affected by age, genetic factors, and body weight.|$|R
50|$|Specialized sweat glands, {{including}} the ceruminous <b>glands,</b> <b>mammary</b> <b>glands,</b> ciliary glands of the eyelids, and sweat glands {{of the nasal}} vestibulum, are modified apocrine glands. Ceruminous glands are near the ear canals, and produce cerumen (earwax) that mixes with the oil secreted from sebaceous <b>glands.</b> <b>Mammary</b> <b>glands</b> use apocrine secretion to produce milk.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{function}} of the breasts, as mammary glands, is the feeding and nourishing of an infant with breast milk during the maternal lactation period. The round shape of the breast helps to limit the loss of maternal body heat. Milk production depends upon a higher-temperature environment for the milk-production {{function of the}} <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> tissues, the lactiferous ducts.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> {{is thought}} to have derived from apocrine skin glands. It has been {{suggested}} that the original function of lactation (milk production) was keeping eggs moist. Much of the argument is based on monotremes (egg-laying mammals). The original adaptive significance of milk secretions may have been nutrition or immunological protection. This secretion gradually became more copious and accrued nutritional complexity over evolutionary time.|$|E
25|$|SubglandularThe breast implant is emplaced to the retromammary space, {{between the}} breast tissue (the <b>mammary</b> <b>gland)</b> and the pectoralis major muscle (major muscle of the chest), which most approximates {{the plane of}} normal breast tissue, and affords the most {{aesthetic}} results. Yet, in women with thin pectoral soft-tissue, the subglandular position is likelier to show the ripples and wrinkles of the underlying implant. Moreover, the capsular contracture incidence rate is slightly greater with subglandular implantation.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of milk is {{closely linked to}} nutritional state in many mammalian species, but the mechanisms by which changes in nutritional state are signaled to the <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are poorly understood. Simultaneous measurements of mammary blood flow and glucose arterio-venous difference were made across the inguinal <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of anesthetized, lactating rats.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} synapomorphy is {{relative}} to a given clade in the tree of life. What counts as a synapomorphy for one clade {{may well be a}} primitive character or plesiomorphy at a less inclusive or nested clade. For example, the presence of <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> is a synapomorphy for mammals in relation to tetrapods but is a symplesiomorphy for mammals in relation to one another, rodents and primates, for example. So the concept can be understood as well in terms of [...] "a character newer than" [...] (autapomorphy) and [...] "a character older than" [...] (plesiomorphy) the apomorphy: <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are evolutionarily newer than vertebral column, so <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are an autapomorphy if vertebral column is an apomorphy, but if <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> are the apomorphy being considered then vertebral column is a plesiomorphy.|$|R

25|$|The human <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> is {{composed}} of several cell types, including adipose (fat cells), muscle, ductal epithelium, and mammary epithelium (referred to sometimes as lactocytes). The mammary epithelium is the site for excretion of raw materials into the milk supply, including choline. This occurs, for the fat portion of the milk, by apocrine secretion, where vacuoles containing materials bud off the cell into the lumen (storage) of the alveolus (milk secretion gland). From here the milk will be released upon stimulation with oxytocin via suckling.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone has weak progestogenic {{activity}} in bioassays. Its actions {{in this regard}} {{are a result of}} direct agonist activity at the PR, though with a very low half-maximal potency. Spironolactone's {{progestogenic activity}} has been suggested to be involved in some of its side effects, including the menstrual irregularities seen in women and the undesirable serum lipid profile changes that are seen at higher doses. It has also been suggested to augment the gynecomastia caused by the estrogenic effects of spironolactone, as progesterone is known to be involved in <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development.|$|E
25|$|Surgical removal is the {{treatment}} of choice, but chest x-rays should be taken first to rule out metastasis. Removal should be with wide margins to prevent recurrence, taking the whole <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> if necessary. Because 40 to 50 percent of dog mammary tumors have estrogen receptors, spaying is recommended by many veterinarians. A recent study showed a better prognosis in dogs that are spayed {{at the time of}} surgery or that had been recently spayed. However, several other studies found no improvement of disease outcome when spaying was performed after the tumor had developed. Chemotherapy is rarely used.|$|E

25|$|Activation of the {{hedgehog}} pathway {{has been}} implicated {{in the development of}} cancers in various organs, including brain, lung, <b>mammary</b> <b>gland,</b> prostate and skin. Basal cell carcinoma, {{the most common form of}} cancerous malignancy, has the closest association with hedgehog signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in Patched and activating mutations in Smoothened have been identified in patients with this disease. Abnormal activation of the pathway probably leads to development of disease through transformation of adult stem cells into cancer stem cells that give rise to the tumor. Cancer researchers hope that specific inhibitors of hedgehog signaling will provide an efficient therapy for a wide range of malignancies.|$|E
25|$|At {{least four}} {{different}} GPCR-linked proteins {{are known to}} respond to steroid hormones. G Protein-Coupled Receptor 30 (GPR30) binds estrogen, Membrane Progestin Receptor (mPR) binds progesterone, G Protein-Coupled Receptor Family C Group 6 Member A (GPRC6A) binds androgens, and Thyroid Hormone and Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) binds Thyroid hormone (though not technically steroid hormones, thyroid hormones can be grouped here because their receptors belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily). As {{an example of the}} effects of these GPCR-linked proteins consider GPR30. GPR30 binds estrogen, and upon binding estrogen this pathway activates adenylyl cyclase and epidermal growth factor receptor. It results in vasodilation, renoprotection, <b>mammary</b> <b>gland</b> development, etc.|$|E
25|$|In humans {{there are}} two subtypes of {{melatonin}} receptors targeted by melatonin agonists, MT1 and MT2. They are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body, together or singly. MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, <b>mammary</b> <b>gland,</b> coronary circulation and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.|$|E

40|$|Keratinocyte {{growth factor}} (KGF) {{is a member}} of the {{fibroblast}} growth factor (FGF) family. KGF is secreted by stromal cells and affects epithelial but not mesenchymal cell proliferation. KGF injected intravenously was found to cause dramatic proliferation of mammary epithelium in the <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of rats. KGF causes ductal neogenesis and intraductal epithelial hyperplasia but not lobular differentiation in nulliparous female rats. KGF causes ductal and lobular epithelial hyperplasia in male rats. KGF causes proliferation of ductal and acinar cells in the <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of pregnant rats. On the other hand, the ductal epithelium of lactating postpartum rats is resistant to the proliferative action of KGF. The <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of lactating rats did not express less KGF receptor mRNA than the glands of pregnant rats, suggesting that the resistance of the ductal epithelium to KGF during lactation is not related to KGF receptor mRNA down-regulation. The <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> of both pregnant and postpartum lactating rats express KGF mRNA with more KGF present in the glands of lactating rats. In conclusion, the KGF and KGF receptor genes are expressed in rat <b>mammary</b> <b>glands</b> and recombinant KGF is a potent growth factor for mammary epithelium...|$|R
