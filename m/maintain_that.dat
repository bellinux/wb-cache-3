5|$|Implementation of {{congestion}} pricing has reduced congestion in urban areas, but has also sparked criticism and public discontent.

50|$|One {{thing that}} clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is <b>that</b> Kantianism <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> man, as a {{rational}} being, makes the moral law universal.

25|$|Viktor Zemskov–Zemskov <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the {{population}} loss {{due to the}} war was 20 million, including 16 million direct losses and 4 million deaths due to the deterioration in living conditions. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the Russian Academy of Science figure of 26.6 million total war dead includes about 7 million deaths due to natural causes based on the mortality rate that prevailed before the war. Zemskov <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> military dead numbered 11.5 million, including nearly 4 million POWs. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the figure of 6.8 million civilian deaths in occupied regions was overstated because it included persons who were evacuated to the rear areas. He submitted an estimate of 4.5 million civilians who were Nazi victims or {{were killed in the}} occupied zone. Zemskov <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> the government figure of 2.1 million civilian deaths due to forced labor in Germany was inflated compared to German wartime records that put the deaths of forced workers at 200,000.|$|R

5|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires by train with tango singer Agustín Magaldi. However, biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> this is unlikely, {{as there is}} no record of the married Magaldi performing in Junín in 1934 (and, even if he had, he usually traveled with his wife). Eva's sisters <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> Eva traveled to Buenos Aires with their mother. The sisters also claim that Doña Juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station and arranged for Eva to live with the Bustamante family, who were friends of the Duarte family. While the method of Eva's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated, she did begin a new life in Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Some authors {{consider}} the marriage episode of Tulsidas to be a later interpolation and <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> {{he was a}} bachelor.

5|$|Although the Georgian Chronicles <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> David died in 1001, several Armenian and Muslim {{accounts}} {{suggest he}} may have died in 1000.

Yet another Armenian, Samuel Anetsi, also puts the date as 1000.|$|E

500|$|Later in the century, the mutakallim Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281–1355) {{rejected}} {{the principle of}} uniform and circular motion, following the Ash'ari doctrine of atomism, which <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> all physical effects were caused directly by God's will rather than by natural causes. [...] He <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> the celestial spheres were [...] "imaginary things" [...] and [...] "more tenuous than a spider's web". His views were challenged by al-Jurjani (1339–1413), who <b>maintained</b> <b>that</b> even if the celestial spheres [...] "do not have an external reality, yet they {{are things that are}} correctly imagined and correspond to what [...] in actuality".|$|R
5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries.

From this perspective, some revisionist historians <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E

5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life. It is {{suggested}} that this deprivation may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|Many academics, {{including}} William Holdsworth, a man {{considered to}} be one of the best legal academics in history, <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> this period saw a decline in the standard of teaching at all the Inns. From 1640 onwards no readings were held, and barristers such as Sir Edward Coke remarked at the time that the quality of education at the Inns of Court had decreased. Holdsworth put this down to three things—the introduction of printed books, the disinclination of students to attend moots and readings and the disinclination of the Benchers and Readers to enforce attendance.|$|E

5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> the pixellated look {{is a question of}} fashion rather than function.|$|E

5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} <b>maintain</b> <b>that</b> her recall {{of the night}} of the fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E
