Such <b>machines</b> could be placed on otherwise unused floor space in businesses, required little maintenance, and brought in money for owners. Beginning about 1898, coin-operated mechanical pianos also became popular. The Mills Novelty Company was a leading producer of such devices; by 1906 it was producing <b>machines</b> ranging from a mechanically played violin to fortune-telling devices. While some <b>machines</b> took cents or other denominations, the nickel was the coin of choice for these <b>machines.</b>|$|E

40|$|Electrochemical <b>machining</b> is a {{relatively}} new technique, only being introduced as a commercial technique within the last 70 [*]years. A lot of research was conducted in the 1960 s and 1970 s, but research on electrical discharge <b>machining</b> around the same time slowed electrochemical <b>machining</b> research. The main influence for the development of electrochemical <b>machining</b> came from the aerospace industry where very hard alloys were required to be <b>machined</b> without leaving a defective layer in order to produce a component which would behave reliably. Electrochemical <b>machining</b> was primarily used for the production of gas turbine blades or to <b>machine</b> materials into complex shapes that would be difficult to <b>machine</b> using conventional <b>machining</b> methods. Tool wear is high and the metal removal rate is slow when <b>machining</b> hard materials with conventional <b>machining</b> methods such as milling. This increases the cost of the <b>machining</b> process overall and this method creates a defective layer on the <b>machined</b> surface. Whereas with electrochemical <b>machining</b> there is virtually no tool wear even when <b>machining</b> hard materials and it does not leave a defective layer on the <b>machined</b> surface. This article reviews the application of electrochemical <b>machining</b> with regards to micro manufacturing and the present state of the art micro electrochemical <b>machining</b> considering different <b>machined</b> materials, electrolytes and conditions used...|$|R

30|$|The {{transferring}} cost of each <b>machine</b> type {{between two}} periods is known. All <b>machine</b> types {{can be moved}} to the <b>machine</b> depot or any location in the cells. Even if a <b>machine</b> is removed from or returned to the cells, this transferring cost is incurred. This cost is paid for several situations: (1) to install a new purchased <b>machine</b> or a <b>machine</b> returned from the <b>machine</b> depot; (2) to uninstall a <b>machine</b> removed from a cell and kept in the <b>machine</b> depot; and (3) to transfer a <b>machine</b> between two different locations. Transferring <b>machine</b> contains uninstallation of a <b>machine</b> from a location and installation of that <b>machine</b> in another location. Installing and uninstalling costs {{are considered to be}} the same. Actually, if a <b>machine</b> is added to a cell, only the installing cost will be imposed. In the same way, if a <b>machine</b> is removed from a cell, only the uninstalling cost will be incurred. Then, if a <b>machine</b> is transferred between two different locations in the cells, both uninstalling and installing costs will be imposed. Thus, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the unit cost of adding or removing a <b>machine</b> to/from the cells is half of the transferring <b>machine</b> cost.|$|R

40|$|<b>Machining</b> of the {{complicated}} parts of high accuracy {{in large quantities}} has been an increasing demand since sophisticated technological equipment and machinery rapidly developed. These complicated components can be <b>machined</b> by employing NC <b>machine</b> tools. TIle motion commands for NC <b>machine</b> tool {{are determined by the}} path of the cutter. Obtaining optimal cutter path length is vital important in reducing the <b>machining</b> time. Nevertheless, another factor which has also influenced over <b>machining</b> time is the sequence of the <b>machining</b> operation. Hence, this project has presented the development of the process planning for <b>machining</b> diaphragm valve with Y - valve body (prismatic parts) with regard an optimum <b>machining</b> time. An effective process planning was developed with considering two major influences over <b>machining</b> time which are cutter path and <b>machining</b> operation sequence. Tool paths planning and simulation have been done by Unigraphics CAD/CAM Software. The <b>machining</b> operation is assumed to be carried out by 3 -axis CNC vertical milling <b>machine</b> and has five setups for <b>machining</b> completion. The process planning developed comprises of six phases. They are fcature recognition, <b>machining</b> operation selection, <b>machine</b> selection, cutting tool sclection, cutting parameters selection and finally sequencing of the <b>machining</b> operation. The study results revealed that the total shortest <b>machining</b> time was 99. 81 minutcs resulted from an optimum tool path and <b>machining</b> sequencc.
