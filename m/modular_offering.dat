40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to explore the {{strategic}} issues associated with the implementation and subsequent development of modular supply chains within the automotive sector. Design/methodology/approach – Given the exploratory nature of this research a case study approach was adopted analysing key suppliers within a single developing modular supply chain. The key approach to the topic was to examine strategic operations management literature {{in order to determine}} the operational impact associated with the move from traditional supply chains to supplying on a modular basis. Findings – The findings indicate that moving from the traditional approach to supplying parts to a modular approach requires suppliers to consider how they can develop their individual module offerings and to determine what operations do not add value to a <b>modular</b> <b>offering</b> and as a consequence can be transferred to downstream suppliers. Research limitations/implications – Given the exploratory nature of this research and its sectoral specificity one should not view the findings as applicable to other supply chains in the process of developing modular offerings. This said, the findings do correlate with earlier research which indicated that value-transfer activity within modular supply chains is a key characteristic associated with developing supply chains (Doran, 2004) Practical implications – In terms of practical applications, the findings demonstrate that modular activity requires the reorganisation of value-creating activities and also requires those suppliers close to the OEM to strategically position themselves to configure their operations to accommodate the growing modular paradigm. Originality/value – The paper explores supply chain modularization which is a fairly under-researched area supply chain management and as such this paper provides insights into this emerging area. The originality is also evident in the approach and focus of the paper (that is examining the three key suppliers within a single automotive supply chain) ...|$|E

Therefore, a multigene transformation strategy {{for use in}} plant molecular biology and plant genetic breeding is thus needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we describe a versatile, ready-to-use multigene genetic transformation method, named the Recombination-assisted Multifunctional DNA Assembly Platform (RMDAP), which combines many of the useful features of existing plant transformation systems. This platform incorporates three widely-used recombination systems, namely, Gateway technology, in vivo Cre/loxP and recombineering into a highly efficient and reliable approach for gene assembly. RMDAP proposes a strategy for gene stacking and contains {{a wide range of}} flexible, <b>modular</b> vectors <b>offering</b> a series of functionally validated genetic elements to manipulate transgene overexpression or gene silencing involved in a metabolic pathway.

A proof-of-principle experiment was confirmed by successfully transferring several heterologous genes into the plant genome.

Such insight relates to both an increasing environmental awareness and socio-economical factors that conflict with the way the automotive industry has been developing.

In particular, we discuss the configuration adopted {{for the implementation of}} the sensor network test-bed deployed at the Information Engineering Department of the University of Padova, Italy. The test-bed has been designed to reproduce typical deployment scenarios in an urban network by mimicking diverse contexts such as dense building networks, sparse environmental scenarios, and linear deployments along streets. The test-bed software has been realized taking full advantage of the most advanced solutions provided by the academic community and the standardization bodies by implementing a completely IP interoperable communication framework. Moreover, the latest solutions for the Internet of things [1] have been used to develop a lightweight <b>modular</b> architecture <b>offering</b> services and data sources through simple and efficient web services. All of this facilitates the integration of the test-bed functionalities into flexible web applications, capable of performing the needed monitoring and managing routines in the entire network as well as on single nodes. The Internet-like approach, coupled with a variety of network configurations, has been used to verify the advantages brought by the usage of constrained wireless communication for smart grids. In particular, {{we have been able to}} quantify useful performance metrics, such as maximum throughput, delivery delay, and transmission reliability, in typical smart grid network scenarios. Specifically, these performance metrics were determined for linearly shaped multihop configurations, to address networks deployed along streets, such as those controlling the street lights, as well as for dense single-and multihop configurations to address small-to-medium-sized building deployments...|$|R

Therefore, new methodologies and tools that allow the end-user to access large image repositories, to dynamically find and retrieve collections of desired images, and to extract and infer knowledge about the patterns hidden in the image archives are required. In this context, this paper presents the Earth Observation Image Librarian (EOLib), which is a <b>modular</b> system <b>offering</b> data mining and knowledge discovery functionality for the TerraSAR-X Payload Ground Segment and is serving to setup {{the next generation of}} Image Information Mining (IIM) systems.

The ability to share data effectively across distributed nodes with rapidly evolving state-of-the-art commercial information technology is a key netcentric goal of the defense community. However, the defense acquisition process has had little success achieving that goal for at least two reasons: acquisition strategies do not incentivize horizontal interoperability, and existing command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C 4 ISR) IT infrastructure is not sufficient to support the most critical and demanding tactical edge scenarios. The Defense Enterprise will close these gaps by working with like-minded government organizations and commercial consortia to establish an open government-industry community incentivized to address them pragmatically. This community is working with the military operational community to expose critical tactical use cases. It will also continuously evolve open standards that leverage COTS IT; address military-specific requirements; and demonstrate value added, interoperability, and security in runtime.

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry needs {{to assure the}} reliable operation of aircrafts. While this reliability has many aspects, this talk focused on the aspect of information technology for the electronic on- and off-board equipment. Modern architectures of avionics, the aircraft's electronic systems, are driven by denser integration into embedded platforms and the interconnection of these systems to each other. In addition, the aircraft's ecosystem demands new connectivity solutions for several stakeholders, e. g. passengers, airlines or air traffic management. This trend of transferring the previously closed, federated systems into interconnected Integrated <b>Modular</b> Avionics <b>offering</b> additional services introduces the potential risk of threads and increased attack surfaces allowing intruders to harm {{the operation of the}} aircraft. To counter these threats is challenge for the {{aviation industry}} that needs new system design approaches. The concept of Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) can provide such a system design for equipment operating in high-assurance environments. Due to its properties of separation and controlled information flow, MILS is a promising design approach for the secure integration of several systems into one hardware platform. While this idea has been part of research for the last decades, MILS can also be used as software design concept for one embedded system. This approach divides the system under development into several sub-functions that can be implemented and executed inside isolated runtime compartments. Information flows between these compartments are mediated by the MILS platform. This divide-and-conquer approach decouples critical code from less critical code, limits the perimeters of the internal software dependencies and allows a localized verification of sub-functions. This paper presents the general security environment to develop and operate avionics, explains the introduced MILS software design approach in more detail, provides the identified advantages and disadvantages using this concept, and discusses the results of a feasibility study using a common avionic high-assurance system to control the information exchange on security domain borders...|$|R

However; drawbacks such as low resolving power and high false positive rates hinder the full capability of the IMS system for detection of harmful chemicals. The work described herein demonstrates modifications of the IMS experimental techniques leading to novel methods for use of IMS in both homeland security and pharmaceutical applications. Several ionization source techniques, including 63 Ni, corona, electrospray and desorption electrospray, were utilized in both homeland security and pharmaceutical applications to modify IMS instrumentation for selective ionization capabilities. An IMS system was designed and built with the goal to achieve a lightweight <b>modular</b> design <b>offering</b> high performance {{for the detection of}} trace explosives using corona ionization, a safer option to 63 Ni ionization sources. The potential of electrospray ion mobility-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMMS) as a method for monitoring pharmaceutical reactions in real time was demonstrated with a reductive amination reaction and real time data were collected on the timescale of 300 seconds. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) was coupled to an atmospheric pressure IMS for the direct analysis of active ingredients formulated into pharmaceutical samples. Increased selectivity for drug responses over excipient responses was demonstrated {{through the use of a}} doping agent in the DESI solvent. Additionally, the use of a modifier in the drift gas of an ion mobility spectrometer as a secondary method to lower the false alarm rate of current IMS systems was demonstrated. An analytical method that utilizes structure selective ion molecule interactions (SSIMI) in ion mobility spectrometry to shift the mobility of a targeted analyte through the addition of a gas phase modifier to the buffer was developed to selectively change the separation of target analytes. A modifier with a proton affinity similar to the target analyte produced the greatest changes in mobility due to the formation of a cluster between the neutral modifier and target analyte ion.

The objective was to find out how offering and pricing should be managed with global customers in the industrial service sector and how supplier should adjust the organization in order to implement global account management. Global account management is relatively young research stream and more research is needed. Both the organizational and especially the commercial aspects of global account management need further research. Furthermore, global account management has not been studied in the context of the industrial service sector. This research was able to contribute to the research gap. The research aimed at making interesting theoretical contributions, as well as giving managerial implications for industrial service companies striving for successful business with global customers. The empirical research was conducted as a single case study of a multinational company’s industrial service business unit. The study mixed both holistic and embedded case study designs. The holistic design enabled to grasp the most important concepts of global account management at the case company level, while the embedded case design looked at global account management at customer level. This way it was possible to reach holistic but concrete conclusions. The study used qualitative data that was collected by interviewing the case company representatives, analysing email correspondence and other case company documents. The research was guided by a strict but evolving framework developed from the existing literature. The results of the study show that in offering and pricing management with global customers it is important to have a global <b>modular</b> service <b>offering,</b> which enables that same services can be offered to a global customer in all markets.

40|$|A {{challenge}} facing many professional service organizations, and especially healthcare institutes, {{is how to}} meet the heterogeneous and complex demands of customers while, at the same time, minimizing costs. Recently, attention has been drawn to the managerial concept of modularity {{as a means of}} providing low-cost person-centred variety. However, only limited conceptual clarity exists as to what constitutes a module in a service offering and how to appropriately design a <b>modular</b> professional service <b>offering.</b> This thesis starts with a theoretical analysis of the literature seeking conceptual clarity on service modularity, and identifies six ways to decompose a service offering into modules. Subsequently, a two-stage design process for service modularity is described. The first step involved a segmentation study in the healthcare sector that used a finite mixture model to group older adults into five segments based on their experienced biopsychosocial needs. In the second step, a multidisciplinary group of professionals, using the results of the person-centred segmentation study, developed a set of care and service modules. Finally, in a multiple case study, various modular professional service architectures were identified, each with its own merits. This final element highlighted the role of interfaces in modular design as well as boundaries to applying modularity in professional services. In explicating the underlying central design choices, I stress that modular service design is not something that ‘just happens’ or slowly evolves. This thesis demonstrates the influence of design choices made within a modular design on how person-centred variety and costs are balanced...|$|R
40|$|My {{interest}} {{in the field of}} modular production was first developed toward the end of my PhD research in 1999. I was visiting a supplier that provided seating solutions on a synchronous basis to Nissan Manufacturing UK and wanted to explore the operational dimensions of synchronous supply. What struck me at the time was that the supplier was charged with providing complex seating modules that included a variety of seating material options, plug and play electronics, lumbar support and a variety of airbag options with associated ignitors. This modular approach required the supplier to manage over 60 upstream suppliers and necessitated the development of lean operations that could deliver faultless products to Six Sigma levels. It was clear at the time of my visit that delivering on a synchronous basis was accommodated by modular production and that this method of production had implications for supply chain management, the configuration of supplier operations and the changing role played by OEMs who were increasingly seeking modular solutions in an environment characterized by high risk and low cost. Ten years on and having written a number of papers relating to modularity and acted as reviewer for a number of modularity focussed papers it became evident to me that this was a growing field of operations and supply chain research and that this area would benefit from a special issue examining key issues and exploring future research avenues. The special issue could test or explore the growing focus upon modular strategies, the role of product architecture, the impact of modularity upon the structure of supply chains and the potential for applying modular thinking within a service sector context. This special issue attracted 25 papers and five appear in this issue. It is fitting that the first paper of this special issue is a reflection of a Harvard Business Review paper first published in 1965 by Professor Martin Starr and often cited as the first paper to explore the power of modularity. Having read Starr's (1965) paper for my own research I decided to contact him and explain the thinking behind the proposed special issue and request his services as a reviewer. To my delight Martin Starr agreed to support this project by not only providing excellent reviews but also by submitting an update of his seminal paper. I asked Martin Starr about the impact of his paper back in 1965 and he explained what happened shortly after its publication: […] After the Harvard Business Review article appeared, I was invited to give a talk about modular production to the University of Western Ontario. They had a large auditorium built in theater style and my audience consisted of about ten people crowded down at the front. One of the PhD students said “you should have seen this place last evening. Betty Friedan was here to talk about her book, The Feminine Mystique. ” He continued, “Every seat was taken and they were standing {{in the back of the}} auditorium. ” It was not easy to give my talk after that introduction. The second paper analyses the supply chain implications of modularity by exploring product performance of manufacturing within Hong Kong. The paper reports the results of a large-scale study and suggests that companies with high levels of product modularity tend to outperform companies with more traditional non-modular operations. In the third paper, modularity is examined within the context of coordination capabilities in order to analyze how process interdependencies are managed through modularity and coordination mechanisms. The authors found that understanding which interdependencies hide potential rents and organizing transfer to appropriate such rents becomes a formidable weapon for firms competing in industries characterized by outsourcing and modularity. Service modularity is the subject of fourth paper which focuses upon the provision of modular care and service packages for independently living elderly. The author proposes that modularity theory should distinguish between the creation of <b>modular</b> <b>offerings</b> in care provision versus their creation in goods production. Examining modularity within such a setting is clearly demanding and, in many ways, it is often more difficult to partition and design services than it is to partition and design products. Finally, fifth paper returns to more traditional territory with an exploration of platform use within the automotive sector. The authors contend that literature relating to modularity is generally focused on the planning and design of the first generation of platform, assuming the possibility to anticipate its evolution over time. The research demonstrates that this assumption needs to be challenged especially in dynamic environments when the firm decides to re-use the platform on more than one generation. The authors demonstrated that when the platform has a long life cycle, the products developed on the platform and the platform itself co-evolves. Thus, rather than a one-step planning process the authors observe a continuous interaction between technical, marketing, economic and strategic questions during the platform lifecycle. Robertson and Ulrich's (1998) framework thus could be extended towards a continuous planning process. The smart reuse routine highlights the interplay or the co-evolution between the products and the platform. This special issue brings together, for the first time, a collection of papers that explore the validity, scope and dimensions of modularity and modularization. Together, they demonstrate that the concept of modularity is applicable to both tangible and intangible environments and that there is plenty of scope to extend modular thinking into, as yet, untapped and unexplored areas. The current economic crisis may hasten the acceleration of modular production as manufacturers seek to reduce costs whilst maintaining quality. Similarly, an increasing number of service environments have explored modular service provision (education (with distinct modules attracting a set amount of credits and outlining clear aims and objectives), banking services (with modularized financial package options), healthcare (seeking modular solutions to capital projects, particularly building provision)) which present many possibilities to test existing concepts, tools and techniques of modularity and to extend and solidify the modular lexicon.

40|$|Background The Dutch mental {{healthcare}} {{sector has}} to decrease costs by reducing intramural capacity with one third by 2020 and treating more patients in outpatient care. This transition necessitates enabling patients to become as self-supporting as possible, by customising the residential care they receive {{to their needs}} for self-development. Theoretically, modularity might help mental healthcare institutions with this. Modularity entails the decomposition of a healthcare service in parts that can be mixed-and-matched {{in a variety of}} ways, and combined form a functional whole. It brings about easier and better configuration, increased transparency and more variety without increasing costs. Aim: this study aims to explore the applicability of the modularity concept to the residential care provided in Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) of Dutch mental healthcare institutions. Methods A single case study is carried out at the centre for psychosis in Etten-Leur, part of the GGz Breburg IMPACT care group. The design enables in-depth analysis of a case in a specific context. This is considered appropriate since theory concerning healthcare modularity is in an early stage of development. The present study can be considered a pilot case. Data were gathered by means of interviews, observations and documentary analysis. Results At the centre for psychosis, the majority of the residential care can be decomposed in modules, which can be grouped in service bundles and sub-bundles; the service customisation process is sufficiently fit to apply modular thinking; and interfaces for most of the categories are present. Hence, the prerequisites for <b>modular</b> residential care <b>offerings</b> are already largely fulfilled. For not yet fulfilled aspects of these prerequisites, remedies are available. Conclusion The modularity concept seems applicable to the residential care offered by the ALF of the mental healthcare institution under study. For a successful implementation of modularity however, some steps should be taken by the ALF, such as developing a catalogue of modules and a method for the personnel to work with this catalogue in application of the modules. Whether implementation of modular residential care might facilitate the transition from intramural residential care to outpatient care should be the subject of future research.

40|$|The {{report is}} divided into three {{different}} categories; background, concept evaluation and comparison and the methodology development. The background gives a short introduction of product architecture, modularity and modularization and also a brief description of existing design concepts which are capable of <b>offering</b> <b>modular</b> capabilities in the operation phase of a vessels life cycle. The second part of the report is a review of possible advantages and disadvantages with the implementation of a similar concept as presented in the background on offshore support vessels. The review deals with several aspects such as increased flexibility, higher spot utilization and also how this concept can have effects in an environmental perspective. Direct challenges with modular capabilities such as equipment complexity, port logistics issues etc. has also been discussed. Finally the concept is evaluated from an economical perspective, discussing costs in short and long term perspectives and how to predict the costs of a conversion between operations. The result of the evaluation is that the concept has aspects that are presumed quite beneficial for ship owners. Noticeable are increased flexibility in the range of operations a vessel can perform, possibilities for a fleet reduction due to modular capabilities and also possibilities for economic benefits in forms of higher spot utilization and easier maintenance of equipment modules. It is also anticipated that the concept will make the vessel more receptive for new technology and equipment modules. The most repressive aspect regarding modular capabilities is by far each equipment modules high degree of complexity together with the low degree of independency. The concept has also been compared with multi-purpose OSV s and conventional mission specific OSV s within several different aspects considered important for ship owners. The results are generally favoring a vessel with modular capabilities, but also that the negative aspects of the concept might not be taken sufficient account for in the comparison. In the third and last part it is developed a methodology to establish the equipment structure of an offshore support vessel with modular capabilities. It establishes the function hierarchy of the vessel and defines the interactions between the equipment modules and the functions before each module is evaluated in light of modular complexity and vessel influence. Based on this the equipment structure is established and exchange intervals for the modules are proposed. To illustrate the steps of the methodology better a case study is performed based on 5 different operations; anchor handling, towing, pipe lay, construction and support. The case study gives two main indications: 1. There are a potential in further development of the methodology. Mainly involving the modules interactions and the specific equipment evaluation. 2. The equipment modules are as determined before very complex and require long exchange intervals and also extensive external support to swap modules...|$|R
40|$|Power {{electronics}} {{are becoming}} established in ever broadening areas of industry. The transition from previous generation technology {{is driven by}} the oportunity for improvements in controllability, efficiency, and longevity. A wide variety of power semiconductors are available, however power handling capacity is still a significant limitation for many applications. An increase in the capacity of a single device is usually accompanied by a drop in switching frequency, and hence achievable system bandwidth. Increased capacity can be attained without this loss in bandwidth by using multiple lower power devices in parallel. Products based on parallel device topologies are already present in the marketplace, however there are many associated complications. The nature of these complications depends on the control method and topology used, but no system combines high performance and high power with high reliability and easy maintainability. This research aims to identify and develop a method that would provide a system of voltage source inverters with a total capacity in excess of 10 MVA, with effective control bandwidth comparable to a 100 kVA system. Additionally, the method should be equally applicable at still higher power levels in the future with the anticipated development of higher capacity power semiconductors. The primary goal when using paralleled devices is to achieve an even distribution of system load between them, as unbalanced load leads to poor system utilisation. Devices can be paralleled either passively, in which devices are controlled in common and characteristics inherent to the device are relied upon to balance load; or actively, in which devices are individually controlled and monitored to improve load balance. A key component of the thesis is the identification and analysis of the inadequacies inherent to passively paralleled systems. It is the limitations of passive paralleling that provide the motivation to develop an active parallel control mechanism. Following the analysis, an active control algorithm is developed and implemented on a paralleled system. The proposed system topology consists of an array of medium power Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) modules operating in parallel. Each module is controlled semi-independently at a local level, with an inter-module communications network to enable active equalisation of module load, and redundant fault management. An innovative load equalisatiion algorithm is developed and proven, the key feature of which is this inclusion of a synthetic differential resistance between modules within the system. The result is a <b>modular</b> expandable structure <b>offering</b> the potential for very high power capacity combined with quality of response usually only found in low power systems. The system as a whole is extremely reliable as any module can be isolated {{in the event of a}} fault without significantly affecting the remainder of the network. Performance results from both simulation and experimentation on a two module small scale prototype are given. Using the developed topology and control method extremely accurate load balancing can be achieved without degradation of the response characteristics. The system is tested up to only 2. 4 kW in the course of this research, but the correlation with simulation is high and gives confidence that the developed mechanism will allow the 10 MV A goal to be achieved. Following the developmental stage of this research the technology has been applied to a commercial system comprising parallel structures of up to 8 modules with a total power handling capacity of 1 MVA with no deterioration in performance. 2 MVA systems are deliverable with the current technology without any changes, and higher power levels are expected to be easily achieved...|$|R
