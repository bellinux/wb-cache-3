40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} study of the vortex-induced vibrations of a rigid square cylinder, <b>mounted</b> <b>flexibly,</b> in a wind tunnel is presented. Special {{attention is paid to}} keep the structural damping as low as possible. Structural supports are assumed to behave linearly through out the amplitude envelope. Experimental data comprises of amplitude curves and transient slopes. The experimental procedure was repeated to study the cylinder behaviour both under the memory effect and without it. The classical mode switch can be pointed out in both the cases. Hysteresis is however found only in the former case. Measurements consist of the time histories of oscillations using laser displacement sensors. Structural parameters are estimated without airflow. Time evolution of energy of the square cylinder is recorded and later manipulated to calculate the growth rate of oscillation amplitude in the transient regime...|$|R

40|$|The {{influences}} of a <b>flexibly</b> <b>mounted</b> cylinder and a fixed cylinder on the flow field in regular waves are studied numerically. Performances of the <b>flexibly</b> <b>mounted</b> cylinder oscillating freely in still water and in regular waves are first simulated. Then the in-line {{forces on the}} two cylinders in regular waves are compared to the theoretical results. All results indicate the present model is valid. Then the entire flow fields induced by the two cylinders are analyzed in detail. The windward and leeward regions of the cylinder are each divided into eight sections. Results of the windward side are complex because of the superposition of incoming and reflected waves. Results of the leeward side show that the sectional average wave height decreases as the wave frequency increases. In general, the <b>flexibly</b> <b>mounted</b> cylinder attenuates wave energy more effectively. Moreover, the wave frequency {{is a major factor}} influencing the flow field. When the incident wave frequency approaches the natural frequency of the cylinder, differences of the two data sets become significant. Distance between the section and the cylinder is another influential factor. The two sets of results become more similar as the distance increases, especially in cases of low incident wave frequencies. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Two-phase {{crossflow}} {{over heat}} exchanger tubes induces vibrations which contribute {{greatly to the}} wear on the tubes. Of the three mechanisms leading to two-phase flow-induced vibrations which have been identified, fluid-elastic instability has been recognized as that {{which leads to the}} vibrations with the largest amplitude. The mass damping parameter is used to predict the onset of fluid-elastic instability, and the mean drag coefficient is used to calculate the mass damping parameter. In this thesis, the drag coefficient measured over single tubes and tubes within array, in single-phase and two-phase flow at various Reynolds numbers, is discussed. The drag coefficient was measured by two methods. For <b>flexibly</b> <b>mounted</b> tubes, strain gages were mounted on cantilever beams which held the tube in place and allowed it to vibrate in the direction parallel to the flow only. For both rigidly and <b>flexibly</b> <b>mounted</b> tubes, pressure distributions were measured {{around the perimeter of the}} tube. Forces, and then the drag coefficient, could be calculated from this information. The drag coefficient was not found to depend upon the flexibility of the tube mounting. As the void fraction of the flow increases, the drag coefficient over the tube increases. This effect was found to be quite large at low Reynolds numbers, and weaker at higher Reynolds numbers, and a different effect was found at very high Reynolds numbers...|$|R
