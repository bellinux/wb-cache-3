Three Hewlett-Packard model 5071 high performance cesium frequency standards were transported from the USNO in Washington, DC to Los Angeles, California in the USNO's <b>mobile</b> <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer links between the <b>mobile</b> <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> and the USNO were conducted {{each day of the}} trip, using the Naval Research Laboratory(NRL) designed spread spectrum modem, built by Allen Osborne Associates(AOA).

50|$|Each {{regional}} beam {{covers a}} fraction of the area covered by a global beam, but collectively all of the regional beams offer virtually the same coverage as the global beams. Use of regional beams allow user terminals (also called <b>mobile</b> <b>earth</b> <b>stations)</b> to operate with significantly smaller antennas. Regional beams were introduced with the I-3 satellites. Each I-3 satellite provides four to six spot beams; each I-4 satellite provides 19 regional beams.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for global wideband satellite communication services on vessels {{has led to}} applications that enable Earth Stations on board Vessels (ESVs) to use Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) networks operating in the uplink band 14 - 14. 5 GHz. The broadband communication solution requested from these kinds of vessels can only be provided by using the ESV services - today offered by several telecommunication operators. Transmitting capacity may vary between 19. 2 kbit/s up to 1 - 2 Mbit/s. From the International Radio Regulatory view, {{in accordance with the}} Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union, the 14 - 14. 5 GHz band is allocated to the Mobile-Satellite Service (Earth-to-Space), except to the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) on a secondary basis, to the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) on a primary basis in all ITU regions and to the Fixed Service (FS) in many countries through Radio Regulations Article 5 footnotes. Hence, whichever operational frequency for the <b>mobile</b> <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> is chosen within 14 - 14. 5 GHz, there may be a need to consider the potential interference caused to the FS receivers. Particularly, in the case of mobile earth stations installed on vessels, interference problems may be created to the Fixed Service receivers placed near the coastline or on small islands. For countries like Greece, the problem is even more intense since there are many islands where Fixed Service links may be deployed and a great number of vessels equipped with Earth Stations operating in the 14 / 11 GHz band travel throughout Aegean Sea every day especially during summer. This paper examines the potential interference from earth stations on vessels to Fixed Service receivers in the 14 GHz band when the vessels are traveling close to the coastline. The parameters that {{have an impact on the}} interference calculations are presented and simulations are conducted for various realistic interference scenarios. It is shown that, the interference caused to the Fixed Service receivers is negligible if some operational limits are imposed to the vessels equipped with Earth Stations...|$|E

50|$|Inmarsat-C is a two-way, packet {{data service}} {{operated}} by the telecommunications company Inmarsat which operates between <b>mobile</b> <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> (MES) and land <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> (LES). It became fully operational {{after a period of}} pre-operational trials in January 1991. The advantages of Inmarsat-C compared to Inmarsat-A are low cost, smaller and uses a smaller omni-directional antenna. The disavantages is that voice communication is not possible with Inmarsat-C. The service is approved for use under the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), meets the requirements for Ship Security Alert Systems (SSAS) defined by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and is the most widely used service in fishing Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS).|$|R
50|$|During {{the initial}} stages of the program, Orbital pursued a multi-pronged approach: {{regulatory}} approvals; ground infrastructure development and procurement of sites; modem development and country licensing. In 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) supported the spectrum allocation for Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary Mobile Satellite Service. With WARC approval, Orbital set up a specific ORBCOMM program for the development of satellites and ground infrastructure, and ORBCOMM became a wholly owned subsidiary of Orbital. In 1995, ORBCOMM was granted a full license to operate a network with up to 200,000 <b>mobile</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>stations</b> (MESs).|$|R

A new method for the realistic calculation of the coordination area is presented. This method takes into account the mobility parameters of the interfering stations such as their velocity and their frequency of passage from specific locations around the FS station and the specific interference conditions. Simulations in real interference environments prove its validity. Useful results for the coordination procedure between the two services are extracted and thoroughly discussed. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to study and examine the various {{reliability}} characteristics of a global mobile satellite communication System (GMSCS) {{with the help of}} mathematical modelling. GMSCS basically comprises of four subsystems; Space segment, Land <b>earth</b> <b>stations,</b> Telecommunication terminals and <b>Mobile</b> <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b> The system under consideration can have three different modes of working: normal, partial and complete failure. The system is characterized by determination of probabilities being in ‘up’ and ‘down’ states at any instant. Integro-differential equations are derived for these probabilities by identifying the system at suitable regeneration epochs. Based {{on the assumption that the}} failure rates of units are distributed exponentially while the repair rates are distributed arbitrarily, different reliability measures like operational availability, reliability, mean time to failure and cost effectiveness have been computed with the principle of Laplace transforms and supplementary variable technique. Considerable attention is devoted to illustrate the results with numerical examples to highlight the important features of reliability measures of the system...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} a {{satellite}} communications receiver than can perform simultaneous multi-channel processing of single channel per carrier (SCPC) signals originating from various small (<b>mobile</b> or fixed) <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b> The number of ground users can be as many as 1000. Conventional techniques of simultaneously processing these signals is by employing as many RF-bandpass filters as the number of channels. Consequently, such an approach would result in a bulky receiver, which becomes impractical for satellite applications. A unique approach utilizing a realtime surface acoustic wave (SAW) chirp transform processor is presented. The application of a Convolve-Multiply-Convolve (CMC) chirp transform processor is described. The CMC processor transforms each input channel into a unique timeslot, while preserving its modulation content (in this case QPSK). Subsequently, each channel is individually demodulated without the need of input channel filters. Circuit complexity is significantly reduced, because the output frequency of the CMC processor is common for all input channel frequencies. The results of theoretical analysis and experimental results are in good agreement...|$|R
