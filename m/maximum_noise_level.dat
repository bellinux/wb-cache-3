40|$|Valuation {{of traffic}} noise {{abatement}} based on hedonic pricing {{models of the}} property market has traditionally measured the noise as the equivalent, or another average, level. What is not captured in such a noise indicator is the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of a vehicle passage. In this study, we incorporate the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the hedonic model letting the property price depend on both the equivalent noise level and the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> subtracted with the equivalent noise level. Furthermore, we control for the equivalent noise level in the estimations. The estimated results show that including the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in the model has influence on the property prices, but only for rail and not for road.

The frequency of {{occurrence of}} the respective noise events is also a factor. The possible practical value of the addition of the maximal <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> to the well-known cumulative noise descriptors L(sub eq), L(sub dn), etc. may be considered.

A somewhat less sharply focused consideration of the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> was adopted.

If the average maximal <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> L(sub max) of the entire aircraft fleet mix exceeds the L(sub eq) by more than 20 dB(A) and if more than 20 daily aircraft noise events exceed the L(sub eq) than the difference L(sub max) - 20 becomes the key criterion for noise-mitigation measures.

This investigation has been conducted to measure the noise pollution level from Toyota car Model 2002 because it used for most Saudi people. Measurements of the noise level from this car at stationary and motion situation have been carried out. The noise levels produced by variable engine speed ranged from 750 to 4000 rpm were recorded. The sound level found to be 59. 45 dBA when the vehicle in motion at normal speed. When the vehicle at idle speed 750 rpm the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> measured at the back exhaust 50. 4 dBA where the minimum level recorded at the right side 40. 8 dBA. When the car parked or at stationary state and the engine at 2500 rpm the <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> at the back exhaust is 53 dB A whereas the minimum level showed from the left side. For maximum engine speed 4000 rpm the back exhaust area has a <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> 58. 2 dBA where as the right side at 51. 2 dBA.

Methods: The measurement of <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> was recorded at every hourly and five second intervals with Leq, Lmin, Lmax in the NICU and PNW in different shifts. <b>Noise</b> <b>level</b> generated due to structural and operational factors was analyzed. <b>Noise</b> <b>levels</b> in different shifts was compared with standard and recommended sound <b>level.</b> Results: The <b>noise</b> generated by structural and operational factors were between 60 - 90 dB. The range of noise generated in NICU and PNW was between 50 - 95 dB and 51 - 95 dB respectively with Leq, Lmin, Lmax for both NICU and PNW were 72 dB, 51 dB, 92 dB and 76 dB, 62 dB, and 87 dB respectively. Morning Shifts had <b>maximum</b> <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> when compared with other shifts. Conclusions: <b>Noise</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly higher than standard recommended levels and morning shifts were noisiest of all in NICU and PNW of an urban hospital.
