25|$|As {{it turned}} out, the reforms were not forthcoming. Khrimian {{returned}} to Constantinople and delivered a famous {{speech in which}} he likened the peace conference to a big cauldron of Liberty Stew' into which the big nations dipped their 'iron ladles' for real results, while the Armenian delegation had only a 'Paper Ladle'. 'Ah dear Armenian people,' Khrimian said, 'could I have dipped <b>my</b> <b>Paper</b> Ladle in the cauldron it would sog and remain there! Where guns talk and sabers shine, what significance do appeals and petitions have? Given the absence of tangible improvements in {{the plight of the}} Armenian community, a number of Armenian intellectuals living in Europe and Russia in the 1880s and 1890s formed political parties and revolutionary societies to secure better conditions for their compatriots in Anatolia {{and other parts of the}} Ottoman Empire.|$|E

He played on the traveling team called the Kansas City Red Sox during the summers of 1908 and 1909, going as far west as Wyoming and earning a dollar a day. He was offered a contract by the minor league Kansas City Blues for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, [...] "So I put down <b>my</b> <b>paper</b> and signed. You could never change that boy's mind anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Emanuel {{declared}} in April 2006 {{that he would}} support Hillary Clinton should she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her {{at least once a}} month as chairman of the DCCC. However, Emanuel's loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, Barack Obama, expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: [...] "I'm hiding under the desk. I'm very far under the desk, and I'm bringing <b>my</b> <b>paper</b> and my phone." [...] Emanuel remained neutral in the race until June 4, 2008, the day after the final primary contests, when he endorsed Obama.|$|E
500|$|Arriving in Geneva on December 26, the Christmas Eve, Balzac {{stayed at}} the Auberge de l'Arc, near the Maison Mirabaud where the Hański family had settled for the season. She left a ring {{for him at the}} hotel, with a note asking for a new promise of love. He gave it, and {{described}} how he began wearing the ring on his left hand, [...] "with which I hold <b>my</b> <b>paper,</b> so that the thought of you clasps me tight." [...] At this time he began working on a philosophical novel, Séraphîta, about a hermaphroditic angel united by the love of a mortal man for a compassionate and sensual woman. Balzac explained that she was his model for the latter. It was clear to all that Hański was in ill health, and Hańska began to think about her future with the French author. In the meantime, she asked Balzac to begin collecting for her autographs of the famous people he spent time with in Paris and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Tan's win sparked {{discussion}} about the recognition given to Paralympians in Singapore. A correspondent to the Straits Times criticized {{the fact that the}} newspaper had not elaborated on Tan's performance or what was involved in the event, but had [...] "focused almost primarily on her disability". Another letter writer to <b>my</b> <b>paper</b> expressed disappointment that less publicity had been given to Tan's achievement compared to the silver medals won by the Singapore women's table tennis team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In addition, a Today reader noted that Tan would be receiving S$25,000 for her bronze medal, a tenth of the S$250,000 that table tennis players Feng Tianwei, Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu received for their silver medals. He felt that she should receive even more than them, given what she had achieved in spite of her disabilities. The President of the Society for the Physically Disabled, Ms Chia Yong Yong, commented that the disparity between the cash awards given to able-bodied and disabled sportspeople was [...] "disconcerting" [...] and looked forward to a single common scheme, because: ...|$|E

500|$|An {{undercover}} agent for Scientology went to Stirling University, where Wallis was a teacher. The individual {{pretended to be}} a student, and asked Wallis if he was involved with illegal drugs. Wallis recognized the individual from the Scientology facility Saint Hill Manor, and the agent switched his cover and then asserted {{that he was actually}} a defector from Scientology. In a 1977 article in Doing Sociological Research titled [...] "The Moral Career of a Research Project", Wallis details what occurred after this incident, [...] "In the weeks following his visit a number of forged letters came to light, some of which were supposedly written by me. These letters sent to my university employers, colleagues and others, implicated me in a variety of acts from a homosexual love affair to spying for the drug squad. Because I had few enemies and because this attention followed so closely upon the receipt of <b>my</b> <b>paper</b> by the Church of Scientology organization, it did not seem too difficult to infer the source of these attempts to inconvenience me." [...] According to Lamont, as of the publication of Religion Inc. in 1986, [...] "the book is now accepted by the Public Affairs office of the Church of Scientology as reasonable and fair", and he was provided a copy of the book from the organization itself.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on May 4, 2010 on E! News. The video {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. It also received numerous comparisons to videos by Britney Spears and Lady Gaga, though Cyrus said she [...] "wanted {{it to be}} something different for a female artist". Cristina Gibson of E! described the video as [...] "edgy", similar to Cyrus' video for [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", but [...] "on steroids". Tina Warren of MTV News said the video was a good step toward ridding Cyrus of her good-girl image and gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "intriguing" [...] and stating, [...] "The video [...] is actually quite magnetic and you can’t look away". Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly agreed. While he acknowledged the video [...] "might be dark and a tad conceptually racy", he claimed it was smart move. [...] "She isn’t moving too fast, honestly [...] it’s not like Miley is stripping or baring much skin". Rather, Stransky said Cyrus had [...] "some super-fun dance moves" [...] and [...] " [...] a statement", albeit a darker one. Chinese newspaper People's Daily said the video featured [...] "bold"costumes and [...] "revealed Cyrus' sexy side". The website, Yahoo! added the video {{to the list of}} [...] "Worst Music Videos of 2010" [...] Daniel Rutledge of 3 News in New Zealand said Cyrus had made [...] "it very clear she wishes to cast aside any resemblance to the Disney alter ego that made her famous and be regarded from now on as an adult singer." [...] Singaporean newspaper <b>My</b> <b>Paper</b> defended Cyrus against claims that the video was too provocative and reported, [...] "If nothing else, this vid shows that Cyrus knows how to entertain, and marks the beginning of truly high-quality videos." [...] Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon.com offered a contrary opinion, stating that while Cyrus is a [...] "talented singer [...] deserves to break out of her Disney mold", the [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] music video was poor. Williams said Cyrus has [...] "talent galore" [...] and [...] "incredible pipes", but her video was [...] "predictable, derivative and dumb" [...] due to its unoriginality. According to People magazine, online reaction to the music video has been greatly varied. [...] "Fans and bloggers lit up the Web with comments ranging from 'stunning, gorgeous, fierce' to 'wow way too much for someone her age'", the magazine reported. NME put the video at number 28 on their list of the [...] "50 Worst Music Videos Ever".|$|E
