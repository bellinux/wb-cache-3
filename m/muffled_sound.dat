500|$|At {{the rifle}} range Lody was {{strapped}} into a chair. He refused {{to have his}} eyes bandaged, as he wished to die with his eyes open. A few moments later {{the inhabitants of the}} Tower heard [...] "the <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of a single volley". His body was taken away to be buried in an unmarked grave in the East London Cemetery in Plaistow. The War Office issued a terse announcement of the execution a few days later on 10 November: [...] "Sentence is duly confirmed." ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of the album's {{production}} has attracted criticism; Stevie Chick disparaged {{the lack of}} character in Ginn's bass-playing on [...] "My War" [...] {{when compared to the}} 1982 demo of the same song with Dukowski on bass. [...] Michael Azerrad praised the strength of the material while denigrating the [...] "frustrating lack of ensemble feel" [...] as the album was recorded without a full lineup. [...] Critic Clay Jarvis commended the album, emphasizing the risks taken on it and its influence, calling it [...] "more a test than an album", and saying, [...] "independent music is stronger because Black Flag formulated it". [...] John Dougan at AllMusic called the A-side of the album [...] "quite good", but described the B-side as [...] "self-indulgence masquerading as inspiration and about as much fun as wading through a tar pit". [...] Robert Christgau considered the B-side a [...] "waste".|$|E
500|$|The {{next few}} loops feature a {{refrigerator}} {{hanging from the}} ceiling, leaking blood, the <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of a hysterically crying baby can be heard from the refrigerator and it violently shakes and moves, implying that the baby is trapped inside. This happens several times, each time being more severe than the last. As it transitions, the radio issues a Swedish message referencing the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In the next loop, the lamps turn completely red, the player's vision blurs, and the character moves abnormally quickly, {{with a set of}} disturbing illusions. Eventually, the protagonist listens to a murder being committed in the bathroom through the bathroom peephole. After the audio ends, the bathroom door opens by itself and the player enters upon the fetus-like creature addressing the protagonist that ten months earlier, he lost his job and turned to alcoholism. His wife then landed a part-time cashier job in order to financially support the family, but the manager was sexually attracted to her, implying a motive for the familicide. The corridor then corrects itself and the protagonist eventually hears a voice uttering [...] "204863" [...] repeatedly and the player's perspective distorts, before the game displays a false crash message.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds,</b> in contrast, {{correspond}} to an [...] "o" [...] or [...] "a" [...] with umlauts.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes?' he said thickly, and {{disappeared}} beneath a huge pocket-handkerchief. <b>Muffled</b> <b>sounds,</b> as of distant explosions of dynamite, together with earthquake shudderings of the bedclothes, told of another sneezing-fit.|$|R

2500|$|The new {{technology}} of , which changes the sound made by nearby object depending on objects blocking its path e.g. walls, {{has been added}} to World at War. The game has various levels of [...] "muffled" [...] sound depending on the objects it travels though e.g. a more <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> through a thick wall compared to a slightly <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> through a thin short wall. For {{the first time in a}} Call of Duty game, the player is able to tell the difference between someone walking next to the player and someone walking above or below the player, as well as telling the difference between a shot fired in the distance and a shot fired close by, but behind a solid object.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, van der Bijl {{scored a}} century {{in one of}} the Oxford University cricket trial matches and that led to his {{selection}} for early matches: once in the team, he did well enough to justify continued selection. Sometimes opening the innings, sometimes batting in the middle order, he scored consistently and totalled 540 runs and an average of 45.00. His best match was against Essex when he made an unbeaten 97 in the first innings and followed that with 60 in the second. Despite his success, however, van der Bijl's batting attracted criticism. The Times, reporting on his 97 not out against Essex, wrote: [...] "His driving too often had the dead and <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> that comes from bad timing and a lack of follow-through. Still, his defence was good and if he took an unconscionable time to reach his 50 he deserved the century that he just missed." [...] Wisden Cricketers' Almanack too, in its review of the 1932 Oxford season, was also somewhat faint in its praise: [...] "Van der Bijl semed to play an unnecessarily laboured game for a man of such fine physique," [...] it wrote. [...] "Patient, with very strong defence, he usually {{took a long time to}} settle down and seldom allowed himself the luxury of an attempt to force the game." [...] In a year when Oxford were not strong in cricket, however, van der Bijl was one of the early selections for the University Match, though in a high-scoring drawn game with Cambridge he scored only 7 in his single innings.|$|E
60|$|Her {{efforts to}} compose Carmina were {{interrupted}} by a <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of men's footsteps and women's voices in the next room.|$|E
60|$|We {{passed along}} a narrow passage and through several rooms piled {{up to the}} ceiling with huge bales; then we descended a winding flight of iron steps, and as we reached the bottom I began to hear a faint hum of voices and strange, <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ruth in Hollyoaks {{was also}} known as a rather loud mouthed character, {{evidence}} of this is seen in an episode where while she is talking Lucy Bensons hand covers her mouth in order to gag her but Ruth continues to try and talk but just makes <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds</b> under Lucys hand.|$|R
2500|$|Kuti {{does not}} {{remember}} when Margaryan returned, but {{early in the}} morning he felt that someone had turned on the light. He thought it was Gurgen returning to the room, but after hearing some <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds,</b> he turned his head away from the wall and saw Safarov standing by Margaryan's bed with a long axe in his hands: ...|$|R
60|$|The boys bent {{their heads}} {{together}} and scarcely breathed. A <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of voices floated {{up from the}} far end of the graveyard.|$|E

60|$|What {{between the}} <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> and the echo, Martin created a noise {{that would have}} set his friends into fits of {{laughter}} {{if they had not}} been greatly alarmed.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly the <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds</b> gave {{place to}} the {{distinct}} bellowing of cattle, the clatter of innumerable hoofs, and the yells of savage men, {{while at the same}} moment the edges of the opposite cliffs became alive with Indians and buffaloes rushing about in frantic haste--the former almost mad with savage excitement, the latter with blind rage and terror.|$|R

60|$|Down {{upon her}} knees Columbine fell. Both hands flew {{to cover her}} face. And as she swayed forward she shook violently, and there escaped her lips a little, <b>muffled</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
60|$|For five or {{six minutes}} the distant tumult continued. Then it ceased almost as {{suddenly}} as it had begun. A minute or two later there was a deep, <b>muffled</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
60|$|Smoke awoke with lips {{touching}} his lips. He lay partly in Labiskwee's arms, his head pillowed on her breast. Her voice was cheerful and usual. The <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> {{of it had}} vanished.|$|E
60|$|A white-faced {{clock on}} the wall ticked off the seconds one by one. From the street below came the <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds</b> of wheeled traffic on the soft mud of the road; it was raining more heavily now, {{and from time to time}} a gust of wind rattled the small windows in their {{dilapidated}} frames, or hurled a shower of heavy drops against the panes.|$|R
50|$|Its ubiquity led to many {{suggestions}} for limiting its use, <b>muffling</b> its <b>sound,</b> {{and even an}} outright ban.|$|R
50|$|The Night Angel Trilogy is {{a fantasy}} series written by Brent Weeks. The story follows {{the life of}} Azoth (later Kylar Stern) as he struggles as a guild rat to become the {{ultimate}} wetboy (an assassin with magical talent, {{such as the ability}} to <b>muffle</b> <b>sound</b> or to block an attack), but then tries to leave it all behind and finally becomes the avatar of retribution: the Night Angel.|$|R
60|$|Holder {{found himself}} sitting erect, rigidly attentive, {{listening}} to the <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of a woman's voice in the entry. A few moments later came {{a knock at the}} library door, and Sam entered. The old darky was plainly frightened.|$|E
60|$|At last, just as {{from every}} church tower the bells strike {{the hour of}} nine, there comes the <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of a distant cavalcade: the sound of horses {{galloping}} and only half drowning that of the rumbling of coach wheels.|$|E
6000|$|He and Teddy {{approached}} the door together, with intent faces. Their eyes considered. [...] "Summat wrong," [...] said Hall, and Henfrey nodded agreement. Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them, {{and there was}} a <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of conversation, very rapid and subdued.|$|E
50|$|Dlugoszewski, {{like other}} composers of her generation, claimed a wide and varied {{assortment}} of influences, {{many of them}} Eastern in origin (Noh drama and haiku, for example). She was exceptional, though, for her belief {{in the power of}} subtlety in music. Virgil Thompson described hers as “music of great delicacy.” Dlugoszewski's music is remarkable for its use of silence and of gentle, <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds,</b> especially considering that much of her repertoire is for percussion instruments.|$|R
50|$|Soundproof louvres {{and doors}} {{are used to}} <b>muffle</b> the <b>sound</b> or direct the noise towards the city or the river as required.|$|R
50|$|Bennett {{liked to}} talk and act tough. He took target {{practice}} by firing BB's from an air pistol at a small target mechanism on a filing cabinet in his basement office at the Rouge. Visitors and co-workers were puzzled by the <b>muffled</b> <b>sounds</b> of pellets striking the target. Bennett furthered his tough guy image by keeping lions as pets at his Ann Arbor estate. He startled fellow executives by bringing the cats to his office and painting their likenesses.|$|R
60|$|Just then a {{loud and}} hideous yell issued from, apparently; {{the bowels of}} the earth, and rudely put to flight the feeling of {{profound}} solitude. The cry, although very loud, had a strangely <b>muffled</b> <b>sound,</b> and was repeated as if by an echo.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} raise herself on her elbow, but she {{discovered}} that loose, though quite efficient bonds held her pinioned down; her arms, however, were free and she put out {{her hand in the}} direction whence came the <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of a woman moaning.|$|E
60|$|For {{a hundred}} yards they ran and twisted through the trees, and then, no signs of pursuit appearing, they slowed down to a dignified saunter. Bert, the trouble-seeker, pricked his ears to the <b>muffled</b> <b>sound</b> of blows and sobs, and stepped aside to investigate.|$|E
50|$|Finally, a {{very simple}} and basic way to {{somewhat}} <b>muffle</b> the <b>sound</b> of a piano when practicing is to cover it with a blanket.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 19th century, Judson Powder Works {{manufactured}} dynamite at the northwest foot of the hill. The company {{had been forced to}} move from San Francisco and then nearby Fleming Point in Berkeley because of continuing accidental explosions. The eucaluptus trees now on the hill were planted by the dynamite manufacturers to catch debris and <b>muffle</b> <b>sound</b> of these explosions. The stop on the transcontinental railroad tracks just to the west was called Nobel Station, after the inventor of dynamite.|$|R
50|$|Uranus — Setting of The Planet of Doubt. Seventh {{planet of}} the solar system, warmed by {{internal}} heat. Has a solid, sub-atmospheric surface, with seas and continents perpetually shrouded in fog. The thick atmosphere limits visibility to fifty feet, <b>muffles</b> <b>sound,</b> and effectively impedes radio communications. First visited by Young in 2060, then by the Gaea expedition in 2100. Can only be reached by rockets based on Titan (Saturn system). Portions claimed by the United States; no settlements as of 2100.|$|R
