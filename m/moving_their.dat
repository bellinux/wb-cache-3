This greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E

5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E

The light in the jump bay of the platoon's C-47 Skytrain was later than expected, <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> landing zone from its intended location near Grave, Netherlands; the plane was passing over buildings when the paratroopers were signalled to leave the aircraft, and Thompson decided to wait until reaching several approaching fields.|$|E

5|$|Western Ganga was an {{important}} ruling dynasty of ancient Karnataka in India which lasted from about 350 to 1000 CE. They are known as 'Western Gangas' to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas who in later centuries ruled over Kalinga (modern Odisha). The general belief is that the Western Gangas began their rule {{during a time when}} multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the Pallava empire in South India, a geo-political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of Samudra Gupta. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from Kolar and later, <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> capital to Talakadu {{on the banks of the}} Kaveri River in modern Mysore district.|$|E
5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} and dishes have been imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, {{largely as a result}} of their isolation from outside culinary influences and the need to produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance, <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> cattle to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping a cow for dairy products.|$|E
5|$|At {{the moment}} of impact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was in his office {{on the other side}} of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E

5|$|In May 2014, Sinclair {{disclosed}} in an FCC filling {{that it was}} unable to find buyers for the three affected stations, requiring changes to its transaction. In Harrisburg, Sinclair chose to retain WHP-TV, and divest WHTM to Media General. However, in Charleston and Birmingham, the company proposed to shut down stations entirely (rather than selling them to other buyers that would also handle their operational responsibilities) so it could maintain legal duopolies; surrendering the licenses for WCIV and the full-powered repeaters of WBMA-LD (WJSU and WCFT), and <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> ABC programming to Sinclair's existing stations WMMP and WABM respectively – which would shift their existing MyNetworkTV programming to digital subchannels. After nearly a year of delays, Sinclair's deal to acquire Allbritton was approved by the FCC on July 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul {{is home to}} Borsa Istanbul, {{the sole}} {{exchange}} entity of Turkey, which combined the former Istanbul Stock Exchange, the Istanbul Gold Exchange, and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey. The former Istanbul Stock Exchange was originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange in 1866. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman Stock Exchange was located. Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbul's main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> headquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and Maslak. In 1995, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (now Borsa Istanbul) moved to its current building in the İstinye quarter of the Sarıyer district. A new central business district is also under construction in Ataşehir and will host the headquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{recording}} sessions {{got off the}} ground, Priestess encountered another problem – {{this time with the}} law. The band were working in a house in a neighborhood, and the close proximity to other houses meant that they had to keep the amount of noise generated to a minimum. They had been assured that the house had not previously been served with noise violations of any kind, but after they had finished recording drums and many of the guitar parts, they learned that they had the volume set too high when working on the bass guitar tracks; law enforcement came to the door and forced them to take their work elsewhere because they were shaking neighboring houses with the noise they were generating. The band did so with no objection, quickly <b>moving</b> <b>their</b> equipment to another studio, although they recalled the incident rather humorously later. Schiffman was able to arrange for the group to use another facility as early as the following day, and the band moved production to that new location the night of the incident. The sessions were completed in November 2008.|$|E
