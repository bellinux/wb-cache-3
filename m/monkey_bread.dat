5000|$|The name aranygaluska (<b>monkey</b> <b>bread)</b> {{literally}} means [...] "golden dumpling" [...] {{and by the}} 1880s, this dessert {{was being}} referred to in Hungarian literature. Hungarian immigrants subsequently brought this dish {{with them when they}} immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century. In 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for aranygaluska, which they referred to as [...] "Hungarian Coffee Cake". As it became more popular in America, aranygaluska came to be confused with <b>monkey</b> <b>bread</b> in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. <b>Monkey</b> <b>bread</b> soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert and therefore what most people know as <b>monkey</b> <b>bread</b> today is actually aranygaluska. Recipes for the bread first appeared in American women's magazines and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States. The bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and chopped pecans. [...] It is traditionally served hot so that the baked segments can be easily torn away with the fingers and eaten by hand.|$|E

They also grow vegetables such as onion, tomato, okra, eggplant, squash and peppers. Pastoral farming is particularly important, especially for food supply and saving money for household food bills. Shea butter, <b>monkey</b> <b>bread,</b> are also produced and are also intended primarily for consumption while the wine of palmyra and raffia {{is a source of}} income for people.|$|E
50|$|The Sambisa {{forest is}} one of the few forests in North Eastern Nigeria where sparse {{vegetation}} is the norm. Most of the vegetation is typical of the Sudanian Savanna although, because of human activity, some parts have become more like the Sahel savanna. The forest consists of a mixture of open woodland and sections of very dense vegetation of short trees about two metres high and thorny bushes, with a height of 1/2-1 metre, which are difficult to penetrate. Major trees and bushes in the forest include tallow, rubber, wild black plum, birch, date palm, mesquite, acacia, <b>monkey</b> <b>bread,</b> red bushwillow, baobab, jackalberry, tamarind and terminalia.|$|E
