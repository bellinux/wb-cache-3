During surveillance, the team crossed the border from Spain with no resistance from the authorities and subsequently parked a car in a crowded place. In past instances, the IRA had employed remote <b>control</b> <b>detonators</b> and intelligence suggested the car was rigged with explosives with the suspects holding the remote detonator.|$|R

40|$|Path {{planning}} {{is one of}} the critical issues in mobile robot applications. Traditional methods for path planning in unknown dynamic environment generally plan one step rather than <b>multiple</b> <b>controlling</b> steps. This paper proposes an approach with <b>multiple</b> <b>controlling</b> steps which integrates receding horizon control (RHC) for mobile robot path planning in which the obstacle avoidance problem is converted into mathematic constraint. Besides, the distance from target to robot is optimized through involving a quadratic cost function. Finally, a quadratic constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) is generated, from which a sequence including <b>multiple</b> <b>control</b> steps is easily obtained. Based on the proposed approach, simulations are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the novel method. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

An understanding of the primary verbal operants and operants under <b>multiple</b> <b>control</b> are essential for planning efficient verbal behavior intervention. This paper presents a primer on B.

40|$|The term {{cognitive}} control {{refers to}} a variety of mental processes that support goal-directed behavior. In the current dissertation, I focus on the role of cognitive control in situations where a weaker (but task-relevant) source of information must be selected over a stronger (but task-irrelevant) source of information. The efficiency with which individuals select information in the face of distraction has classically been viewed as a function of static control settings tied to task instructions. Recent evidence suggests, however, that variations in the efficiency of cognitive control can be induced by variations in stimulus experience and that <b>multiple</b> <b>control</b> settings may be maintained for a single task. To date, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms that support this more flexible form of control. Across six experiments, I find evidence for the formation of <b>multiple</b> <b>control</b> settings that are relatively long lasting but fragile. <b>Multiple</b> <b>control</b> settings can be maintained within a single experiment and can last over relatively long periods of time, however, without the proper contextual support these control settings fall apart. These results emphasize the important role of stimulus experience in studies of cognitive control. Ph. D...|$|R

Using the control firm structure allows us to easily avoid the new listing, rebalancing, and skewness biases. Further, despite the induced correlation amongst the BHARs, using <b>multiple</b> <b>control</b> firms allows us to increase the power of the test beyond that of existing tests. Most importantly, we show that, with the appropriate choice of control firms, our test is well-specified in both random and nonrandom samples...|$|R
