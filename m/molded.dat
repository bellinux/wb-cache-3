50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression <b>molding,</b> transfer <b>molding,</b> injection <b>molding,</b> extrusion, rotational <b>molding,</b> blow <b>molding,</b> thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam <b>molding.</b> Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes. Compression <b>molding,</b> transfer <b>molding,</b> injection <b>molding,</b> forging, and foam <b>molding</b> has high equipment and tooling cost. Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational <b>molding,</b> blow <b>molding,</b> thermoforming, and casting. A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.|$|R

5|$|Thatched or tiled roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof.

50|$|Transfer <b>molding</b> (BrE moulding) is a {{manufacturing}} process where casting material is {{forced into a}} <b>mold.</b> Transfer <b>molding</b> is different from compression <b>molding</b> in that the <b>mold</b> is enclosed Hayward rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact. Compared to injection <b>molding,</b> transfer <b>molding</b> uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the <b>mold</b> cavity. This allows thicker reinforcing fiber matrices to be more completely saturated by resin. Furthermore, unlike injection <b>molding</b> the transfer <b>mold</b> casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection <b>molding</b> processes.|$|R

The reduction of the weld-line groove has been promoted in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> whereas few effects appeared in the steel <b>mold.</b> Surface temperature increase by the hot air supply in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> is larger than that in the steel <b>mold.</b> By this higher temperature increase, temperature of the resin on the weld-line area must be higher and the hardness of the resin must be lower in the laser metal sintered <b>mold</b> so that the resin is deformed well reducing the weld-line groove...|$|R

5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be <b>molded</b> using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E

Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main disadvantages: high tooling cost, limited to low-melting-point metals, and short <b>mold</b> life. The high tooling costs make this process {{uneconomical}} for small production runs. When {{the process is}} used to cast steel or iron the <b>mold</b> life is extremely short. For lower melting point metals the <b>mold</b> life is longer but thermal fatigue and erosion usually limit the life to 10,000 to 120,000 cycles. The <b>mold</b> life is dependent on four factors: the <b>mold</b> material, the pouring temperature, the <b>mold</b> temperature, and the <b>mold</b> configuration. <b>Molds</b> made from gray cast iron can be more economical to produce but have short <b>mold</b> lives. On the other hand, <b>molds</b> made from H13 tool steel may have a <b>mold</b> life several times greater. The pouring temperature {{is dependent on the}} casting metal, but the higher the pouring temperature the shorter the <b>mold</b> life. A high pouring temperature can also induce shrinkage problems and create longer cycle times. If the <b>mold</b> temperature is too low misruns are produced, but if the <b>mold</b> temperature is too high then the cycle time is prolonged and <b>mold</b> erosion is increased. Large differences in section thickness in the <b>mold</b> or casting can decrease <b>mold</b> life as well.|$|R

5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are <b>molded</b> into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} a feature-based approach to automated design of multi-piece sacrificial <b>molds.</b> We use multi-piece sacrificial <b>molds</b> to create complex 3 D polymer/ceramic parts. Multi-piece <b>molds</b> refer to <b>molds</b> that contain {{more than two}} <b>mold</b> components or subassemblies. Our methodology has the following three benefits over the state-of-the-art. First, by using multi-piece <b>molds</b> we can create complex 3 D objects that are impossible to create using traditional two piece <b>molds.</b> Second, we make use of sacrificial <b>molds.</b> Therefore, using multi-piece sacrificial <b>molds,</b> we can create parts that pose disassembly problems for permanent <b>molds.</b> Third, <b>mold</b> design steps are significantly automated in our methodology. Therefore, we can create the functional part from the CAD model of the part {{in a matter of}} hours and so our approach can be used in small batch manufacturing environments. The basic idea behind our <b>mold</b> design algorithm is as follows. We first form the desired gross <b>mold</b> shape based on the feature-based description of the part geometry. If the desired gross <b>mold</b> shape is not manufacturable as a single piece, we decompose the gross <b>mold</b> shape into simpler shapes to make sure that each component is manufacturable using CNC machining. During the decomposition step, we account for tool accessibility to make sure that (1) each component is manufacturable, and (2) components can be assembled together to form the gross <b>mold</b> shape. Finally, we add assembly features to <b>mold</b> component shapes to facilitate easy assembly of <b>mold</b> components and eliminate unnecessary degree of freedoms from the final <b>mold</b> assembly...|$|R
