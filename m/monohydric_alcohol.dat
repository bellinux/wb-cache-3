The kinetic model suggests a molecular picture of a hydrophobically stabilized encounter complex, with equilibrium constants Kec often smaller than unity, in which the cosolute blocks the reaction center of the hydrolytic ester for attack by water. The formation of these encounter complexes leads to a dominant initial-state stabilization as follows from the thermodynamic model. Decreases in both apparent enthalpies and entropies of activation for these hydrolysis reactions correspond to unfavorable enthalpies and favorable entropies of complexation, which confirms that the encounter complexes are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. ...|$|E

The Transportation network is responsible for a large amount of the hazardous emissions causing global warming and air pollution problems worldwide. Bio-diesel {{is one of the}} most important suitable oil to eliminate greenhouse gases emissions and alternative of the fossil fuels. The demand of energy is increasing on day-to-day basis, because enhancement in industrialization and population. Bio-diesel (mono-alkyl-esters) is the substitutive fuel, which obtained through the process of transesterification of <b>monohydric</b> <b>alcohols</b> with triglyceride oil. Bio-diesel oil obtained from the renewable sources of fuel having no properties of degradable and toxic. The waste cooking oil, such as sunflower, canola, soybean, coconut, corn oil, fish oil, rice bran, chicken fat, and algae can be used for preparation of Bio diesel, by adopted this process, the dependency on petroleum-based fuel decreased partially. This paper will focus on production of bio diesel oil from algae (micro algae and macro-algae) having higher efficiency of photosynthetic process by the other biomass products. The algae are best sources for the production bio-diesel, and having best yielding stock for bio-diesel. The macro algae is available in abundant in the form of seaweed at coastal area of Balochistan which extends over 750 kms. The micro algae cultivated near the beach of coastal area either in wet land (ponds) or in saline lagoons. It will provide main source of income to the people of coastal area inhabitants and consequently, it will provid...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} an {{experimental}} technique which permits {{detailed study of}} the temperature of maximum density of pure water and aqueous solutions is presented. The density of water {{as a function of}} temperature passes through a maximum at 3. 98 C. This temperature of maximum density (Tmd) changes when solutes are added to the water. This investigation is carried out by cooling a rectangular chamber containing a test fluid. Throughout the tests a 4 °C temperature gradient is maintained. As the test fluid is cooled through its density maximum the normal single cell convection that occurs {{in the presence of a}} temperature gradient is replaced by a double cell. Monitoring this double cell is the basis of all tests carried out in this study. For solutes such as ionic salts and sugars, the temperature of maximum density decreases in a linear manner as the solute concentration increases (‘Despretz law’). It had been noted, however, in previous work that for <b>monohydric</b> <b>alcohols</b> such as methanol and ethanol the behaviour of the temperature of maximum density is non-linear, showing an initial rise above 4 C as the solute concentration is increased, followed by a drop below 4 C as the concentration continues to rise. Results presented here from more detailed studies indicate that the behaviour of the temperature of maximum density in such cases is highly non-linear, moving through several local maxima in the low concentration region for both ethanol and 2 -propanol. Macroscopic and microscopic are investigated in an attempt to understand and explain this unexpected behaviou...|$|R

Static load providing separation of specimen at equilibrium peel rate, corresponding to 10 - 8 m/sec, {{the rate at which}} a kinetic segment of a hydrocarbon chain moves in an elementary event of thermal motion, was treated as peel strength of a specimen at creep rupture. A methodology was developed to measure the peel strength at creep rupture in an open air and liquid medium active towards the interface of joined materials. Series of <b>monohydric</b> <b>alcohols</b> was selected since lower alcohols are strongly hydrogen bonded solvents whilst higher alcohols tend to strong dispersion interaction. The change in peel strength values due to variation of solubility parameter of the selected alcohols was used for identification of molecular bonds established across rubber filler interface. Decreasing in the peel strength values with increasing in despersive component of the solubility parameter of the hostile medium indicated the presence of dispersion bonds across rubber-filler interface. Hydrogen and polar bonds were identified by decreasing the peel strength values due to increasing polar component of the solubility parameter of the alcohols to which a specimen was exposed, while stability of joints to action of hostile medium, proved the presence of chemical bonds established across the rubber - filler interface. Obtained peel-strength values correlated well with bound rubber content, ensuring that the results have realistically characterized rubber-filler interaction. The chemical nature of the filler surface was the main factor influencing it, that has made possible in commercial practicability the modification of the inert filler in order to enhance its effect on rubber properties.
