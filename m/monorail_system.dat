5|$|Previously, {{there had}} been plans to extend the <b>monorail</b> <b>system</b> which connects many of the major area hotels and the Las Vegas Convention Center to the airport. In December 2006, Clark County {{approved}} plans for the extension, although funding was not specified. In its presentation to the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee in early 2016, Las Vegas Monorail expressed its continued interest in the extension. However, the project is largely no longer under consideration due to its high cost.|$|E

Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the monorail and fights him just as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy {{a section of the}} track. Batman refuses to kill Ra's, but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him.|$|E

25|$|To {{reach the}} park, guests either use the Walt Disney World <b>Monorail</b> <b>System,</b> the ferryboats, or Disney Transport buses, {{depending}} on the location of their hotel or parking lot. The three hotels closest to Magic Kingdom, Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, use either the ferry or <b>monorail</b> <b>system</b> to travel to Magic Kingdom. Guests staying at Disney's Wilderness Lodge and Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground can also ride a dedicated ferry boat to the Magic Kingdom docks. Guests of other hotels take buses {{to travel to the}} park, while guests who are not staying at any of the resort's hotels must use the <b>monorail</b> <b>system</b> or ferryboats to travel to the park from the Transportation and Ticket Center. The three ferries are clad in different trim colors and are named for past Disney executives: the General Joe Potter (blue), the Richard F. Irvine (red) and the Admiral Joe Fowler (green). The main monorail loop has two lanes. The outer lane is a direct nonstop loop between the TTC and Magic Kingdom, while the inner loop has additional stops at Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, and Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa. Epcot is accessible by a spur monorail line that was added upon that park's opening in 1982.|$|E

25|$|Previously {{there had}} been {{plans to build a}} <b>{{monorail}}</b> <b>system</b> and part of it was already under construction, but the project stalled in 2004 due to lack of funding. The monorail project was relaunched in 2013 and the groundbreaking was done in October 2013. However the project cancelled in January 2015, due to disagreements between the Jakarta administration and PT Jakarta Monorail over the monorail's route. By mid 2015, this project is finally abandoned by Jakarta Government and being replaced by light rail transit system.|$|E
25|$|SwissRapide: The SwissRapide AG {{together}} with the SwissRapide Consortium was planning and developing the first maglev <b>monorail</b> <b>system</b> for intercity traffic between the country's major cities. SwissRapide was to be financed by private investors. In the long-term, the SwissRapide Express was to connect the major cities north of the Alps between Geneva and St. Gallen, including Lucerne and Basel. The first projects were Bern – Zurich, Lausanne – Geneva as well as Zurich – Winterthur. The first line (Lausanne – Geneva or Zurich – Winterthur) could go into service as early as 2020.|$|E
25|$|A <b>monorail</b> <b>system</b> {{was built}} and {{installed}} by Computerised People Mover International {{at a cost}} of $4million and then opened by the Duchess of Kent in 1991. The system is 1 mile (1½ km) long and travels on an elevated guideway to give views of the park grounds– the track crosses Flag Lane twice on its one-way circular shape. The two halves of the park are connected by the system and there is one station in each part, one near the lion enclosure and one near the monkey building. Each train on the system can seat 24 passengers between its four cars and a full tour takes around fifteen minutes.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{problems}} {{in major cities}} around the world {{during the last two}} decades have presented important needs of new transportation systems. Currently, there is an increased demand on public transportation systems, especially in mega cities. This increased transportations demand, pushed transportation authorities to plan new projects and expand existing <b>monorail</b> <b>systems</b> to accommodate the increase demand. This required engineers to develop and design larger <b>monorail</b> <b>systems.</b> New <b>Monorail</b> designs require more powerful bogies with new dimensions to accommodate more passengers, therefore new suspension system design is essential. In order to overcome new designs problems, better understanding of the suspension system is needed by mathematically modeling the system to predict some dynamic characteristics of a new design. This research work concentrates on the modeling and simulation of 15 degrees of freedom full-car <b>Monorail</b> suspension <b>system.</b> The model features the Monorail body, Front bogie and rear bogie geometries. Lagrange’s equation was used to obtain the equations of motion of the <b>monorail</b> suspension <b>system</b> and system matrices. Numerical Central Difference method was used to obtain the system responses subject to sinusoidal Track excitations. Three Track scenarios that has different loads and different driving speeds were conducted to investigate the <b>monorail</b> suspension <b>system,</b> programmed in MATLAB. The system results are analyzed in terms of their dynamic responses. Fourier Fast transform was used to calculate the frequency ranges of dynamic responses. As a result, some very important characteristics of the <b>Monorail</b> suspension <b>system</b> were revealed, with indicators that helps understanding the effects of driving speeds and different loads, which can be used to better understand the system dynamic performance, to improve the original design specifications and detect <b>Monorail</b> suspension <b>system</b> problems...|$|R
25|$|As a {{possible}} alternative to subway construction, engineer F. H. Behr proposed a <b>monorail</b> <b>system</b> for Brooklyn. Each car was proposed to carry 80 to 120 passengers and attain {{a speed of}} 100 miles per hour. An application was filed with the Board of Alderman for franchises for four routes, with the first running to South Brooklyn. It would have run from the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue and down Fourth Avenue to 85th or 86th Streets, where it would turn eastward to Stillwell Avenue, where it would turn onto West 12th Street and continue to a terminal loop at Coney Island.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{crossing}} Loop 610 which connected AstroWorld to {{its share}} of the Astrodomain (now NRG Park) parking lot was the only publicly accessible, privately owned bridge to cross an interstate highway in Harris County, Texas. A <b>monorail</b> <b>system</b> connecting Astrodomain properties was planned but never built. Stan McIlvaine of the Houston Sports Association (of which Roy Hofheinz was president) had contacted Walt Disney's MAPO, Inc. division concerning the plan as early as 1966. The beamway would have connected AstroWorld's Entry Plaza with the parking lot, the Astrodome, the AstroWorld Hotel, and possibly other nearby locations. The bridge over Loop 610 was engineered and built so that it could accommodate the planned monorail beamway. Bridge supports extended extra feet on both sides. Tram vehicles were employed to shuttle guests between the Entry Plaza and parking lot after the monorail plan was abandoned.|$|E
