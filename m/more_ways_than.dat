The pastoral setting is integrated into the plot, particularly the guerrilla combat of the Chouans. In complementing individual with environs Balzac also shows the influence of James Fenimore Cooper, whose The Last of the Mohicans had impressed the French author.

5|$|Weed {{had wanted}} {{the vice presidential}} {{nomination}} for Seward (who attracted few delegate votes), and Collier had acted to frustrate them in <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> one, for with the New Yorker Fillmore as vice president, under the political customs of the time, no one from that state could be named to the cabinet. Fillmore was accused of complicity in Collier's actions, but this was never substantiated. Nevertheless, there were sound reasons for the selection of Fillmore, as he was a proven vote-getter from electorally crucial New York, and his track record in Congress and as a candidate showed his devotion to Whig doctrine, allaying fears he might be another Tyler were something to happen to General Taylor. Delegates remembered him {{for his role in}} the Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from downed enemies.|$|E

When his brother became captain of the side in 1927, success came to the club in <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> ever achieved. Coventry played in the four consecutive premierships between 1927 and 1930, and in the same years would continue his league dominance, being the finest goal kicker in the league. In the 1928 Grand Final he kicked 9 goals, a league record, and in 1929 he became the first player to kick 100 goals in a season, where he kicked 124 goals, a feat he followed up in 1930 with 118 which included a personal best bag of 17 goals against Fitzroy. Coventry would continue being Collingwood's leading goal kicker during the years 1931–1934, and would win his first and only, Copeland Trophy in 1933, where he kicked another 108 goals for the season.|$|E
