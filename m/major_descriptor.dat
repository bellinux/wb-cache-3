Each of three subjects had a distinctive percentage of responding cells (P less than 0. 01), greater after 22 hr culture than after 15 hr (P less than 0. 05) due to continued recruitment, but these values were unmodified by variation of the culture temperature in the range 35 degrees C [...] 39 degrees C. The incremental growth rate is the <b>major</b> <b>descriptor</b> of cellular growth and, not unexpectedly, each subject has a distinctive value (P less than 0. 01) which is greater after culture for 22 hr than after 15 hr (P less than 0. 05).

On the other hand, personality was classically found to be modulated in depression, with behavioral inhibition system (BIS) -related dimensions (namely harm avoidance (HA), neuroticism) showing higher scores in depressed subjects. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationships between emotional responsiveness (as measured by skin conductance response [SCR]) and personality in depression. METHODS: SCR was recorded following the presentation of neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant pictures in 20 depressed subjects and 20 controls. RESULTS: Pleasant pictures elicited more and larger responses than unpleasant ones in control but not in depressed subjects. This effect was not modulated by personality. Moreover, depressed subjects were found to show generally faster half-recovery times and to rate emotional pictures as less arousing than control subjects and these effects disappeared when BIS-related dimensions were controlled. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that BIS-related dimensions are independent from the specifically reduced responses to pleasant pictures, but are involved in the observed general affect reducing.

Complex networks exhibit some common topological features including small diameter, high degree of clustering, power-law degree distribution, and modularity.

We conducted the analysis on two networks, one constructed from all MeSH descriptors and another using only <b>major</b> <b>descriptors.</b> Network reduction was performed using the Pearson’s chi-square test for independence. To characterize topological properties of the network we adopted some specific measures, including diameter, average path length, clustering coefficient, and degree distribution. For the full MeSH network the average path length was 1. 95 with a diameter of three edges and clustering coefficient of 0. 26. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test rejects the power law as a plausible model for degree distribution. For the major MeSH network the average path length was 2. 63 edges with a diameter of seven edges and clustering coefficient of 0. 15. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test failed to reject the power law as a plausible model. The power-law exponent was 5. 07. In both networks it was evident that nodes with a lower degree exhibit higher clustering than those with a higher degree.

However, depending on the process operation conditions, several malfunctions could take place, in which filamentous bulking and deflocculation processes, such as pin-point flocs, are the most common problems, causing the sludge settling ability decrease and effluent quality deterioration. Bright field Image analysis is nowadays considered a powerful tool to quantitatively characterize aggregated and filamentous bacteria. Furthermore, the use of epifluorescent staining techniques, coupled to image analysis, presents a promising method to determine bacteria gram nature and viability. Encouraged by the success of image analysis procedures over the last years, the present work studied a lab-scale activated sludge system, under operation conditions causing filamentous bulking and pin-point flocs phenomena. Sludge settling ability and turbidity values were measured verifying the nature of the settling problem. COD contents, as well as nitrogen contents, in terms of N-NH 4 +, N-NO 3 - and N-NO 2 -, were surveyed in the feeding effluent, reactor bulk and settler. Regarding the biomass characterization, four <b>major</b> morphological <b>descriptors</b> groups were studied, covering free filamentous bacteria contents, aggregates contents, aggregates size and aggregates morphology.

In this paper, an invariant feature point matching algorithm is presented by introducing the Polar Complex Exponential Transform (PCET), {{a new kind of}} orthogonal moment reported recently. Similar to orthogonal complex moments, PCETs is defined on a circular domain. The magnitudes of PCETs are invariant to image rotation and scale. Furthermore, the PCETs are free of numerical instability, so they are more suitable for building shape descriptor. In this paper, the invariant properties of PCETs are investigated, and the accurate moments are selected elaborately. During similarity measurement，the cross correlation function is reconstructed by invariant PCET moments (IPCETs) combining both the magnitude and phase coefficients and maximized to match the control-point pairs.

40|$|Biological {{variation}} is commonly measured at two basic levels: variation within individual communities, {{and the distribution}} of variation over communities or within a metacommunity. We develop a classification for the measurement of biological variation on both levels: Within communities into the categories of dispersion and diversity, and within metacommunities into the categories of compositional differentiation and partitioning of variation. There are essentially two approaches to characterizing the distribution of trait variation over communities in that individuals with the same trait state or type tend to occur in the same community (describes differentiation tendencies), and individuals with different types tend to occur in different communities (describes apportionment tendencies). Both approaches can be viewed from the dual perspectives of trait variation distributed over communities (CT perspective) and community membership distributed over trait states (TC perspective). This classification covers most of the relevant descriptors (qualified measures) of biological variation, as is demonstrated with the help of <b>major</b> families of <b>descriptors.</b> Moreover, the classification is shown to open ways to develop new descriptors that meet current needs. Yet the classification also reveals the misclassification of some prominent and widely applied descriptors: Dispersion is often misclassified as diversity, particularly in cases where dispersion descriptor allow for the computation of effective numbers; the descriptor GST of population genetics is commonly misclassified as compositional differentiation and confused with partitioning-oriented differentiation, whereas it actually measures partitioning-oriented apportionment; descriptors of β-diversity are ambiguous about the differentiation effects they are supposed to represent and therefore require conceptual reconsideration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A local image {{descriptor}} robust to {{the common}} photometric transformations (blur, illumination, noise, and JPEG compression) and geometric transformations (rotation, scaling, translation, and viewpoint) is crucial to many image under-standing and computer vision applications. In this paper, the representation and matching power of region descriptors are to be evaluated. A common set of elliptical interest regions is {{used to evaluate the}} performance. The elliptical regions are further normalized to be circular with a fixed size. The normalized circular regions will become affine invariant up to a rotational ambiguity. Here, a new distinctive image descriptor to represent the normalized region is proposed, which primarily comprises the Zernike moment (ZM) phase information. An accurate and robust estimation of the rotation angle between a pair of normalized regions is then described and used to measure the similarity between two matching regions. The discriminative power of the new ZM phase descriptor is compared with five <b>major</b> existing region <b>descriptors</b> (SIFT, GLOH, PCA-SIFT, complex moments, and steerable filters) based on the precision-recall criterion. The experimental results, involving more than 15 million region pairs, indicate the proposed ZM phase descriptor has, generally speaking, the best performance under the common photometric and geometric transformations. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses on the descriptor performances are given to account for the performance discrepancy. First, the key factor for its striking performance {{is due to the fact}} that the ZM phase has accurate estimation accuracy of the rotation angle between two matching regions. Second, the feature dimensionality and feature orthogonality also affect the descriptor performance. Third, the ZM phase is more robust under the nonuniform image intensity fluctuation.

In 1981 Maria Calderisi 2 ̆ 7 s Music Publishing in the Canadas 1800 - 1867 was published. Both of these publications have prompted m e {{to embark on}} A Guide to Dating Nineteenth Century Music in Australia. Maria Calderisi produced her publication {{as a result of}} an M A project, and gave m e every encouragement to do the same for Australia. For the M A, I have covered only the cities of Melbourne and Sydney, and the rest of Australia will be covered in a further study. Music in the nineteenth century was almost never dated in any country, and as this represents Australia 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 early music, 2 ̆ 7 this is the period covered, from 1800 to 1899. For the purpose of this study, music refers to printed music which is published and which has as its raison d 2 ̆ 7 etre music in a notated form - that is music which is intended for performance and is called a musical score for bibliographic purposes. This study excludes other forms of music, such as music manuscripts, sound recordings and texts of musical works without music notation, such as some song books, h y m n books and librettos. It also excludes music printed in other publications such as newspapers, periodicals, programs, educational and church publications. The study tends not to emphasise music which is already dated, although it often furnishes essential information about its participants which in turn helps with the dating process of other items. Australian music in the nineteenth century which was dated often refers to specific events, some of which generated a flurry of musical works not all of which were dated. A s elsewhere, music reflected the social, historical and recreational activities of the time. Information from the music itself is the primary source for dating purposes, and so every element needs to be examined to see if it can assist in this process. The elements which help most in this work are not only those found in <b>major</b> bibliographic <b>descriptors,</b> such as composers 2 ̆ 7 and authors 2 ̆ 7 names, the title, place of publishing and publisher 2 ̆ 7 s name but also other elements which are frequently omitted in the cataloguing process, such as the printer 2 ̆ 7 s name and address, the publishers 2 ̆ 7 address, and the names of illustrators, lithographers, engravers, photographers, performers, dedicatees and any other people associated with the item. B y building up a matrix of all these variables, w e can possibly narrow down the period in which a work emerges. Guides to dating music frequently have at their core a directory of all or most of these major participants in the publishing and printing process, with names, descriptors, dates, addresses and changes of addresses. The directories for both Sydney and Melbourne form the core of this study. As well as using the music itself, the directory elements have been expanded from other sources such as city directories, newspapers and periodicals. They also contain a short biography of the major firms and a selection of the titles associated with each entry. Once these directories for both Sydney and Melbourne were completed, information from them and other sources was used to develop a narrative of the development of music publishing and printing in both Sydney and Melbourne. A short Chronology provides not only the sequence of events, but also the juxtaposition of those participants who were working at the same time...|$|R
