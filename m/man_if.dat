5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each <b>man.</b> <b>If</b> we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the <b>man</b> <b>if</b> they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E
25|$|Several playable {{characters}} {{also appear}} as boss battles throughout the game, such as battling Iron <b>Man</b> <b>if</b> the player chooses the Anti-Registration path, or facing Captain America on the Pro-Registration path. Other playables are unlocked by defeating them, such as Deadpool, Green Goblin and Venom.|$|E

With Roll's help, Mega Man {{makes his way to}} the center of the island and in the process releases a girl called Sera and her servant Geetz, both of whom go to the Sulphur Bottom. Geetz tells Bluecher and Barrel that the Mother lode can be accessed by means of four keys. Bluecher and Barrel ask Mega <b>Man</b> <b>if</b> he could retrieve the keys before the Pirates who heard their conversation with Geetz.|$|E
25|$|At the tribunal, Caspar's {{case was}} heard first. Caspar was {{suspended}} for four weeks. Coleman's defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation, the Players' Advocate Dan Minogue was thought {{to have made a}} good case for Coleman by arguing that any <b>man,</b> <b>if</b> he were a man at all, would hit back after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.|$|E
25|$|If {{the husband}} could show {{that his wife}} had been a bad wife, the Code allowed him to send her away, while he kept the {{children}} as well as her dowry; or he could degrade her to the position of a slave in his own house, where she would have food and clothing. The wife might bring an action against her husband for cruelty and neglect and, if she proved her case, obtain a judicial separation, taking her dowry with her. No other punishment fell on the <b>man.</b> <b>If</b> she did not prove her case, but was proved to be a bad wife, she was drowned.|$|E

25|$|Menstruating women {{suffered}} numerous restrictions. The Ashanti viewed them as ritually unclean. They did not {{cook for}} men, {{nor did they}} eat any food cooked for a <b>man.</b> <b>If</b> a menstruating woman entered the ancestral stool house, she was arrested, and the punishment was typically death. If this punishment is not exacted, the Ashanti believe, the ghost of the ancestors would strangle the chief. Menstruating women lived in special houses during their periods as they were forbidden to cross the threshold of men's houses. They swore no oaths and no oaths were sworn for or against them. They {{did not participate in}} any of the ceremonial observances and did not visit any sacred places.|$|E
25|$|Rousseau {{writes that}} the theatre, at first glance, {{is a form of}} amusement. Amusements are {{acceptable}} in moderation, when they are necessary, but they become a burden if they consume the minds of men enough to waste their time. The principle of the theatre is to please, it is not, Rousseau argues, functional because the characters are always distant from <b>man.</b> <b>If</b> the play is a comedy, for example, the content is undermined, and if it is tragic, the heroic ideals are exaggerated and placed {{out of the reach of}} man. Even if the play happens to portray moral ideals well, the awareness of the audience that it is a fiction does not do the ideas justice.|$|E
25|$|An accumulator, Butt {{works hard}} for his runs, not indulging {{in too many}} big hits; his {{statistics}} show the low number of 19 international sixes to date (1 September 2010) of which he's scored 10 in Twenty20 cricket, 7 in One-Day Internationals and only six in Test cricket. He scores {{a lot of his}} runs between backward point and extra cover. He uses his superb wrist work to angle the bat, placing the ball into gaps using the pace of the ball to his advantage; a very good technique for ODIs where it is best to keep the scoreboard ticking all the time. He also has the ability to cut the ball very fine down to third <b>man</b> <b>if</b> there are no slips, especially against spin bowlers, as he showed to great effect in his above-mentioned innings of 108 not out. These are his specialties, but he has large range of shots. However, many commentators have expressed that his defensive technique has flaws, and that he is prone to playing at balls outside off-stump which should be left.|$|E

25|$|Low {{offers to}} travel to Spacetime Six to show the aliens how to return, but this {{requires}} them to repower the portal that was used. They are able to retrieve two life crystals from a machine that generates them, but Low and Brink fight over the crystals, and Brink falls to his death. During the process of opening the portal, Robbins is killed. The player has the option of reviving Robbins with a life crystal after the portal is opened; however, if they do, she immediately jumps to her death, with no crystals left to revive her a second time. With no other options, Low uses the portal to meet {{the rest of the}} aliens in Spacetime Six; with the portal open, the aliens can perceive the route home and return to Cocytus. They restore Brink and Robbins to life and cure Brink of his addiction to the crystals, though this leaves him as an elderly <b>man.</b> <b>If</b> Low left Robbins dead, she is happy to see him, but if Low revived her, she is angry and scorns him. As promised, the aliens reconstruct a spacecraft for the humans, and representatives of the species join the humans as they return to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Qiao Xuan {{later became}} the Chancellor (相) of the Qi State (齊國; in present-day Shandong). He once {{committed}} an offence and was stripped off his post and sent to perform hard labour. After serving his sentence, {{he was allowed to}} rejoin the civil service and appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Shanggu Commandery (上谷郡) and later as the Administrator of Hanyang Commandery (漢陽郡). While he was in office, Qiao Xuan heard that Huangfu Zhen (皇甫禎), the Prefect (令) of Shanggui County (上邽縣), was guilty of corruption. He had Huangfu Zhen arrested, flogged, and head shaved bald. Huangfu Zhen later died in Ji County (兾縣). This incident shocked everyone in the region. Around the time, Qiao Xuan heard of Jiang Qi (姜岐), a famous man who lived in Shanggui County, and wanted to recruit him to join the civil service. Jiang Qi claimed that he was ill and declined. Qiao Xuan was angered, so he sent Yin Yi (尹益) to pressure Jiang Qi into agreeing. He threatened to make Jiang Qi's mother marry another <b>man</b> <b>if</b> he refused again. Yin Yi conveyed Qiao Xuan's threat to Jiang Qi but Jiang still declined and claimed that he was sick. The Counsellors (士大夫) in the commandery came to see Qiao Xuan and managed to persuade him to stop forcing Jiang Qi. This incident became the subject of jokes at the time. Qiao Xuan resigned on the grounds that he was ill. Shortly after, he joined the civil service again as a Chief Clerk (長史) to the Excellency of Works (司徒). He was subsequently promoted to Court Architect (將作大匠).|$|E

500|$|A truce {{between the}} Klings was snuffed {{out by the}} budding match. Amos {{believed}} that the Hardings had African American blood, and was also offended by Harding's editorial stances. He started to spread rumors of Harding's supposed black heritage and encouraged local businessmen to boycott Harding's business interests. When Harding found out what Kling was doing, he warned Kling [...] "that he would beat the tar out of the little <b>man</b> <b>if</b> he didn't cease".|$|E
500|$|Despite these findings, {{baseball}} historians still credit Walker {{with being}} {{the first in the}} major leagues to play openly as a black man. On the subject of White, John R. Husman wrote: [...] "He played baseball and lived his life as a white <b>man.</b> <b>If</b> White, who was also of white blood, said he was white and he was not challenged, he was white in his time and circumstances". To clear up the confusion between Walker and Robinson, Husman also pointed out that, while the two ball players endured their own trials with racism in baseball, Walker undoubtedly preceded Robinson in the major leagues.|$|E
500|$|Alexander's {{parents were}} not so happy about the match. Sophia disapproved of her son marrying a commoner, while Constantine wanted a delay but was {{prepared}} to be his son's best <b>man</b> <b>if</b> Alexander would be patient. Alexander visited Paris {{at the end of}} 1918, raising hopes among his family that {{they would be able to}} contact him once he was outside Greece. When Queen Sophia attempted to telephone her son in his Parisian hotel, a minister intercepted the call and informed her that [...] "His Majesty is sorry, but he cannot respond to the telephone". He was not even informed that she had called.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{includes}} {{a variety of}} cultural references. Among Smithers' paintings of Burns is a parody of a photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin riding a horse while bare-chested. Smithers likens Homer, Lenny and Carl to The Three Stooges, and Homer chooses Smithers' potential partners via the gay dating app Grindr. At the party, George Takei asks another <b>man</b> <b>if</b> {{he wants to hear}} [...] "horror stories" [...] about his Star Trek co-star William Shatner, and he is pleased that the man does not know who Shatner is. A billboard outside the school's production of Casablanca advertises that the kindergarten are putting on a production of zoophilia-themed play Equus the following night. [...] The end sequence with the treasure hunt pays homage to Bogart's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and The African Queen.|$|E
500|$|Explaining Church {{teaching}} of this commandment, Kreeft cites Saint Thomas Aquinas, who wrote, [...] "An evil desire {{can only be}} overcome by a stronger good desire." [...] The US Bishops suggest {{that this can be}} achieved through cultivation of goodwill, humility and gratitude for one's own and others' blessings, while trusting in God's grace. Kreeft explains that Saint Paul the Apostle illustrated the concept in his letter to the Philippians when he listed his worldly credentials as a respected Jew and stated, [...] "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord." [...] As Jesus stated, [...] "What shall it profit a <b>man</b> <b>if</b> he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own [...] Church teaching on the tenth commandment is directed toward this same attitude toward worldly goods, termed [...] "poverty of spirit".|$|E
500|$|In Odd Girl Out, Laura Landon's {{resistance}} {{to the idea that}} she may be homosexual lies in her own concept of femininity rather than any repugnance for loving women. In I Am a Woman, the second book in the series, Beebo's butch appearance [...] "seems to alternately terrify and attract Laura", leading to a very erotic physical relationship. However, when Laura lashes out at Beebo in a moment of self-pity, it is her masculinity that Laura attacks, invalidating Beebo's uniqueness and the core of her desirability violently. In the book that exhibits the most self-destruction in the series, Women in the Shadows, Laura expresses shame when accompanying Beebo outside of Greenwich Village, fearing Beebo will be arrested and jailed. Facing the end of their relationship, Beebo expresses the desire to be a <b>man,</b> <b>if</b> only to be able to marry Laura to give her a normal life.|$|E
