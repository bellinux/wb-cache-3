5|$|In February 2012, {{to address}} the Doxil shortage, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed for the {{temporary}} importation of Lipodox, which contains the same active ingredient as Doxil and is made by Sun Pharma Global FZE (Sun), a subsidiary of India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. The agency said it intends to continue allowing the importation of Lipodox until Sun has <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> generic Doxil to meet demand.|$|E
5|$|The Moldavians {{made the}} first move by sending musicians {{to the middle of}} the valley. The sound of drums and bugles made Suleiman think that the entire Moldavian army awaited him there. Instead, the centre of the valley held the Székely forces and the Moldavian {{professional}} army, which were ordered to make a slow retreat when they encountered the enemy. Suleiman ordered his troops to advance and, when they <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> progress, the Moldavian artillery started to fire, followed by archers and handgunners firing from three different directions. The archers could not see the enemy for the fog, and, instead, had to follow the noise of their footsteps. The Moldavian light cavalry then helped to lure the Ottoman troops into the valley by making hit-and-run attacks. Ottoman cavalry tried to cross the wooden bridge, causing it to collapse. Those Ottoman soldiers who had managed to survive the attacks from the artillery and the archers, and who did not get caught in the marshes, had to confront the Moldavian army, together with the Székely soldiers further up the valley. The 5,000 Székely soldiers were successful in repelling the 7,000 Ottoman infantrymen. Thereafter, they made a slow retreat, as instructed by Stephen, but were later routed by the Ottoman sipahi, while the remaining Ottoman infantry attacked the Moldavian flanks.|$|E
25|$|Designed for 50 men, it was {{initially}} home to six {{who met the}} criteria of being at least 65 years old, Protestant and residents of New York State. It continued to operate below capacity until 1903, when the death of Matthew Vassar's widow <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> money available.|$|E

25|$|Discharged {{from the}} Navy at the war's end, Touhy married Clara Morgan in Chicago in 1923. Determined to remain honest, he became first a cab driver, then an {{automobile}} salesman. His auto sales career was successful, and he <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> money {{to form a}} trucking company in Des Plaines with his brothers Tommy and Eddie.|$|E
25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe {{needed some}} getting out. He {{was a great}} battler for England and for Yorkshire. He never gave his wicket away unless he was {{satisfied}} he had <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> already. With Percy Holmes he formed just about the finest opening partnership I bowled against. I got him out cheaply a few times, but he scored a few hundreds against my bowling, so I reckon we ended up just about square.|$|E

His 600 men took cover behind boulders and fallen trees and <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> of a racket to dissuade Whitaker's men from moving against them. By this time Pettus's brigade of three Alabama regiments had descended from the summit and came to Walthall's assistance after 2 p.m.|$|E
25|$|After the Lamborghinis are {{seized by}} his creditor, Charlie finds himself $80,000 {{in the hole}} and hatches a plan to return to Las Vegas, which they passed the night before, and win money at {{blackjack}} by counting cards. Though the casino bosses are skeptical that anyone can count cards with a six deck shoe, after reviewing security footage they ask Charlie and Raymond to leave. Charlie has <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> to cover his debts and has reconciled with Susanna who rejoined them in Las Vegas.|$|E
25|$|Grand Trunk Railway Depot. The depot, {{which is}} now part of the Port Huron Museum, is where 12-year-old Thomas Edison {{departed}} daily on the Port Huron– Detroit run. In 1859, the railroad's first year of operation, Edison convinced the railroad company to let him sell newspapers and confections on the daily trips. He became so successful that he soon placed two newsboys on other Grand Trunks running to Detroit. He <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> money to support himself and to buy chemicals and other experimental materials.|$|E

25|$|In 1916, Stout {{tired of}} writing a story {{whenever}} he needed money. He decided to stop writing until he had <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> money to support himself through other means, {{so that he would}} be able to write when and as he pleased. He wrote no fiction for more than a decade, until the late 1920s, when he had saved substantial money through his school banking system. Ironically, just as Stout was starting to write fiction again, he lost most of the money that he had made as a businessman in the Depression of 1929.|$|E
25|$|John Brown {{was born}} in Sheffield in 1816, {{the son of a}} slater. At the age of 14, unwilling to follow his father's plans for him to become a draper, he {{obtained}} a position as an apprentice with Earle Horton & Co. The company subsequently entered the steel business and at the age of 21, John Brown with the backing of his father and uncle obtained a bank loan for £500 to enable him to become the company's sales agent. He was so successful, he <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> money to set up his own business, the Atlas Steel Works.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} riding horses of the cavalry {{detachment}} and officers, {{a large number}} of draught horses belonged to the artillery and military engineers for ensuring supplies. In case of emergency or when large-scale transport was necessary, contracts were signed with private haulage companies. Just the mill in the Cavalier Camus, which <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> flour daily for 1,500 portions of bread, required 24 horses to operate. For the rapid reinforcement of endangered fortress sections or to support a breakout, horsed units of artillery were ready. In 1859, Luxembourg had eight horse guns with 38 horses. There was also a need for additional horses to transport the ammunition, as well as for riding and as reserves.|$|E

25|$|An {{ice cream}} maker is a machine {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market it herself. Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.|$|E
25|$|The Gunston {{character}} was originally conceived by comedy writer Wendy Skelcher and first {{appeared as a}} minor character to appear in a single sketch in the second series of the cult Australian TV comedy series The Aunty Jack Show in 1973. Cast member Garry McDonald portrayed Gunston as a dull and talentless local TV reporter from the industrial city of Wollongong – a locale that was the butt of many jokes throughout the series. The Gunston character <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> of an impression {{for him to be}} revived in a subsequent comedy mini-series made by the Aunty Jack team, Wollongong the Brave (1974), in which he starred in a satirical mock documentary Norman Gunston: The Golden Weeks. His segments as Norman in What's On In Wollongong {{became one of the most}} popular parts of the Aunty Jack Show, and Norman appeared on the Aunty Jack Sings Wollongong album along with McDonald's other character, Kid Eager.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 1869, James and Sarah {{had another}} son, James Rowland Angell, who later served as {{president}} of Yale University. That same year, the University of Michigan offered Angell its presidency following the resignation of Erastus Haven. He visited Ann Arbor with his wife, but felt that he owed it to his supporters in Vermont to stay on with the University of Vermont. The offer was repeated in 1871, his former teacher Henry S. Frieze having served as acting president in the meantime. This time, Angell felt that the University of Vermont had <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> progress that he could leave it in good conscience, and he accepted the offer. He made a trip to Ann Arbor to deliver his inaugural address at Commencement on June 28, 1871, then returned to Vermont to finish out the academic term before moving his family to Ann Arbor for good in September of that year.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E
500|$|Falle's pimp {{kept her}} imprisoned {{for the years}} that he prostituted her, and trafficked her across Canada to Edmonton, Vancouver, and Kelowna. Falle later said of herself and the other women in {{prostitution}} she knew, [...] "I couldn't admit that I was not there by choice. We couldn't live in our own skin if we admitted that. We needed {{to believe that it}} was our choice." [...] Falle's pimp told her he would marry her if she <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> money for him through prostitution. When she had made the amount of money her pimp required, she was 17 years old. The two got married that year.|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever <b>made</b> <b>enough</b> songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E
