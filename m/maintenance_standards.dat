500|$|Along {{with all}} the Gresley 3-cylinder types, the Pacifics {{suffered}} from low wartime <b>maintenance</b> <b>standards,</b> conditions for which {{they had not been}} designed. Gresley's sudden death in 1941 and an unsympathetic successor, Edward Thompson, did not help matters in this respect. In 1945 Thompson took the opportunity to rebuild the first of Gresley's A1 Pacifics, Great Northern, to the LNER Class A1/1 specification with divided drive and separate valve gear for the inside cylinder. [...] Thompson intended to rebuild to this configuration all the Gresley A1s that had not been converted to A3 standard; in the meantime the remaining Gresley A1s were reclassified as A10s. [...] The rebuilding of these locomotives as A1/1 never happened. [...] Instead, the conversion to A3 standard continued. [...] The A1/1 was at first classified as A1, and reclassified as A1/1 when Arthur Peppercorn [...] designed and constructed his own Class A1s in 1947.|$|E

40|$|During {{the winter}} 1993 / 94, the Swedish National Road Administration {{received}} considerable criticism for its winter maintenance {{and in particular}} for the high consumption if road salt. This led to discussions on changing the rules for winter maintenance. Some ice or snow was temporary allowed on the roads with high winter <b>maintenance</b> <b>standard.</b> More roads were degraded to lower winter <b>maintenance</b> <b>standard</b> where ice or snow were permanently permitted. In addition, certain changes intended to influence driver behaviour and vehicle equipment for example mandating the use of winter tyres were to be studied. The purpose of the first investigation described in this paper was to calculate the socio-economic consequences that may be expected from a requirement on winter tyres in various circumstances. In the second investigation in this paper the traffic safety effect of the requirement is studied. A requirement of using winter tyres when it is slippery was selected based on facts from the first investigation...|$|R

Life management of power transformer should include research of fault diagnostic, monitor methods and insulation reclamation to extend life, and establish life model of power transformer. Life management of power transformer should not only consider the fault model, quantitative assessment of the relevant remnant withstands strengths of transformers and operational stresses, but also establish the <b>maintenance</b> <b>standard</b> for power transformer...|$|R
