Includes bibliographical refences. An {{efficient}} and accurate {{computer aided design}} (CAD) software for the electromagnetic simulation of passive microwave components, fabricated in planar stratified media, is developed in this work. The numerical technique employed in this software {{is based on the}} spatial-domain method of moments (MoM) in conjunction with the closed-form Green’s functions. Since the computational efficiency is a major issue in CAD softwares, the spatial-domain MoM is significantly improved in this respect {{with the use of the}} closed-form Green’s functions and closed-form expressions for the MoM matrix entries. Vertical <b>metalizations</b> in the form of via holes and shorting pins, which are the indispensable parts of the most microwave circuits, are also modeled very efficiently and incorporated into this formulation.

40|$|Future {{synthetic}} aperture radar antennas will be significantly more sophisticated than their earlier counterparts, requiring enhanced electrical capabilities such as operation at multiple frequencies with multiple polarization ability, as well as desirable non-electrical features such as light weight, easy and reliable deployability, and low cost. The present paper describes {{the results of a}} prototype SAR array developed with these considerations in mind. This paper will describe the development of a dual-frequency array operating at L and C bands, with dual linear polarization capability at both bands. Unlike most earlier dual-band arrays, this array shares the same radiating aperture for both bands and both polarizations, resulting the smallest possible aperture area for a given gain specification. A critical constraint in this project was a requirement for an extremely light weight package, leading to the use of foam substrates with thin dielectric membranes for <b>metalizations</b> of the radiating elements and feed networks...|$|R

Cylindrical or “tube” transducers are often used, which have <b>metalization</b> on {{the inner and outer}} walls of the structure. In normal operation, an alternating current (AC) electrical signal generated by the drive/timing electronics is impressed across the two <b>metalization</b> layers. This voltage creates stress in the material, which in turn cause the transducer to emit an acoustic signal or “ping”, which emanates outward {{from the surface of the}} tube. An acoustic “ping” can be detected by specialized receivers, and processed using advanced signal processing techniques to determine if a fish swimming into the reception area carries a specific acoustic tag.|$|E

The LPCVD process allows the passive components to be fabricated at temperatures higher than their highest operating temperatures. The deposition of thin films by LPCVD is accomplished by reacting one or more gases {{on the surface of}} a heated substrate. The substrates to be coated are placed on a graphite susceptor and then loaded into the center of a quartz reaction tube. The RF power is applied to the coil {{on the outside of the}} reaction tube which in turn is coupled into the graphite susceptor causing it to heat. Pressures of several torr or less are typical, with carrier flow rates of 0. 1 to 2. 0 liters/min. Nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium are typical carrier gases.

In this dissertation we look more closely at requirements for indoor antenna connectivity with particular focus on the signal to noise ratio needed to overcome fading in multi-path channels. A new analytical channel model, including multipath scattering, is proposed and adapted to determine antenna requirements. These requirements are then used to develop realistic signal to noise ratios for Silicon-based Radio Frequency (RF) front ends.

40|$|InP/InGaAsP weakly {{confined}} wave guides, are {{of interest}} for the fabrication {{of a variety of}} optoelectronic devices, including optical cross point switches. Previous studies have shown that stress from metallization alters the behavior of these waveguides and the strain-induced changes in refractive index have been investigated by studying the degree of polarization (DOP) from the facets of ridge waveguide (RWG) lasers. However, in devices intended for waveguide routing or switching, (where the degree of confinement is much weaker than that found in ridge waveguide lasers), e-beam deposited TiPtAu contacts, caused broadening and splitting of the optical near field mode profile after thermal annealing and increased waveguide loss. In this paper, we report the results of a study of process-induced changes on the optical near field mode profile, for different dielectric depositions, <b>metalizations</b> and anneal cycles. It was found that the addition of a layer of sputtered W to the e-beam metal stack provided sufficient compressive stress to balance the (otherwise) tensile stress from the TiPtAu. This not only eliminated the mode splitting, but for sufficiently high values of compressive stress, was found to actually sharpen the mode and enhance the guiding. On the basis of these results stable waveguides, suitable for routing or switching were achieved for a range of device parameters, operating conditions and process parameter variations.

The OLEDs are deposited directly on the top metal layer. The metal layer serves as electrode and defines the bright area. Furthermore, the area below the electrodes {{can be used for}} integrated circuits. Due to efficient emitter with low operating voltage it is possible to renounce high-voltage devices depending on selected CMOS process. Thus manufg. cost can be further reduced.

Similar fabrication techniques were applied to produce ring lasers coupled to Fabry-Perot cavities, with various diameters ranging from 50 to 1400 //m. Device characterization was done by means of photoluminescence, currentvoltage, current-power measurements, and electroluminescence. Photoluminescence was used for checking the lasing wavelength. Current-voltage and current-power measurements were done to investigate the serial resistances, threshold currents, and differential quantum efficiencies of the fabricated devices with various cavity lengths. From these measurements, the threshold current densities, the internal quantum efficiencies, and the internal net optical losses were obtained.

40|$|International audienceSilicon carbide (SiC) power devices {{can operate}} at much higher {{temperature}} than their silicon counterparts. This enabled {{the design of}} power electronics converters for environments in which the ambient temperature can reach or exceed 200 °C. For example, jet engine controls or brake actuation for aircrafts, or the down-hole converters for geothermal or gas exploration. Another way of taking advantage of this high junction temperature capability of SiC devices is to save on their thermal management system: using a less efficient (but smaller and lighter) cooling system, and let the junction temperature reach elevated levels, even with a moderated ambient temperature. As a seminconducting material, SiC can in theory operate up to 1000 °C. Many additional limitations, however, {{must be taken into}} account : melting of the contact <b>metalizations,</b> degradation of the secondary passivation layer [...] . Furthermore, for unipolar devices, the thermal run-away phenomenon must be considered: with these devices, the conduction losses increase dramatically with their junction temperature. At some point, they can exceed the cooling capability of the associated thermal management system, and the device becomes unstable. To build a functional converter, many other aspects must be investigated: passive devices, gate drivers, packaging [...] . High temperature has a strong influence on the converter design, as not all technologies are compatible with this requirement: very few capacitors or encapsulating materials can be found to operate above 200 °C. For more ambitious goals (more than 250 °C), the design alternatives are even fewer. In many cases, the increase in the maximum operating temperature is associated with wider temperature swings (e. g. for aircraft applications, the ambient temperature can go from - 55 °C to more than 200 °C). This increased thermal cycling generates higher mechanical stresses in the packaging (because of the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the various materials of the package). This has a detrimental consequence on reliability...|$|R

50|$|Conversely, the {{substrate}} does affect the electric field, so that {{the substrate}} side contributes a larger capacitance across the slots than does the air side. Electric charge can accumulate or be depleted more readily on the substrate face of the conductors than on the air face. As a result, at those points on the wave where the current reverses direction, charge will spill over {{the edges of the}} <b>metalization</b> between the air face and the substrate face.

50|$|An {{external}} {{voltage divider}} {{is used to}} apply 100 volts to the acceleration optics (for electron detection), each MCP, {{the gap between the}} MCPs, and the backside of the last MCP and the collector (anode). The last voltage dictates the time of flight of the electrons and in this way the pulse-width. The anode is a 0.4 mm thick plate with an edge of 0.2 mm radius to avoid high field strengths. It is just large enough to cover the active area of the MCP, because the backside of the last MCP and the anode act as a capacitor with 2 mm separation and large capacitance slows down the signal. The positive charge in the MCP s positive charge in the backside <b>metalization.</b> A hollow torus conducts this {{around the edge of the}} anode plate. A torus is the optimum compromise between low capacitance and short path and for similar reasons usually no dielectric (Markor) is placed into this region. After a 90° turn of the torus it is possible to attach a large coaxial waveguide. A taper permits minimizing the radius so that an SMA connector can be used. To save space and make the impedance match less critical, the taper is often reduced to a small 45° cone on the backside of the anode plate.|$|E
