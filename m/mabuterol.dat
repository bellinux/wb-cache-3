40|$|Onderzoek is verricht naar de toepasbaarheid van {{cryotrapping}} gaschromatografie-Fourier transform infrarood spectrometrie (GC-FTIR) als bevestigingsmethode bij de 'selected ion' GC-MS analyse van beta-agonisten in monsters kalfslever en urine. Clenbuterol, Salbutamol, <b>Mabuterol,</b> Bromobuterol, Cimaterol, Cimbuterol en Mapenterol werden gedetecteerd als trimethylsilyl- en als methylboronzuur derivaten. Gebruik van methylboronzuur als derivatiseringsreagens leidt voor zowel standaarden als monsterextracten tot een aanzienlijke verlaging van de chemische achtergrond in de GC-FTIR chromatogrammen. De identificatiegrens van de methode voor methylboron-zuur gederivatiseerde beta-agonisten is circa 1 nanogram per microliter geinjecteerd extract, hetgeen overeenkomt met 3 - 8 ppb in het oorspronkelijke monster. De overeenkomst tussen analyt- en referentiespectrum, in combinatie met de retentietijd, is een bruikbaar bevestigingscriterium. Cryotrapping gas chromatography-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry {{has been}} used for confirmatory analysis of the beta-agonists Clenbuterol, Salbutamol, <b>Mabuterol,</b> Bromobuterol, Cimaterol, Cimbuterol and Mapenterol in samples of calf urine and liver following gas chromatography-selected ion detection mass spectrometry. Samples were analysed for their trimethylsilyl- and methylboronate-derivatives. Methylboronate derivatization yielded strongly diminished chemical background and interference levels in the IR chromatograms of both standard and sample extracts. The limit of identification for methylboronate derivatives is approximately 1 ng/mul in extracts, which corresponds to 3 - 8 ppb in incurred samples. The similarity of analyte and reference spectra, together with the retention time, are useful criteria for confirmation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{usefulness}} of cryotrapping gas chromatography-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (GC-FTIR) for the residue {{analysis of the}} beta-agonists clenbuterol, <b>mabuterol</b> and salbutamol in bovine urine and tissues has been evaluated. It is demonstrated that the technique is able to detect and identify the trimethylsilyl derivatives of these compounds in urine and liver extracts of veal calves and cattle. The obtained limit of identification is approximately 1 nanogram per microliter extract injected on column which is equivalent to 2. 5 microgram per liter or kilogram of the original sample. It is anticipated that the technique may develop as a valuable method for univocal confirmation {{of the presence of}} residues, particularly in addition to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) ...|$|E
40|$|In several "black-market" {{used for}} growth {{promotion}} preparations new compounds were found {{belonging to the}} group of N-phenylethanolamines with structures very similar to compounds known to be used for veal calf and cattle production, the so called beta-agonists. The two most important compounds are "mapenterol", closely related to <b>mabuterol</b> and "cimbuterol", closely related to cimaterol. Each time the "new" compound differs in the aliphatic moiety of the molecule in that one H-atom is substituted for a methyl group. Confirmation of the identity of the structures is based on their low resolution mass spectra, behaviour in the analytical system and in part on the NMR- and FTIR spectra. Moreover, identical compiunds were found by other Benelux-research institutes. The compounds are currently being synthesized. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} competitive solid‐phase {{enzyme immunoassay}} {{for the detection}} of tert‐butylic beta‐agonist drugs was developed. An antiserum was raised in rabbits against the diazo‐conjugate of clenbuterol and the human serum albumin. In the assay, the anticlenbuterol antibody was incubated with the salbutamol‐enzyme conjugate and unlabelled standard or samples in microtitre wells precoated with affinity‐purified antirabbit IgG. The absolute detection limit for clenbuterol and <b>mabuterol</b> was 0. 3 ng/ml (15 pg/well) and 50 % relative binding at 1. 0 ng/ml (50 pg/well). The absolute detection limits for salbutamol and terbutaline were 0. 9 and 1. 3 ng/ml, respectively. The cross‐reactivity of iso‐propylic parent compounds was quite low (< 1 %). Urine and sera were tested without any extraction step. Sample blanks (96 urine and 76 sera from five different sources) showed low matrix effect, suggesting a limit of decision for bovine urine of 0. 6 ng/ml clenbuterol equivalent. Mean recoveries of clenbuterol in spiked urine and serum samples ranged from 90 to 120 % (mean recovery 96 %). Comparative analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that false negative results do not occur. The assay is simple, rapid, sensitive, multiresidual, reliable and cost‐effective. The test is adaptable to high sample throughput laboratories as well as field test for rapid screening of a few samples in slaughterhouses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the determination of priority β-agonists in urine based on a fully automated sample preparation procedure using the online TurboFlow™ chromatography clean-up step and determination on the Orbitrap™ mass analyzer technology. The principle of the method is the enrichment of the β-agonists after enzymatic hydrolysis over night on a small column packed with a special stationary phase (TurboFlow™) while flushing away sample matrix and interfering compounds. Thereafter the analytes are transferred onto an analytical column and detected by liquid chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry in full scan mode at a resolution of R= 50, 000 FWHM (full width at half maximum) and in HCD (Higher Energy Collisional Dissociation) scan mode at a resolving power of 10, 000 FWHM. The optimization of {{each step of the}} method, such as selection of the TurboFlowTM and analytical column as well as sample loading and elution parameters were performed using a standard solution containing salbutamol, clenbuterol and <b>mabuterol</b> at a concentration of 100 µg/L. The developed automated sample preparation significantly improved the throughput and efficiency of the previous used screening method and resulted in a considerable reduction in analysis time. Validation experiments including 24 β-agonists in urine gave decision limits (CCα) between 0. 05 - 0. 35 ug/L. The repeatability of analyses for urine samples spiked at 0. 5 ug/L was within the range of 5 - 26 % and recoveries for all compounds were found to be within 89 - 107 %...|$|E
40|$|Solid-phase {{extraction}} {{techniques were}} evaluated for {{the extraction of}} P-agomsts from biological matrices prior to determination by radioimmunoassay. Clenbuterol was extracted from aqueous liver homogenates using a combmation of on-column liquid/liquid partitioning coupled to a silica sohd-phase extraction step following initial enzymatic digestion of the liver sample. The procedure was validated at fortification levels of 0 2 and 0 4 ppb clenbuterol Recovery of clenbuterol was greater than 60 % at both concentrations. Four P-agomsts were extracted from bovine unne and liver samples using mixed-mode sohd-phase extraction columns. The procedure was validated for clenbuterol, <b>mabuterol,</b> salbutamol and terbutalme at levels of 2 and 5 ppb. The mean recovery for the P-agomsts from liver and unne was greater than 75 % and 85 %, respectively. The limit of detection was 0 13 ng/ml and 0 46 ng/g of clenbuterol in unne and liver, respectively. Clenbuterol and salbutamol were extracted from bovine liver samples using a mixed-mode matnx sohd-phase dispersion/ion exchange procedure. Four types of sorbent were mvestigated m order to determine which sorbent combined most effectively with the ion exchange matenal in retaining the P-agomsts Recovery of clenbuterol and salbutamol from liver samples fortified at 50 ppb was greater than 80 %, the resulting extracts were insufficiently punfied to allow for determination of Pagomsts at low or sub-ppb levels An enzymatic hydrolysis step was required for the determination of conjugated residues of salbutamol m incurred liver samples...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of drugs}} to improve animal growth is banned in the European Union. Nevertheless, illegal use has been {{demonstrated}} in several countries and Member States have to run extensive control programs {{to ensure that the}} ban is respected. The aim of this work was to explore the possibility of using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensors to develop fast and robust screening assays for hormones and ß-agonists. Modified standard procedures for hapten synthesis were employed to immobilise stable analyte specific sensor chip surfaces used for analysis. Sensor chips for clenbuterol, ethinylestradiol and trenbolone gave assays with IC 50 values in the region of 0. 5 ng/ml. Sample matrix interference from urine and serum with the antibody-antigen interaction and non-specific binding from samples to the sensor surface was systematically studied. Strategies to minimise these effects were investigated and described. Biosensor assays for clenbuterol in bovine hair and urine, suitable for routine use, were developed and validated. For hair, a sandwich assay format was used. A rapid and simple extraction using 100 mM NaOH was developed, and the assay was validated by analysis of hair samples from animals treated with clenbuterol. The critical factor for assay sensitivity was non-specific binding to the sensor chip surface from hair extracts, which was controlled by ultrafiltration of samples and by the use of a secondary antibody. The limit of detection (LOD) of the hair assay was 10 ng/ml. In the urine assay, the cross-reaction for several ß-agonists, including salbutamol, <b>mabuterol</b> and brombuterol was high, enabling detection of concentrations below 1 ng/ml. Analysis of these low analyte concentrations in urine without sample pre-treatment was limited by high sample-to-sample variation, inhibition of antibody binding to the surface and occasional non-specific binding. A rapid and simple sample clean-up using integrated immunofiltration was developed to minimise these sample matrix effects. With this method, at least 48 samples could be processed and analysed by one person in one working day...|$|E
