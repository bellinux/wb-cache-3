40|$|The morphology, {{incidence}} {{and distribution of}} hyaline cells in ten cases each of pleomorphic adenoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, adeno-carcinoma and <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumour</b> were studied by conventional light microscopy. Results showed that the hyaline cells were identified in 60 % of pleomorphic adenoma and in 20 % of mucoepidermoid tumours, but were absent in adenoid cystic carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Relative area estimation of hyaline cells in pleo-morphic adenomas showed that this may range from 2. 2 % to 30. 4 % of the total tumour area. The usefulness of the hyaline cell as a diagnostic criteria in distinguishing between some of the salivarygland tumours wasalso discussed...|$|E
40|$|IT is now {{generally}} agreed that classification of mucous gland tumours on histological grounds is a useful procedure since {{the various types of}} tumour bear differing prognoses. Though there is still lack of unanimity with regard to details of nomenclature, most pathologists and clinicians would probably agree to the recognition of the following neoplasms as distinct entities. 1. Mixed tumours. -These are the neoplasms traditionally described as "mixed salivary tumours ". Typically, they consist of an epithelial component intimately associated with mucoid or myxochondroid interce]lular material. 2. <b>Mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumours.</b> -The neoplasms described by Stewart, Foote and Becker (1945), consisting of epidermoid and mucus-secreting elements. 3. Cylindromas. -Tumours of characteristic architecture, to be described in this paper. 4. Glandular, squamous and other carcinomas. -Frank carcinomas...|$|R
40|$|The {{child was}} extubated 2 days after surgery. The {{post-operative}} course was uncomplicated, chest drains were removed {{on the fifth}} day following surgery and, on the seventh day after surgery, the child was discharged from the hospital in an excel-lent general state. The final pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of primary low-grade polypoid mucoepidermoid carcinoma originating broadly from the trachea, without the in-volvement of the surgical margins. No evidence of metastatic mucoepidermoid carcinoma was identified in the five paratra-cheal lymph nodes that were excised. Follow-up 2 years after surgery is normal and the child is today <b>tumour</b> free.

40|$|Background. Tracheo-bronchial and {{vascular}} sleeve procedures {{represent an}} effective surgical therapy for benign lesions, tumours of low-grade malignancy and bronchogenic carcinoma in selected patients. Methods. From January 1980 to August 2002, 248 patients underwent sleeve procedures. We performed 195 bronchial sleeves and 53 tracheo-bronchial sleeves: 39 cases of sleeve lobectomy (SL) had vascular plasty associated, five {{of whom were}} arterial sleeve resection. Histological examination revealed 178 squamous carcinomas, 24 adenocarcinomas, 5 small cells carcinomas, 5 large cell carcinomas, 1 adenosquamous carcinomas, 25 bronchial carcinoids (19 typical and 6 atypical), 4 <b>mucoepidermoid</b> <b>tumours,</b> 4 adenoid-cystic carcinoma, 1 metastatic tumours, 1 bronchial stenosis post lung transplantation. 123 patients had N 0 disease, 75 had N 1 disease and 50 patients had N 2 disease. In bronchial carcinoid disease 5 patients had N+. 106 patients had preoperative and/or postoperative irradiation/CT; 14 patients with carcinoid tumours underwent preoperative LASER-therapy. In 125 patients we used a perianastomotic pedicled flap. Results. 48 patients (19. 3...|$|R
40|$|Metastatic parotid tumours in {{the skull}} are very rare. An {{interesting}} {{case of a}} <b>mucoepidermoid</b> parotid <b>tumour</b> metastasizing to the skull vault is described in a patient who had previously been operated for a pituitary adenoma 20 years back with no post operative radiotherapy; however, she required hormonal supplementation therapy. She underwent an operation for a parotid tumour 7 years ago and received postoperative radiotherapy for the parotid tumour away {{from the site of}} the skull metastases. No local recurrence of the parotid tumour was noted. The initial diagnosis was that of a solitary intradiploic meningioma. Interesting clinico-radiological findings are presented...|$|R
40|$|Differentially {{expressed}} {{genes in}} various benign and malignant salivary gland tumours {{were identified by}} use of cDNA microarrays containing 19, 000 human expressed sequence tags. Samples were derived from 5 patients with pleomorphic adenoma, 4 with Warthin’s tumour, one with clear cell carcinoma, and 2 with <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma. <b>Tumours</b> were classified by using a subset of 486 genes. Benign Warthin’s tumour and pleomorphic adenoma showed very distinctive gene expression patterns. A total of 133 genes differentiated the single malignant clear cell carcinoma from non-tumour salivary glands (p < 0. 01), whereas only 16 genes separated it from the highly related benign pleomorphic adenoma (p < 0. 01). A total of 57 cDNAs were associated with mucoepidermoid carcinoma (p < 0. 01). The results show gene expression alterations common to all tumours and unique to each benign and malignant tumour. The numerous Expressed Sequence Tags of unknown function we identified could also become useful as tumour markers and represent a set of novel tumour-associated genes...|$|R

Material and methodsThe study is analysis of 531 patients with parotid gland tumours in patients treated in ENT Department during 1986 – 2006. We analysed surgical treatment and intraoperative tumour stage. The results of histological diagnosis were presented. ResultsThe frequency of incidence of benign neoplasm was 80 %. The most frequent tumour was pleomorphic adenoma – 75 % and adenolymphoma – 16 %. Malignant tumours constituted 20 % of all gland <b>tumours.</b> <b>Mucoepidermoid</b> (27 %) and adenoid cyst (22 %) carcinomas were the most common malignant tumour.

40|$|Salivary gland tumours are a {{group of}} lesions whose {{heterogeneity}} of biological and pathological features is widely reflected in the molecular aspect. This is demonstrated by {{an increasing number of}} studies in the field of genetics of these tumours. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect the most significant scientific reports on the cytogenetic and molecular data concerning these tumours, which might facilitate the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The analysis covered 71 papers included in the PubMed database. We focused on the most common tumours, such as pleomorphic adenoma, Warthin <b>tumour,</b> <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma, and others. The aim of this study is to present current knowledge about widely explored genotypic alterations (such as PLAG 1 gene in pleomorphic adenoma or MECT 1 gene in mucoepidermoid carcinoma), and also about rare markers, like Mena or SOX 10 protein, which might also be associated with tumourigenesis and carcinogenesis of these tumours...|$|R
40|$|This {{multicentre}} study involved 28 Italian ORL Centres {{responding to a}} questionnaire sent by us which allowed recruitment of a high large {{number of cases of}} parotid neoplasms observed over a 10 -year period. Statistical data obtained partly confirmed previous findings. Benign tumours account for 80 % of case histories with a relationship 1 : 4 M/F, the most frequent being pleomorphic adenoma (57. 3 % of cases), followed by Warthin’s tumour (32. 4 %), this rating not having been confirmed in case histories (8 - 10 %) in the literature. Malignant tumours instead were fewer in number compared to the literature (14 % vs 25 - 30 %); the most frequent being mucoepidermoid carcinoma (18. 2 %) of which 44 % G 1, 33 % G 2 and 23 % G 3. Adenoid-cystic carcinoma was observed in 15. 3 % and ≤ 10 % for all the other most frequent histological malignant neoplasms. Diagnostic work-up included echotomography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, less used imaging techniques were computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, Sialo-computed tomography. During this multicentre investigation more widespread use of imaging techniques has, however, been observed. The greater use of ecotomography and of fine-needle aspiration biopsy was due to simplicity of application and low cost offering good sensitivity and specificity. Surgical treatment of benign tumours consisted, in 50 % of cases, in superficial paroditectomy and in ~ 30 % of total paroditectomy. Enucleoresection was limited to ~ 15 % of neoplasms, enucleation to < 10 % of cases with only 2 % of pleomorph adenoma due to the well-known anatomo-pathological characteristics which may lead to relapse. For malignant neoplasms, total parotidectomy was performed in ~ 50 % of cases, while in the remaining 50 % an almost equal rate of superficial parotidectomy was carried out and enlarged parotidectomy, with or without sacrificing the facial nerve, which was rebuilt in 60 % of cases. The lateral neck dissection most frequently carried out was of functional type in 54 % and selective type in 46 % with removal of levels I-III and II-IV in ~ 60 % of cases. Sentinel lymph node was observed in a limited number of centres. When no clinically evident lymph nodes were present (NO) considering the tumour histotype, two thirds of patients underwent surgery or radiotherapy, while in the remainder the wait-and-see attitude was prefered. Post-operative - complementary radiotherapy was very frequently performed instead of chemotherapy. Oncological results obtained were compared with those reported in the literature: in fact for all benign neoplasms relapse ratings are about 5 %, while for malignant tumours the worst prognosis was in squamous cell carcinoma with median of 37. 7 on survival and metastasis rate of 16. 5 %. Finally, <b>mucoepidermoid</b> carcinoma <b>tumours</b> showed best survival, followed by adenoid-cystic carcinoma with ranges, respectively, 83 and 81...|$|R
