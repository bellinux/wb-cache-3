30|$|Time {{delay is}} usually {{encountered}} in many practical situations such as signal processing, image processing etc. There {{has been an}} increasing research activity on time-delay systems during the past years [1 – 16]. The problem of the delay-dependent stability analysis of time-delay systems has become a hot research topic in the control community [17, 18] {{due to the fact}} that stability criteria can provide a <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> upper bound of time delay. The <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> upper bound can be regarded as an important index for the conservatism of stability criteria [19 – 23]. To our knowledge, Jensen’s inequality has been mostly used as a powerful mathematical tool in the stability analysis of time-delay systems. However, Jensen’s inequality neglected some terms, which unavoidably introduced some conservatism. In order to investigate the stability of a linear discrete systems with constant delay, Zhang and Han [24] established the following Abel lemma-based finite-sum inequality, which improved the Jensen inequality to some extent.|$|R

30|$|The {{situation}} {{may be particularly}} worrisome in less economically developed countries where legislative standards do not exist {{as a result of}} frail institutions and tight budgets. In such cases, a prevailing absence of surveillance schemes may allow in beaches undetected pollution from stormwater, domestic sewage and industrial effluents (Kuylenstierna et al., 2009). The situation is exacerbated as less developed nations are often at a loss on how to develop workable standards for the purpose of beach water quality monitoring (Johnstone, 2007). Reimann and David Banks (2004) also highlighted the problems of setting meaningful action levels or <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> concentrations (MAC-values) for water quality. Usually, public authorities and responsible politicians consider water quality statistics and take a decision on what proportion of failures they think can be accepted based on a consideration of political factors, economic factors and suggested MAC hinged on available empirical data. In cases where there are no indigenous studies that present empirical findings which suggest epidemiologically proven action levels or <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> concentrations that make a case for the initiation of a beach water bacteriological quality monitoring (BQM) program, a worst case scenario of political inaction and negligence may become observable (Dada et al., 2012).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Venice Commission in its Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters {{specifies}} that (single-seat) constituencies {{should be}} drawn {{so that the}} size difference of a constituency’s size from the average should not exceed a fixed limit while its borders must not cross the borders of administrative regions, such as states or counties. Assuming that constituencies are of equal size {{within each of the}} administrative regions, the problem is equivalent to the apportionment problem, that is, the proportional allocation of voting districts among the administrative regions. We show that the principle of <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> departure is incompatible with common apportionment properties, such as monotonicity and Hare-quota. When multiple apportionments satisfy the smallest <b>maximum</b> <b>admissible</b> departure property we find a unique apportionment by the repeated application of the property. The allotment such that the differences from the average district size are lexicographically minimized can be found using an efficient algorithm. This apportionment rule is a well-defined allocation mechanism compatible with and derived from the recommendation of the Venice Commission. Finally, we compare this apportionment rule with mainstream mechanisms using data from Hungary, Germany and the United States...|$|R
