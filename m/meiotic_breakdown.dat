40|$|Cell-free {{extracts}} prepared from activated clam oocytes contain {{factors which}} induce phosphorylation {{of the single}} 67 -kD lamin (L 67), disassemble clam oocyte nuclei, and cause chromosome condensation in vitro (Dessev, G., R. Palazzo, L. Rebhun, and R. Goldman. 1989. Dev. Biol. 131 : 469 - 504). To identify these factors, we have fractionated the oocyte extracts. The nuclear lamina disassembly (NLD) activity, together with a protein kinase activity specific for L 67, appear as a single peak throughout a number of purification steps. This peak also contains p 34 cdc 2, cyclin B, and histone H 1 -kinase activity, which are components of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF). The NLD/L 67 -kinase activity is depleted by exposure of this purified material to Sepharose conjugated to p 13 suc 1, and is restored upon addition of a p 34 cdc 2 /p 62 complex from HeLa cells. The latter complex phosphorylates L 67 and induces NLD {{in the absence of}} other clam oocyte proteins. Our results suggest that a single protein kinase activity (p 34 cdc 2 -H 1 kinase, identical with MPF) phosphorylates the lamin and is involved in the <b>meiotic</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the nuclear envelope in clam oocytes...|$|E
