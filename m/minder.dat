5|$|In 1918, {{after some}} negotiation, Nevinson {{agreed to work}} for the British War Memorials Committee to produce a single large artwork for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. He was offered an honorary {{commission}} as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit over a long weekend to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he went and his movements were restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army <b>minder</b> assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit the casualty stations he wanted to sketch in.|$|E

5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen <b>Minder,</b> monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Anthony Francis Conroy {{was born}} in Dublin to John (Jack) and Esther Conroy, {{and was one of}} ten siblings: Alphonsus (Ollie), Laurence (Lar), John (Donny), Rita, Peter, Michael, Vincent, Paul, and Marie. Christened as Gerard, he soon became known by the name Terry as he could not {{pronounce}} 'Gerard' as a young child. His mother held two jobs: as a factory worker and an office cleaner. The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of household chores to spend the majority of his time playing football in the street. However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football in the street. He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers of other children in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the printing trade, and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a machine <b>minder</b> and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|E
25|$|A pair of mules {{would be}} manned {{by a person}} called the <b>minder</b> and two boys called the side piecer and the little piecer. They worked barefoot in humid temperatures, the <b>minder</b> and the little piecer worked the <b>minder</b> half of the mule. The <b>minder</b> would make minor {{adjustments}} to his mules {{to the extent that}} each mule worked differently. They were specialists in spinning, and were only answerable to the gaffer and under-gaffer who were in charge of the floor and with it {{the quantity and quality of}} the yarn that was produced. Bobbins of rovings came from the carder in the blowing room delivered by a bobbin carrier who was part of the carder's staff, and yarn was hoisted down to the warehouse by the warehouseman's staff. Delineation of jobs was rigid and communication would be through the means of coloured slips of paper written on in indelible pencil.|$|E

25|$|The doffing {{took only}} a few minutes, the piecers would run {{the length of the}} mule gate thrutching five {{spindles}} a time, and the doffing involved lifting four cops from the spindles with the right hand and piling them on the left forearm and hand. To get a firm cop bottom, the <b>minder</b> would whip the first few layers of yarn. After the first few draws the <b>minder</b> would stop the mule at the start of an inward run and take it in slowly depressing and releasing the faller wire several times. Alternatively, a starch paste could be skillfully applied to the first few layers of yarn by the piecers – and later a small paper tube was dropped over spindle – this slowed down the doffing operation and extra payment was negotiated by the minders.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on paid child care work/commodification of child care in {{informal}} labor market and aims to understand meaning of this commodification for child <b>minders</b> and work relation; place of emotions in work, features transferred from familial relations and their impacts; and influence of private sphere as a working place. This study is based on in-depth interviews conducted with 19 child <b>minders</b> {{in the capital city}} of Turkey, Ankara. Results displayed that in Turkey, due to lack of any formal regulations targeting the paid child care work, ambiguity that surrounds frame of the work increases the tension. Both child <b>minders</b> and mothers refrain from considering their connection with each other as employee and employer. Hence, they are inclined to think and behave via family terms. Unavailability of any kind of formal mechanism to bring standardization of definition of tasks, of wages, and of working relation causes a formless area. However, there are informally defined and adopted principles functioning in the field. Furthermore, because of fictive kinship relation and emotional component in the work, risk of exploitation is high. And despite inequality between mothers and child <b>minders,</b> both of the actors have their own negotiation power...|$|R
25|$|The show starred Dennis Waterman as Terry McCann, {{an honest}} and likable {{bodyguard}} (<b>minder</b> in London slang) and George Cole as Arthur Daley, a socially ambitious, but highly unscrupulous importer-exporter, wholesaler, used-car salesman and purveyor {{of anything else}} from which there was money to be made, whether within the law or not.|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} {{element of}} the series were the subplots typically found in a <b>Minder</b> episode. Although subplots weren't necessarily found {{in all of the}} episodes, they were found in most and usually consisted of one of Arthur's dodgy deals, Terry's minding jobs and/or favours done for friends and in a few instances involved the police tackling particular cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} a number of {{parallels}} with long-running BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses, with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire and get them into trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status than they really were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. Indeed, Only Fools and Horses creator / writer John Sullivan claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV's <b>Minder,</b> which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of Only Fools and Horses and <b>Minder</b> were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers (in the days before video recorders were commonplace in many UK homes).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} which {{requirements for}} development {{that exists in}} Næstved family daycare and how the child <b>minders</b> experience them. Furthermore we investigate which conditions that underlie these requirements for development and how the child <b>minders</b> perceive them. The project is written in a critical realistic theory of science perspective, and therefore has a critical approach. Through empirical data collected by ourselves, the management strategies NPM & HRM and theories from Kirsten Marie Bovbjerg, Rasmus Willig and Kirsten Frederiksen og Jens Erik Kristensen, it is analysed and discussed which factors that may have an influence on the requirements for development and how these are perceived. The paper concludes that New Public Management, Human Resource Management and The learning organization demand development as a permanent condition, which are implemented in the daycare due to a competitive and efficiency logic. The requirement for development can also {{be explained by the}} child minders’ desire for self-realization. These have been institutionalized through i. e. the use of employee development dialogues and upgrading IT skills. Since the child <b>minders</b> cannot decline the development opportunities, there has been a shift from a development desire to a development coersion. This development has led to a tacit acceptance of the requirements for development, and thus a disempowerment of the child <b>minders...</b>|$|R
