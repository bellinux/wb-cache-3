5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> and {{the keep}} were {{surrounded}} by a ditch, which had three counterscarp musketry galleries. These were also significantly altered by the British.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> of {{the station}} and the shops to each side was {{designed}} {{with the intention of}} taking upward development on its roof, though this did not come until around 1960 when three storeys of office building were added.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 1949, a {{fire spread}} {{from the library}} roof; over 300 printed books and the manuscripts on {{exhibition}} were completely destroyed, and over 3,000 books needed repair, though the <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> suffered little damage and restoration took less than a year.|$|E

5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, and the <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> {{is made of}} oak timbers, joined {{together}} using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> of an insect's {{digestive}} {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> within Group F. It slopes {{gradually}} away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E

5|$|The Bacon Academy, nicknamed Old Bacon Academy, was the {{original}} Bacon Academy until 1993. The Old Bacon Academy was built in 1803 and is located at 84Main Street, Colchester, Connecticut. The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. Noted for its plain, utilitarian floor plan consisting of two rooms off a central hall and stairway, the inside has seen some renovations throughout its history. The Day Hall, a contributing property purchased by the Bacon Academy trustees in 1929, is a church hall that {{was used for the}} high school until 1962.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers {{at either end of the}} water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and an infusion of extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
5|$|The dome, {{octagonal}} in shape, stands prominently {{on top of}} {{the centre}} of the cella. It was supported by four now-destroyed columns which were located directly beneath it. The integrated bell tower has been built {{on top of the}} narthex, as was customary in contemporary Byzantine church architecture, and extends from the rectangular <b>main</b> <b>structure.</b> The bell tower was originally rectangular, though it is now partially ruined. It was reached from the south by means of a stone staircase.|$|E

5|$|During the investigation, the Royal Navy {{conducted}} recovery operations. The first {{pieces of}} wreckage were discovered on 12 February 1954 {{and the search}} continued until September 1954, by which time 70 percent by weight of the <b>main</b> <b>structure,</b> 80 percent of the power section, and 50 percent of the aircraft's systems and equipment had been recovered. The forensic reconstruction effort had just begun when the Abell Committee reported its findings. No apparent fault in the aircraft was found, and the British government decided against opening a further public inquiry into the accident. The prestigious nature of the Comet project, particularly for the British aerospace industry, and the financial impact of the aircraft's grounding on BOAC's operations, both served to pressure the inquiry to end without further investigation. Comet flights resumed on 23 March 1954.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, William the Conqueror subdued {{the north of}} the country in a {{sequence}} of harsh campaigns, and the north-west region became a contested border territory between the Normans and the Scottish kings. William's son, William Rufus, invaded the north-west in 1091 and built Brough Castle around 1092, placing it in the north part of the old Roman fort in order {{to make use of the}} existing earthworks, in a similar way to nearby Brougham and Lancaster. The north side of the site overlooks the River Eden. This castle appears to have been a motte and bailey design; the keep had stone foundations and a <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> built from timber, while the rest of the former fort was turned into a palisaded bailey. The village of Church Brough was created alongside the castle at around the same time, in the form of a planned settlement, part of the Norman colonisation of the low-lands in the region.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> of {{the fruit}} body {{consists}} primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E

5|$|The {{plant was}} laid out roughly north to south {{orientation}} along the Thames River. The plant itself {{is a mixture of}} interconnected buildings and stand-alone structures. The stand-alone structures included three propane sheds (Buildings 63, 64 and 65) that were located near the Human Resources building (Building 86) and its storage shed (Building 30). The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant. At {{the north end of the}} plant was the Research and Development building (Building 87), it was located connected to two large storage buildings (Building 1 and 2). On the front of Building 2 was the main offices (Building 85). Building 2 is connected to the largest building, the Manufacturing Building (Building 3), which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House (Building 5) and Glass House 2 (Building 32). Building 32 also served as storage building. Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House Cullet & Mix House (Number 7) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building (Number 9) at the southern end.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' {{originally}} {{consisted of}} a nave and chancel, to which a sanctuary was added in the first building phase. The church was extended on three occasions between the 10th and 14th centuries– a period of population growth– to include an aisled nave, a western tower and a northern chapel; its windows featured stained glass. The church was abandoned in the 15th century, presumably because the parish could no longer support two churches. It was demolished, and virtually all of its masonry removed, {{some of which may}} have been used in improvements to the church of St Nicholas. The settlement of Shuart remained as an area of local administration into the 17th century, but it is now regarded as a deserted medieval village. There were no visible remains of All Saints' Church by 1723, although land there remained as glebe belonging to the parish of St Nicholas. The site of All Saints' Church was excavated by archaeologists between 1978 and 1979. The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> had been robbed of its materials leaving only the foundations, from which the archaeologists were able to interpret the history of the building's construction and its form. Among the foundations were discovered numerous stone carvings, floor tiles, remnants of stained glass, and several disturbed graves.|$|E

25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> {{consists}} of thirteen transverse buttress-walls, pierced by three superimposed brick arches, which create twelve compartments, each 9–13 m wide. The two lengthwise walls are not parallel, but steadily move apart {{as they go}} north. The eastern wall features a pair of superposed corridors on its upper two levels, built inside the wall's body and lit by loopholes in the wall's façades. The basement-level compartments have no windows, but the upper levels are lit through small openings in the western wall. A spiral stairway tower connects the <b>main</b> <b>structure</b> with the two towers.|$|E
