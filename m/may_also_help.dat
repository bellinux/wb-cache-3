5|$|Little {{is known}} about how ctenophores get rid of waste {{products}} produced by the cells. The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea, and <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to adjust the animal's buoyancy by pumping water into {{or out of the}} mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies of aesthetics. It <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> explain classificatory disputes about art as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history. There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.|$|E
50|$|Corey May is an American {{video game}} writer. He is {{currently}} the Narrative Director for Austin video game developer, Certain Affinity. <b>May</b> is <b>also</b> the co-founder and President of Sekretagent Productions, a production company based in Los Angeles, California working in the film, video game, and internet industries. May is the main writer of the Assassin's Creed series.May worked as the lead writer on Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed II, and Assassin's Creed III. Corey <b>May</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> Jeffrey Yohalem as a writer on Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, and Darby McDevitt on Assassin's Creed: Revelations. May helped Jeffrey Yohalem once again on Assassin's Creed Syndicate, making it the last game he worked on before departing from Ubisoft. <b>May</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> {{in the production of}} most other entries into the Assassin's Creed franchise to make sure everything flows together into one coherent narrative.|$|R
50|$|The rodent's fearsome {{front teeth}} and large size {{may have been}} used to fight over females for {{breeding}} rights and <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> defend against predators, including carnivorous marsupials, saber-toothed cats, short-faced bears and terror birds.|$|R
50|$|During the war, Britain covertly {{supplied}} Nigeria {{with weapons}} and military intelligence and <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> it to hire mercenaries. After {{the decision was}} made to back Nigeria, the BBC oriented its reporting to favor this side. Supplies provided to the Federal Military Government included two vessels and 60 vehicles.|$|R
5|$|Internet {{searches}} {{for information on}} suicide return webpages that 10-30% of the time encourage or facilitate suicide attempts. There is some concern that such sites may push those predisposed over the edge. Some people form suicide pacts online, either with pre-existing friends or people they have recently encountered in chat rooms or message boards. The Internet, however, <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent suicide by providing a social group {{for those who are}} isolated.|$|E
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E
5|$|The inner region around Epsilon Eridani, from a {{radius of}} 2.5AU inward, {{appears to be}} clear of dust down to the {{detection}} limit of the 6.5m MMT telescope. Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind, while {{the presence of a}} planetary system <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> keep this area clear of debris. Still, this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{noted for}} his {{legislative}} {{work in the}} area of technology, May chaired the legislature's Joint Computer Management Committee and {{was a member of the}} Colorado legislature during the installation of Internet service in the Colorado State Capitol in the 1990s. He is credited setting up the buildings' first wireless internet network, eliminating the need to remove interior marble facades in order to install new wiring. As a member of the state's Information Management Commission, <b>May</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> established the Colorado General Assembly's online legislative information system, and has called this his [...] "biggest contribution" [...] in technology issues. In 2006, May sponsored legislation which created the state position of chief information security officer and provided state funding to the Colorado cyber-security office. Outside the legislature, <b>May</b> <b>also</b> operated a firm specializing in computer consulting for small businesses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{work was}} {{dedicated}} to the Antwerp art collector Antoon van Leyen who had provided {{some of the information}} for the book and <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> finance the publication. [...] Other persons who had provided information on contemporary artists included de Bie’s own father, Erasmus Quellinus II, Luigi Primo and Hendrick ter Brugghen’s son Richard.|$|R
50|$|Many {{small trees}} and shrubs in the spiny thickets, such as endemic Uncarina, {{conserve}} water by producing seeds with hooks and spines rather than fleshy fruits. These seeds attach themselves to the skin and fur of passing animals for dispersal, and are still dispersed by living lemur species as well as introduced species such as cattle. Pachylemur <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> disperse seeds in this fashion.|$|R
5|$|The procellariids are small- to {{medium-sized}} seabirds. The largest, {{the giant}} petrels with a wingspan of , {{are almost as}} large as albatrosses; the smallest, such as the fairy prion have a wingspan of , are slightly bigger than the diving petrels. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> locate nesting colonies. The plumage of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the Cape petrel).|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or filled with fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E
5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective heat insulation and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E
50|$|In 458, a Hephthalite king called Khushnavaz helped Sasanian Emperor Peroz I (458-84) {{gain the}} Persian throne from his brother. The Hephthalite <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> the Sasanians {{eliminate}} another Hunnic tribe, the Kidarites: by 467, Peroz I, with Hephthalite aid, reportedly managed to capture Balaam {{and put an}} end to Kidarite rule in Transoxiana once and for all. The Kidarites, weakened, had to take refuge in the area of Gandhara.|$|R
50|$|Remaining chaste {{and being}} {{in control of their}} own bodies, can <b>also</b> <b>help</b> women feel powerful. Cathy Hampton states that, ‘all virtuous women must accede {{directly}} to the call to chastity, an imperative that places them on equal footing rather than in a relationship of hierarchy.” Relating to Cecilia, her decision to keep her virginity in tact throughout her life <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> her feel more powerful, and made her realize that she had the independence to control her life allowing her to battle the oppression of Almachius.|$|R
500|$|Many {{small trees}} and shrubs in the spiny thickets, such as endemic Uncarina, {{conserve}} water by producing seeds with hooks and spines rather than fleshy fruits. [...] These seeds attach themselves to the skin and fur of passing animals for dispersal, and are still dispersed by living lemur species as well as introduced species such as cattle.

25|$|It <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> with actinic keratosis, {{and acute}} pain caused by minor strains, sprains, and contusions (bruises).|$|E
25|$|Lidocaine, {{along with}} ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> in {{treating}} jellyfish stings, both numbing {{the affected area}} and preventing further nematocyst discharge.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis {{may be used}} {{to treat}} Crohn's disease because of its {{anti-inflammatory}} properties. Cannabis and cannabis-derived drugs <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to heal the gut lining, and may reduce the need for surgery and other medications.|$|E
5000|$|Her {{paper on}} [...] "On the Genesis of Psychical Conflict in Early Infancy" [...] has been {{described}} as 'the clearest and most beautifully expressed outline of Kleinian theory as it was at that time'. In general, 'Riviere often presents Kleinian ideas in ways that are more accessible and elegant than Klein's densely packed papers, and she <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> Klein to express herself more effectively in English'.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his rookie}} season in MLB with the California Angels, Joyner became a fan {{favorite}} and briefly inspired a sensation in which Anaheim Stadium was dubbed [...] "Wally World". The film National Lampoon's Vacation had featured a fictional theme park by that name, and the Angels' proximity to Disneyland <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> inspire the moniker. Additionally, ESPN announcer Chris Berman famously called him Wally [...] "Absorbine" [...] Joyner, a nickname that stuck.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 Farrell {{made two}} {{appearances}} for the FAI XI. In May 1937 the FAI organised a European tour with a squad that included Tommy Breen, Jackie Brown and Jimmy Dunne {{as well as}} Farrell. Farrell made his debut for the FAI XI on 17 May in a 1-0 win against Switzerland. A week later, on 23 <b>May,</b> he <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> the FAI XI defeat France 2-0. This {{would prove to be}} his last appearance for the FAI XI.|$|R
25|$|Food. It {{is common}} for people (especially those on diets) to faint during a long session. Having a regular meal {{beforehand}} is recommended; being fed small snacks during play <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent fainting.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{water intake}} <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> in {{acclimatization}} {{to replace the}} fluids lost through heavier breathing in the thin, dry air found at altitude, although consuming excessive quantities ("over-hydration") has no benefits and may cause dangerous hyponatremia.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{containing}} these added proteins {{can be used}} as {{a component}} in oral rehydration solutions which are used to treat diarrheal diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence. Such supplements <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> reverse anemia.|$|E
5000|$|Cura sa čaršije was {{released}} by Hayat Production on 11 April 2011. A [...] "promotional party" [...] was held at Sarajevo's hotel Bristol 30 <b>May</b> 2011. <b>Also</b> the <b>help</b> promote Cura sa čaršije, Rahić embarked {{on a tour of}} the same name.|$|R
50|$|In the romances, {{his adventures}} {{frequently}} included greater foes than other knights, including giants, enchantresses, or dragons. They <b>may</b> <b>also</b> gain <b>help</b> {{that is out}} of ordinary. Sir Ywain assisted a lion against a serpent, and was thereafter accompanied by it, becoming the Knight of the Lion. Other knights-errant have been assisted by wild men of the woods, as in Valentine and Orson, or, like Guillaume de Palerme, by wolves that were, in fact, enchanted princes.|$|R
50|$|The name Topličice {{and names}} like it (e.g., Dolenjske Toplice) {{are derived from}} the Slovene common noun *toplica 'hot spring', {{referring}} to a local geological feature. The German name Töplitzel and Gottscheerish name Teplitzle are derivd from the Slovenian name. Both the Slovene and German names are diminutives (with the suffixes -ice and -el), also reflected in the obsolete Slovene name Male Toplice, all literally 'little hot spring(s)'. The diminutive form <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> differentiate the settlement from many others named Toplice/Töplitz.|$|R
25|$|Estrogen <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> in the {{prevention}} of dementia but cannot help when dementia is already present and when cognitive function is already impaired. It increases cerebral blood flow and is an anti-inflammatory agent, enhancing activity at the neuronal synapses in the brain. It <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to increase brain activation in regions that are affected by dementia which is mainly the hippocampus region. Recent evidence on the effects of estrogen do not allow for an unambiguous recommendation for estrogen supplementation and they indicate that the timing of estrogen supplementation may be important, with early postmenopausal use being preferable over its use later in life.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} GPA is cyclophosphamide and high dose corticosteroids for remission induction and less toxic immunosuppressants like azathioprine, leflunomide, methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent relapse. Rituximab {{may be substituted}} for cyclophosphamide in inducing remission.|$|E
25|$|Other joint medications, like {{hyaluronic acid}} and Adequan, may help {{alleviate}} the pain if the horse has mild bone spavin. However, {{they are less}} useful for treating moderate of severe cases. MSM <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> horses with moderate bone spavin.|$|E
2500|$|Like Lee, the tomboy Scout of {{the novel}} is the {{daughter}} of a respected small-town Alabama attorney. Scout's friend, Dill, was inspired by Lee's childhood friend and neighbor, Truman Capote; Lee, in turn, is the model for a character in Capote's first novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms, published in 1948. [...] Although the plot of Lee's novel involves an unsuccessful legal defense similar to one undertaken by her attorney father, the 1931 landmark Scottsboro Boys interracial rape case <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> to shape Lee's social conscience.|$|R
50|$|As {{indicated}} in the title, A New Grammar with Exercises of Bad English, Ann's book used examples of poor English to teach grammar. A New Grammar also attacked the use of Latin rules in the vernacular, {{and was the first}} to suggest the pronoun he could be used for both sexes, which <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> propel the book to over 30 editions in subsequent years. Her work was often plagiarized and quoted outright by many authors to follow her, showing her efforts were not going unnoticed.|$|R
50|$|The West German Intelligence Service later {{recruited}} him, and he <b>may</b> <b>also</b> have <b>helped</b> the CIA capture Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara in 1967. Barbie {{is suspected}} of having {{had a hand in}} the Bolivian coup d'état orchestrated by Luis García Meza Tejada in 1980. After the fall of the dictatorship, Barbie no longer had the protection of the Bolivian government, and in 1983 was extradited to France, where he was convicted of crimes against humanity. He died of cancer in prison on 23 September 1991.|$|R
