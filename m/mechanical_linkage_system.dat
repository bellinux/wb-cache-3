40|$|Research {{activities}} towards developing CO 2 compressors {{have increased}} drastically {{during the last}} couple years. Since the transcritical CO 2 cycle operates at much higher absolute pressures {{as compared to the}} conventional vapor compression cycles, it is necessary to develop new compressors or modify existing ones. In this paper, a novel positive-displacement oil-free CO 2 compressor will be introduced. The compressor’s <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>system</b> will be described. In addition, preliminary compressor test results will be presented, including volumetric efficiency, overall isentropic efficiency, discharge temperature and mass flow rate. The compressor was designed and manufactured to provide cooling capacities from 10 kW to 100 kW. The novel compressor design introduces a new low-friction drive mechanism. The displacement of the compressor can be mechanically varied while keeping a small constant head clearance. A test stand was constructed to map the compressor efficiency, mass flow rate, power consumption and discharge temperature. The test stand is based on a hot gas bypass design, where parts of the discharged refrigerant flow bypasses the condenser, whereas {{the other part of the}} flow changes phase as it flows through a condenser. The two streams are mixed to obtain the desired compressor super heat at the suction side of the compressor. The prototype compressor has been tested under different pressure ratios (5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 6) and at different speeds (900 rpm, 1200 rpm, 1500 rpm, 1800 rpm) ...|$|E
40|$|Primary Flight {{students}} {{encounter a}} negative transfer of information {{early in their}} flight training while learning to taxi (steer) an airplane in the airport environment. Non-pilots rely on using their hands to manipulate vehicular movement in automobiles. In aircraft, the control yoke does not become effective for turning the airplane until sufficient airflow is achieved while in flight. In addition, directional control {{on the ground is}} not achieved by movement of the ailerons or the elevator. In most general aviation aircraft, directional control on the ground is achieved by a steerable nose wheel and/or the deflection of the rudder. Early in the training process, students must overcome the strong desire to control the aircraft’s movement by the use of control yoke inputs and instead, use the rudder pedals. The challenge for freshman engineering students is to design a mechanical device that simulates the steerable nosewheel control system for use by pilots early in their training process. The engineering students were challenged to create specifications for a turning radius for the device. This involved investigation of how a steerable nosewheel operates on an actual airplane. Based on these specifications, the students were challenged to design a <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>system</b> that allows the freedom of movement to meet these specifications. This design project gives engineering students an opportunity to apply design principles to a practical project. The engineering students gain an understanding of work as a team; work with the client, and the sequence and process of design. Beginning pilots using the device gain an enhancement of motor skills that positively transfer to learning to steer the airplane...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} few decades, {{substantial}} improvements were made to rail infrastructure worldwide. This was necessary to accommodate the ever increasing transportation demand and requirements. Nowadays, trains are required to transport heavier loads and to travel at higher speeds. One of the major improvements was achieved {{by the development of}} the off-flange curving bogie designs to reduce wheel and rail wear. Off-flange designs include passive steering and actively controlled steering. The development and implementation of self-steering bogies on locomotives was promoted in the early 1980 ’s by two major locomotive manufacturers. Up to date, thousands of these locomotives, with built-in self-steering bogies, have been manufactured and taken into service (Swenson, 1999). Most self-steering bogies have mechanical linkage systems to steer the wheel sets. As an alternative to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>system,</b> the DCD Group (a South African manufacturer of rail and mining equipment) initiated the development of a Passive Hydraulic Steering (PHS) system. First PHS prototype systems, developed by DCD, have proven that huge wear reduction possibilities exist on both, rails and wheels. In addition the prototype systems also significantly decreased noise and vibration levels when negotiating tight corners (Swenson & Scott, 1996 and DCD Rolling Stock, 2012). However, existing prototype solutions require further improvements and development for optimisation. To be able to identify and implement improvements, the need exists to perform modelling and testing of the systems to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} operation and suitability of a complete unit. The aim of this research project is thus, to mathematically model an existing prototype PHS system and validate the model with data from experiments and tests. This model can then be used in order to improve and optimise performance, cost and reliability of the system, before mass production is considered. A literature survey was conducted, focusing on general wheel and rail wear mechanisms, techniques to improve wheel and rail life and on existing techniques for modelling the hydraulics and multi-body dynamics of locomotive systems. The literature survey was followed by extensive laboratory tests on component basis, a quarter PHS system and on the full PHS system. From these tests all parameters needed for the characterisation of the PHS and the mathematical model were determined. These tests also provided data for the validation of the PHS model. Finally, a mathematical model of the PHS system was successfully generated and validated. This model can now be used in a multi-body dynamic locomotive simulation to evaluate its effectiveness. The results and findings of the literature survey, experiments and modelling are reported on and discussed in this report.

40|$|Along with {{increasing}} advances in robotic technologies, {{there are now}} significant efforts under way {{to improve the quality}} of life especially those with physical disabilities or impairments. Control of such medical human-interactive robotics (HIR) involves complications in its design and control due to uncertain human factors. This dissertation makes its efforts to resolve three main challenges of an advanced HIR controller development: 1) detecting the operator?s motion intent, 2) understanding human motor behavior from the robotic perspective, and 3) generating reference motion for the HIR. Our interests in such challenges are limited to the point-to-point reaching of the human arm for applications of their solutions in the control of rehabilitation exoskeletons, therapeutic haptic devices, and prosthetic arms. In the context of human motion intent detection, a mobile motion capture system (MCS) enhanced with myoprocessors is developed to capture kinematics and dynamics of human arm in reaching movements. The developed MCS adopts wireless IMU (inertial measurement unit) sensors to capture ADL (activities of daily life) motions in the real-life environment. In addition, measured muscle activation patterns from selected muscle groups are converted into muscular force values by myoprocessors. This allows a reliable motion intent detection by quantify one of the most frequently used driving signal of the HIR, EMG (electromyography), in a standardized way. In order to understand the human motor behavior from the robotic viewpoint, a computational model on reaching is required. Since such model can be constituted by experimental observations, this dissertation look into invariant motion features of reaching with and without elbow constraint condition to establish a foundation of the computational model. The HIR should generate its reference motions by reflecting motor behavior of the natural human reaching. Though the accurate approximation of such behavior is critical, we also need to take into account the computational cost, especially for real-time applications such as the HIR control. In this manner, a higher order kinematic synthesis of <b>mechanical</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>systems</b> is adopted to approximate natural human hand profiles. Finally, a novel control concept of a myo-prosthetic arm is proposed as an application of all findings and efforts made in this dissertation...|$|R

Next, the system estimates the position {{and direction of the}} rotation axis from the relative trajectory of these parts.

Moreover, the rotation axis has to be estimated from a sequence of positions and postures in the presence of noise. We present the following two techniques to solve these problems: 1) Occlusion robust object tracking based on prediction. 2) Parameter estimation of the <b>mechanical</b> rotation <b>linkage</b> from the noisy relative trajectories of its parts.
