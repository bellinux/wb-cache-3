Since the first proposal of the stellarator concept many reactor studies have been published and these studies reflect the large variety of stellarator configurations. The main representatives are the continuous-coil configurations and the modular-coil configurations. As {{a continuation of the}} LHD experiment two reactor configurations, FFHRI and FFHR 2, have been investigated, which use continuous helical windings for providing the magnetic field. The <b>modular</b> <b>coil</b> concept has been realized in the MHH-reactor study (USA 1997) and in the Helias reactor.

Stellarator configurations with continuous coils such as LHD possess a natural helical divertor, which can be used favourably for impurity control.
