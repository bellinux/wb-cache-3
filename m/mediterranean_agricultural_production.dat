40|$|Abstract – This paper aims to {{estimate}} the technical efficiency of the agricultural sector {{in a group of}} Mediterranean countries involved in the process of global market liberalization. The analysis applies the stochastic production frontier model to a set of six different crop products. For each product, a panel data set covering the period 1990 - 2005 in fourteen Mediterranean countries is used and separate econometric results are obtained. Then cross-sectional country information is used, in the second stage, to assess the main factors contributing to technical inefficiencies and to explain efficiency differentials among Mediterranean countries. The empirical results revealed the presence of important inefficiencies in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> with significant diversities across countries and crops. EU countries on average appear to have higher technical efficiency levels than SMC, amon...|$|E

In particular, we have asked how the ex ante expected volume of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> responds to additional information when information also affects the futures market for agricultural commodities. The analysis has produced two main results. Firstly, higher market transparency increases farmers’ expected profits {{as long as the}} cost function is convex. However, higher market transparency does not increase <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> levels per se. If farmers’ marginal cost functions are concave (convex), higher market transparency leads to higher (lower) ex ante expected levels of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe rain-fed {{agriculture}} {{system is}} vulnerable to climate change impact. However, such impact may also vary by aggregate and sub-sectoral levels of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production.</b> The impact of climate change and variability on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> would engender appropriate policies and practices towards a sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> system. We investigated the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> in Nigeria, and drew lessons for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Nigeria. Using time series data that spanned 43 years and econometric analytical technique, we quantified the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on aggregate production and sub-sectors (all crops, staples, livestock, fisheries and forestry). Irrigation had positive and significant impact on aggregate <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> {{as well as all}} sub-sectors of agriculture. These findings suggest the need for the minimization of the impact of climate-induced production risks through CSA which would involve complementary development of more arable land areas under irrigation in Nigeria. Irrigation would also enhance complementary agricultural water management for the development of all the sub-sectors of agriculture, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> under prevailing climate change and variability...|$|R

Through surveying 215 households in Bac Ninh province, the paper explores impacts of {{female and male}} migration on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> and its implications on rural development. The results show that in comparison to male migration household, the female one tends to focus on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> by taking the opportunities to rent more land (26. 3 %) and effective use their own allocated land for <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> (97. 4 %). The overall impacts of migration on <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> are the aging of farm labor force (49. 6 year old in average) and higher female participation in <b>agricultural</b> <b>production.</b> The findings suggest that female migrants have a greater contribution in agriculture production both in term of working time and agricultural capital investment while male migrants enhance household income by accumulating capital outside agriculture. Through the gender lens, this research emphasizes the duality {{in the nature of}} migrant lives and the implications of rural labor migration on the fixed categories. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The South Asian dryland (arid and semi-arid) {{ecosystems}} {{have been}} exhibiting considerable <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> system changes. In fact, today, there are scientific consensus that this nature of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> system enables it to capture market, technologies and environmental opportunities. Pressing concerns are, however, adverse environmental trade-offs that {{these changes are}} experiencing and therefore the challenges toward a resilient <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> system. This is particularly important in arid and semi-arid ecosystems which are resources constrained and thus more vulnerable: for example to climate change. To stimulate and revive a debate in agricultural research circles, this paper demonstrates the magnitude of major changes, their drivers and environmental implications in context to <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> systems in drylands of South Asia. As an example we selected districts representing different dryland <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> systems in western Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka states of India. Taking crop, livestock and trees as major enterprises, we characterized <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> systems of the sample districts. Key operational resources, demographic and external agents were illustrated as examples of drivers of changes. Then major emphasis was given to material and environment related livelihood outcomes and their dynamic as <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> systems evolve over time. Despite a remarkable improvement in material outcomes of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> (> 100 % increase in cereal grain yields taking 1966 as a base year), the long term environmental dimension tends to be compromised by short term needs: as demonstrated by perpetual soil nutrient stock mining, ground water depletion and instability of cereal grain yields (28 - 110 % CV). Based on these empirical evidence, we debate as to where a system research should focus and what policy circles {{need to do to}} address emerging problems and contribute to advances toward a sustainable <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> systems in dryland...|$|R
