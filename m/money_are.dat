5|$|The {{relatively}} stable {{value of the}} currency in the 1990s compared to the 1980s is explained by Peter D. Little in Somalia: Economy without a State as resulting {{from the lack of}} a central government printing currency to pay for civil and military expenditures. Traders avoid the need to carry large amounts of Somali shillings by converting them to U.S. dollars and then wiring them to money houses in Somalia. Because identification can be easily forged, those seeking to pick up wired <b>money</b> <b>are</b> required to answer questions about their clan and kinship relations. Private remittance companies known as hawala assist in the transfer of money. One of the largest such companies, Al Barakaat, was shut down in 2001 by a U.S.-led initiative due to alleged terrorist ties; the company's communications business, with more than 40,000 subscribers, was also shut down.|$|E

25|$|Money is any item or verifiable {{record that}} is {{generally}} accepted as payment for {{goods and services}} and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context.

The research money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of $277.6 million.

25|$|Deadweight loss {{does not}} account for the effect taxes have in {{leveling}} the business playing field. Businesses that have more <b>money</b> <b>are</b> better suited to fend off competition. It is common that an industry {{with a small amount of}} very large corporations has a very high barrier of entry for new entrants coming into the marketplace. This is due to the fact that the larger the corporation, the better its position to negotiate with suppliers. Also, larger companies may be able to operate at low or even negative profits for extended periods of time, thus pushing out competition. More progressive taxation of profits, however, would reduce such barriers for new entrants, thereby increasing competition and ultimately benefiting consumers.|$|E

25|$|International relief {{targeted}} at poverty reduction {{could also be}} redirected towards subsidizing renewable energy projects. Because of the integral role that electrification plays in supporting economic and social development, funding of rural electrification {{can be seen as}} core method for addressing poverty. Radios, televisions, telephones, computer networks and computers all rely on an access to electricity. Because information services allow for the proliferation of education resources, funding the electric backbone to such systems has derivative effect on their development. In this way access to communications and education {{plays a major role in}} reducing poverty. Additionally, international efforts that supplies equipment and services rather than <b>money,</b> <b>are</b> more resistant to resource misappropriation issue that pose problems in less stable governments.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the product}} {{development}} (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell {{is the answer}} to a question from a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting that answer are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., drill down to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it is implicit (undefined). If it is implicit, the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the assumptions are valid, then time and <b>money</b> <b>are</b> saved. If, however, the assumptions are invalid, it is likely to increase costs and exceed the schedule for implementation.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{monetary}} theory distinguishes {{among different}} ways to measure the money supply, reflected in different types of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system {{that focuses on the}} liquidity of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of <b>money)</b> <b>are</b> conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2 etc. may be different in different countries.|$|E

The woman's imagination also changes Tony's face; upon discovering this, he dances elegantly with her, and they spy a motel run by Mr. Nick. Tony convinces the woman to take a gondola toward a pyramid alone, winning a soul for Parnassus. Tony falls {{back out of the}} Imaginarium, returning his face to normal; the woman exits shortly after and gives the troupe a vast sum of money.

25|$|The Discworld novels contain {{common themes}} and motifs that {{run through the}} series. Fantasy clichés are parodied {{in many of the}} novels, as are various subgenres of fantasy, such as fairy tales (notably Witches Abroad), witch and vampire stories (Carpe Jugulum) and so on. Analogies of {{real-world}} issues, such as religion (Small Gods), business and politics (Making <b>Money),</b> <b>are</b> recurring themes, as are music genres such as opera (Maskerade) or rock music (Soul Music). Parodies of non-Discworld fiction also occur frequently, including Shakespeare, Beatrix Potter, and several movies. Major historical events, especially battles, are sometimes used as the basis for both trivial and key events in Discworld stories (Jingo, Pyramids), as are trends in science, technology, and pop culture (Moving Pictures, Men at Arms). There are also humanist themes in many of the Discworld novels, and a focus on critical thinking skills in the Witches and Tiffany Aching series.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain {{the nature and extent}} of coin-use in Anglo-Saxon England. Written references to minting and <b>money</b> <b>are</b> scarce, and it is likely that even a single silver penny had considerable buying power – perhaps something in the region of £10–£30 in modern currency. Their use may also have been concentrated in certain classes of society, and was probably most associated with particular transactions such as the payment of rents, tributes and legal fees. However, analysis of surviving single-finds (principally made since the 1970s by users of metal-detectors) shows that coins were used extensively, especially in the eastern half of England, both within and outside towns; they also circulated widely, and are frequently found far from their mint of origin. Substantial numbers of English coins have been found elsewhere in Europe, especially in Italy and Scandinavia, while English designs were influential on the emergent coinages of Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Bohemia.|$|E
