Reasons for staying included defiance (not willing to be intimidated), age (too old to move), money (not wanting to abandon businesses or houses), caring (not wanting to abandon elderly parents or pets), duty (civil servants and other essential workers were asked not to leave).

That year, Tropical Depression Auring caused flooding of similar magnitude to Thelma; however, the waters were properly diverted to the sea. A sculpture and monument to the victims, designed by architect Maribeth Ebcas and artist Florence Cinco respectively, called [...] "Gift of Life" [...] was constructed on a 1.3km2 (0.8mi2) plot of land.

We must keep alive aspirations which can remain valid throughout the longest and darkest period of universal calamity and degradation." [...] The poem also relied on the war {{as a way to}} connect to Eliot's idea that there was a united humanity. In particular, Stephen Spender claimed that [...] "the war modified [...] attitude by convincing him that there was a Western cause to be positively defended. And after the war there was a Germany to be brought back within the Western tradition".|$|E

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, Peace on Earth {{was written}} {{based on the}} {{question}} [...] "How do you know there's peace on earth {{in a world that}} isn't very peaceful?" [...] Hall opined that when people hear Christmas carols, they often don't hear their true message. Hall intended the album to help people rediscover the worshipful nature behind the carols. As an example of a message he wanted people to hear, he gave [...] "I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day", a song written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow about his rediscovery of hope amidst several personal tragedies. Hall felt that the song's <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> was one that his kids and their generation needed to hear. As a co-producer on the album, Hall wanted to introduce aspects and ideas that the band had not done before, and he felt the album offered a chance to branch out. He wanted the band's female members, Megan Garrett and Melodee DeVevo, to play a more prominent role, in part to show people [...] "the gifts they have".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Thomas Newman. He {{felt that it}} already elicited such strong emotions without music that he {{found it difficult to}} compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, [...] "Shawshank Redemption," [...] plays during Andy's escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a [...] "triumphal flourish" [...] and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. [...] "So Was Red," [...] played following Red's release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy's cache, became one of Newman's favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add [...] harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope.</b> According to Darabont, harmonica player Tommy Morgan [...] "casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take," [...] and this is heard in the finished film. Newman's score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Weizsäcker's {{speech was}} praised both nationally and internationally. The New York Times {{called it a}} [...] "sober <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope</b> to the uneasy generations of young West Germans". The {{president}} of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Werner Nachmann, thanked Weizsäcker for his strong words, as did Karl Ibach, {{a former member of}} the German Resistance, who called his speech a [...] "moment of glory (Sternstunde) of our republic". Weizsäcker was however criticized for some of his remarks by members of his own party. Lorenz Niegel, a politician of the sister party CSU, who had not taken part in the ceremony, objected to the term [...] "day of liberation", referring to it instead as a [...] "day of deepest humiliation". The Greens were also absent during the speech, choosing instead to visit Auschwitz. A year later, the Green politician Petra Kelly called the speech [...] "correct, but not more than self-evident", pointing to speeches president Gustav Heinemann had made during his presidency. The harshest criticism came from the Federation of Expellees, whose president Herbert Czaja, while thanking the president for highlighting the expellees' fate, criticized his remark that [...] "conflicting legal claims must be subordinated under the imperative of reconciliation".|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{around the}} world sought to {{interpret}} {{the relationship between the}} Na'vi and humans in the film, mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov, who wrote in the Hindustan Times and The Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "The 'civilised humans' turn out as primitive, jaded and increasingly greedy, cynical, and brutal—traits only amplified by their machinery—while the 'monkey aliens' emerge as noble, kind, wise, sensitive and humane. We, along with the Avatar hero, are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews." [...] Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience, like the film's hero, Jake, would find that the Na'vi's culture was really the more civilized of the two, exemplifying [...] "the qualities of kindness, gratitude, regard for the elder, self-sacrifice, respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature." [...] Echoing this analysis, psychologist Jeffery Fine in The Miami Herald urged [...] "every man, woman and child" [...] to see the film and wake up to its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism, which is [...] "steamrolling our soul and consciousness", and reconnection with all life as [...] "the only... promise of survival" [...] for humanity. [...] Similarly, an Angolan critic saw the film as a <b>message</b> <b>of</b> <b>hope,</b> writing, [...] "With this union of humans and aliens comes a feeling that something better exists in the universe: the respect for life." [...] Cameron confirmed that [...] "the Na'vi represent the better aspects of human nature, and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature." ...|$|E

[...] The Reagan campaign briefly used [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", a song criticizing the treatment of Vietnam War veterans (which they mistakenly thought was devoid of anti-war content), as {{a campaign}} song, without permission, until Springsteen, a lifelong Democrat, insisted that they stop.|$|E
