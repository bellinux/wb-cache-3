For another, Spears' vocals were the real thing, as she sang in an alluringly low tone [...] but capably hit the high notes , however, she left the upper-octave duties to her background singers [...] during Spears' most strenuous dance routines". Richard Leiby of The Washington Post believed that the show [...] " [...] great". Dan Aquilante of the New York Post said that Spears [...] "seemed to be enjoying the show as much as her fans. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Mariah-like cowboy hat pushed back on her noggin or possibly the stripper's pole borrowed from Madonna's prop closet, [...] Spears was in her element and having a ball". Letta Tayler of Newsday said [...] "For half the show, she remained the old Britney, the budding teen who dreamed of romance.

30|$|Steroid {{saponins}} {{have been}} reported to possess a wide range of biological activities including antibacterial (Gan et al. 2014), antifungal (Wang et al. 2015), immuno inhibitory (Nunez 1988). The bioactivity of steroidal <b>is</b> due to <b>the</b> presence of a steroid nucleus in its structure, which can <b>be</b> damage to <b>the</b> membrane and leakage of cellular materials, ultimately leading to bacteria and fungus death (Moulin-Traffort et al. 1998). So steroidal saponins maybe also have a significant role against the growth of T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes. The role of the isolated steroidal compounds on persons’ health should be further investigated to understand its action in vivo. Sesquiterpene lactones possessed very high antifungal activity (Vajs et al. 1999). The biological activity of sesquiterpene lactones is generally attributed to the alkylating property of the α-methylene-γ-lactone moiety, and the presence of other alkylating sites (epoxides and conjugated carbonyl groups) may enhance their biological activities. Moreover, their lipophilicity seems {{to play an important role}} in antifungal activity. Since the chemical composition of the fungal cells walls is highly lipophilic, they generally represent strong barriers for the penetration of hydrophilic compounds, and the transport of polar compounds through the outer lipid layer of fungi is retarded (Skaltsa et al. 2000). Flavonoids can complex with extracellular soluble proteins and bacterial cell walls, <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason which Flavonoids possess antimicrobial activity (Hossain et al. 2013), more lipophilic flavonoids may also disrupt microbial membranes (Ghanbari et al. 2012).|$|R
