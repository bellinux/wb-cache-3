This replaces the elements (zeroes and ones) of the standard adjacency matrix of the interchange graph of a <b>kinematic</b> <b>system</b> by integer elements representing the numbers of constrained degrees of freedom (dof) throughout the system. It is shown that, as motion faults develop progressively within a particular <b>kinematic</b> <b>system,</b> the succession of kinematic states lies along a trajectory in an abstract kinematic fault space derived from Constraints Matrix eigenvalues.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a novel hierarchical model to partition a <b>kinematic</b> <b>system</b> into {{a set of}} nested subsystems. This is framed in a mixed real/virtual context, where some joints and links may exist in simulation only. We then use this capability to build a precise form of kinematic abstraction, where a potentially complex subsystem can be virtually replaced by a simpler “interface. ” Hierarchy and abstraction are interesting because they can help manage complexity in large (100 + DoF) mixed real/virtual mechanisms. We prove that checking if an abstraction is proper is PSPACE-hard, but show that even improper abstractions can be useful. Topological algorithms are presented for decomposing a hierarchical or abstracted <b>kinematic</b> <b>system</b> into subsystems that can be treated in isolation, thus speeding up kinematic computations.
