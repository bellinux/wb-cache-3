5|$|Any {{electrical}} current generates a magnetic field; neural oscillations induce weak magnetic fields, and in functional <b>magnetoencephalography</b> the current produced can show localised brain function in high resolution. Tractography uses MRI and image analysis to create 3D {{images of the}} nerve tracts of the brain. Connectograms give a graphical representation of the neural connections of the brain.|$|E
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG) is an imaging {{modality}} that uses very sensitive magnetometers {{to measure the}} magnetic fields resulting from ionic currents flowing through neurons in the brain. High-quality MEG machines allow for sub-millisecond sampling rates.|$|E

The {{multifocal}} {{nature of}} epileptogenicity in Panayiotopoulos syndrome has been also documented with MEG, which {{revealed that the}} main epileptogenic areas are along the parietal-occipital, the calcarine, or the central (rolandic) sulci. Patients with frontal spikes were significantly older than patients with spikes on rolandic, parieto-occipital, or calcarine sulci. Follow-up MEG demonstrated shifting localization or disappearance of MEG spikes.|$|E
25|$|Measurement and {{recording}} techniques {{which are not}} primarily designed to produce images, such as electroencephalography (EEG), <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG), electrocardiography (ECG), and others represent other technologies which produce data susceptible to representation as a parameter graph vs. time or maps which contain data about the measurement locations. In a limited comparison these technologies {{can be considered as}} forms of medical imaging in another discipline.|$|E
25|$|Newer, {{non-invasive}} techniques {{now include}} brain imaging by {{positron emission tomography}} (PET); {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) and <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG); and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in psycholinguistics.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} amount of research concerns brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music perception and performance. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields, and use such techniques as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and positron emission tomography (PET).|$|E

In conjunction with qualitative research methods, it can provide deep understanding into what, how and why people consume. Measuring eye tracking in e-service marketing {{is another example of}} quantitative biological methods measuring the way we consume. It analyses how consumers shop in an online environment by recording the number of mouse clicks and click maps based on eye movement.|$|E
25|$|For {{prospective}} memory, the {{parietal lobe}} {{is important for}} recognizing cues that trigger an intended action, especially when the cues are visual or spatial. The parietal lobe is also responsible for maintaining attention on the intended action and inhibiting other activities during performance. Studies using PET {{have shown that the}} parietal lobe is activated when participants engage in prospective memory tasks involving visual information such as remembering a series of numbers. Activation of the parietal lobe is also evident in studies using <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG) which traces electric activity of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Superconductors {{are used}} to build Josephson {{junctions}} which are {{the building blocks of}} SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices), the most sensitive magnetometers known. SQUIDs are used in scanning SQUID microscopes and <b>magnetoencephalography.</b> Series of Josephson devices {{are used to}} realize the SI volt. Depending on the particular mode of operation, a superconductor-insulator-superconductor Josephson junction {{can be used as a}} photon detector or as a mixer. The large resistance change at the transition from the normal- to the superconducting state is used to build thermometers in cryogenic micro-calorimeter photon detectors. The same effect is used in ultrasensitive bolometers made from superconducting materials.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG) is a {{functional}} neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently {{the most common}} magnetometer, while the SERF (spin exchange relaxation-free) magnetometer is being investigated for future machines. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of {{various parts of the}} brain, and neurofeedback. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity.|$|E
25|$|Phase {{resetting}} also {{permits the}} study of evoked activity, a term used in electroencephalography and <b>magnetoencephalography</b> for responses in brain activity that {{are directly related to}} stimulus-related activity. Evoked potentials and event-related potentials are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or spontaneous activity, are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are phase-locked to the stimulus or event. Evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity, although this is an ongoing debate.|$|E
25|$|It {{may also}} be {{possible}} to create functional 3D maps of the brain activity, using advanced neuroimaging technology, such as functional MRI (fMRI, for mapping change in blood flow), <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG, for mapping of electrical currents), or combinations of multiple methods, to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods. Today, fMRI is often combined with MEG for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, as the methods complement each other. Even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan, important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies.|$|E
25|$|Neurophysiological methods rely on {{utilizing}} information {{stemming from}} more direct {{and not necessarily}} conscious (pre-attentative) processes. Subjects are presented with speech stimuli in different types of tasks and {{the responses of the}} brain are measured. The brain itself can be more sensitive than it appears to be through behavioral responses. For example, the subject may not show sensitivity to the difference between two speech sounds in a discrimination test, but brain responses may reveal sensitivity to these differences. Methods used to measure neural responses to speech include event-related potentials, <b>magnetoencephalography,</b> and near infrared spectroscopy. One important response used with event-related potentials is the mismatch negativity, which occurs when speech stimuli are acoustically different from a stimulus that the subject heard previously.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} neurons can also {{generate}} oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up (constructive interference). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which {{gives rise to}} large-amplitude oscillations of the local field potential. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) and <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far {{too small to be}} picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation. Neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of large-scale oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page). Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity endogenously through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory interneurons {{play an important role in}} producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.|$|E

Combined with MRI, {{they were able}} to study the association between tuberous areas of the brain, neuronal malfunctioning and epileptogenic areas. Later studies would confirm that MEG is superior to EEG in identifying the eliptogenic tuber, which may be a candidate for surgical resection.|$|E
500|$|Mu waves, {{also known}} as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or {{sensorimotor}} rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, {{in the part of}} the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), <b>magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called [...] of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree.|$|E

2500|$|Cohen has {{developed}} new approaches and methodologies for assessing memory.

Some {{of the techniques}} involved are functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Diffuse Optical Imaging, Event Related Brain Potentials (ERPs), and <b>Magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG). [...] Techniques such as eye movements {{make it possible to}} assess responses without relying on verbal reports. [...] Computers can be used to examine where a person directs their attention, and relate patterns of attention to the person's previous exposure to a stimulus and their conscious and unconscious levels of response.|$|E
2500|$|Fiduciary markers {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of medical imaging applications. Images of the same subject {{produced}} with two different imaging systems may be correlated (called image registration) by placing a fiduciary marker in the area imaged by both systems. [...] In this case, a marker which is visible in the images produced by both imaging modalities must be used. [...] By this method, functional information from SPECT or positron emission tomography can be related to anatomical information provided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Similarly, fiducial points established during MRI can be correlated with brain images generated by <b>magnetoencephalography</b> to localize the source of brain activity.|$|E
2500|$|Pareidolia {{can cause}} people to {{interpret}} random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 <b>magnetoencephalography</b> study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform face area {{at a time and}} location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon. [...] A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.|$|E
2500|$|Medical imaging is the {{generating}} {{of visual}} {{representations of the}} interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Medical imaging reveals details of internal physiology that help medical professionals plan appropriate treatments for tissue infection and trauma. [...] Medical imaging is also central in supplying the biometric data necessary to establish baseline features of anatomy and physiology so as to increase the accuracy with which early or fine-detail abnormalities are detected. [...] These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with general pathology procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the pathogenesis of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases. [...] Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include radiology (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray radiography) magnetic resonance imaging, [...] medical ultrasonography (or ultrasound), endoscopy, elastography, tactile imaging, thermography, medical photography, nuclear medicine and functional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography. [...] Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving electroencephalography, <b>magnetoencephalography,</b> and electrocardiography often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Magnetoencephalography</b> (MEG) is an imaging {{technique}} {{used to measure}} the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain via extremely sensitive devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). MEG offers a very direct measurement of neural electrical activity (compared to fMRI for example) with very high temporal resolution but relatively low spatial resolution. The advantage of measuring the magnetic fields produced by neural activity is that {{they are likely to be}} less distorted by surrounding tissue (particularly the skull and scalp) compared to the electric fields measured by electroencephalography (EEG). [...] Specifically, it can be shown that magnetic fields produced by electrical activity are not affected by the surrounding head tissue, when the head is modeled as a set of concentric spherical shells, each being an isotropic homogeneous conductor. Real heads are non-spherical and have largely anisotropic conductivities (particularly white matter and skull). While skull anisotropy has negligible effect on MEG (unlike EEG), white matter anisotropy strongly affects MEG measurements for radial and deep sources. Note, however, that the skull was assumed to be uniformly anisotropic in this study, which is not true for a real head: the absolute and relative thicknesses of diploë and tables layers vary among and within the skull bones. This makes it likely that MEG is also affected by the skull anisotropy, although probably not to the same degree as EEG.|$|E
2500|$|Spontaneous {{activity}} is brain {{activity in the}} absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting-state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses. [...] The term ongoing brain {{activity is}} used in electroencephalography and <b>magnetoencephalography</b> for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a stimulus or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form evoked potentials/evoked fields, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be noise if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis. [...] Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as alpha waves, are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low-amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a noise process. In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the default network. The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands.|$|E
