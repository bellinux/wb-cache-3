5|$|Although {{tellurium}} {{is found}} with gold <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than in uncombined form, {{it is found}} even <b>more</b> <b>often</b> combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.|$|E

Temporal lobe epileptics had such disturbances much <b>more</b> <b>oftener.</b> The commonest diagnostic label {{in both the}} groups was behaviour disorder, followed by neuroses.

50|$|Social {{conservatism}} {{is distinct}} from cultural conservatism, {{although there are some}} overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social <b>mores,</b> <b>often</b> by opposing what they consider radical policies or social engineering. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.|$|R
50|$|Social conservatives {{demand a}} return to {{traditional}} morality and social <b>mores,</b> <b>often</b> through civil law or regulation. Social change away from traditional values is generally regarded as suspect, while social values based on tradition are generally regarded as tried, tested and true. It is a view commonly associated with religious conservatives, particularly Evangelicals or conservative Roman Catholics.|$|R

5|$|When tufted males clap, females look {{towards them}} and display {{a greater number}} of tap {{displays}} to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping <b>more</b> <b>often</b> by settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens from side to side.|$|E
5|$|A female P. labiata <b>more</b> <b>often</b> pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it <b>more</b> <b>often</b> catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, it {{is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E

These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found that Black signers not only used constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white signers.|$|E
5|$|About 6% {{of those}} with {{epilepsy}} have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures. Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli. Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises. In certain types of epilepsy, seizures happen <b>more</b> <b>often</b> during sleep, and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping.|$|E
5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced <b>more</b> <b>often</b> {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the emperor}} held supreme power, he <b>more</b> <b>often</b> sought {{the advice of}} his cabinet and other ministers before making {{decisions}} and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (tingyi 廷議). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of old ones, complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation. Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. <b>More</b> <b>often</b> than not, he was forced to accept the majority consensus of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.|$|E

He was then promoted to the Under-22s, where he scored 44 and took 4/71 in his first match against Saurashtra, prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team.|$|E
5|$|Being a quintessential part of vespers, evensong or matins, the Magnificat was, already {{for over}} a century before Bach's composition, the liturgical text that was most often set to music apart from the Mass ordinary.
