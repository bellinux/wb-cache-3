5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews across the country to affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>food</b> bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it. Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 This study {{sought to}} examine food choice motives and {{influences}} among Oregon Latinos to gain {{a greater understanding of}} their dietary acculturation. Previous studies relying principally on quantitative methods to assess the relationship between acculturation and diet have reported inconsistent results, though a general decline in diet quality is reported with increased acculturation. In contrast, this research used quantitative and qualitative methods and revealed some positive dietary changes with increased acculturation. Quantitative surveys were used to collect data on frequency of consuming traditional <b>Mexican</b> <b>foods</b> versus mainstream American foods among self-identified Latino parents and their 10 - 13 year old children. Interviews were then conducted to elicit influential factors on making traditional Mexican vs. mainstream American food choices. Data from the surveys suggest that parents are consuming traditional <b>Mexican</b> <b>foods</b> at a higher frequency than the children and the children are consuming mainstream American foods at a higher frequency than the parents. The interviews elicited themes that included: preference for <b>Mexican</b> <b>foods,</b> a value for ethnic identity, perceptions for valuing both Mexican and mainstream American foods, a preference for fresh, homemade food, ease of maintaining <b>Mexican</b> <b>foods</b> upon immigration, acculturation impact upon food choice, family and social network influences, increased health knowledge, and heavy is healthy. The qualitative piece of the study suggests dietary acculturation is highly complex and qualitative methods may prove worthwhile in achieving clarity in understanding of the process...|$|R

25|$|Food {{insecurity}} has distressed Mexico {{throughout its}} history and continues {{to do so in}} the present. Food availability is not the issue; rather, severe deficiencies in the accessibility of food contributes to the insecurity. Between 2003 and 2005, the total <b>Mexican</b> <b>food</b> supply was well above the sufficient to meet the requirements of the Mexican population, averaging 3,270 kilocalories per daily capita, higher than the minimum requirements of 1,850 kilocalories per daily capita. However, at least 10 percent of the population in every Mexican state suffers from inadequate food access. In nine states, 25–35 percent live in food-insecure households. More than 10 percent of the populations of seven Mexica states fall into the category of Serious Food Insecurity.|$|E
25|$|On 13 September 2017, Collins Foods {{announced}} that Taco Bell {{would return to}} the Australian market, with their first store being situated in the Brisbane suburb of Annerley in Queensland using a refurbished Sizzler restaurant which had closed earlier that year. The Annerley store opened on Saturday 4 November 2017 with about 50 people camping out overnight to be first to try the store. The store has 96 seats in indoor and outdoor settings and has an open kitchen so diners can see their food being prepared. There is also a drive-through. The menu appears to be a subset of the USA menu based on food tasting research undertaken by the company. The Annerley store does not have a breakfast menu, but offers beers and margaritas similar to their <b>Mexican</b> <b>food</b> competitors in the Australian market.|$|E
25|$|Taco Bell {{was founded}} by Glen Bell, who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in San Bernardino, California in 1946 when he was 23 years old. In 1950, he opened Bell's Hamburgers and Hot Dogs in San Bernardino's West Side barrio. According to Gustavo Arellano, author of Taco USA: How <b>Mexican</b> <b>Food</b> Conquered America, Bell watched long lines of {{customers}} at a Mexican restaurant called the Mitla Cafe, located across the street, which attracted a dedicated customer base for its hard-shelled tacos. Bell began eating there regularly, attempting to reverse-engineer the recipe, and eventually won {{the confidence of the}} proprietors such that they allowed him to see how the tacos and other foods were prepared. In late 1951 or early 1952, he took what he had learned and opened a new stand, this time selling tacos under the name of Taco-Tia.|$|E

500|$|Like {{many other}} western towns, the {{earliest}} restaurants in Phoenix were often steakhouses. Today, Phoenix is also {{renowned for its}} <b>Mexican</b> <b>food,</b> thanks to both its large Hispanic population and its proximity to Mexico. Some of Phoenix's restaurants have a long history. The Stockyards steakhouse dates to 1947, while Monti's La Casa Vieja (Spanish for [...] "The Old House") was in operation as a restaurant since the 1890s, but closed its doors November 17, 2014. [...] Macayo's (a Mexican restaurant chain) was established in Phoenix in 1946, and other major Mexican restaurants include Garcia's (1956) and Manuel's (1964). The recent population boom has brought {{people from all over}} the nation, and to a lesser extent from other countries, and has since influenced the local cuisine. Phoenix currently boasts cuisines from all over the world, such as Korean, barbecue, Cajun/Creole, Greek, Hawaiian, Irish, Japanese, sushi, Italian, fusion, Persian, Indian (South Asian), Spanish, Thai, Chinese, southwestern, Tex-Mex, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and French.|$|E
500|$|In 1990 Jarre {{released}} En Attendant Cousteau (Waiting for Cousteau), {{inspired by}} the French oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau. On Bastille Day 1990 he performed a concert at La Défense in Paris, attended by a record-breaking audience of about two million people, again beating his earlier world record. He later promoted a concert near the Pyramids of Teotihuacan in Mexico, to be held during the solar eclipse of 11 July 1991. However, with only weeks to go, important equipment had not arrived and the sinking in the Atlantic Ocean of a cargo ship containing the purpose-built pyramidal stage and other technical equipment made staging the concert impossible. Jarre's disappointment was such that he [...] "could not cope with <b>Mexican</b> <b>food</b> for two years". About two years later he released Chronologie, an album which was largely influenced by the techno-music scene. From a technical standpoint the album is a reversion to a concept seen in Jarre's Oxygène/Équinoxe period, where a grandiose overture precedes more rhythmic sections. The album features Jarre's traditional collection of instruments like the ARP 2600 and Minimoog, as well as newer synthesisers such as the Roland JD-800 and the Kurzweil K2000.|$|E

2500|$|The largest {{outbreak}} of hepatitis A virus in United States history occurred {{among people who}} ate at a now defunct <b>Mexican</b> <b>food</b> restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003. Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result. The outbreak {{was brought to the}} attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in [...] cases of hepatitis A in the county. After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the source of the outbreak to the use of contaminated raw green onion. The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time. It is believed that the green onions may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected individuals. Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude. The CDC believes that the restaurant's use of a large communal bucket for chopped raw green onion allowed non-contaminated plants to be mixed with contaminated ones, increasing the number of vectors of infection and amplifying the outbreak. The restaurant was closed once it was discovered to be the source, and over 9,000 people were given hepatitis A immune globulin because they had either eaten at the restaurant or had been in close contact with someone who had.|$|E
