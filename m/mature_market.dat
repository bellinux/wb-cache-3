5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a <b>mature</b> <b>market</b> such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

25|$|Glass {{container}} manufacture in {{the developed}} world is a <b>mature</b> <b>market</b> business. World demand for flat glass was approximately 52 million tonnes in 2009. The United States, Europe and China account for 75% of demand, with China's consumption having increased from 20% in the early 1990s to 50%. Glass container manufacture is also a geographical business; the product is heavy and large in volume, and the major raw materials (sand, soda ash and limestone) are generally readily available, therefore production facilities need to be located close to their markets. A typical glass furnace holds hundreds of tonnes of molten glass, and so it is simply not practical to shut it down every night, or in fact in any period short of a month. Factories therefore run 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This means that there is little opportunity to either increase or decrease production rates by more than a few percent. New furnaces and forming machines cost {{tens of millions of dollars}} and require at least 18 months of planning. Given this fact, and the fact that there are usually more products than machine lines means that products are sold from stock. The marketing/production challenge is therefore to be able to predict demand both in the short 4- to 12-week term and over the 24- to 48-month-long term. Factories are generally sized to service the requirements of a city; in developed countries there is usually a factory per 1–2 million people. A typical factory will produce 1–3 million containers a day.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} influence of shopping motivations on impulse buying behaviour and compares these effects in emergent and <b>mature</b> <b>markets.</b> Shopping is becoming a gradually hedonic activity worldwide with {{an increasing number of}} multichannel buying opportunities. Unexpectedly, the research on the relations between shopping motivations and impulse buying does not exit, yet. Impulsive buying behaviour is a widely recognized phenomenon in <b>mature</b> <b>markets.</b> It is even estimated that 40 percent of all money spent is through impulse buying. While impulse buying has been much studied in <b>mature</b> <b>markets,</b> especially in the U. S., {{there have been a few}} studies in emergent markets. Data were collected from 520 female shopping mall visitors in four countries representing two <b>mature</b> <b>markets</b> (the Netherlands and Germany) and two emerging markets (Turkey and Russia) and analysed with structural equation modelling. There were significant differences in the effect of gratification, adventure, value, and quality seeking motivation on impulse buying, but not the ones of role play, social and idea. Adventure and gratification motivation influenced positively impulse buying both markets. Value motivation negatively influenced impulsive buying in <b>mature</b> <b>markets,</b> but opposite of it in emerging markets. Value motivation was not hedonic in mature markets; however it was both hedonic and utilitarian value in emerging markets. The effect of quality seeking motivation on utilitarian value was only significant in emerging markets. We additionally discuss several implications for marketers...|$|R
