In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice {{at the age of}} two, on improvised skis. [...] At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby Huseby installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: [...] "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... hen I came down again I bored into the snow up to <b>my</b> <b>waist.</b> The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." [...] Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of Telemark, where a new style of skiing was being developed. [...] "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.|$|E

Critics compared the riff to [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011) by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan. [...] "In the Dark" [...] opens with Dev's sing-talk vocal style as she sings [...] "On <b>my</b> <b>waist,</b> through my hair / Think about it when you touch me there / Close my eyes, here you are dance-dance-dancing in the dark." [...] According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio, the line borrows the melody from Reel 2 Real's [...] "I Like to Move It" [...] (1994). [...] "In the Dark" [...] sees Dev using her singing voice more than her distinctive sing-talk style. Lyrically, the song speaks of sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight, as Dev repeats the line, [...] "I got a sex drive that's push to start". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "In the Dark" [...] is written in the time signature of common time and set in a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of C minor and Dev's vocals span from the note of A4 to the note of B5. It has a basic sequence of Cm–E6–A5–G5 as its chord progression.|$|E

I had on the short skirts of last year, and I could feel ten thousand eyes fastened on my high-heeled boots, which you know I never went to extremes in. I confess my face burned a little, to realize what a scarecrow I must look, when I glanced round at those Altrurian women, whose pretty, classic fashions made the whole place like a field of lilacs and irises, and knew that they were as comfortable as they were beautiful.

I tugged at it, and thought so. I passed the rope round it like a pulley, and then tied it about <b>my</b> own <b>waist.</b> I had a happy thought: I could use myself as a windlass. I turned on my feet for a pivot. Elsie helped me to pull. 'Up you go!' I cried, cheerily. We wound slowly, for fear of shaking him.

But the pulley helped us, and Elsie, spurred by need, put forth more reserve of nervous strength than I could easily have believed lay in that tiny body. I twisted myself round and round, close to the edge, so as to look over from time to time, but not at all quickly, for fear of dizziness. The rope strained and gave. It was a deadly ten minutes of suspense and anxiety. Twice or thrice as I looked down I saw a spasm of pain break over Harold's face; but when I paused and glanced inquiringly, he motioned me to go on with my venturesome task. There was no turning back now. We had almost got him up when the rope at the edge began to creak ominously.|$|R

I was one who could never be still, nor settle down to a quiet existence. After I came to own my own ship there is hardly a port from Archangel to Australia which I have not entered. I was rough and wild and free, but there was one at home, sir, who was prim and white-handed and soft-tongued, skilful in little fancies and conceits which women love.

I dashed between them and caught her round the <b>waist.</b> <b>My</b> men beat back the frightened bridegroom and the lookers on. We bore her down to the boat and aboard our vessel, and then getting up anchor we sailed away across the White Sea until the spires of Archangel sank down behind the horizon. She had my cabin, my room, every comfort. I slept among the men in the forecastle. I hoped that in time her aversion to me would wear away, and that she would consent to marry me in England or in France. For days and days we sailed. We saw the North Cape die away behind us, and we skirted the grey Norwegian coast, but still, in spite of every attention, she would not forgive me for tearing her from that pale-faced lover of hers.

But before that, she was interviewed and she answered: “I’ve been preparing myself for several months mentally, spiritually, emotionally and of course, physically,” “We have won four Miss International titles so far so it’s a big challenge for me to bring home a fifth one. But I’m keeping my fingers crossed,” “Precious Lara is my role model,” “I will meet up with her for some tips. If I’m lucky enough to win, the first thing I’d do is board the next plane home so I can share the crown and celebrate with my kababayan,” She was also asked if she would join showbiz like her predecessors, she replied: “I love to sing and dance but don’t know how to act. I prefer TV hosting.” In another interview that talked about her preparations for the pageant: [...] "There {{are a lot of}} preparations. It's getting a little bit scary now, because it's closer, but we're doing a variety of things. We go to the gym to get more toned, more fit, and healthier. We also get health checkups, eating well to make sure I don't get sick, and recently we started to have personality development classes, language, history about the Philippines, and just interviewing skills, things like that," [...] Nicole reveals...."The pageant is very near and fills me with both excitement and eagerness to jump in there and give my very best. I have prepped myself with months of training in all aspects—physical, mental and spiritual, and I really hope I can bring pride to our country," [...] Nicole shares. [...] "If ever I'm lucky enough to win (fingers crossed!), the first thing I'd like to do is board the next plane home so I can share the crown and celebrate with my country. Then of course, I'd carry out my reign as Miss International 2012 {{to the best of my}} abilities. For me, the future is open to all possibilities—showbiz definitely included!" [...] In addition through Philippine Star: “I’m just so thrilled about the opportunity to bring honor to our country. If I’m lucky enough to win, the first thing I’d want to do is celebrate my victory with my fellow Filipinos,” said Nicole who believes that the modern Filipino is someone who confidently pushes for what she believes in. She also revealed her plans after she’s done with her beauty queen duties. “In the near future, I’d like to focus on Psychology here in the Philippines as it’s something that’s not really touched upon. My law degree would also come in handy for the legal aspects of it. Of course, the possibilities after the Miss International tilt are endless, and the future is open to just about everything, even show business.” Cosmopolitan Philippines had a chat with her before her departure for Japan:Name one common misconception people have about beauty queens?I think probably one of the most obvious ones is that we’re all beauty and no brains. But you know, if you really pay attention watching beauty pageants these days, you’ll really see that we’re all trying to achieve a lot, we’re all college students or graduates, and we all want to make a difference....You're a law student and a beauty queen. Is it easy or hard to reconcile the two?I think you can always find a way to integrate all aspects of your life, and being a lawyer definitely helps me in the question and answer portion, and I think both are having advocacy, arguing for what’s right....How does being a law student influence your beauty queen persona?I think both require a strong stance and a strong personality and a strong aura. So I guess being a law student has given me the confidence to be able to stand in front of a crowd and you know get my point across....What’s your number one advocacy?I think I really love to focus on children; they’re really my passion. Even in the psychology side, that’s what I’d like to focus on. really want to help their welfare, their health, their interests and inspire them to really reach their potential....What’s your everyday style?I think I have a very feminine look. I like clothes that flatter my shape especially, I guess, highlighting <b>my</b> small <b>waist.</b> I also like to feel comfortable. Relaxed yet feminine....Flats versus stilettos? Dresses versus jeans?Well, as a beauty queen, we should always wear stilettos. Generally, I enjoy wearing flats; they're more comfortable. I feel more relaxed day to day. for dresses versus jeans, there’s a time and place for both, but I like dresses; they’re more feminine and girly....Who is your style icon?Especially since I’m joining the 2012 Miss International Pageant, I would say that my style icon is Audrey Hepburn. She’s very timeless, classic, beautiful, feminine--all things that I want to embody as well....Beauty queens are always viewed as eternally poised, perfectly polished ladies. Tell us a fun, un-beauty queen-like fact about you?Well, I really like outdoor activities and extreme sports. I love the thrill of those types of things. I love rollercoasters. I love going camping. I hiked to the top of Mt. Pinatubo. I love adventure like water rafting, bungee jumping, things like that....What’s the most fearless thing you’ve done so far in terms of sports?I’ve done whitewater kayaking by myself in a small town in Boracay area, Antique. And they have really wild rapids. I’ve never done it before but I just went there, put on my helmet and went by myself and went kayaking. It was really fun....Any advice for fun, fearless Cosmo girls?Well I think as a young, independent Filipino woman of today, you can be anything you want to be. So just continue being fun and fearless. Try extreme sports like me; you can still be feminine, poised, and beautiful like a beauty queen. Don’t be discouraged. Just do it Put yourself out there and give it a shot.|$|R
