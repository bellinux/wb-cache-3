50|$|David Staller plays this {{undesirable}} {{husband as}} a man whose lust exempts nothing. Every time he appears onstage, you think: keep this person away from my babysitter and Rolex. Mr. Staller’s rogue posture modulates his character’s cruelty, leavening the play’s potentially stifling mood.Mr. Hamilton believed our most dangerous enemies were always {{in the room with}} us..., and his work can feel claustrophobic. <b>Ms.</b> <b>Moore</b> is aware of this, providing the proper ventilation to clear much of the Victorian must. Brian Murray, playing the detective who uncovers Manningham’s plan, is her greatest asset in this regard. He appears onstage with the red cheeks of a Santa Claus, an ageing imp who hides out in nooks and corners, showing a benevolent sarcasm that teases Bella out of her dimwitted complacency.|$|E
