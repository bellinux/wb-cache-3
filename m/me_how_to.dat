25|$|The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is {{one method}} of {{determining}} upper limb apraxia through the {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, {{the reliability and validity}} of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger on top of your nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use a hammer”) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.|$|E
