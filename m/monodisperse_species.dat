50|$|Analytical light {{scattering}} (ALS), also loosely {{referred to as}} SEC-MALS, is the implementation of static {{light scattering}} (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques in an online or flow mode. A typical ALS instrument consists of an HPLC/FPLC chromatography system coupled in-line with appropriate light scattering and refractive index detectors. The advantage of ALS over conventional steady-state light scattering methods {{is that it allows}} separation of molecules/macromolecules on a chromatography column prior to analysis with light scattering detectors. Accordingly, ALS enables one to determine hydrodynamic properties of a single <b>monodisperse</b> <b>species</b> as opposed to bulk or average measurements on a sample afforded by conventional light scattering.|$|E
40|$|Molecular weight {{fractions}} of linear polyethylene were irradiated at 133 C, in the completely molten and highly crystalline states, {{for the purpose}} of assessing the importance of chain-scission processes and establishing the critical conditions for gelation. The partitioning between sol and gel in either state was found to adhere to the theory for the intermolecular cross-linking of <b>monodisperse</b> <b>species</b> for dosages just beyond the gel point. Deviations from theory occurred as the dosage was increased further. It was concluded that main-chain scission, at these temperatures, is not a significant process. High molecular weight samples in the completely molten state obeyed the Flory-Stockmayer condition for critical gelation...|$|E
40|$|Model Pt/WOr/SiOr catalysts, {{prepared}} by “impregnation ” of a silica-covered TEM grid {{using the same}} precursor salts and pretreatment steps as those used for supported catalysts, were characterized with TEM by analyzing the same catalyst regions through the series of pretreatment steps. Overlayers appeared after a second calcination step following Pt impregnation. By a series of control experiments the overlayers were shown not to arise from carbon contamination, from impurities in the silica or Pt precursor, or from aging under ambient conditions. On the other hand, the mobility of W 03 was indicated. These observations qualitatively correlate to previous characterization of the real catalysts and suggest that the SMSI state in ptiWO,lSiOZ catalysts arises from mobile, <b>monodisperse</b> <b>species</b> of WOr formed during the second, low-temperature CakinatiOn Step. 0 1987 Academic Press, Inc...|$|E

40|$|New insight was gained {{into the}} acidity-reactivity {{relationships}} of sulfated zirconia (SZ) catalysts prepared via (NH 4) 2 SO 4 impregnation of Zr(OH) 4 for propanoic acid esterification with methanol. A family of systematically related SZs {{was characterized by}} bulk and surface analyses including XRD, XPS, TGA-MS, N 2 porosimetry, temperature-programmed propylamine decomposition, and FTIR of adsorbed pyridine, as well as methylbutynol (MBOH) as a reactive probe molecule. Increasing surface sulfation induces a transition from amphoteric character for the parent zirconia and low S loadings < 1. 7 wt %, evidenced by MBOH conversion to 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl- 2 -butanone, methylbutyne and acetone, with higher S loadings resulting in strong Brønsted-Lewis acid pairs {{upon completion of the}} sulfate monolayer, which favored MBOH conversion to prenal. Catalytic activity for propanoic acid esterification directly correlated with acid strength determined from propylamine decomposition, coincident with the formation of Brønsted-Lewis acid pairs identified by MBOH reactive titration. <b>Monodispersed</b> bisulfate <b>species</b> are likely responsible for superacidity at intermediate sulfur loadings...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a lattice {{model of a}} mixture of repulsive, attractive, or neutral <b>monodisperse</b> star (<b>species</b> A) and linear (species B) polymers with a third monomeric species C, which may represent free volume. The mixture is next to a hard, infinite plate whose interactions with A and C can be attractive, repulsive, or neutral. These two interactions are the only parameters necessary to specify {{the effect of the}} surface on all three components. We numerically study monomer density profiles using the method of Gujrati and Chhajer that has already been previously applied to study polydisperse and monodisperse linear-linear blends next to surfaces. The resulting density profiles always show an enrichment of linear polymers in the immediate vicinity of the surface, due to entropic repulsion of the star core. However, the integrated surface excess of star monomers is sometimes positive, indicating an overall enrichment of stars. This excess increases with the number of star arms only up to a certain critical number and decreases thereafter. The critical arm number increases with compressibility (bulk concentration of C). The method of Gujrati and Chhajer is computationally ultrafast and can be carried out on a PC, even in the incompressible case, when simulations are unfeasible. Calculations of density profiles usually take less than 20 minutes on PCs. Comment: 42 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of adenosylcobalamin-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase from Propionibacterium shermannii is isolated in an inactive form which contains a tightly bound cobalamin. Even when the enzyme was denatured in 5. 0 M guanidine hydrochloride the cobalamin remained associated with the protein. However, when dithiothreitol {{was added to the}} denatured protein, the pink inhibitor was rapidly converted into a yellow-brown compound which could be removed by dialysis. Enzyme activity could be recovered after removal of the denaturant, although surprisingly this did not depend on prior treatment with dithiothreitol. The interaction between the protein and inhibitor was investigated by using analytical ultracentrifugation under denaturing conditions. The sedimentation coefficient s 20,w was measured in various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. A complicated picture emerged in which at low denaturant concentrations subunit dissociation, partial unfolding and aggregation occur, whereas at high concentration the protein behaves as a <b>monodisperse</b> <b>species.</b> No major differences in sedimentation were observed between the enzyme-cobalamin complex and the cobalamin-free enzyme, suggesting that the inhibitor does not significantly stabilize higher-order structure within the protein...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Five {{different}} {{molecular weight}} phenolphthalein poly(aryl ether ketone) (PEK-C) fractions in CHCl 3 were studied by static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS). The dynamic LLS {{revealed that the}} PEK-C samples contain some large polymer clusters. These large clusters can be removed by filtering the solution with a 0. 1 -ím filter. We found that the persistence length of PEK-C in CHCl 3 at 25 °C is 2 nm and the Flory characteristic ratio, C∞, is 25.

40|$|The {{rapid and}} high-fidelity {{replication}} of DNA in bacteria {{is carried out}} by a molecular machine called the replisome, which {{is made up of}} a dozen different proteins. These include the primosome complex of DnaB 6 helicase and DnaG primase, complexed to the Pol III holoenzyme which is made up of two αεθ polymerase-exonuclease cores (one to replicate each parental strand), each in complex with a β 2 clamp and held in a pair by the clamp loader complex δγτ 2 δ’ψχ. Experiments with several of these proteins are reported here. A particular focus of this work is the structure and dynamics of the Bacillus spp. DnaB 6 helicase, DnaI helicase loader and their DnaB 6 -DnaI 6 complex. In this project, I used X-ray and neutron scattering techniques to characterise the structure and dynamics of DNA replication proteins from a variety of species. The recently developed technique of size-exclusion chromatography coupled small-angle Xray scattering (SEC-SAXS) was used extensively for structural measurements. The inline separation of samples into <b>monodisperse</b> <b>species</b> has allowed very high quality SAXS to be measured for samples that would otherwise have given compromised scattering data. The SAXS curves thus obtained have been used for both model building and model validation, as a complement to information from high-resolution structural techniques...|$|E
40|$|Microscopic {{structures}} of <b>monodispersed</b> rhodium dicarbonyl <b>species</b> chemisorbed on a ceramic metal-oxide support (?-alumina) {{have been obtained}} by density functional theory (DFT) calculations with periodic boundary conditions applied. Several minimum energy {{structures of}} species were obtained and their relative energies indicate that, in the most energetically stable geometry, the rhodium atom is coordinated in a square-planar environment and forms a four-membered Rh–O–Al–O ring, with one Al atom octahedrally coordinated. Another docking geometry, close lying in energy, also has a square-planar coordination for the rhodium atom and involves a six-membered Rh–O–Al–O–Al–O ring with one Al octahedrally coordinated and one Al tetrahedrally coordinated. Computed bond lengths {{were found to be}} in reasonable agreement with experimental bond lengths as determined by EXAFS spectroscopy. Theoretical Rh K-edge XANES spectra suggest that the pre-edge region probes electronic states localized on the RhI(CO) 2 unit, while postedge features probe the electronic states arising from the RhI(CO) 2 interaction with the support, which partly depends on the docking geometry of the RhI(CO) 2 units. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{graphene}} (i. e. monolayer carbon film) {{and carbon}} clusters supported on {{a transition metal}} surface are systematically studied by local probe techniques, {{with respect to their}} structures, electronic properties and formation mechanisms. The main tools used are low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS), which are introduced in Chapter 2. The mechanism of the resonance tunnelling at electron energies higher than the work function of the surface is discussed in detail, and a qualitative explanation of the Gundlach oscillations in the corresponding spectroscopy is presented. Epitaxial graphene synthesised on the Rh(111) surface by ethylene dehydrogenation is investigated by STM in Chapter 4. Such carbon film exhibits a hexagonal Moiré pattern due to a lattice mismatch between graphene and the rhodium substrate. The periodicity and local registries of the graphene/Rh(111) superstructure are carefully analysed. Based on a thorough discussion about the “commensurate vs. incommensurate” nature of the Moiré pattern in surface science field, the graphene/Rh(111) system is identified to have a non-simple-commensurate superstructure. The surface electronic properties and geometric buckling of graphene/Rh(111) are investigated by resonance tunnelling spectroscopy (RTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in Chapter 5. Spectroscopy measurements reveal a modulation of the electronic surface potential (or work function Φ) across the supercell of epitaxial graphene. Based on the microscopy/spectroscopy data and the extended DFT calculations, we examined the electronic coupling of the various local C-Rh registries, and identified both experimentally and theoretically the local atomic configurations of maximum and minimum chemical bonding between graphene and the rhodium substrate. We studied in Chapter 6 the growth mechanism of graphene on Rh(111) at elevated temperatures. This part starts by investigating the dehydrogenation of ethylene into ethylidyne. When the dehydrogenation process is complete, <b>monodispersed</b> carbon <b>species,</b> identified as 7 C 6, are found to dominate the cluster population on the rhodium terraces. A significant coalescence of the 7 C 6 clusters into graphene islands occurs at temperatures higher than 873 K. The structural and electronic properties of the 7 C 6 carbon clusters are examined by high-resolution STM and STS, and compared with coronene molecules, i. e. the hydrogenated analogues of 7 C 6. DFT calculations are further used to explain the stability of 7 C 6 supported on the Rh(111) surface, and also the structural characteristics of such magic-sized carbon clusters.

40|$|Lesions in {{the gene}} for frataxin, a nuclear−encoded {{mitochondrial}} protein, cause the recessively inherited condition Friedreich's ataxia. It is thought that the condition arises from disregulation of mitochondrial iron homeostasis, with concomitant oxidative damage leading to neuronal death. Very little is, as yet, known about the biochemical function of frataxin. Results: Here, we show that the mature form of recombinant frataxin behaves in solution as a <b>monodisperse</b> <b>species</b> that is composed of a 15 −residue−long unstructured N terminus and an evolutionarily conserved C−terminal region that is able to fold independently. The structure of the C−terminal domain consists of a stable seven−stranded antiparallel β sheet packing against a pair of parallel helices. The structure is compact with neither grooves nor cavities, features that are typical of iron−binding modules. Exposed evolutionarily conserved residues cover a broad area and all cluster on the β−sheet face of the structure, suggesting {{that this is a}} functionally important surface. The effect of two clinically occurring mutations on the fold was checked experimentally. When the mature protein was titrated with iron, no tendency to iron−binding or to aggregation was observed. Conclusions: Knowledge of the frataxin structure provides important guidelines as {{to the nature of the}} frataxin binding partner. The absence of all the features expected for an iron−binding activity, the large conserved area on its surface and lack of evidence for iron−binding activity strongly support an indirect involvement of frataxin in iron metabolism. The effects of point mutations associated with Friedreich's ataxia can be rationalised by knowledge of the structure and suggest possible models for the occurrence of the disease in compound heterozygous patient...|$|E
40|$|The thermal induced on-surface {{chemistry}} of large {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) deposited on dielectric substrates is very rich and complex. We evidence temperature-assisted (cyclo) dehydrogenation reactions for C 60 H 30 molecules and the subsequent bottom-up formation of assembled nanostructures, such as nanodomes, on the TiO 2 (110) surface. To this aim we have deposited, under ultra-high vacuum, a submonolayer coverage of C 60 H 30 and studied, {{by a combination of}} experimental techniques (STM, XPS and NEXAFS) and theoretical methods, the different chemical on-surface interaction stages induced by the increasing temperature. We show that room temperature adsorbed molecules exhibit a weak interaction and freely diffuse on the surface, as previously reported for other aromatics. Nevertheless, a slight annealing induces a transition from this (meta) stable configuration into chemisorbed molecules. This adsorbate-surface interaction deforms the C 60 H 30 molecular structure and quenches surface diffusion. Higher annealing temperatures lead to partial dehydrogenation, in which the molecule loses some of the hydrogen atoms and LUMO levels spread in the gap inducing a net total energy gain. Further annealing, up to around 750 K, leads to complete dehydrogenation. At these temperatures the fully dehydrogenated molecules link between them in a bottom-up coupling, forming nanodomes or fullerene-like <b>monodisperse</b> <b>species</b> readily on the dielectric surface. This work opens the door to the use of on-surface chemistry to generate new bottom-up tailored structures directly on high-K dielectric surfaces. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
