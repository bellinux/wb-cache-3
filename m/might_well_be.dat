5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
25|$|According to John Dominic Crossan, Jesus {{sent his}} disciples out to heal and to {{proclaim}} the Kingdom of God. They were {{to eat with}} those they healed rather than with higher status people who <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> honored to host a healer, and Jesus directed them to eat whatever was offered them. This implicit challenge to the social hierarchy was part of Jesus' program of radical egalitarianism. These themes of healing and eating are common in early Christian art.|$|E

25|$|Predictions {{that the}} batting would prove {{superior}} to the bowling and that the first Test <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> left unfinished were certainly justified; and yet there were three times when {{one side or the}} other might have gained a winning advantage... there was some very brilliant batting, some splendid bowling, and much good fielding and throwing. On the other hand there was rather too much indifferent batting, a surfeit of defensive bowling and tactics, and some deplorable fielding in which the simplest of chances were missed.|$|E
25|$|Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's {{theory of}} vision, {{but did not}} make any {{corresponding}} changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, teleology and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly {{came to realize that}} the universe itself <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. Many of the restrictions described by Aristotle and later favoured by the Catholic Church were thus challenged. This development from a physics infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward a physics where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries.|$|E

25|$|John Willis-Bund {{states that}} the battle of Camp Hill was {{remarkable}} {{from the fact that}} an armed mob—they were nothing more—twice repulsed assaults of the best troops in the Royalist army, who attacked them in overwhelming numbers. That less than 300 men should keep some 1,800 at bay, even for a short time, was an act that deserved to be recorded; that they, an untrained mob, should have checked the dreaded Royalist cavalry, was a still greater achievement. The Parliamentarians were delighted, and they had reason to be. Captain Greaves, probably a local man, {{a member of the family}} that lived at King's Norton, who commanded the Parliament troops, <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> proud of his men's achievement.|$|E
25|$|After the First Jewish–Roman War in 70 CE, the Roman {{authorities}} took {{measures to}} suppress the rebellious province of Judea. Instead of a procurator, they installed a praetor as a governor and stationed an entire legion, the X Fretensis, in the area. Tensions continued to build up {{in the wake of}} the Kitos War, the second large-scale Jewish insurrection in the Eastern Mediterranean during 115-117, the final stages of which saw fighting in Judea. Mismanagement of Roman governance during early 2nd century <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> behind the proximate causes of the revolt, largely bringing governors with clear anti-Jewish sentiments to run the province. Gargilius Antiques may have preceded Rufus during the 120s. The Church Fathers and rabbinic literature emphasize the role of Roman Governor Rufus in provoking the revolt.|$|E
25|$|After her arrest, she {{was allowed}} to retire early from the LAPD; she {{was held in the}} Los Angeles County Jail. A bail hearing was not held for almost six months. Judge Robert J. Perry {{surprised}} both sides when he set the amount at $10 million in cash, well above what the defense had suggested and more than twice what prosecutors had proposed. The case against her was very strong, he said, and thus she <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> at risk to flee the country or obtain weapons through her husband. Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, said the judge did not understand the case well and contrasted the high figure with the $1 million set for Robert Blake and Phil Spector when they were charged with murder. Several months later, her brother claimed she was not receiving adequate treatment for an unspecified cancer while in custody, either.|$|E

25|$|Swift's {{explanation}} {{for the title of}} the book is that the Ship of State was threatened by a whale (specifically, the Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes) and the new political societies (the Rota Club is mentioned). His book is intended to be a tub that the sailors of state (the nobles and ministers) might toss over the side to divert the attention of the beast (those who questioned the government and its right to rule). Hobbes was highly controversial in the Restoration, but Swift's invocation of Hobbes <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> ironic. The narrative of the brothers is a faulty allegory, and Swift's narrator is either a madman or a fool. The book is not one that could occupy the Leviathan, or preserve the Ship of State, so Swift may be intensifying the dangers of Hobbes's critique rather than allaying them to provoke a more rational response.|$|E
25|$|In May 1951, {{faced with}} {{reports on the}} {{increasingly}} potential capability of, and thus the threat posed by, the growing Soviet strategic bomber fleet and that nation's newly developed atomic weapons, the British Air Ministry proceeded to draft an Operational Requirement, OR 301, which sought a rocket-powered interceptor that could attain an altitude of 60,000ft (18,300 m) in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Many of the performance requirement laid out by OR 301 {{was due to the}} anticipation of rapid increases in performance by the opposing Soviet aircraft; by the early 1960s, it was suspected that these bombers <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> capable of supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2 with a potential operational altitude as high as 80,000ft. Avro's design team promptly set about designing an suitable interceptor that conformed with the specification's requirements, which would result in the Avro 720 proposal. In addition, various other proposals from a number of companies were received, including Bristol, Blackburn, Shorts and Saunders-Roe.|$|E
25|$|Model {{validation}} (MV) {{takes the}} models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> {{seen as a}} superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle {{to attract and retain}} adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.|$|E

25|$|A {{certain number}} of seats used for {{domestic}} purposes are of great interest. A {{good example of the}} long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the Musée Cluny, Paris. In the Museum at Rouen is a long seat of a movable kind with a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there {{is a good example of}} the typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th-12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth. The shadows, curves and twists only being emphasized by a few well-disposed cuts with a V tool; and of course the whole effect greatly improved by colour. A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the Victoria and Albert Museum, offer patterns that <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the hackneyed Elizabethan forms.|$|E
500|$|Serious {{doubt is}} {{emerging}} {{that reduces the}} likelihood that Archaeamphora longicervia belongs in the Sarraceniaceae lineage, or was even a pitcher plant at all. [...] Although Archaeamphora <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> {{a representative of the}} earliest flowering plants on Earth [...] it is very unlikely that it represents an ancestor of Sarraceniaceae since it is much too old {{to be part of the}} advanced [...] "crown group" [...] of Ericales to which Sarraceniaceae belong. [...] Another contradiction is that except for Archaeamphora, there is no other evidence to suggest that Sarraceniaceae evolved outside the New World, to which all extant members of the family are endemic.|$|E
500|$|Two songs, [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun" [...] are {{intended}} to imitate American popular songs of the 1940s. [...] In the former, the triple recitation of the song title at intervals suggests a big band arrangement of the wartime era, while in the bridge, the final eight bars (repeating the lyrics from the bridge's first eight bars) gives a suggestion of swing. [...] The sections beginning [...] "If the man don't understand you" [...] and [...] "If you laugh at different comics" [...] have a blues style. [...] Lovensheimer deems the song [...] "Nellie's spontaneous and improvisatory expression of her feelings through the vocabulary of popular song". Mordden suggests that [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with its [...] "take no prisoners bounce", <b>might</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> {{the center of the}} score, with the typical American girl defending her love by spouting clichés, many of which, such as [...] "corny as Kansas in August" [...] Hammerstein made up, and [...] "sure enough, over the years they have become clichés".|$|E
