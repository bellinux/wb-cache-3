In a curved apron <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand exits the mold vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the spray-chamber, the rollers gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. In a vertical <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> the strand stays vertical as it passes through the spray-chamber.

40|$|Purpose. This {{research}} is aimed {{to obtain the}} regression dependence of the machinability on the chemical composition of pig iron (C, Cr, Mn and Ni) in cast state. Methodology. The method of active experiment planning was used to build a mathematical model. Cast irons of composition 1. 09 … 3. 91 % С; 11. 43 … 25. 57 % Cr; 0. 6 … 5. 4 % Mn; 0. 19 … 3. 01 % Ni were studied. Cutting tools with plates 10 х 10 mm out of ВК 8 according to State Standard 19051 - 80 were used for turning. Cutting modes: cutting depth – 0. 8 mm, longitudinal feed – 0. 15 mm/rot., spindle’s rotation frequency during turning – 200 … 360 rot. /min. Lubricating and cooling liquids were not applied. Evaluation of iron workability was produced by determining the linear tool flank wear per unit length of the cutting path. Findings. Mathematically probabilistic equation of the regression dependence of the cutting tool’s wear on the C, Cr, Mn and Ni content in the <b>machined</b> <b>cast</b> iron were obtained. It was established that {{with the increase of}} Cr content in the cast iron to 14. 8 % the cutting tool’s wear decreased as a result of formation of carbide eutectic which destroyed the doped ledeburite continuous frame. Further increase of chromium content promoted appearing of chromic carbides with high microhardness which considerably increased the tool’s wear. The conducted research shown that the minimum cutting tool’s wear 0, 18 mkm/m was observed during the <b>machining</b> of <b>cast</b> iron containing: 1. 09 % C, 14. 8 % Cr, 2. 3 % Mn and 1. 2 % Ni; and the maximum wear is 48, 96 mkm/m – when the content was: 3. 91 % C, 11. 43 % Cr, 5. 4 % Mn and 0. 19 % Ni. The tool’s wear reached 47. 61 mkm/m during the treatment of cast iron containing 3. 91 % C, 25. 57 % Cr, 5. 4 % Mn and 0. 19 % Ni. Originality. Mathematically probabilistic model of the dependence of the cutting tool’s wear on the C, Cr, Mn and Ni content in the <b>machined</b> <b>cast</b> iron has been elaborated by the author.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of bridge orientation in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> on castability and quality of base metal castings. Methods: Three groups of patterns with different direction and lengths in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> were <b>casted</b> and then studied qualitatively and quantitatively using mean and standard deviation in table of frequency. Results: Larger nodules and porosities were on the joints of sprue in horizontal specimens (P= 0. 01 and 0. 048, respectively). There was no significant difference in castability between 3 -, 5 - and 6 -unit bridges in relation to their direction in <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> (P= 0. 5). An increase in bridge length led to more variation in length and width. The position of bridges also played an important role in the length variation in bridges. Conclusion: The direction of bridges had no effect on base metal castability but a vertical position resulted in a better casting quality and an increase in length of the bridges caused more defects in castings...|$|R

This thesis concerns with the development and implementation of the numerical model of temperature field for continuously cast steel billets and its use for optimal control of the <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> The numerical model was developed and implemented in MATLAB.

The model was then utilized as a part of the developed model-based predictive control system for the optimal control of dynamic situations in the <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> operation. The behaviour of the developed control system was examined by means of dynamic model situations that have confirmed the ability of the implemented system to optimally control dynamic operations of the continuous <b>casting</b> <b>machine.</b> Both the numerical model of the temperature field and the model-based predictive control system have been implemented so that they can be modified for any <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> and this allows for their prospective commercial applications...|$|R
