500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Psycho Therapy", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown {{into one of the}} most popular Ramones' song. Dee Dee recalled: [...] "I knew we needed a real 'Ramones song' for the album, and I knew [...] was {{depressed}} about how things were going. He needed that song to get excited about the band again." [...] The next track is another cover song, [...] "Time Has Come Today", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to have more of a [...] "garage" [...] feel to it, as compared to the original. [...] "My-My Kind of a Girl" [...] was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as [...] a [...] "lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur." [...] Dee Dee's [...] "Time Bomb", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be [...] "more ridiculous than frightening." [...] The album concludes with [...] "Everytime I Eat Vegetables It <b>Makes</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> You", which was said by author Todd Anderson to be a [...] "sing along." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{her first}} name is Kate, she chooses to go by KT, saying [...] " [...] just <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a buxom lass baking bread for her man working in the fields. I {{have no problem with}} that, but it's just not really how I pictured being a rock star." [...] Also, Tunstall spells {{her first name}} KT (as opposed to Katie) to {{differentiate}} herself from fellow singer Katie Melua. She also asserted that she derived [...] "KT" [...] from K-T impact, the name of a geological event that caused extinction of dinosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|The story {{depicts the}} effect of understimulation on the narrator's mental health and her descent into psychosis. With nothing to stimulate her, she becomes obsessed by the pattern and color of the wallpaper. [...] "It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all the yellow things I ever saw – not {{beautiful}} ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things. But {{there is something else}} about that paper – the smell! ... The only thing I can think of that it is like is the color of the paper! A yellow smell." ...|$|E

2500|$|Naturism addresses, {{challenges}} and explores {{a myriad of}} sometimes taboo subjects: stereotypes and mores relating to the nude appearance of the human body, mixed sex nudity, personal space, human sexuality, gymnophobia, modesty, physical attractiveness, vanity, objectification, [...] exploitation and consent. It can thus be controversial. Descamps [...] assembled a list of criticisms of naturism: it is too cold; normal bodies look ugly—it is only for the physically beautiful; it is too embarrassing; it is against the laws of nature, against the law, or against religion; [...] "nudism <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> sex"; it is for primitive people or animals.|$|E

6000|$|She resolutely {{took him}} to her {{favorite}} white and green cottages and Georgian houses.
