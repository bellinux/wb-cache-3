40|$|Your writer, in conjuring {{this tale}} of murder, adultery, incest, ghosts, {{redemption}} and remorse, takes you first to a daffodil-filled garden in Highgate, North London, where, just outside the kitchen window, something startling shimmers on the very edges of perception. Fluttering and chattering, these are our kehua - a whole <b>multiplying</b> <b>flock</b> of Maori spirits (all will be explained) goaded into wakefulness by the conversation within. Scarlet - a long-legged, skinny young woman {{of the new world}} order - has announced to Beverley - her aged grandmother - that she intends to leave home and husband for the glamorous actor, Jackson Wright - he of the vampire films. Beverley may be well on her way to her ninth decade, but she's not beyond using this intelligence to stir up a little trouble. And neither are the kehua outside the window. The sins and traumas of the past haunt us all. Call them hungry ghosts, grateful dead, dybbuks, kelpies, poltergeists, furies or kehua, we carry them with us - across continents, oceans, decades and generations. Quite how they became attached to a three-year-old white girl is the origin of your writer's tale. Suffice to say that murder {{is at the root of}} it all, that Beverley and her female bloodline carry a weighty spiritual burden and that this is the story of how they learn to live with their ghosts, or maybe how their ghosts learn to live with them...|$|R
60|$|But these {{means of}} traffic and travel soon ceased to suffice. Then the Ohio people {{felt the need}} of getting out with their {{increasing}} crops, their <b>multiplying</b> <b>flocks</b> and herds, and they made their need known to the nation, {{to which they were}} everywhere akin, and the nation answered through Congress by beginning, in 1806, the National Road, which was finished by 1838, from Baltimore as far as Indiana. This road first opened the East to Ohio; then in 1811 a steamboat made its appearance on the Beautiful River, and after that steam commanded all the Southern and Southwestern waters for us, {{as well as those of}} the inland seas on the North. Then, that all these waters might be united, the state began in 1825 to build a system of canals, from Cleveland to Portsmouth and from Toledo to Cincinnati. When these canals were completed, with their branches, they gave the people some nine hundred miles of navigable waters within their own borders. The main lines were built, not by companies for private profit as the railroads have since been built, but by the people for the people, and it may be said that the great prosperity of Ohio began with them. Wherever they ran they drained the swamps and made the land not only habitable but beautiful. They were dug by Ohio people, and the sixteen millions of dollars that they cost came back into the hands of the men who gladly taxed themselves for the outlay. The towns along their course grew, and new towns rose out of the forests and prairies.|$|R
50|$|In 1950 {{a single}} Whooping crane was {{captured}} and {{transported to the}} Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas joining twenty-six others {{as the last of}} the wild flock of whooping cranes in the world. The Louisiana bird died but the rest <b>multiplied</b> into a <b>flock</b> of three hundred. The main reason for starting new colonies are concerns that a single hurricane or disease outbreak could end in the extinction of the Whooping crane.|$|R
50|$|Lake Eyre itself lies {{approximately}} 16 m below sea level, {{and usually}} contains only salt. In flood years it fills {{and for a}} short time undergoes a period of rapid growth and fertility: long-dormant marine creatures <b>multiply</b> and large <b>flocks</b> of waterfowl arrive to feed and raise their young before the waters evaporate once more. The annual mean runoff in the Lake Eyre Basin is lowest of any of the world's major drainage basins.|$|R
40|$|NPIP-mandated {{serological}} {{screening of}} a <b>multiplier</b> breeder <b>flock</b> detected possible Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) exposure. The flock was quarantined and further samples including blood and choanal swabs were collected {{and sent to}} a research facility for independent testing and confirmation. Subsequent analyses included diagnosis by Serum Plate Agglutination (SPA), MG-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and culture identification. Results of the various diagnostic tests were compared. The findings of the various diagnostic tests were in agreement and confirmed MG infection of the breeder flock. Time requirements of the various diagnostic procedures were recorded and were 1 h, 27 h and 30 days for SPA, MG-specific PCR and culture identification, respectively. The results affirm {{the validity of the}} diagnostic procedures and emphasize the importance of timely screening and diagnostic procedures for control of MG...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Performance {{recording}} and genotyping in the multiplier tier of multi-tiered sheep breeding schemes could potentially reduce {{the difference in}} the average genetic merit between nucleus and commercial flocks, and create additional economic benefits for the breeding structure. Methods The genetic change in a multiple-trait breeding objective was predicted for various selection strategies that included performance recording, parentage testing and genomic selection. A deterministic simulation model was used to predict selection differentials and the flow of genetic superiority through the different tiers. Cumulative discounted economic benefits were calculated based on trait gains achieved in each of the tiers and considering the extra revenue and associated costs of applying recording, genotyping and selection practices in the multiplier tier of the breeding scheme. Results Performance recording combined with genomic or parentage information in the multiplier tier reduced the genetic lag between the nucleus and commercial flock by 20 to 030 years. The overall economic benefits of improved performance in the commercial tier offset the costs of recording the multiplier. However, it took more than 180 years before the cumulative net present value of benefits offset the costs at current test prices. Strategies in which recorded multiplier ewes were selected as replacements for the nucleus flock did modestly increase profitability when compared to a closed nucleus structure. Applying genomic selection is the most beneficial strategy if testing costs can be reduced or by genotyping only a proportion of the selection candidates. When the cost of genotyping was reduced, scenarios that combine performance recording with genomic selection were more profitable and reached breakeven point about 100 years earlier. Conclusions Economic benefits can be generated in <b>multiplier</b> <b>flocks</b> by implementing performance recording in conjunction with either DNA pedigree recording or genomic technology. These recording practices reduce the long genetic lag between the nucleus and commercial flocks in multi-tiered breeding programs. Under current genotyping costs, the time to breakeven was found to be generally very long, although this varied between strategies. Strategies using either genomic selection or DNA pedigree verification were found to be economically viable provided the price paid for the tests is lower than current prices, in the long-term...|$|R
40|$|Small {{ruminant}} {{production is}} widespread throughout all the ecological zones of West and Central Africa. The seasonal {{climate of the}} area influences growth and reproduction of the animals through its effects on forage availability and disease prevalence. Distribution of the breeds show evidence of ecological adaptation, the dwarf, trypanotolerant breeds being predominant in the humid areas while the larger, long-Iegged breeds predominate in the drier areas. There exist at least 11 sheep and 4 goat breeds indigenous to the regions but many are still poorly characterized. There is a great need for the standardization of breed names across national boundaries. Large gaps still exist in the available performance data {{for most of the}} breeds. Generally however, their reproductive rates are fairly high while growth rates and milk yields are low. Genetic improvement should be focussed on growth and reproductive traits. I for breed improvement on a national or regional scale, an open nucleus breeding scheme is recommended, involving central nucleus, <b>multiplier</b> and farmers <b>flocks.</b> Such a scheme should be backed by an effective extension service for maximum effect...|$|R
60|$|Deut. viii. 11-18. Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in {{not keeping}} his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; and when thy herds and thy <b>flocks</b> <b>multiply,</b> and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, {{and all that}} thou hast is multiplied; then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee forth out {{of the land of}} Egypt, from the house of bondage; who led thee through that great and terrible {{wilderness}}, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end: and thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. But thou shall remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.|$|R
5000|$|Kids for Kids {{supports}} {{grass roots}} projects that communities identify {{as the most}} effective way of enabling them to help themselves. [...] "We don't believe in charity" [...] said Parker [...] "our aim is to empower women to take charge of their own lives, long term". First priority is water {{and for the first time}} in a long while the Water Environment and Sanitation Department in North Darfur is in a position to drill as many hand pumps as Kids for Kids has money for. [...] "A hand pump can be named after a donor" [...] says Parker. Many Kids for Kids pumps are treasured as a living memorial for someone who has died, or to celebrate something special. In some areas, where hand pumps prove that there is plentiful water, they can be converted to submersible solar powered pumps which will help many people. This year one of the villages Kids for Kids is adopting is Kulkul, the village rebels took Parker and her son Alastair to when they were capture in 2005. Parker is hoping to be able to provide the first Kids for Kids' Solar Powered pump if they can raise the £20,000 ($30,358) Other Projects include the training of midwives—there is no health care in villages so that when there is obstructed labour, a common complication in a region where FGM (female genital mutilation) is widespread, means that rope delivery is the only form of help—first aid workers who treat simple wounds, teach hygiene and even build latrines—provide veterinary care, train in farming techniques and water harvesting, provide donkeys—the only transport in a region where there are no roads—donkey ploughs, carts and water carts, farm tools and seeds, blankets, mosquito nets and other household essentials—and, most importantly, the provision and repair of hand pumps. Long term improvement of the environment, the planting of trees, is another priority, and forms another source of income for families. An extensive tree planting campaign has been funded since 2006, with a Demonstration Garden in the main Tree Nursery in El Fasher, where trees planted back in 2006 are now tall enough to give shade and where people come to picnic at weekends. Kids for Kids has also funded a new Midwives Training School in El Fasher where they fund the training of 40 village midwives each year. But the Key project is a Goat Loan. The poorest 15 percent of families in each Kids for Kids village is lent six goats to provide milk immediately for the children and to enable mothers to have a livelihood as the little <b>flock</b> <b>multiplies.</b> At the end of two years six goats are passed on to another poor family, and so on. Eventually the whole community benefits from this simple, life changing, loan. It has been called the best Microfinance project ever. To ensure that the projects are sustainable and there is clear accountability, the management of the projects is carried out by village committees which are trained in book keeping—but, most importantly, they are accountable to their own communities. This has ensured that the projects have survived even during the worst periods of violence.|$|R
