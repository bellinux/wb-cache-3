40|$|Xenorhabdus {{bacterium}} {{has been}} used as a biological control agent against Luciaphorus sp., a <b>mushroom</b> <b>mite</b> endemic in Thailand. To develop an effective formulation of Xenorhabdus stokiae, treatments using different parts of X. stokiae isolate PB 09 culture, including whole cell suspension, cell-free supernatant, and crude cell extract, were performed. The results show that different parts of X. stokiae isolate PB 09 culture could induce variable effects on mite mortality and fecundity. Application with cell-free supernatant of X. stokiae culture resulted in both the highest mite mortality rate [(89. 00 ± 3. 60) %] and the lowest mite fecundity [(41. 33 ± 23. 69) eggs/gravid female]. Whole cell suspension of X. stokiae isolate PB 09 culture was found to be slightly less effective than its cell-free supernatant, suggesting that X. stokiae was more likely to release its metabolites with acaricidal activities to the surrounding culture media. Crude cell extract of X. stokiae was not effective against mites. Cell-free supernatant of X. stokiae isolate PB 09 was the most effective biological control agent and it could be conveniently used in future formulations instead of live bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of plant}} {{extracts}} for controlling agricultural pests {{has become increasingly}} popular in the recent years. <b>Mushroom</b> <b>mite,</b> Luciaphorus sp., is a destructive pest of several mushroom species and {{has been reported to}} cause severe loss of mushroom cultivation in many settings. The efficacies of 23 rhizome and leaf extracts were evaluated against female adults of Luciaphorus sp. At 3 days after treatment, the rhizome extracts derived from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb. and Zingiber montanum (Koenig) Link ex Dietr. were found to have very strong acaricidal activities, resulting in 100 % mite mortality, followed by Curcuma longa Linn. (98. 89 %), Zingiber zerumbet (L.) Smith. (97. 78 %), Kaempferia parviflora Wall. Ex Baker (88. 89 %), and Zingiber officinale Roscoe. (84. 44 %). The leaf extracts of Ocimum sanctum Linn. and Melissa officinalis L. also resulted in 100 % mite mortality 3 days after treatment, while the other leaf extracts induced mite mortality only below 70 %. The results suggested that rhizome extracts of C. xanthorrhiza and Z. montanum and leaf extracts of O. sanctum and M. officinalis have a great potential for future development as natural acaricides for controlling Luciaphorus sp...|$|E

Also, {{there are a}} variety of user-friendly forms of bioformulation products, including dusts (DP), granules (GR), wettable powders (WP), oil dispersions (OD), and liquid formulations (Knowles 2005). The WP formulation of B. licheniformis (N 1 E) mixed with corn starch and olive oil was evaluated against tomato gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea in both artificial and natural infection settings, and the results showed that spraying of WP formulation mixed with a 100 -fold diluted N 1 E was found to be the most effective approach (Lee et al. 2006). Furthermore, B. thuringiensis Berliner (B.t.) mixed with water-soluble granular formulation was evaluated against the rice leaffolder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, and the results showed that the first spraying of the formulation containing 2.5  kg/ha B.t. led to the lowest leaffolder damage at only 8.21  % after 7  days and also the highest grain yield at 28. 58  kg/plot (Kandibane et al. 2010). Currently, several entomopathogenic bacteria have received much attention as biological control agents. Xenorhabdus spp. are gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and symbiotically associate with entomopathogenic nematodes of the family Steinernematidae (Boemare et al. 1993; Forst et al. 1997). A complex cooperation between these bacteria and their nematodes leads to severe toxicity to many insect species (Akhurst 1983; Herbert and Goodrich-Blair 2007; Herbert Tran et al. 2009). When the nematodes infest their insect hosts, they release the symbiotic bacteria from their intestinal tracts into the insect host’s hemocoel, and this action usually results in the death of insect hosts within 48  h, most likely due to the combined actions of bacterial multiplication, septicemia, and secretion of toxins (Bowen and Ensign 1998; Sicard et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2012). Cell suspensions and cell-free supernatants of Xenorhabdus spp. have been shown to be highly effective under laboratory conditions for controlling of several insect pests, such as Plutella xylostella L. (Abdel-Razek 2003; Mahar et al. 2008), Hopila philanthus (Fuessly) (Ansari et al. 2003), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), Thrips tabaci (Lindeman) (Gerritsen et al. 2005), Galleria mellonella L. (Mahar et al. 2005), Spodoptera exgua (Hubner), Otiorhynchus sulcatus (Fabricius), Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal) (Mahar et al. 2008), and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Shresth and Kim 2010). Moreover, Bussaman et al. (2009) reported that application with Xenorhabdus nematophila and Photorhabdus luminescens caused the highest mortality of Luciaphorus perniciosus Rack, a <b>mushroom</b> <b>mite,</b> at 85 and 83  %, respectively. The cell suspension of X. nematophila that was cultivated for 48  h at the concentration of 1  ×  108 cells/ml was found to cause the maximum mortality of L. perniciosus (85 – 88  %) and reduction of fecundity of its offspring (22.84  %). Moreover, the different parts of X. stokiae isolate PB 09 culture (whole cell suspension, cell-free supernatant and crude cell extract) were also evaluated and the results showed that cell-free supernatant of X. stokiae PB 09 was the most effective to control <b>mushroom</b> <b>mite,</b> resulting in miticidal activities at 89  % (Bussaman et al. 2012). Nonetheless, the efficacy of Xenorhabdus spp. bacteria in the form of bioformulations has yet been explored. This is important to understand the suitable bioformulation forms of Xenorhabdus spp. before proceeding to the field experiments (Suprapta 2012). Therefore, in this study, X.|$|E
