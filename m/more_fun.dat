5|$|The team's founders enjoy playing {{co-operative}} multiplayer {{games and}} are passionate about them, as they allow players to play alongside each other instead of against each other. In addition, {{they found it}} <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> than the typical competitive multiplayer experience. However, they thought {{that this type of}} game was not well-developed, and often encouraged players to complete objectives alone. As a result, the company decided to develop a game which tasks players to deploy strategy and work with other players, leading to the development of both Left 4 Dead and Evolve.|$|E
5|$|Prakash Raj and Ashish Vidyarthi {{were cast}} as the film's primary antagonists. Raj played a mafia kingpin and Vidyarthi played a corrupt police officer, a villain's role he finds <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to play {{than that of a}} hero. Sayaji Shinde and Nassar played the two other {{principal}} characters in the film. Jyothi Rana played the role of the mafia kingpin's moll, marking her debut in Telugu cinema. Isai and Subbaraju portrayed negative roles as well, with the former also making his debut in Telugu cinema. Ali played the role of a beggar and shared screen-space with Brahmanandam and Venu Madhav. Jagannadh added this trio to the film to provide situational humour. Master Bharath played the role of D'Cruz's brother. Mumaith Khan performed an item number in the film.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game Adventure and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish. The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play; as they found it <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1988, in the Tabernas Desert in Spain's Almería province. Spielberg originally had planned the chase to {{be a short}} sequence shot over two days, but he drew up storyboards to make the scene an action-packed centerpiece. Thinking he would not surpass the truck chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark (because the truck was much faster than the tank), he felt this sequence should be more story-based and needed to show Indiana and Henry helping each other. He later said he had <b>more</b> <b>fun</b> storyboarding the sequence than filming it. The second unit had begun filming two weeks before. After approximately ten days, the production moved to Bellas Artes to film the scenes set in the Sultan of Hatay's palace. Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park {{was used for the}} road, tunnel and beach sequence in which birds strike the plane. The Spanish portion of location filming finished on June 2, 1988, in Guadix, Granada, with filming of Brody's capture at İskenderun train station. The filmmakers built a mosque near the station for atmosphere, rather than adding it as a visual effect.|$|E
