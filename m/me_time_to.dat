2500|$|Gallian captained the Australian under-19 side {{against its}} English {{counterpart}} in 1989. He was educated at Keble College, Oxford, reading Diplomacy and Social Studies, {{which he described}} as [...] "a course that allowed <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> play cricket in my third year". He played for Oxford University 1990–1993, captaining in the Varsity Match in 1993 and scoring 115 and 53 not out. During this time Gallian frequently opened both the batting and the bowling, though his medium-paced bowling has since only been used in partnership-breaking capacities. Gallian began his first-class career at Lancashire and his innings of 312 was the highest score at Old Trafford.|$|E
2500|$|In 1784, when Penniman was 24, she {{was living}} {{with her mother and}} step-father, Mr. Wall, in Westminster. He was {{probably}} attempting to recover some of the lost possessions of the family. But Brush’s vast acres had been sequestered to the state; even his library and furniture had been scattered. Gen. Ethan Allen, who had frequent occasion to visit Westminster, fell a victim to Penniman's charms. Gen. Allen was at this time a widower of 47, with three or four children. On February 16th, Gen. Allen entered Margaret’s apartment, and found Penniman in a morning gown, standing on a chair, arranging china on the shelves of a china-closet. After a few words of greeting, he said to her, “Fanny, if we are ever to be married, now is the time, for I am on my way to Arlington." [...] “Very well,” she replied, “if you will give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get my josie.” In a very short time she was ready, and together they entered the breakfast-room where a group of judges were sitting. Chief-Justice Robinson was asked by Allen to perform the ceremony. To Robinson’s astonished question “When?” the answer was “Now.” The judge suggested that {{it was a matter of}} importance which required due consideration, to which Allen replied, implying that with such a bride long consideration was unnecessary. The ceremony was performed, interrupted at one point by Allen, who when called upon to promise “agreeable to the law of God,” exclaimed after a glance out the window, [...] "The law of God as written in the Book of Nature? Yes, go on." [...] The ceremony concluded, the bride’s trunk and guitar-case were placed in the sleigh and they left for their home in Arlington.|$|E

60|$|She didn't give <b>me</b> the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> ask of what precisely. She {{raised her}} head and {{addressed}} me.|$|R

60|$|You're {{very much}} too modest, Charlie. I'm {{enormously}} flattered and grateful. You must give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think it over.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{more can}} I do!" [...] murmured Mrs. Lecount behind her handkerchief. [...] "Give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think--give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover myself. May I retire, sir, for a moment? My nerves are shaken by this sad scene. I {{must have a}} glass of water, or I think I shall faint. Don't go yet, Miss Garth. I beg you will give us time to set this sad matter right, if we can--I beg you will remain until I come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, squire. Give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get to {{the city}} and she'll never hear of her boy again. There will be no failure this time." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked from}} one to the other in dumb astonishment. Mrs. Lecks gave <b>me</b> no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> say anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{only answer}} I {{can give you}} now is, NO," [...] said Lapham. [...] "If you want another, you must let <b>me</b> have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think it over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You eat things sometimes, I suppose, daddy?" [...] he said, apologetically. [...] "I {{left home}} before breakfast {{this morning and}} it took <b>me</b> some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> find my way here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ask him {{if there}} are any snakes there, sir," [...] he said, and foolishly enough I put the {{question}} to give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think of other things.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> go and change my boots {{and get a}} shawl. We ladies {{are not ready to}} go out always, as are you gentlemen." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It took <b>me</b> some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{find the}} shops. I bought some liver. That's tasty, isn't it? And you can't eat much of it, so it's more {{economical}} than butcher's meat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody," [...] said Tommy, {{with some}} awe; [...] "it {{just came to}} me. Do you notice how simple the wording is? It took <b>me</b> some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make it so simple." ...|$|R

60|$|Without giving <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> speak, he {{clutched}} my arm {{with one of}} his clammy hands, and raised himself painfully upon his elbow, his eyes burning with the fever that was in him.|$|E

60|$|Wood. Hold, good landlady, not so fast; let <b>me</b> have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} on't; I may mollify, for {{flesh is}} frail. An {{hour or two}} hence we will confer together upon the premises.|$|R

60|$|As {{they lay}} there Kari {{addressed}} them, {{waving his arms}} and pointing towards <b>me</b> from <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time.</b> Afterwards I learned that he was telling them I was a god, for which lie may his soul be forgiven.|$|R
6000|$|... "You deserve no notice--since {{you were}} about to marry on the sly, so to speak, and, most likely, leave me when your {{contract}} came to an end without allowing <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make other arrangements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has never}} been our habit, Rodgerson," [...] said Morris, turning pale. [...] "But give <b>me</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> turn round, and I'll see what I can do; I daresay we can let you have {{something}} to account." ...|$|E

60|$|He gave <b>me</b> no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover myself. He {{proceeded}} {{with what he}} had to say--speaking, mind, in the tone of a perfectly well-bred man; with nothing wild in his look, and nothing odd in his manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Joe, there's {{plenty to}} do, an' little May don't give <b>me</b> much <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do it," [...] replied Mary, glancing at a crib where little May, their first-born, lay coiled up in sheets like a rosebud in snow.|$|R
