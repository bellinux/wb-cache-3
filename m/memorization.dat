5|$|Born into {{a musical}} family, Smith taught herself {{to play the}} piano and later became a classically trained musician. Earning a {{teaching}} degree, she began publishing music compositions for children using the philosophy of Friedrich Fröbel, advocating for less <b>memorization</b> and drilling and more attention to intuitive appreciation of music. Studying composition and voice in Germany, she also toured the country observing choirs and their teaching techniques.|$|E
5|$|New Method for Representing by Dots... (1839) {{put forth}} Braille's {{plan for a}} new writing system with which blind people could write letters that could be read by sighted people. Called decapoint, the system {{combined}} his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by Braille and requiring <b>memorization),</b> the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and <b>memorization</b> to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} East Texas Normal College (ETNC) {{comprises}} {{the history of}} the university now known as Texas A University–Commerce from its foundation as a private normal college in 1889 to its acquisition by the State of Texas in 1917. It was founded in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo, who served as its president from its foundation until his death in 1917, and moved to Commerce after its original campus burned down in 1894. A popular school for active teachers seeking state certification or recertification, it was largely shaped by Mayo's own personal beliefs about education, which focused on participation and hands-on learning instead of <b>memorization</b> or rote learning.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% {{of individuals}} with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the <b>memorization</b> of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{teaching}} style differed from conventional music instruction {{at the time}} in that she required instrumental students to study voice. Piano, organ and violin instruction was offered by 1907. Organ was under the instruction of Gertrude Madeira Smith, Eleanor's sister, and violin was taught by Charles Moerenhout of the Chicago Orchestra. Five assistants also helped the teachers. Smith felt that adding vocal training gave a level of experience that was neglected by singular focus on <b>memorization</b> of scales and structural drills usually prevalent for those learning instruments. She also incorporated songs from the students' homelands as a way to intermingle their old cultures with their new lives and made effort to involve the parents {{in the development of the}} curricula. As a progressive reformer, Smith advocated that inclusive diversity was a means of building a cosmopolitan citizenry united by pursuit of music excellence. She also encouraged students to compose music from their earliest instruction and to recover songs from their cultural backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's {{habilitation}} {{was completed}} on December 13, 1927, {{and he started}} his lectures as a privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1928, being the youngest person ever elected privatdozent in its history in any subject. By the end of 1927, von Neumann had published twelve major papers in mathematics, {{and by the end}} of 1929, thirty-two papers, at a rate of nearly one major paper per month. His reputed powers of <b>memorization</b> and recall allowed him to quickly memorize the pages of telephone directories, and recite the names, addresses and numbers therein. In 1929, he briefly became a privatdozent at the University of Hamburg, where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better, but in October of that year a better offer presented itself when he was invited to Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no <b>memorization</b> and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E
5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just <b>memorization</b> and prearrangement...|$|E
5|$|In the Royal Audiencia, the {{education}} situation worsened after of {{the expulsion of}} the Jesuit priests; too few learned people lived in Quito {{to be able to}} fill the void. The majority of the population neither read nor wrote well. On the other hand, the few who could enter the university were given an education which was heavily theoretical and used <b>memorization</b> as the primary learning technique. Scholasticism, which was in decline in these times, was still taught; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions. As a result, the intellectual people in Quito—most of whom were clerical—had affected manners when expressing themselves, while having no new ideas. Furthermore, in 1793 only two medical doctors were available in Quito, of which one was Espejo; the majority of people who fell ill were helped by curanderos. In Quito at the time, ethnic prejudice was common, and therefore most people considered society to be divided into estates of the realm, which differed by racial origin. Because of this, a person's dignity and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{prestige}} of an American higher education {{is the result of}} weaknesses in the PRC's education system, which stifles creativity in favor of rote <b>memorization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Music may be memorized, {{or it may}} {{be carried}} on flip folders, which are held by lyres that clip onto the instruments. Having music memorized is usually {{considered}} an advantage for competitive bands, and at competitions, there is usually a penalty {{for the use of the}} sheet music on the field written into the scoring rubric. Practically, <b>memorization</b> prevents obstruction of vision caused by the folders. The <b>memorization</b> of music is usually a matter of pride for the marching band, however bands that regularly pull from expansive libraries and perform dozens of new works each season are more likely to utilize flip folders.|$|E
25|$|A major {{drawback}} to learning Wubi is its steeper learning curve, since {{as a more}} complex system it takes longer to acquire as a skill. <b>Memorization</b> and practice are key factors for proficient usage.|$|E
25|$|In North America, many {{thousands}} of individuals have increased their code recognition speed (after initial <b>memorization</b> of the characters) by listening to the regularly scheduled code practice transmissions broadcast by W1AW, the American Radio Relay League's headquarters station.|$|E
25|$|All {{three groups}} of the Seventh Air Force used black symbols or stripes in various configurations, without any pattern. Identification of groups could be made only by <b>memorization</b> of symbols {{assigned}} to squadrons and knowledge of to what groups those squadrons were assigned.|$|E
25|$|Hadith narrators are {{evaluated}} {{in light of}} two qualities in determining the overall grading of a hadith. These qualities are derived from {{the definition of a}} hadith that is sahih constituting two of its five conditions. The first, uprightness (al-ʻadālah), is defined as the ability an individual possesses to adhere to moralistic decorum (al-taqwā) and maintaining proper social graces (al-murūʼah). The second, precision (al-ḍabṭ), is of two types, the first is pertaining to <b>memorization</b> and the second to writing. Precision in <b>memorization</b> (ḍabṭ al-ṣadr) refers to the ability to retain the specified information, recalling and conveying it at will. Precision in writing (ḍabṭ al-kitāb) is the preservation of the written information from the time it was heard until its transmission.|$|E
25|$|Panic {{disorders}} {{appear to}} modify levels-of-processing by increasing ability to recall words with threatening meanings over positive and neutral words. In one study, both implicit (free recall) and explicit (memory of emotional aspects) <b>memorization</b> of word lists were enhanced by threatening meanings in such patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{emotional}} memory and sleep {{can be applied}} to real-life situations e.g. by developing more effective learning strategies. One could integrate the <b>memorization</b> of information that possesses high emotional significance (highly salient) with information that holds little emotional significance (low salience), prior to a period of sleep.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{memorize}} likenesses based on words he {{provides an example}} of a verse and describes how images may be placed, each of which corresponds to words in the verse. He notes however that the technique will not work without combination with rote <b>memorization</b> of the verse, so that the images call to mind the previously memorized words.|$|E
25|$|The {{educational}} system in Taiwan {{is the responsibility}} of the Ministry of Education. The system produces pupils with some of the highest test scores in the world, especially in mathematics and science. It has been criticised for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favour of rote <b>memorization.</b> Recent educational reforms intended to address these criticisms are a topic of intense debate in Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|In {{defense of}} the APL community, APL {{requires}} less coding to type in, and keyboard mappings become memorized over time. Also, special APL keyboards are manufactured and in use today, as are freely available downloadable fonts for operating system platforms such as Microsoft Windows. The reported productivity gains assume that one will spend enough time working in APL to make <b>memorization</b> of the symbols, their semantics, and keyboard mappings worthwhile.|$|E
25|$|Jensen's {{interest}} in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. Level I, or associative learning, may be defined as retention of input and rote <b>memorization</b> of simple facts and skills. Level II, or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent {{to the ability to}} manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.|$|E
25|$|Montaigne’s {{views on}} child {{education}} {{continue to have}} an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne’s ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed {{in the importance of}} experience over book learning and <b>memorization.</b> Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|From a {{young age}} Sidney had shown great {{academic}} promise, mastering the rote <b>memorization</b> upon which the cheder education {{of the day was}} based. By the age of 13, Hillman had memorized several volumes of the Talmud. The next year he was chosen by the Hillman rabbinical clan to go away to attend yeshiva in Vilijampolė, a small town across the river from the city of Kaunas. It was hoped that Sidney would follow in the Hillman family tradition by becoming a rabbi.|$|E
25|$|Corvid {{ingenuity}} {{is represented}} through their feeding skills, <b>memorization</b> abilities, use of tools, and group behaviour. Living in large social groups {{has long been}} connected with high cognitive ability. To live in a large group, a member {{must be able to}} recognize individuals and track the social position and foraging of other members over time. Members must also be able to distinguish between sex, age, reproductive status, and dominance, and to update this information constantly. It might be that social complexity corresponds to their high cognition.|$|E
25|$|Kelly's {{research}} {{also indicates that}} both nomadic and sedentary societies rely on performance and entertainment {{as a part of}} their complex knowledge storage system. The use of songs and rituals is a vital component of retention techniques which further strengthens <b>memorization,</b> and it is ubiquitous among the cultures studied by Kelly. People participating in the performance would sing and tell stories while also touching a mnemonic object, moving around the site, or dancing, as a way to trigger kinaesthetic cues to access the knowledge.|$|E
25|$|After the American Revolution, {{there was}} a {{proliferation}} of colleges, with at least forty-five extant by the 1820s. Like their colonial predecessors, these were affiliated with Christian denominations, albeit ones increasingly obscure and minute. Also like their predecessors, these were primarily rural. Unlike in contemporary layouts, there was little emphasis on now-essential structures; curricula heavy on <b>memorization</b> and subsequent recitation meant {{there was no need}} for large lecture halls or libraries. However, American collegiate administrations exerted control over their students' extracurricular lives, necessitating the construction of extensive dormitories, kitchen facilities, and lavatories.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, {{published}} in 2008, {{claims to have}} replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock <b>memorization</b> {{on the part of}} participants. The authors believe that their method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the readiness potential). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{character}} {{literacy in}} both China and Japan is taught by rote <b>memorization,</b> where schoolchildren become proficient at writing characters by writing them by hand repeatedly. As {{a result of}} people becoming less reliant on handwriting and more willing to use computer input methods, {{they are no longer}} exposed to the necessary reinforcement to retain the ability to write the characters. Those affected by character amnesia are still capable of reading text and visually recognizing characters, but are unable to write some characters by hand, usually those less frequently used, without the aid of an input method device such as a mobile phone or computer.|$|E
25|$|Experience {{was also}} a key element to {{learning}} for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere <b>memorization</b> of knowledge often practised in book learning.He argued that students would become passive adults; blindly obeying and lacking {{the ability to think}} on their own. Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned. He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books. For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is written}} in a style that {{differed}} from the prevailing writing technique {{and structure of the}} scholar gentry of the time. The scholar gentry under the Confucian education system fostered by the classical imperial examinations were molded by their study and <b>memorization</b> of classical Chinese poetry and literature. As such, the literary style tended to be poetic, indirect and metaphorical, relying on allusions and imagery to depict an idea. Phan eschewed this traditional style to write in a direct, ordinary prose style, especially in his analytical and argumentative sections. The book precipitated a new style of writing among scholar gentry revolutionaries, who later tended to use a more direct style.|$|E
25|$|In Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies, Kelly {{suggests}} that knowledge {{may have been}} originally preserved by the nomadic Britons by using the landscape as a mnemonic tool, {{in a similar fashion}} to the <b>memorization</b> technique known as Method of loci. As the Britons started to settle, they would have needed to modify the way they stored their knowledge as they were not moving as much anymore, so they would have built Stonehenge in an attempt to replicate the landscape locally, allowing them to memorize and store knowledge. The circles and stones or timber posts would have represented the landscape, and each stone would have been associated with a segment of their knowledge system.|$|E
25|$|After Muhammad {{would receive}} revelations {{he would later}} recite it to his companions, who also memorized it or wrote it down. Before the Quran was {{commonly}} available in written form, speaking it from memory prevailed as the mode of teaching it to others. The practice of memorizing the whole Quran is still practiced among Muslims. Millions of people have memorized the entire Quran in its original Arabic. This fact, taken {{in the context of}} 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. People of that time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in <b>memorization</b> to a remarkable degree. Events and competitions that featured the recitation of elaborate poetry were of great interest.|$|E
25|$|Schools on {{the five}} Lakota {{reservation}} started offering Lakota language classes {{beginning in the early}} 1970s, but Lakota language instruction suffered very low quality primarily due to lack of linguistic and methodological background of the teachers. Positions of Lakota language teachers were filled with native Lakota speakers without teaching accreditation under the assumption that a native speaker is logically an effective teacher of the language. But for several decades Lakota instruction did not result in creating proficiency among graduates of reservation schools. Students and observers reported repeatedly that Lakota classes from elementary level all the way to college commonly involved mere route <b>memorization</b> of isolated vocabulary items (usually the terms for colors, number and animals).|$|E
25|$|The Arabic script {{as we know}} {{it today}} was unknown in Muhammad’s time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and the Quran was {{preserved}} through <b>memorization</b> and written references on different materials. As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible due to the absence of diacritical marks (a’jam). Vowelling marks (tashkil) to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well. Due to this there were endless possibilities for the mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script {{as we know it}} today, the scripta plena, which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century.|$|E
25|$|Illustrations of {{theatrical}} masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes {{for the eyes}} and a small aperture for the mouth, {{as well as an}} integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality. This demonstrates {{the way in which the}} mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as <b>memorization</b> of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.|$|E
