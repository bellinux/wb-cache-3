25|$|Development of {{denominations}} or movements {{has been}} primarily a phenomenon among Ashkenazi Jews who have immigrated to Anglophone countries. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> of these denominations is in English, not Hebrew.

25|$|While Eastern-Rite Catholics {{belong to}} the Catholic Church and are also under the Pope's {{authority}} and hold the same theological beliefs as Latin-Rite Catholics, Eastern theology has a notably different emphasis on specific Marian beliefs. Furthermore, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> and publications on Mariology and centers for its study have been related to the Latin Rite of the Church.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus on}} {{personal}} acceptance is mirrored in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> surrounding {{choosing not to}} reproduce. Many early books were grounded in feminist theory and largely sought to dispel the idea that womanhood and motherhood were necessarily the same thing, arguing, for example, that childfree people face not only social discrimination but political discrimination as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} about {{the characteristics of the}} perpetrators, their relationships to the victims, or their motives is primarily due to the dysfunction of the Mexican justice system as most cases have been inadequately investigated and documented. While in many of the cases in Ciudad Juárez it has yet to be determined who exactly has committed the murders, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on this issue purports that patriarchal backlash against working women may be a potential motive for the killings.|$|E
25|$|Attention, memory, {{and spatial}} ability are key {{cognitive}} functions affected by testosterone in humans. Preliminary {{evidence suggests that}} low testosterone levels may be {{a risk factor for}} cognitive decline and possibly for dementia of the Alzheimer's type, a key argument in life extension medicine for the use of testosterone in anti-aging therapies. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature,</b> however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic relationship between spatial performance and circulating testosterone, where both hypo- and hypersecretion (deficient- and excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on cognition.|$|E
25|$|The Nimbarka sampradaya {{worship of}} the {{youthful}} Krishna, alone or with his consort Radha, {{is one of the}} earliest dating at least to the 12th century, just as Rudra Sampradaya does. According to Nimbarka, Radha was the eternal consort of Vishnu-Krishna and there is also a suggestion, though not a clear statement, that she became the wife of her beloved Krishna. It should be noted that Nimbarka rescues Radha from the presumed immoral implication of <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature,</b> and gives to her a dignity unattained elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} out-of-sample tests used in <b>the</b> time-series {{predictability}} <b>literature</b> may suffer from test size {{problems related to}} <b>the</b> common practice <b>of</b> exogenous specification of critical parameters, such as <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> predictive variables, traded assets, and in-sample estimation periods. We perform specification searches across these parameters and find that rejections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> null hypothesis <b>of</b> no predictability {{are very sensitive to}} minor variations in parameter specification. We perform simulations to determine if the observed predictability in the data is real. The simulations suggest that <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature's</b> out-of-sample evidence <b>of</b> time-series-based predictability is consistent with data snooping. ...|$|R

40|$|The recent global {{financial}} catastrophe has {{raised questions about}} the relationship between corporate governance and the crisis. Many scholars attribute the crisis to the corporate failure and <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon model <b>of</b> capitalism. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literatures,</b> however, tend to focus on examining <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> financial crisis in the developed economy. Following up this line of literatures, this paper will extend <b>the</b> discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> corporate governance in financial crisis in the developing world. Using Indonesia as a case study, this paper will look at evidence that has emerged from the recent financial crisis regarding <b>the</b> failures <b>of</b> corporate governance in addressing and preventing the crisis...|$|R
25|$|When Gerard Krefft {{named the}} species in 1873, he {{intended}} to commemorate the man who first reported it to him, Australian policeman and naturalist Robert Arthur Johnstone (1843-1905). However, Krefft made an error in writing the name, and for many years the species has been known as C. johnsoni. Recent studies of Krefft's papers have determined the correct spelling of the name, and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> has been updated to the correct usage. However, both versions still exist. According {{to the rules of}} the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the epithet johnsoni (rather than the intended johnstoni) is correct.|$|E
25|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> and {{research}} surrounding TCKs {{has found that}} these individuals are more open to learning new languages, demonstrate more flexibility when interacting with a novel culture than their monoculture peers, and a greater interest in continuing a global nomad lifestyle, which includes an interest in international careers. It {{has been found that}} women are more inclined to seek out interpersonal relationships while men are more task-oriented in their relationships and choices. Such findings were used in the hypothesis of a study conducted by Gerner & Perry (2000) that predicted that gender differences would also be found in the cultural acceptance and experiences of TCKs.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{are urged}} to prepare for {{congregation}} meetings by studying the assigned Watch Tower literature, {{and are expected to}} read all magazines and books published by the Society. One analysis noted that each year Witnesses are expected to read more than 3,000 pages of the Society's publications, according to its suggested program for personal study. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> is illustrated extensively, with sociologist Andrew Holden observing utopian, post-Armageddon images of happy Witnesses in bright sunshine and pristine environments, often playing with formerly wild animals such as lions and tigers, in contrast to dark-colored images of unfavorable activities such as murders, burglaries and promiscuity that highlight the moral dangers outside the organization.|$|E
40|$|CMA fractionally spaced {{equalizers}} (CMA-FSEs) {{have been}} shown, under certain conditions, to be globally asymptotically convergent to a setting which provides perfect equalization. Such a result {{relies heavily on}} <b>the</b> assumptions <b>of</b> a white source and no channel noise (as is <b>the</b> case in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature's</b> analysis <b>of</b> CMA). Herein, we relax the white source assumption and examine <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> source correlation on CMA. Analytic results are meshed with examples showing CMA-FSE source correlation effects. Techniques for finding all stationary and saddle points on the CMA-FSE error surface are presented using recent developments in the algebraic-geometry community.

25|$|The Babylonians removed only {{a portion}} of the {{population}} of Jerusalem; of those exiles, only a small portion returned to Jerusalem (539) after the Persian conquest of Babylon, and did so over several decades. The population of Persian-period Jerusalem and the area was smaller than once believed, only a few thousands. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> which became the Hebrew bible was compiled during the Persian period, and Persian Yehud saw considerable conflict over the construction and function of the Temple and matters of cult (i.e., how God was to be worshiped). Persia controlled Yehud using the same methods it used in other colonies, and the bible reflects this, and Yehud's status as a Persian colony is crucial to understanding the society and literature of the period. The restoration of the Davidic kingdom under Persian royal patronage was clearly the project of the exile community in the early post-Exilic period. The returnees attempted to restore in Yehud the First Temple threefold leadership template of king (Sheshbazzar and Zerubbabel), high priest (Joshua, descended from the priestly line), and prophets (Haggai, Zechariah). However, {{by the middle of the}} next century, probably around 450 BCE, the kings and prophets had disappeared and only the high priest remained, joined by the scribe-sage (Ezra and the appointed aristocrat-governor Nehemiah). This new pattern provided the leadership model for Yehud for centuries to come.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{allegations}} made in the Pendle witch trials resulted {{from members of the}} Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it is implicit in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, {{it may have been a}} trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have been bad blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion. The Demdikes are believed to have lived close to Newchurch in Pendle, and the Chattox family about [...] away, near the village of Fence.|$|E
2500|$|Losses {{of ancient}} {{writings}} {{occurred in the}} Old World, including {{as a result of}} deliberate or accidental fires, wars, earthquakes, and floods.

When the Edgeworths returned to Ireland, despair turned to rage, as in Sonnet 14 [...]|$|E
2500|$|While medieval {{literature}} {{makes use}} of many literary devices, allegory is so prominent in this period as to deserve special mention. [...] Much of medieval literature relied on allegory to convey the morals the author had in mind while writing—representations of abstract qualities, events, and institutions are thick in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> of this time. Probably the earliest and most influential allegory is the Psychomachia (Battle of Souls) by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius. Other important examples include the Romance of the Rose, Everyman, Piers Plowman, Roman de Fauvel, and The Divine Comedy.|$|E
2500|$|By convention, finely painted {{vessels of}} all shapes are called [...] "vases", {{and there are}} over 100,000 {{significantly}} complete surviving pieces, giving (with the inscriptions that many carry) unparalleled insights into many aspects of Greek life.

50|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early <b>literature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{new nation}} {{struggled}} to find a uniquely American voice in existing literary genre, and this tendency was also reflected in novels.
