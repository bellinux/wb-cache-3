40|$|The use of Podiatry {{services}} is increasing and {{the exposure to}} dust and noise in Podiatry facilities has not been well documented in the literature. Concern for exposure to dust and noise has been raised due {{to the amount of}} particles seen when grinding and sanding custom <b>moulded</b> <b>shoe</b> inserts. Shoe inserts are made from a range of materials including polypropylene, polyurethane foams, ethylene/acetate copolymers, vinyl acetate and aluminina trihydrate. Monitoring for PM 2. 5, PM 10 and noise was undertaken in a teaching podiatry laboratory on two days to ascertain if they were at a level hazardous to health. In addition the ventilation system was assessed to determine if the capture velocities were sufficient to determine if the current ventilation system is sufficient to control the potential hazards. Because the laboratory is used by a variety of students during the day, static monitoring was undertaken in preference to personal sampling so that a broad range of exposures could be determined. The results of the dust monitoring shows that the levels of PM 2. 5 and PM 10 were within levels considered adequate from a public health viewpoint although peaks did occur during the clean-up of the laboratory. Noise monitoring highlighted that although the average levels were acceptable there is concern that a number of machines have noise levels exceeding 80 dBA. The ventilation system was assessed from a qualitative (smoke tubes) and quantitative (velocity measurements) viewpoint, and because of the action of the spinning wheels and belt it was determined that they were not adequate...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Field Hockey is {{a popular}} sport played {{predominantly}} on artificial sports surfaces requiring sustained periods of locomotion at various velocities. During human locomotion the body is exposed musculoskeletal transient shocks that {{have been linked to}} various injuries (Aguinaldo and Mahar 2003). The magnitude of the impact shocks have been reported as being affected by the velocity of locomotion, movement strategies, the surface and the footwear worn (Clarke et al 1983). Therefore choosing appropriate conditions should reduce the levels of impact shock experienced reducing the risk of injury. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The Purpose {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of footwear, surface and speed on the magnitude of tibial shock. METHODS Nine male participants, (Age 21 + 1. 69, Height 175. 75 + 6. 56 and Mass 78. 13 + 12. 11) volunteered to take part in this study. All participants were injury free at the time of data collection and completed an informed consent form. A tri-axial accelerometer (Biometrics ACL 300) sampling at 1000 Hz was mounted to a lightweight carbon-fibre plate via a securely glued lightweight bolt and thread. The accelerometer signal was recorded by a Biometrics DataLog system (Biometrics Ltd, Gwent, UK). The accelerometer signal was filtered at 60 Hz using a Butterworth 4 th order zero-lag low-pass filter. The concrete surface at the side of the pitch was typical of the sort of surface on which field hockey participants would warm up prior to matches. Participants were required to run in each of the footwear at 5 m. s- 1 (running) and 3. 3 m. s- 1 (jogging). RESULTS Significant differences were observed between running and jogging for the different surfaces. Significant differences in the tibial axial peak were also reported when comparing the effects of surface during running, however during jogging significant differences were not found. Significant differences between mean tibial acceleration values in the Saucony Running, Umbro Soccer Astroturf, and Gryphon Venom, when compared to Umbro Soccer Moulded during running on synthetic surfaces. No other significant differences were found across the population of participants between the shoes for the 3 other surface and velocity conditions (running on synthetic surface, jogging on concrete, running on concrete). DISCUSSION It appears that footwear only has a measureable effect across the population of participants, during running at a higher speed (5 m. s- 1). The significant differences recorded were all cases where the Umbro <b>Moulded</b> <b>shoes</b> exposed the athlete to higher tibial axial accelerations than the other shoe conditions. This occurred only in the running group on the synthetic sports surface This may have been replicated on the concrete but it was considered not safe for participants to run in Umbro <b>Moulded</b> <b>shoes</b> on a concrete surface. Furthermore, the same footwear (Umbro Moulded) as in the previous chapter was highlighted as exposing the population to a significant increase in detrimental kinetic factors. The results of this research suggest that participating in high velocity activities on hard concrete surfaces, exposes the musculoskeletal to significantly larger impact shocks. This information can be used by coaches to select suitable activities with the surfaces available to them. This investigation also identified that during running on synthetic sports surfaces, <b>moulded</b> soccer <b>shoes</b> with hard deep cleats expose the body to larger impact shocks than shoes designed for running and synthetic sports surfaces. Therefore these types of shoes should not be used in field hockey participation on such surfaces. Significant differences in the magnitude of tibial shock between similar footwear designs used by field hockey participants were also identified using the methodologies in this study. The evidence from individual participant provides some assistance for footwear selection. However, the findings of this study demonstrated that shoes can reduce impact shock for one individual while increasing it for another. Therefore, for a participant to be confident of making the correct choice of footwear in relation to exposure to tibial shock, the footwear needs to be tested on an individual basis...|$|R
40|$|Semi {{products}} used in {{the shoe}} manufacturing are mostly made through polymer blend injecting in moulds. The injection moulds are designed {{with one or more}} cavities. When the mould has only one cavity the injection is made straight in cavity through one canal or through one main canal and more auxiliary canals. In multiple cavity injection always uses the primary canal and more auxiliary canals. The cavities of the mould may be posted symmetrically or asymmetrically refer ring to the main canal. The correct dimensioning of the injection system determines the quality of the injected pieces and the productivity of the manufacturing process. In the same time, the injection parameters have a lot of values depending of the injected plastic mass. The aspects of the designing of the <b>moulds</b> for <b>shoe</b> manufacturing are complex. The paper presents some contributions in the designing of the injection systems of the <b>mould</b> cavities in <b>shoe</b> industry. It develops some aspects about the optimization of the principal and secondary injection canals placing confronted by the mould cavities, some aspects about the injection canals placing straight contactly with the mould cavities depending on the shape and the dimension of the cavities and some aspects about the dimensioning of the injection canals...|$|R
5000|$|Laminate {{floors are}} {{reasonably}} {{easy for a}} DIY homeowner to install. Laminate flooring is packaged {{as a number of}} tongue and groove planks, which can be clicked into one another. Sometimes a glue backing is provided for ease of installation. Installed laminate floors typically [...] "float" [...] over the sub-floor on top of a foam/film underlayment, which provides moisture- and sound-reducing properties. A small (1-10 mm) gap is required between the flooring and any immovable object such as walls, this allows the flooring to expand without being obstructed. Baseboards (skirting boards) can be removed and then reinstalled after laying of the flooring is complete for a neater finish, or the baseboard can be left in place with the flooring butted into it, then small beading trims such as <b>shoe</b> <b>moulding</b> or the larger quarter-round moulding can be fitted to the bottoms of the baseboards. Saw cuts on the planks are usually required at edges and around cupboard and door entrances, but professional installers typically use door jamb undercut saws to cut out a space to a height that allows the flooring to go under the door jamb & casing for a cleaner look.|$|R
