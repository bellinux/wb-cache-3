5|$|The {{supernova}} {{explosion that}} formed the Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that inhabitants of the southern hemisphere may have witnessed this explosion and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia that were left by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in the constellations Vela and Carina. One of the larger circles <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E
5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> Moon, {{which would}} be the {{earliest}} depiction discovered. The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E
5|$|Two fossils {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as isolated lower premolars of Ferugliotherium, {{but neither is}} still regarded as such. Two other teeth {{have been identified as}} upper premolars of Ferugliotherium; as with the jaw fragment, they may also represent an indeterminate multituberculate. One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps, of which one contains four and the other at least two cusps. The other is more poorly preserved, but <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> same tooth position. These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars.|$|E

5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|Although much reduced, a {{significant}} Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after {{the abandonment of}} the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources. Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic. Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths. Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> final episode of Classic Period collapse. After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until {{the rise of the}} city of Mayapan in the 12th century. New cities arose near the Caribbean and Gulf coasts, and new trade networks were formed.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions.

5|$|Named and {{described}} by Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka in 1977, Opisthocoelicaudia was first {{thought to be}} a new member of the Camarasauridae, but is currently considered a derived member of the Titanosauria. Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious, but it may have been close to the North American Alamosaurus. All Opisthocoelicaudia fossils stem from the Nemegt Formation. Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils, the only other sauropod from this rock unit is Nemegtosaurus, which is known from a single skull. Since the skull of Opisthocoelicaudia remains unknown, several researchers have suggested that Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> same species. Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation, which include skin impressions, can probably be referred to either Nemegtosaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia as these are the only known sauropods from this formation.|$|E
5|$|Ruffs of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the less}} common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as Parasaurolophus, <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> remains of {{individuals}} who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna.|$|E

5|$|Canis dirus {{lived in}} the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene (125,000–10,000 years before present or YBP) in North and South America (although no members of Canis survive in the latter continent). The {{majority}} of fossils from the eastern C.d.dirus have been dated 125,000–75,000YBP, but the western C.d.guildayi fossils are not only smaller in size but more recent; thus it has been proposed that C.d.guildayi derived from C.d.dirus. However, there are disputed specimens of C.dirus that date to 250,000YBP. Fossil specimens of C.dirus discovered at four sites in the Hay Springs area of Sheridan County, Nebraska, were named Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis (Frick 1930, undescribed), but Frick did not publish {{a description of the}}m. Nowak later referred to this material as C.armbrusteri; then, in 2009, Tedford formally published a description of the specimens and noted that, although they exhibited some morphological characteristics of both C.armbrusteri and C.dirus, he referred to them only as C.dirus. These Nebraskan fossil specimens <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> earliest record of C.dirus.|$|E
5|$|Metallic lead beads {{dating back}} to 7000–6500 BCE {{have been found in}} Asia Minor and <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> first example of metal smelting. At that time lead had few (if any) {{applications}} due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral). The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as currency, and for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant, as currency, and as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing.|$|E
5|$|The graptolites are colonial organic walled fossils {{which also}} {{occurred}} from the Ordovician to the Devonian; {{only part of}} their life cycle is known {{and it is not}} clear how they reproduced. It has been suggested that the Chitinozoa <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> pre-sicula stages of graptolites - the period between the colony's sexual reproduction, and the formation of a new colony. This hypothesis appears to be supported by the co-occurrence of graptolite and chitinozoan fossils, whose abundances appear to mirror one another. The similar chemical composition of the fossils has been seized by both sides of the argument. Proponents suggest that the use of the same chemical framework is an indicator that the two may be related. However, this factor means that situations favouring the preservation of one will also tend to preserve the other - and the preparation techniques used to extract the fossils will also favour or disfavour the two groups equally. Therefore, the apparent co-occurrence of the two fossils may merely be an artifact of their similar composition. The hypothesis struggles to explain the continuing abundance of chitinozoans after the middle Devonian, when graptolites became increasingly rare.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} {{agreement between}} Magnús and Muirchertach is noted in several sources. The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of the Four Masters {{reveal that the}} marriage to place in 1102. Other sources reporting the marriage include the twelfth-century Ágrip af Nóregskonungasǫgum, the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga, and Magnúss saga berfœtts within the thirteenth-century Heimskringla. The forms of Bjaðmunjo's name in these Scandinavian sources (Bjaðmunjo and Bjaðmynja) suggest that they <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> Gaelic Bé Binn, a name {{known to have been}} borne by other members of the Uí Briain. Other Gaelic names equated to that of Bjaðmunjo include Ben Muman (or Ben Mumain), Blathmuine, and Bláthmín. Sigurðr was apparently twelve-years-old {{at the time of the}} marriage, although Bjaðmunjo's age is uncertain. The remarkably young age of the newlyweds, and the fact that the union is recorded at all in historical sources, suggests that a dynastic marriage was required for the conclusion of peace between their fathers.|$|E
5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> adult plumage.|$|E
5|$|At Copán ritual offerings were {{deposited}} {{around the}} city's stelae {{until at least}} 1000, which <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors, or {{may be due to}} highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin. A small number of sculpted stelae once stood at Cerro Quiac in the Guatemalan Highlands, and are presumed to have been erected by Mam Maya in the 13th or 14th century. At Lamanai in Belize, Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small Postclassic platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century. At La Milpa, also in Belize, at around the time of Spanish contact in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population started to make offerings of Conquest-period pottery to stelae, perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the Spanish onslaught. A plain stela in Twin Pyramid Group R at Tikal was removed by the local inhabitants some time during the Postclassic; its accompanying altar was also moved but abandoned some distance from its original location. Some plain stelae were raised at Topoxté in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala in the Postclassic; these were perhaps covered in stucco and painted. This may represent a revival of the katun-ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period, and reflected ties with the northern Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps.

In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and <b>may</b> <b>represent</b> <b>the</b> same tooth position as 249, though it would come from {{the opposite side of the}} mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E
