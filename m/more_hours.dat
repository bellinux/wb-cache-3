5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of freezing rain, ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen for several <b>more</b> <b>hours.</b> Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas.

5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of September8, an eye began to develop within a central dense overcast. Later that day, Fred intensified into a Category 1 hurricane with winds estimated at 75mph (120km/h). By the morning of September9, satellite imagery depicted that Fred had undergone rapid intensification and attained Category 2 status. This resulted from {{the formation of a}} 12mi (19km) wide eye due to low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures. This intensification continued for several <b>more</b> <b>hours,</b> ending with Fred attaining satellite-estimated its peak intensity as a solid Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and an estimated barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg), making it the second strongest storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game.

5|$|Throughout {{the morning}} of June21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15mi (20km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. Centered just {{off the coast of}} Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. Hours later, {{convection}} rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz. The storm's remnants persisted for several <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> before dissipating roughly 175mi (280km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of August 16, a brief increase in wind shear due to a trough over the southeastern United States, caused the center to become exposed. Despite this, Claudette attained its peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) around this time. Around 1:10am EDT (0510UTC) on August 17, the storm made landfall near {{the eastern end of}} Santa Rosa Island with winds of 45mph (85km/h). Shortly thereafter, the barometric pressure decreased to 1005mbar (hPa; 29.68inHg), the lowest pressure recorded in associated with the storm. Several hours after landfall, convection associated with the storm quickly decreased and by 8:00am EDT, the NHC issued their final advisory on Claudette as it weakened to a tropical depression. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) began issuing advisories on the system. The HPC issued their final advisory late on August17 as the remnants of Claudette began to dissipate over Alabama. The remnants persisted for several <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> before becoming indistinguishable over Mississippi, on August 18.|$|E
5|$|In May 1950, Bolt was {{reassigned to}} VMF-224 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, and he {{remained}} there until May 1951. The squadron flew the F2H Banshee and {{within three months}} of joining the unit he had flown <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> on the aircraft than any other pilot in the squadron. This {{was followed by a}} quick four-month tour on the staff at the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. During this time, the US Air Force was operating its first squadron of F-86 Sabre aircraft. The Sabres were the only U.S. aircraft which performed well against the MiG-15s operated by China and North Korea in the Korean War. Bolt used his connections to enter an exchange program with the USAF in September 1951, becoming an exchange officer with the 318th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McChord Air Force Base in Washington flying the F-94 Starfire. Soon after, he began piloting the F-86F Sabre which had been transferred to the squadron. He continued training with the squadron and was promoted to major in December 1951.|$|E

5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> at school during the school year and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more during the school year than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Wipha began to weaken as {{it started to}} interact with the high terrain of Taiwan. Early on September18, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon Goring as it left their area of responsibility. Later that day, the center of the typhoon passed roughly 130km/h (80mi) north of Taipei, Taiwan. Continued weakening took place as the storm neared landfall in Mainland China. Around 1800UTC, the eye of Wipha crossed the Chinese coastline near Wenzhou with sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph 10-minute sustained). The JTWC assessed Wipha to have made landfall as a low-end Category3 typhoon with winds of 185km/h (115mph 1-minute sustained). Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved further inland. The JTWC issued their final advisory on Wipha during the afternoon of September19 as they classified the system as an extratropical cyclone. However, the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression until September20. At this time, the remnants of Wipha had entered the Yellow Sea and accelerated northeastward towards the Korean Peninsula. The extratropical remnants of Wipha persisted for several <b>more</b> <b>hours</b> before dissipating off the coast of North Korea that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and lifebuoys, before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen <b>more</b> <b>hours.</b> After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E
