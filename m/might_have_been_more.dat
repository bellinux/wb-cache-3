5|$|The only Canadian, {{and also}} last known {{specimen}} {{of the sea}} mink (Mustela macrodon) was captured on Campobello Island, New Brunswick in 1894. It is unknown whether the species was ever native to the country, but an unidentified animal reported in 1785 suggest it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> common in the Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|Kleine was a philologist, his lessons {{not held}} in {{contemporary}} language, {{and it is}} not known for certain all subjects Busch and his friend were taught. Busch did learn elementary arithmetic from his uncle, although science lessons <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> comprehensive, as Kleine, like many other clergymen, was a beekeeper, and published essays and textbooks on the subject— Busch demonstrated his knowledge of bee-keeping in his future stories. Drawing, and German and English poetry, were also taught by Kleine.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E

60|$|He {{stopped and}} picked up a cobble-stone as he spoke, flinging it after his {{escaping}} prey. It narrowly missed Myles's head; had it struck him, there <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> no <b>more</b> of this story to tell.|$|R
5|$|Schwimmer {{concluded}} in 2002 that the feeding patterns of Deinosuchus most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller Deinosuchus specimens of eastern North America {{would have been}} opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche {{similar to that of}} the modern American alligator. They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, Deinosuchus that lived in Texas and Montana <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in Deinosuchuss eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian could have been the region's apex predator.|$|E
5|$|State-owned {{slaves were}} put to work in palaces, offices, workshops, stables, and {{sometimes}} state-owned agricultural fields, while privately owned slaves were employed in domestic services and sometimes farming. However, {{the vast majority of}} non-independent farmers working for wealthy landowners were not hired laborers or slaves, but were landless peasants who paid rent as tenants. It <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> economically feasible to maintain tenants instead of slaves, since slave masters were obligated to pay an annual poll tax of 240 coins for each slave they owned (the same rate merchants had to pay for their poll tax). Government slaves were not assigned to work in the government's monopolized industries over iron and salt (which lasted from Emperor Wu's reign until the beginning of Eastern Han). Privately owned slaves were usually assigned to kitchen duty while others fulfilled roles as armed bodyguards, mounted escorts, acrobats, jugglers, dancers, singers, and musicians.|$|E
25|$|Chasmosaurus shared its habitat, {{the east}} coast of Laramidia, with {{successive}} species of Centrosaurus. A certain niche partitioning is suggested by the fact that Chasmosaurus had a longer snout and jaws and <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> selective about the plants it ate.|$|E

"I {{accept the}} pledge, young sir," [...] rejoined Columbus, struck by his earnestness, and {{pleased with his}} sincerity--"though it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a <b>more</b> {{faithful}} representation of your thoughts had {{the order of the}} motives been reversed." ...|$|R
60|$|Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick was fair-haired, blue-eyed, and slender, with a rosy, boyish {{face that}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> molded <b>more</b> by an {{environment}} of luxury, indolence, and ease than the more strenuous exigencies of life's sterner requirements.|$|R

25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, Liam Cosgrave resigned as Fine Gael leader. He {{was replaced by}} his former Foreign Minister, Garret FitzGerald. Cosgrave retired at the 1981 general election. Cosgrave can be accused of calling the 1977 election prematurely, as the Irish economy was recovering rapidly in early 1977 and a later election in the autumn or winter of that year <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> propitious for the National Coalition.|$|E
25|$|In {{the initial}} questioning, {{it comes to}} light that the {{previous}} owner of the house, Sellon, {{was found dead in}} his shop, supposedly from a fall down the stairs, but it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> nefarious than that. There were suspicions of involvement in drugs and Sellon also left a note to the effect that he had come across something worth fourteen thousand pounds but no one has yet found out what the item was.|$|E
25|$|The CCSPS {{heart attack}} and {{cardiovascular}} death outcomes appear {{to be better than}} what has been reported for prescription statin drugs. A 2008 review pointed out that the cardioprotective effects of statins in Japanese populations occur at lower doses than are needed in Western populations, and theorized that the low amount of monacolins found in Xuezhikang <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> effectively athero-protective than expected in the Chinese population in the CCSPS study for the same reason.|$|E

25|$|The Leptocleididae {{radiated}} {{during the}} Early Cretaceous. These were rather small forms that, despite their short necks, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> {{closely related to}} the Plesiosauridae than to the Pliosauridae. Later in the Early Cretaceous, the Elasmosauridae appeared; these were among the longest plesiosaurs, reaching up to fifteen metres (fifty feet) in length due to very long necks containing as many as 76 vertebrae, more than any other known vertebrate. Pliosauridae were still present as is shown by large predators, such as Kronosaurus.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 1814, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher with 80,000 Allied {{troops from}} his own Army of Silesia and Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia {{defeated}} Napoleon and 45,000 French soldiers in the Battle of La Rothière. This setback seriously shook the French army's morale. Each side suffered about 6,000 casualties but the Allied captured 50–60 artillery pieces. The Allies were delighted by their victory, though it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> complete if all their reserves had been committed to the battle. At this time, the Allied generals made the questionable decision to separate their armies. Blücher's army would advance from Châlons-sur-Marne toward Meaux while Schwarzenberg's army operated on a more southerly route from Troyes toward Paris.|$|E
25|$|Although {{no peace}} treaty was signed, the eastern Roman borders were not {{attacked}} by the Sasanians in the next years. It <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> important for the Romans to attach Hatra to their fortresses of the border defense system. The people of Hatra knew that their relative autonomy, which became possible at the late Parthian era due to {{the weakness of the}} central government, was under the threat of the policies announced by the Sasanians. The foreign policy of the new Persian rulers was to proceed to the Occident and that was probably in order to divert the public attention from the internal problems of the land; that is while the procedure of the Parthians and the Romans in the final years was to leave everything be as they are.|$|E

500|$|Biden {{had felt}} poorly {{physically}} during {{parts of the}} campaign, suffering repeated headaches {{and at one point}} in September 1987 having to halt a speech in New Hampshire for 15 minutes after feeling faint. [...] In February 1988, he suffered the first of two brain aneurysms that required life-saving surgery and seven months away from the Senate in order to convalesce. [...] Biden and others would speculate that had his campaign not ended early, the aneurysms <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> severe or detected later and that he might not have lived out the year.|$|E
500|$|Meltwater from snow {{supports}} more life, {{at higher}} altitudes, on Licancabur than on similar mountains. Grasses, tola bushes, butterflies, flies and lizards are found {{as high as}} [...] Life further down the mountain could be supported by the fertilizing effect of dust from volcanic rocks. Polylepis incana <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> prevalent at Licancabur during wetter times, and is now more common in Bolivia. Chinchillas were found as high as [...] in 1955. The upper parts of the mountain had been avoided by hunters, and after some high-altitude attempts during the 1920s chinchilla hunting disappeared from the area. Licancabur {{is part of the}} Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve.|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} was still unsettled after Greenfield became premier in autumn 1921. Greenfield {{was at a}} loss as to how to respond to this crisis, complaining that both employees and employers were the most difficult people in the province to deal with and that they showed [...] "very little spirit of compromise". He tried to be balanced in his approach to this labour-employer friction but was not aided by his own Minister of Public Works, Labour MLA Alex Ross, who took the side of the miners and objected to the government's provision of police escorts for strikebreakers. [...] Though the problems originated before Greenfield took office, many Albertans felt that a stronger leader <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> successful than Greenfield in achieving industrial peace.|$|E
60|$|I {{had heard}} many weird tales about him, and worshipped {{him from a}} distance. It took the saloon to bring us together.

50|$|When {{examining}} the subcomponents of the index, any positive effect that {{a low level}} of taxes <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> disputed than the importance of rule of law, lack of political corruption, low inflation, and functioning property rights. Many north European nation, such as Iceland (# 70), Denmark (# 15), Finland (# 11) and Sweden (# 39), have extensive welfare states, which are strongly opposed by advocates of laissez-faire. It is argued these countries have less regulation than most others, and research using the Ease of Doing Business Index suggests that the effect of business regulations <b>is</b> <b>more</b> important than government consumption. The Global Competitiveness Report looks at several other factors that affect economic growth such as infrastructure, health, and education.|$|R
5000|$|Claims of [...] "near-room temperature" [...] {{transient}} effects {{date from}} the early 1950s and some suggest that in fact the breakthrough <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made <b>more</b> than once but could not be made stable enough and/or reproducible as the relationship between isotope number and Tc was not known at the time.|$|R
500|$|As the {{meetings}} continued, Hutchinson began offering her own religious views, stressing that only [...] "an intuition of the Spirit" [...] {{would lead to}} one's election by God, and not good works. [...] Her theological interpretations began diverging from the more legalistic views found among the colony's ministers, and the attendance increased at her meetings and soon included Governor Vane. [...] Her ideas that one's outward behaviour was not necessarily tied {{to the state of}} one's soul became attractive to those who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> attached to their professions than to their religious state, such as merchants and craftsmen. [...] The colony's ministers became more aware of Hutchinson's meetings, and they contended that such [...] "unauthorised" [...] religious gatherings might confuse the faithful. [...] Hutchinson responded to this with a verse from Titus, saying that [...] "the elder women should instruct the younger." ...|$|E
500|$|Species of both extinct {{and living}} (extant) lemur vary in size based on habitat conditions, despite their {{differences}} in niche preference. [...] Within related groups, larger species tend to inhabit wetter, more productive habitats, while smaller sister taxa {{are found in}} drier, less productive habitats. [...] This pattern suggests that populations of both living and extinct lemur species had become geographically isolated by differences in habitat and evolved in isolation due to varying primary production within different ecosystems. Thermoregulation may also {{have played a role}} in the evolution of their increased body size. [...] Yet despite this pressure to specialize and differentiate, some of the extinct subfossil lemurs, such as Archaeolemur, may have had island-wide distributions during the Holocene, unlike the living lemurs. [...] If this is the case, it may suggest that some larger lemurs <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> tolerant to regional differences in ecology than living lemurs.|$|E
500|$|Brundage {{connected}} {{the world of}} art and that of amateur sports in his own mind. In {{a speech to the}} IOC session in Tokyo in 1958, he discussed netsuke, used at one time by Japanese to anchor items hung from kimono sashes, and of which he owned several thousand; he held two in his hands as he spoke. He told the members that a netsuke was at one time carefully carved by the man who wore it, building [...] "something of himself into the design", and although a class of professional netsuke makers arose later, whose work <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> technically adept, it was, [...] "ordinarily cold, stiff, and without imagination.... Missing was the element of the amateur carver, which causes these netsuke to be esteemed so much higher by the collector than the commercial product carved for money." [...] Brundage later commented about his speech, [...] "Here was the difference between amateurism and professionalism spelled out in a netsuke." ...|$|E
