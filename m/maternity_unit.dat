5|$|In 1925, Ferrari {{was called}} to assist a {{military}} wife during childbirth at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires, which had no gynecological unit. After she proposed that one be developed, Ferrari started the facility with one bed and donated equipment and supplies. The military gazette began advertising from June of that year that gynecological services were available from Mondays to Fridays at the hospital. As military wives {{became aware of the}} services, the growth was exponential and within five years Ferrari had expanded the service to two floors that housed a <b>maternity</b> <b>unit</b> with two delivery rooms, their own sterilization facility, a recovery unit, and forty beds in private rooms. She also developed a small sealed room with purified air and an incubator, {{the first of its kind}} in Argentina. Ferrari brought the techniques she had learned abroad to Argentina. Though radiology had been performed in other parts of the world for decades, there was resistance to implementing it by professionals who had no experience with it. Ferrari insisted it should be introduced and fought against the previous practice of surgical solutions for all cases, advocating that surgery only be used when absolutely necessary. A commemoration for the 10th anniversary of the <b>maternity</b> <b>unit</b> was attended by the Minister of War, the Director General of Health, the Hospital Director and other senior officials, as well as by children born over the past 10 years together with their families. A commission of the Marine wives who had received service from Ferrari's unit made a substantial donation. Despite her success, the atmosphere at the hospital remained hostile. Following the 1930 coup d'état of José Félix Uriburu with the country's shift to a more conservative stance during the Infamous Decade, Ferrari ultimately was forced to leave the hospital in 1939.|$|E

40|$|Background: Evidence {{suggests}} {{the closure of}} <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> is associated {{with an increase in}} babies born before arrival (BBA). Aim: To explore the association between the number of <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> in Australia and Queensland by birthing numbers, BBA rate and geographic remoteness of the health district where the mother lives. Methods: A retrospective study utilised routinely collected perinatal data (1992 - 2011). Pearson correlation tested the relationship between BBA rate and number of <b>maternity</b> <b>units.</b> Linear regression examined this association over time. Findings: During 1992 - 2011, the absolute numbers (N= 22, 814) of women having a BBA each year in Australia increased by 47 % (N= 836 - 1233); and 206 % (n= 140 - 429) in Queensland. This coincided with a 41 % reduction in <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> in Australia (N= 623 - 368 = 18 per year) and a 28 % reduction in Queensland (n= 129 - 93). BBA rates increased significantly across Australia, r= 0. 837, n= 20 years, p< 0. 001 and Queensland, r= 0. 917, n= 20 years, p< 0. 001 and this was negatively correlated with the number of <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> in Australia, r= - 0. 804, n= 19 years, p< 0. 001 and Queensland, r= - 0. 906, n= 19 years, p< 0. 001. Conclusions: The closure of <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> over a 20 -year period across Australia and Queensland is significantly associated with increased BBA rates. The distribution is not limited to rural and remote areas. Given the high risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with BBA, it is time to revisit the closure of units...|$|R
40|$|In England and Wales, the Caesarean section (CS) rate is 21. 5 %, {{ranging from}} 6 % to 66 % between <b>maternity</b> <b>units.</b> The {{impact of a}} high CS rate on women's health and NHS {{resources}} is not clear. Case-mix differences {{should be taken into}} account to enable valid comparisons and exploration of factors contributing to this variation. An understanding of these factors is important to ensure quality of obstetric care. The aim of this thesis was to explore the variation in CS rates between <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> and evaluate the impact of (I) case-mix and (ii) women's birth preferences using National Sentinel Caesarean Section Audit (NSCSA) data. Summary of NSCSA data: Phase 1 (01. 05. 2000 to 31. 07. 2000) • Information on 150, 139 women giving birth in 216 <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> in England and Wales. Variables collected include age, ethnicity, parity, number of previous CS, mode of onset of labour, gestation, presentation, mode of delivery and birth weight. Phase 2 (01. 12. 2000 to 31. 01. 2001) • Survey of 2, 475 pregnant women from 40 selected <b>maternity</b> <b>units.</b> Variables include preferred type of birth. Case-mix data were also collected for all 32, 536 women giving birth in these <b>maternity</b> <b>units.</b> The relationship between case-mix variables and CS (i) before labour and (ii) during labour was demonstrated using logistic regression. Using tese results, standardised CS rates were calculated for individual <b>maternity</b> <b>units.</b> Using meta-analytical techniques, the amount of variation in CS rates explained by case-mix adjustment was quantified. Data on preferred type of birth were available for 7 % of women in Phase 2. Therefore various techniques for handling 'missing data' including multiple imputations were researched and applied to these data. Key findings:. The association between CS and case-mix variables vary for CS before labour and CS during labour. The odds of CS (before and in labour) increase with maternal age. Women from ethnic minority groups have lower odds of CS before labour, and increased odds of CS in labour. Women with a previous vaginal delivery have lower odds of CS, although the magnitude of this for CS before and in labour is markedly different.. Adjustment for case-mix explained 34 % of the variance in CS rates between <b>maternity</b> <b>units.</b> • Adjustment for case-mix differences and women's birth preferences explained 45 % of the variance in CS rates between <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> in England and Wales. 3 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Patient safety {{has been}} a {{priority}} for many societies and health care systems in the last decades. Identification of preventable risks and aversion of potentially unsafe situations and fatal complications in <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> is life saving. The explicit {{need to focus on}} quality of care underpins the aim of the study to initially evaluate the safety culture and teamwork climate in the public <b>Maternity</b> <b>Units</b> of the 5 Regional Hospitals in Cyprus as measured by a validated safety attitudes tool. Methods Data were collected from 140 midwives working in the public sector all over Cyprus by the Greek Version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire-Labor version. Results One hundred and six (75. 71 %) registered midwives completed the questionnaire fully. The median of total work experience as a registered midwife was 3 years (IQR: 2 - 18. 25); whereas the median of total working experience in the nursing and <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> was 5 years (IQR: 2 - 21. 75). Experienced midwives rated the following domains higher: team work, safety climate, job satisfaction and working conditions as opposed to the midwives with less experience. Additionally those with a longer working life in the current <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> rated these domains higher: safety climate, job satisfaction and working conditions as opposed to the less experienced midwives. Conclusions The high mean total score on team work and safety climate in the more experienced group of midwives is a predominant finding for the <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> of Cyprus. In Cyprus where facilities are small in size and midwives know each other, share more responsibility towards patient safety. It could be suggested that younger midwives need more support and teamwork practice to enhance the safety and teamwork climate towards self-confidence. </p...|$|R

The objective of this survey was to identify the types of incidents which triggered local reviews in the UK, in order to inform national safety reporting guidance. DESIGN: A national descriptive survey. SETTING: UK. PARTICIPANTS: Consultant-led <b>maternity</b> <b>units.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Seventy-one per cent of <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> provided an incident review trigger list. The conditions included were classified by two assessors. Incidents that were listed by at least 5 % of <b>maternity</b> <b>units</b> were reported and compared with incidents recommended for review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).
