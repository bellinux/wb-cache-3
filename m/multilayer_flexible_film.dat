40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{possible}} effects determined on polymeric food packaging films by the simultaneous {{application of pressure}} (P) and temperature (T) in high pressure pasteurization and sterilization treatments of packaged foodstuffs. Both theoretical modelling and experimental issues are discussed. In fact reversible and irreversible effects that could occur in single film {{as well as in}} multilayer film structures have been reviewed and correlated to the variation of structural andmorphological properties of the polymeric materials, under P/T conditions relevant for the specific application. The structural changes of the amorphous and crystalline domains of polymer films could possibly occur in response to pressure and/or temperature conditions, which, in turn, result in detectable effects on properties of packagingmaterials. Particular attention has been devoted to addressing issues like irreversible alteration of functional (i. e., barrier to gases and water vapor, scalping and migration phenomena) and mechanical properties of the packaging materials in a relationship with a modification of degree of crystallinity, aging of the amorphous phase, delamination of multilayer films, rubbery to glassy state transition promoted by pressure and plasticization induced by absorption of low molecular weight compounds. Industrial relevance: High pressure processing (HPP) is steadily gaining as a food preservationmethod that preserves natural sensory and nutritional attributes of food with a minimal quality loss. In fact, packaged foods processed by using this technique maintain most of their original texture and nutritional qualities, additionally exhibiting an extended shelf-life. Industrially, the selection of the proper polymeric materials as well as the packaging structure becomes extremely importantwhen both high pressure and high temperature are employed for high pressure sterilization processes. In this context, an important issue that is relevant for industrial applications is to predict the possible effects of treatments on the structure and morphology of thematerials which, in turn, can determine relevant effects on mechanical, functional (i. e., gas and vapor barrier properties) and aesthetic (e. g., see-through clarity) properties. In fact, modification of the crystallinity level, density change of amorphous regions and possible hydrolysis phenomena could hamper the use of the packaging material for the HPP applications. Moreover, <b>multilayer</b> <b>flexible</b> <b>films</b> can, in some cases, display delamination phenomena leading to unacceptable modifications of the aspect {{as well as of the}} integrity of the packaging structure...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of the {{addition}} of montmorillonite (MMT) nanoplatelets on whey protein isolate (WPI) -based nanocomposite films and coatings were investigated. The main objective was the development of WPI-based MMT nanocomposites with enhanced barrier and mechanical properties. WPI-based nanocomposite cast films and coatings were prepared by dispersing 0 % (reference sample), 3, 6, 9 % (w/w protein) MMT, or, depending on the protein concentration, also 12 and 15 % (w/w protein) MMT into native WPI-based dispersions, followed by subsequent denaturation during the drying and curing process. The natural MMT nanofillers could be randomly dispersed into film-forming WPI-based nanodispersions, displaying good compatibility with the hydrophilic biopolymer matrix. As a result, by addition of 15 % (w/w protein) MMT into 10 % (w/w dispersion) WPI-based cast films or coatings, the oxygen permeability (OP) was reduced by 91 % for glycerol-plasticized and 84 % for sorbitol-plasticized coatings, water vapor transmission rate was reduced by 58 % for sorbitol-plasticized cast films. Due to the addition of MMT nanofillers, the Young’s modulus and tensile strength improved by 315 and 129 %, respectively, whereas elongation at break declined by 77 % for glycerol-plasticized cast films. In addition, comparison of plasticizer type revealed that sorbitol-plasticized cast films were generally stiffer and stronger, but less flexible compared glycerol-plasticized cast films. Viscosity measurements demonstrated good processability and suitability for up-scaled industrial processes of native WPI-based nanocomposite dispersions, even at high-nanofiller loadings. These results suggest that the addition of natural MMT nanofillers into native WPI-based matrices to form nanocomposite films and coatings holds great potential to replace well-established, fossil-based packaging materials for at least certain applications such as oxygen barriers as part of <b>multilayer</b> <b>flexible</b> packaging <b>films...</b>|$|R

This study evaluated the influence of PATP on two state-of-the-art <b>multilayer</b> EVOH <b>films.</b> <b>Flexible</b> pouches containing water as the food simu-lant were made from the two films and processed at 680 MPa for 3 min at 105 C and 680 MPa for 5 min at 100 C. Each film was investigated for its oxygen transmission rates (OTRs), melting temperature (Tm), enthalpy of melting (DH), and overall crystallinity before (control) and after processing. The changes in OTRs and total DH of the two films were also analyzed during a storage period of 240 days in ambient conditions after processing. Results showed a significant (P 0. 05) change in the Tm and DH of the two films. The overall crystallinity of film A decreased, but improved slightly for film B after PATP. A recovery in the OTRs of the two films occurred during storage. The films also showed changes in the total DH measured during the storage period, which was used to explain {{the changes in the}} oxygen barrier prop-erties. The OTR of both films remained below 2 cc/m 2 day, which is required in packaging applications for shelf-stable foods with a 1 -year shelf life.

40|$|Transformation optics {{offers a}} {{theoretical}} {{tool for the}} design of electromagnetic devices that can manipulate the flow of microwaves in an unprecedented way, but also places demanding requirements on the permittivity ε and permeability μ of materials used to form the devices, along with their spatial variations in three dimensions. Polymers that are light-weight and with high processability are considered potentially useful in realizing transformation optic designs, but only where the effective ε and μ can be increased controllably by loading the polymer with inorganic particles. This thesis focuses on the development of bespoke polymer-based composite materials and robust manufacturing approaches for potential applications in electromagnetic devices. Three main manufacturing approaches have been explored. Firstly, casting was demonstrated to produce bulk materials with equal permittivity and permeability by embedding NiZn ferrite particles in an epoxy matrix. Hybrid composites with a combination of soft magnetic ferrite and metallic magnetic fillers, anisotropic composites with magnetic field aligned fillers, and high magnetic anisotropic materials with multi-layered structures were all produced successfully. Developed materials showed superior electromagnetic properties to many competitor approaches for miniaturization and low profile antenna, especially for the case of magnetically anisotropic cast tiles. Secondly, a spray deposition approach was developed for the fabrication of large-scale nanocomposite polymer-based films. By incorporating Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles or multi-wall carbon nanotubes, as a thin sandwich layer into a perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) matrices respectively, 30 - 50 μm thick <b>flexible</b> <b>multilayer</b> nanocomposite <b>films</b> with enhanced dielectric and magnetic properties were produced.

40|$|Delamination {{phenomena}} frequently {{occur when}} multi-layer <b>flexible</b> polymeric <b>films</b> are employed for high pressure treatments of food packaging for pasteurization and sterilization purposes, thus potentially limiting {{the reliability of}} this treatment technology. The motivation of delamination is however not yet well understood. For this reason, to catch the key factors leading to interlaminar stress fields which can be prodromal to localized delamination events, the issue ofmechanical failure of bi-layer structures under high pressure is thoroughly addressed in the present work, by constructing analytical models and Finite Element based numerical simulations. The theoretical results highlight the crucial {{role played by the}} mismatch of Young's moduli and Poisson ratios of the laminated film sheets in promoting delamination. These outcomes are in full agreement with experimental findings obtained by performing tests on high pressure-treated foodmultilayer packages realized coupling different polymeric materials, that is polypropylene-polyethyleneterephthalate, polypropylene-cast polyamide and polypropylene-bioriented polyamide. Industrial relevance: High pressure processing is a promising food preservation method endowed with minimal quality loss.
