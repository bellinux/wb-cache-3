No one was stirring; and nothing was to be seen but a clumsy old chest of native workmanship, a few calabashes, and bundles of tappa hanging against a post; and a heap of something, we knew not what, in a dark corner. Upon close inspection, the doctor discovered it to be a loving old couple, locked in each other's arms, and rolled together in a tappa mantle.|$|E
60|$|Cow Island {{is not an}} island,--at least, at this season,--though, I believe, in {{the time}} of freshets, the marshy Charles floods the meadows all round about it, and extends across its {{communication}} with the mainland. The path to it is a very secluded one, threading a wood of pines, and just wide enough to admit the loads of <b>meadow</b> <b>hay</b> which are drawn from the splashy shore of the river. The island has a growth of stately pines, with tall and ponderous stems, standing at distance enough to admit the eve to travel far among them; and, as there is no underbrush, the effect is somewhat like looking among the pillars of a church.|$|E

How, then, do you expect to do it all by yourself? But listen to me, and do what I tell you. It is your only chance. When you have filled the manger as full as it will hold you must weave a strong plait of the rushes which grow among the <b>meadow</b> <b>hay,</b> and cut a thick peg of stout wood, and be sure that the horse sees what you are doing. Then it will ask you what it is for, and you will say, 'With this plait I intend to bind up your mouth so that you cannot eat any more, and with this peg I am going to keep you still in one spot, so that you cannot scatter your corn and water all over the place!'

60|$|With its {{beautiful}} purple blush it reminds me, and supplies the place, of the Rhexia, {{which is now}} leaving off, {{and it is one}} of the most interesting phenomena of August. The finest patches of it grow on waste strips or selvages of land at the base of dry hills, just above the edge of the meadows, where the greedy mower does not deign to swing his scythe; for this is a thin and poor grass, beneath his notice. Or, it may be, because it is so beautiful he does not know that it exists; for the same eye does not see this and Timothy. He carefully gets the <b>meadow</b> <b>hay</b> and the more nutritious grasses which grow next to that, but he leaves this fine purple mist for the walker's harvest,--fodder for his fancy stock. Higher up the hill, perchance, grow also Blackberries, John's-Wort, and neglected, withered, and wiry June-Grass. How fortunate that it grows in such places, and not in the midst of the rank grasses which are annually cut! Nature thus keeps use and beauty distinct. I know many such localities, where it does not fail to present itself annually, and paint the earth with its blush. It grows on the gentle slopes, either in a continuous patch or in scattered and rounded tufts a foot in diameter, and it lasts till it is killed by the first smart frosts.|$|E

6000|$|To speak literally, {{a hundred}} Irishmen, with Yankee overseers, came from Cambridge {{every day to}} get out the ice. They divided it into cakes by methods too well known to require description, and these, being sledded to the shore, were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform, and raised by {{grappling}} irons and block and tackle, worked by horses, on to a stack, as surely as so many barrels of flour, and there placed evenly side by side, and row upon row, as if they formed the solid base of an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds. They told me that in a good day they could get out a thousand tons, which was the yield of about one acre. Deep ruts and [...] "cradle-holes" [...] were worn in the ice, as on terra firma, by the passage of the sleds over the same track, and the horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out like buckets. They stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile thirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square, putting hay between the outside layers to exclude the air; for when the wind, though never so cold, finds a passage through, it will wear large cavities, leaving slight supports or studs only here and there, and finally topple it down. At first it looked like a vast blue fort or Valhalla; but when they began to tuck the coarse <b>meadow</b> <b>hay</b> into the crevices, and this became covered with rime and icicles, it looked like a venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin, built of azure-tinted marble, the abode of Winter, that old man we see in the almanac--his shanty, as if he had a design to estivate with us. They calculated that not twenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination, and that two or three per cent would be wasted in the cars. However, a still greater part of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended; for, either because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expected, containing more air than usual, or for some other reason, it never got to market. This heap, made in the winter of '46-7 and estimated to contain ten thousand tons, was finally covered with hay and boards; and though it was unroofed the following July, and a part of it carried off, the rest remaining exposed to the sun, it stood over that summer and the next winter, and was not quite melted till September, 1848. Thus the pond recovered the greater part.|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of traditional management practices {{is essential for}} the conservation of the biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands including species-rich <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> In the canton Valais (Switzerland), <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> are traditionally irrigated using open water channels. However, since the 1980 s, this labour intensive irrigation technique has been increasingly replaced by sprinkler irrigation. This study examined whether the different irrigation techniques (traditional vs. sprinkler) influence the local biodiversity of species-rich <b>hay</b> <b>meadows.</b> In particular, the diversity and composition of plant and gastropod species of eight traditionally irrigated meadows were compared with those of eight sprinkler-irrigated meadows. It was also assessed whether the species of either meadow type differed in functional traits. A high plant species richness was found in the meadows investigated. The study showed that the diversity and composition of plant and gastropod species of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> were not affected by the change in irrigation technique 8 – 18 years ago. However, a lower grass/forb-ratio was observed in traditionally than in sprinkler-irrigated meadows. Furthermore, irrigation technique affected the leaf distribution and the onset of seed shedding in plants. Thus, the change in the irrigation technique altered only some aspects of biodiversity. Therefore, irrigation system alone does not represent the major factor affecting the biodiversity of <b>hay</b> <b>meadows</b> investigated...|$|R
