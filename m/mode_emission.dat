40|$|Abstract. Plasma waves {{observed}} in the Saturn magneto-sphere provide {{an indication of the}} plasma population present in the rotationally dominated inner magnetosphere. Electro-static cyclotron emissions often with harmonics and whistler <b>mode</b> <b>emission</b> are a common feature of Saturn’s inner mag-netosphere. The electron observations for a region near 5 RS outside and near a plasma injection region indicate a cooler low-energy ( 1000 eV) more pancake or butterfly distribution. We model the electron plasma distributions to conduct a lin-ear dispersion analysis of the wave modes. The results sug-gest that the electrostatic electron cyclotron emissions can be generated by phase space density gradients associated with a loss cone that may be up to 20 ◦ wide. This loss cone is some-times, but not always, observed because the field of view of the electron detectors does not include the magnetic field line {{at the time of the}} observations.

Electrostatic cyclotron emissions often with harmonics and whistler <b>mode</b> <b>emission</b> are a common feature of Saturn's inner magnetosphere.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for the Ulysses trajectory to attain high ecliptic latitudes using a Jovian gravitational assist resulted in a fortuitous passage through the Io torus region. Specifically, the spacecraft spent many hours at latitudes just above the torus. During this time the low-frequency cutoff of an ordinary mode (O <b>mode)</b> <b>emission</b> allowed a determination of the local electron plasma frequency (i. e., electron density) along the northern flank of the torus. Also, near a Jovian System III longitude of 100 deg, the spacecraft flew past a set of active field lines that have been previously identified {{to be associated with}} the hectometric generation region. During the passage, Ulysses observed a newly discovered O mode component and a whistler <b>mode</b> <b>emission</b> similar to that observed by Voyager 1 13 years previously. All of the broadband VLF emissions imply the presence of a particular population of electrons.

40|$|Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) {{are capable}} of high power, tunable {{wavelength}} and single <b>mode</b> <b>emission</b> at room temperature in the mid-infrared wavelength region. These capabilities make them perfect light sources for laser based gas spectroscopy. The work described in this thesis focuses on development of QCLs suitable for selective gas sensing applications. The thesis starts with the description of different changes to the QCL active region design. These changes were studied {{in order to improve}} laser performance while keeping the emission wavelength fixed. The proposed modifications were performed on short mid-infrared wavelength (lambda= 3 - 4 um) quantum cascade lasers based on InGaAs/AlAsSb and InAs/AlSb material systems. The focus of this work is then moved to the description of a single mode quantum cascade laser with a third order unilateral grating. The previously unreported grating architecture that was used to achieve distributed feedback (DFB) in a QCL, as well as grating design and laser characterization are detailed in Chapter . The reported laser generates single <b>mode</b> <b>emission</b> with 30 dB side mode suppression ratio and a linewidth of 0. 4 cm^(- 1). The simplified fabrication process for a third order DFB grating is developed for lambda= 3. 3 - 3. 6 um emission wavelength. A different approach to achieve single <b>mode</b> <b>emission</b> in a QCL is described in Chapter 6. An external cavity QCL setup combined with the Fabry-Perot (FP) reflector is reported for the first time. The FP reflector is used to provide selective feedback that is controlled by the separation distance between two FP reflector mirrors. This external cavity arrangement allows generation of a wide spectral range and the rapid wavelength tuning capability. Finally, the thesis is concluded with sensitive gas detection experiments. The direct absorption technique is utilized to demonstrate the 160 ppmv detection of methane with the ro-vibrational absorption line located at lambda= 3. 3 um and 1 ppmv detection of nitric oxide with the absorption line located at lambda= 5. 3 um. The experiments were performed using single mode lasers that were designed and fabricated in Sheffield...|$|E

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{probe the}} non-resonant feeding of photons into the optical mode of a two dimensional photonic crystal nanocavity from the discrete emission from a quantum dot. For a strongly coupled system {{of a single}} exciton and the cavity mode, we track the detuning-dependent photoluminescence intensity of the polariton peaks at different lattice temperatures.

For a different dot-cavity system where the cavity mode is detuned by Δ E> 5 meV to lower energy than the single exciton transitions emission from the mode remains correlated with the quantum dot as demonstrated unambiguously by cross-correlation photon counting experiments. By monitoring the temporal evolution of the photoluminescence spectrum, we show that feeding of photons into the mode occurs from multi-exciton transitions.
