500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value.

500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E

2500|$|Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda expounded on the words, [...] "Then the Lord God formed ( [...] , wa-yitzer) man," [...] in [...] Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda {{taught that}} the word וַיִּיצֶר, wa-yitzer is written with two yuds (...) to show that God created people with two inclinations (yetzerim), one good and one evil. Rav Nahman bar Isaac demurred, arguing that {{according}} to this logic, animals, of which [...] writes , wa-yitzer with a single yud, should have no evil inclination (yetzer hara), but we see that they injure, bite, and kick, plainly evincing an evil inclination. Rather, Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi explained that the two yuds by saying, [...] "Woe is <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> my Creator (yotzri), woe is <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> my evil inclination (yitzri)!" [...] Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi thus indicated that the two yuds indicate the human condition, where God punishes us for giving in to our evil inclination, but our evil inclination tempts us {{when we try to}} resist. Alternatively, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar explained that the two yuds reflect that God created two countenances in the first man, one man and one woman, back to back, as [...] says, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Livni {{noted in}} a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin's policies at the time.

Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell down on <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> what happened to us, to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1817 the troops of José de San Martín crossed the Andes {{to put an end}} to Spanish dominion in Chile. In the face of the disintegration of the royalist forces, Maroto proposed abandoning the capital and retreating southward, where they could hold out and obtain resources for a new campaign. The military conference called by Marcó on February 8 adopted Maroto's strategy, but the following morning the captain changed his mind and ordered Maroto to prepare for battle in Chacabuco. The night before the combat, Antonio Quintanilla, who would later distinguish himself extraordinarily in the defense of Chiloé, confided with another official regarding the ill-chosen strategy and that, given the position of the insurgents, the royalist forces ought to retreat a few leagues towards the hills of Colina: [...] "Maroto overheard this conversation from a nearby chamber and either couldn't or refused to hear <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his pride and self-importance, called on an attendant with his notorious hoarse voice and proclaimed a general decree on pain of death, to whomever suggested a retreat." [...] Although Maroto and his troops fought with valor, the battle turned into a complete defeat.

I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank.

Dev Anand aspired to become a performer after seeing Ashok Kumar's performance in films like Achhut Kanya and Kismet.

[...] Then he was soon offered the lead role in Prabhat Films' Hum Ek Hain (1946), a film about Hindu-Muslim unity, where Dev Anand played a Hindu boy and was paired opposite Kamala Kotnis. While shooting the film in Pune, Anand befriended the actor Guru Dutt. Between them, they agreed that if one of them were to become successful in the film industry, he would help the other also to be successful. They formed a mutual understanding that when Anand produced a film, Dutt would direct it and when Dutt directed a film, Anand would act in it.|$|E
