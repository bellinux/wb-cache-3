5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military explosive ordnance disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> in the transmitters.|$|E

25|$|The {{microwave}} bridge contains {{both the}} microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source {{there is an}} isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} <b>microwave</b> <b>power.</b> This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{magnetron}} is {{a fairly}} efficient device. In a microwave oven, for instance, a 1.1-kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of <b>microwave</b> <b>power,</b> an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and {{the properties of the}} cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large S band magnetrons can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75kW. Some large magnetrons are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.|$|E
25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed to microwave radiation {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> into an electrical current.|$|E

The enzyme can be easily extracted by homogenization in phosphate buffer. The optimal pH for enzyme activity was 7, at an optimal concentration of H 2 O 2 around 50 mM. The optimal temperature interval for the assays was between 30 - 40 Â°C. In these conditions the KM was 105 mM. The influence of the irradiation of the enzymatic extract with different <b>microwave</b> <b>powers</b> for different interval of time was assessed.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} issue of cosmological {{parameter}} estimation in light of current and upcoming high-precision measurements of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> background <b>power</b> spectrum. Physical quantities which determine the power spectrum are reviewed, and their connection to familiar cosmological parameters is explicated. We present a set of physical parameters, analytic functions of the usual cosmological parameters, upon which the <b>microwave</b> background <b>power</b> spectrum depends linearly (or with some other simple dependence) {{over a wide range}} of parameter values. With such a set of parameters, <b>microwave</b> background <b>power</b> spectra can be estimated with high accuracy and negligible computational effort, vastly increasing the efficiency of cosmological parameter error determination. The techniques presented here allow calculation of <b>microwave</b> background <b>power</b> spectra $ 10 ^ 5 $ times faster than comparably accurate direct codes (after precomputing a handful of power spectra). We discuss various issues of parameter estimation, including parameter degeneracies, numerical precision, mapping between physical and cosmological parameters, and systematic errors, and illustrate these considerations with an idealized model of the MAP experiment.

25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely in the paper , which also shows that this semiconductor device structure is well suited for <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> amplification. It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and it also has a control terminal, the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, the {{specific}} heating {{effect of a}} high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set {{he was working on}} started to melt a candy bar he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters. To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Drying {{characteristics}} of sawdust was studied under batch mode using lab scale microwave dryer. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the effect of material load and <b>microwave</b> output <b>power</b> on drying {{characteristics of}} sawdust. Methods: Material load and <b>microwave</b> output <b>power</b> were varied from 23 to 186 g and 530 to 370 W respectively. Different kinetic models were tested to fit the drying rates of sawdust. Similarly, the activation energy was calculated by employing the Arrhenius equation.

The insects {{were exposed to}} 2450 MHz at five different power levels of 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 W for five exposure times of 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 min. A complete mortality was achieved for tested insect at 400 W power level for exposure time of 12 min and 72 h cold storage period.
