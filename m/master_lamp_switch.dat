50|$|The {{system was}} {{deployed}} with an earlier two-stage switch labeled “Auto-Sport”, with a later modification of “Auto-Soft-Mid-Hard”. Some variations used a dial to specifically select {{the level of}} hardness to the driver’s desires. For most driving situations, the “Auto” selection was recommended. When the system was activated, an indicator light reflected the suspension setting selected.The system components consisted of a control switch, indicator light, four shock absorbers, shock absorber control actuator, shock absorber control computer, vehicle speed sensor, stop <b>lamp</b> <b>switch,</b> with a throttle position sensor and {{a steering angle sensor}} on TEMS three stage systems only.|$|R

50|$|Some {{have claimed}} Thomson's lamp is {{physically}} impossible since {{it must have}} parts moving at speeds faster {{than the speed of}} light (e.g., the <b>lamp</b> <b>switch).</b> Adolf Grünbaum suggests that the lamp could have a strip of wire which, when lifted, disrupts the circuit and turns off the lamp; this strip could then be lifted by a smaller distance each time the lamp is to be turned off, maintaining a constant velocity. However, such a design would ultimately fail, as eventually the distance between the contacts would be so small as to allow electrons to jump the gap, preventing the circuit from being broken at all.|$|R

5000|$|For 1999, the Mustang also {{received}} a change to its taillights, making them edgier, with sharp corners and straight lines {{as opposed to the}} rounded off style of previous years. The lamps were still composed of three vertical segments, reminiscent of the original. Minimal changes occurred from year-to-year, most noticeable was a redesigned center panel in the dashboard for 2001, which now allowed double-din stereo head units, including an in-dash six-CD player. The rear window defroster switch, previously mounted below the headlamp pull switch, was moved to the lower center stack below the stereo. When equipped, the fog <b>lamp</b> <b>switch</b> was relocated to the lower center stack as well, previously, it was on the center console adjacent to the cup holders. The third button on the lower switch panel was for the traction control system (on V8 models). On convertible models, the power roof switch remained on the center console - on coupe models, that switch was replaced with a small coin holder.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Suppose we {{are given}} an infinite, finitely {{generated}} group G and a transient random walk with bounded range on the wreath product (Z/ 2 Z) ≀ G, such that its projection on G is transient. This random walk {{can be interpreted as}} a lamplighter random walk, where there is a lamp at each element of G, which can be switched on and off, and a lamplighter walks along G and <b>switches</b> <b>lamps</b> randomly on and off. Our aim is to show that the lamplighter random walk escapes with respect to a suitable (pseudo-) metric on the wreath product faster to infinity than its projection onto G. For this purpose, we show that the asymptotic linear rate of burning lamps is non-zero, providing an acceleration of the lamplighter. If <b>lamp</b> <b>switches</b> are not charged by the pseudo-metric and if G = Z, we prove that the rate of escape with respect to the pseudo-metric, which becomes the length of a shortest “travelling salesman tour”, is strictly bigger than the rate of escape of the lamplighter random walk’s projection on G. We prove the same for nondegenerate cases if G = Z. Furthermore, we prove for G having infinitely many ends the acceleration with respect to a Markovian distance, which arises from probabilities on (Z/ 2 Z) ≀ G and the metric on G. 1...|$|R

30|$|As a {{reference}} for the above x-ray experiments, we also observed free radical formation in cells that received 5 minutes of mercury lamp illumination. The cell samples were prepared {{following the same}} protocol as the x-ray experiments. A confocal fluorescence image was acquired immediately before the mercury <b>lamp</b> was <b>switched</b> on. Then the cells were illuminated for 5 minutes, and a second fluorescence image was acquired. A total of 8 separate samples were studied.|$|R

50|$|If {{the load}} were {{guaranteed}} to be balanced, then the neutral conductor would not carry any current and the system would be equivalent to a single-ended system of twice the voltage with the line wires taking half the current.

40|$|International audienceThree d-xylan type per-O-methylated trisaccharides {{with various}} types of {{linkages}} between the d-xylopyranose units were examined by atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode. The most interesting feature of a thermospray mass spectrum using the APPI source with UV <b>lamp</b> <b>switched</b> off, is the exclusive production of [M+Na](+) adduct ions. [M+Na](+) cationized ions are the most abundant species {{in the case of}} APPI mass spectrometry. The second ionization process has no analogy in the case of substances studied using APPI to date. This aspect involves the addition of a water molecule to the molecular ion of a per-O-methylated saccharide, giving rise to [M+H(2) O](+) adduct ions. The [M+H(2) O](+) species are readily detected at m/z 544, and are clearly visible for all three isomers studied. The MS/MS spectrum of [M+Na](+) ions contains a base peak at m/z 375, produced by a Y-type cleavage of the trisaccharide, along with a hydrogen rearrangement on the terminal interglycosidically linkage glycosidic oxygen atom. The [M+H(2) O](+) species fragment largely give rise to ions at m/z 175, 143 and, as a result, the m/z 111 ion is unique to nonreducing terminal units...|$|R
