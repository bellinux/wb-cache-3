500|$|I have {{demonstrated}} on myself in an injury occasioned by a fall, that it [...] {{did for me}} what surgeons could not do. Dr. Cushing of this city pronounced my injury incurable and that I could not survive three days because of it, when {{on the third day}} I rose from <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> to the utter confusion of all I commenced my usual avocations and notwithstanding displacements, etc., I regained the natural position and functions of the body.|$|E
500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman in his bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying in <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|... {{house was}} on fire. My father was {{standing}} beside <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> woke me up. I dressed quickly. Mother {{wanted to stop}} and save her jewel-case; but Father said: 'I refuse to let myself and my two children be burnt {{for the sake of}} your jewel-case.' We hurried downstairs, and as soon as I was outside I woke up.|$|E
60|$|A most {{beautiful}} summer morning succeeded, and after breakfast {{we went out}} arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion. We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side wall, {{of which he had}} the key, and the first thing I saw was that the <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> flowers were all laid out according to the manner of <b>my</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> flowers at home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will bury that nasty {{person in}} the hole which he has dug. I will bring <b>my</b> <b>bedding</b> out, <b>and</b> dry it in the sun," [...] said Mr. Tod.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, that is possible!" [...] {{the countess}} exclaimed; [...] "I could knot <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> clothes <b>and</b> slide down. It matters not about getting back again, {{since we have}} no ladder." ...|$|R
2500|$|From 2002 to 2006, Brown {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with film producer Christine Crokos. Brown and Crokos lived together in Los Angeles, California. Asked about the relationship, Brown said: [...] "People call me lesbian, bisexual or heterosexual, but I know who's in <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> that's it. I have a huge libido and a great sex life". Brown and Crokos' relationship ended in 2006. Brown has said that she had a four-year relationship with a woman when in her teens.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse came to Burbank's studio one hot day, fanning {{himself with}} a big turkey wing. [...] "He sat down on <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and,</b> not noticing, put his hat down {{on a sheet of}} sticky flypaper I had placed there. To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper with his other hand, and soon he was tangled up gloriously. Before I could come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Ginsberg {{received}} a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of [...] "Howl" [...] he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, [...] "The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window – I have the key – Get married Allen don't take drugs – the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window". In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg's brother Eugene, she said, [...] "God's informers come to <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key {{on the side of the}} window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window." [...] These letters and the absence of a facility to recite kaddish inspired Ginsberg to write [...] "Kaddish" [...] which makes references to many details from Naomi's life, Ginsberg's experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines [...] "the key is in the light" [...] and [...] "the key is in the window".|$|E
6000|$|... "Matter! The Black Hole at Calcutta is the matter. Poisonous, gaseous {{exhalation}} is the matter! Outrageous, ungentlemanly snoring is the matter! give me <b>my</b> <b>bedding,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> drop of brandy, and my pipe, {{and let me}} go on deck. Let me be a Chaldean shepherd, and {{contemplate the}} stars. Let me be the careful watch who patrols the deck, and guards the ship from foes and wreck. Let me be anything but the companion of men who snore like the famous Furies in the old Greek play." [...] While I am venting my indignation, <b>and</b> collecting <b>my</b> <b>bedding,</b> the smiling <b>and</b> sleepy face of Mr. Migott disappears slowly {{from the side of}} the hammock--and before I am on deck, I hear the oily purr once more, just as amiable, soft, and regular as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Claus, happily. [...] "Now I {{will put}} you in <b>my</b> warm <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> you must sleep until morning, when I will carry you back to your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, my friends, {{with what}} a brave carouse [...] I made a second {{marriage}} in my house-- [...] Divorced old barren Reason from <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> [...] <b>And</b> took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{laughed with}} scorn as I lay in <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> (<b>and</b> {{so did the}} ghost give a ghastly snigger).|$|E
60|$|No! I {{lie down}} on <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> I {{discover}} {{that there is no}} rest for me that night.|$|E
60|$|Then we parted, and {{too tired}} even to wonder any more, I threw myself down on <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> slept.|$|E
60|$|That {{night in}} the chill dead hour before the dawn Oro came again. I woke up to see him seated by <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> majestic, <b>and,</b> as it seemed to me, lambent, though {{this may have been}} my imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come in, my poor dear, come in,' {{said the}} good {{woman in a}} tremulous voice, drawing Janet within the door. 'Come into <b>my</b> warm <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> may God in heaven save and comfort you.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "After I {{resigned}} {{this game}} with perfect self-control and solemnly {{shook hands with}} my opponent {{in the best of}} Anglo-Saxon traditions, I rushed home, where I threw myself onto <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> howling <b>and</b> screaming, and pulled the blankets over my face." ...|$|R
60|$|On this {{particular}} occasion I made my barricade stronger than usual; {{sat down on}} <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> opened the packet from home.|$|E
60|$|Dead leaves blew into my room, And alighted upon <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>And</b> a tree {{declared}} to the gloom Its sorrow {{that they were}} shed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good," [...] exclaimed Bridge. [...] "I wonder what's keeping James. He {{should have}} been here long since to turn down <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> fix my bath." ...|$|E
6000|$|You know, my friends, {{with what}} a brave carouse [...] I made a second {{marriage}} in my house, [...] Divorced old barren Reason from <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> [...] <b>And</b> took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse. [...] (St. 60, Mr. Fitzgeralds translation.) ...|$|R
60|$|At last I saw {{the shadowed}} bars, Like a lattice wrought in lead, Move {{right across the}} {{whitewashed}} wall That faced <b>my</b> three-plank <b>bed,</b> <b>And</b> I knew that {{somewhere in the world}} God's dreadful dawn was red.|$|R
60|$|They're back. Dan {{is lying}} on <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> I'll try <b>and</b> tell you his story as near as I can, in his own words.|$|R
60|$|I {{gave up the}} struggle. In dull, stupid, obstinate despair, I threw {{myself on}} <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> fell from sheer fatigue into a broken, uneasy sleep.|$|E
60|$|When I got home, I threw {{myself on}} <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> enjoyed a {{delightful}} sleep, and when I awoke felt cool and fresh, and very happy.|$|E
60|$|I {{arranged}} {{that this}} letter, which I took great pleasure in writing, {{should be left}} on <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> discovered so soon as my flight was known.|$|E
6000|$|Sunset, twilight, night came as we trotted on and on. We faced a cold wind. The {{forest was}} black, gloomy, full of shadows. Lee gave us {{all we could}} do to keep up with him. At eight o'clock, two hours after dark, we reached the {{southern}} end of Mormon Lake. A gale, cold as ice, blew off the water from the north. Half a dozen huge pine trees stood on the only level ground near at hand. [...] "Nielsen, fire--pronto!" [...] I yelled. [...] "Aye, sir," [...] he shouted, in his deep voice. Then what with hurry and bustle to get <b>my</b> <b>bedding</b> <b>and</b> packs, and to thresh my tingling fingers, and press my frozen ears, I was selfishly busy a few minutes before I thought of Romer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are my oysters," [...] {{he said at}} last. [...] "I {{know they}} are my oysters. You raided <b>my</b> <b>beds</b> last night <b>and</b> robbed me of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on, Dorothy; go on. I'm {{so weak that}} I {{can hardly}} stir myself; it's the first moment that I've been out of <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> for weeks;--and {{of course you can}} say what you please. I know what it will be. I shall have to take to <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> again, <b>and</b> then,--in a very little time,--you can both--make fools of yourselves,--just as you like." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{climbed down}} from <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> made my toilet leisurely. When I had finished, Mr. Harrison appeared, and {{together}} we had breakfast, and, five hours later, dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take me to <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> {{bring my}} jewel box," [...] she said, with a shuddering sigh, as the {{faithful}} servant received {{her with an}} exclamation of thankfulness.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} be quiet now, my dear fellow, after your dose; talking will only excite you. Settle {{yourself}} on <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> I'll be back in an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought that}} it was fancy, and I listen'd in <b>my</b> <b>bed,</b> [...] <b>And</b> then did {{something}} speak to me--I know not what was said; [...] For great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind, [...] And up the valley came again the music on the wind.|$|R
60|$|MARGARET. Except {{just once}} more. I don't mean now, {{but when my}} hair is really up. If I should ever have a--a Margaret of my own, come in and see me, Daddy, in <b>my</b> white <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> say 'snap'--and I'll have the biscuit ready.|$|R
6000|$|... "One night Mahon spoke {{through the}} small window of my berth. It opened right into <b>my</b> very <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> I was lying there sleepless, in my boots, feeling as though I had not slept for years, and could not if I tried. He said excitedly-- ...|$|R
