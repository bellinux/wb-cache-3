50|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> sweep out {{a larger}} area than {{mechanical}} pumps, {{and do so}} more frequently, making them capable of much higher pumping speeds. They do this {{at the expense of}} the seal between the vacuum and their exhaust. Since there is no seal, a small pressure at the exhaust can easily cause backstreaming through the pump; this is called stall. In high vacuum, however, pressure gradients have little effect on fluid flows, and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> can attain their full potential.|$|E

Entrapment pumps capture gases in a solid or adsorbed state. This includes cryopumps, getters, and ion pumps.|$|E
40|$|Abstracts: The {{research}} investigates {{two kinds}} basic problems during the precision processing about turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor using 5 -axis machining center. The {{one is to}} study the geometric and dimensional precision of turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor. The other one is to study the accuracy evaluative factors of 5 -axis turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor machining center. For improving the processing precision to ensure the dynamic symmetry and geometric symmetry of the turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor, it focus on analyzing the allowable deviations from the turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> rotor’s nominal geometry and dimensions specified during the design stage by defining tolerances on the part’s features using geometric dimensioning tolerancing standards and homogeneous transformation matrix. The geometric and dimensional errors deviation model of this feature can be represented by a HTM Hq.

40|$|In {{the context}} of modern {{industry}} the <b>molecular</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> (MVP) are widely used. The analyzed current market of vacuum technology enables drawing a conclusion that this equipment holds {{one of the leading}} positions among the high-vacuum facilities of pumping due to their advantages such as insensitivity to the atmosphere breakthrough, ability to pump out heavy gases quickly, rapid start-up time, and oil-free pumping. The earlier developed authors’ mathematical model and calculation program are used to assess the influence efficiency of the key geometrical parameters of flowing part of the cylindrical <b>molecular</b> <b>pump</b> on its main characteristics.

50|$|The {{impact of}} {{molecular}} size must be considered. Smaller molecules can leak in more easily {{and are more}} easily absorbed by certain materials, and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> are less effective at pumping gases with lower molecular weights. A system {{may be able to}} evacuate nitrogen (the main component of air) to the desired vacuum, but the chamber could still be full of residual atmospheric hydrogen and helium. Vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as palladium (which is a high-capacity hydrogen sponge) create special outgassing problems.|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> are the {{diffusion}} pump and the turbomolecular pump. Both types of pumps blow out gas molecules that diffuse into the pump by imparting momentum {{to the gas}} molecules. Diffusion pumps blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular pumps use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these pumps will stall and fail to pump if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical pump.|$|E
50|$|Outgassing {{can also}} be reduced simply by {{desiccation}} prior to vacuum pumping.High vacuum systems generally require metal chambers with metal gasket seals such as Klein flanges or ISO flanges, rather than the rubber gaskets more common in low vacuum chamber seals. The system must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small vapour pressure, and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. As a result, many materials that work well in low vacuums, such as epoxy, will {{become a source of}} outgassing at higher vacuums.With these standard precautions, vacuums of 1 mPa are easily achieved with an assortment of <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps.</b> With careful design and operation, 1 µPa is possible.|$|E

40|$|Periodic {{driving is}} used to operate {{machines}} that go from standard macroscopic engines to small non-equilibrium micro-sized systems. Two classes of such systems are small heat engines driven by periodic temperature variations and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> driven by external stimuli. Well known results that are valid for nonequilibrium steady states of systems driven by fixed thermodynamic forces, instead of an external periodic driving, have been generalized to periodically driven heat engines only recently. These results include a general expression for entropy production in terms of currents and affinities and symmetry relations for the Onsager coefficients from linear response theory. For nonequilibrium steady states, the Onsager reciprocity relations {{can be obtained from}} the more general fluctuation theorem for the currents. We prove a fluctuation theorem for the currents for periodically driven systems. We show that this fluctuation theorem implies a fluctuation dissipation relation, symmetry relations for Onsager coefficients and further relations for nonlinear response coefficients. The setup in this paper is more general than previous studies, i. e., our results are valid for both heat engines and <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps.</b> The external protocol is assumed to be stochastic in our framework, which leads to a particularly convenient way to treat periodically driven systems.

40|$|The ASDEX upgrade {{vacuum vessel}} is {{equipped}} with 14 turbo <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> (TMPs) and a cryo pump (CP). The CP is cooled with boiling helium (He). To obtain similar conditions with the CP for hydrogen (H₂) and deuterium (D₂) pumping a lower helium panel temperature (T HP) is required {{in the case of}} H₂.

The requirements are predicted by computations and verified experimentally for this case. By raising the cryostat pressure above ambient, the prediction of the H₂ end pressure (p eH₂) of the CP could be compared with measurements in the range 5 × 10 ⁻⁷ eH₂ (mbar) < 5 × 10 ⁻⁴.

Until now much {{attention has been paid}} to minimizing hydrogen outgassing from the vacuum chamber wall materials, however, procedures and processing deserve further scrutiny. For reducing the gas load, high sensitivity helium leak detection techniques with sensitivities better than 1 × 10 - 12 Torr l/sec should be used. Effects that are induced by vacuum instrumentation need to be reduced in order to obtain accurate pressure measurements. This paper presents the current status of the CEBAF DC photogun.

In this paper, a comprehensive overview is given of different bearing topologies of RMBs with different stator poles that differ in their construction, the driving mode of electromagnets, power consumption, cost, magnetic circuits, and symmetry. RMBs with different poles and couplings between the two bearing axes in the radial direction responsible for cross-coupling generation are compared. In addition, different shaped rotors are compared, as the performances of magnetic bearing-rotor systems are of great concern to rotor constructions. Furthermore, the parameter design methods, the mathematical models and control strategies of the RMBs are described in detail. From the comparison of topologies, models and control methods for RMBs, the advantages, disadvantages and utilizable perspectives are also analyzed.

40|$|ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) transporters are membrane-bound <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> {{that form}} {{one of the}} largest of all protein families. Several of them are central to phenomena of biomedical interest, including cystic fibrosis and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. ABC transporters share a common architecture comprising two hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the substrate pathway across the membrane. The conformational changes in the NBDs induced by ATP hydrolysis and the means by which they are transmitted to the TMDs to effect substrate translocation remain largely unknown. We have performed a molecular dynamics simulation of HisP, the well studied NBD of the bacterial histidine permease, to identify hinges and switches of the NBD conformational transitions and subunit–subunit interfaces. This analysis reveals that the TMDs regulate ATP hydrolysis by controlling conformational transitions of the NBD helical domains, and identifies the conformational changes and the crucial TMD:NBD interface, by which the energy of ATP hydrolysis is transmitted to the TMDs. We also define the conformational transitions of the Q-loop, a key element of the NBD mechanism, and identify pathways by which Q-loop switching is coordinated with TMD and NBD conformational changes. We propose a model for the catalytic cycle of ABC transporters that shows how substrate-binding and transport by the TMDs may be coordinated and coupled with ATP binding and hydrolysis in the NBDs...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the design, construction and initial {{operation of the}} NSTX bakeout, water cooling and vacuum systems. The bakeout system is designed for two modes of operation. The first mode allows heating of the first wall components to 350 degrees C while the external vessel is cooled to 150 degrees C. The second mode cools the first wall to 150 degrees C and the external vessel to 50 degrees C. The system uses a low viscosity heat transfer oil which is capable of high temperature low pressure operation. The NSTX Torus Vacuum Pumping System (TVPS) is designed to achieve a base pressure of approximately 1 x 10 (superscript - 8) Torr and to evacuate the plasma fuel gas loads in less than 5 minutes between discharges.

40|$|ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) transporters {{constitute a}} large class of <b>molecular</b> <b>pumps</b> whose {{central role in}} chemotherapy resistance has highlighted their clinical relevance. We investigated whether the lipid composition of the membrane affects the function and structure of HorA, a bacterial ABC multidrug transporter. When the transporter was reconstituted in a bilayer where phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the main lipid of the bacterial membrane, was replaced with phosphatidylcholine (PC), ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport became uncoupled. Although ATPase activity was maintained, HorA lost its ability to extrude the prototypical substrate Hoechst 33342. Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) revealed that, although the secondary structure of the protein was unaffected, {{the orientation of the}} transmembrane helices (TM) was modified by the change in lipid composition. The orientation of the backbone carbonyls indicated that the helices opened wider in PE versus PC-containing liposomes, with 10 degrees difference. This was supported by hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies showing increased protection of the backbone from the solvent in PC-containing liposomes. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance was used to further probe the structural change. In the PC-containing liposomes we observed increased mobility of the spin label in TM 4, along with increased exposure to molecular oxygen, used as a hydrophobic quencher. This indicates that the lipid change induced modification of the orientation of TM 4, exposing Cys- 180 to the lipid phase. The lipid composition of the bilayer thus modulates the structure of HorA, and in turn its ability to extrude its substrates. Journal ArticleSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
