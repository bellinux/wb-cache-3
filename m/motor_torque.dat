25|$|When {{used with}} a load that has a torque curve that {{increases}} with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor {{is equal to the}} load torque. Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and <b>motor</b> <b>torque</b> are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.|$|E
500|$|Operation of {{the motors}} above rated {{nameplate}} speed (base speed) is possible, but {{is limited to}} conditions {{that do not require}} more power than the nameplate rating of the motor. This is sometimes called [...] "field weakening" [...] and, for ACmotors, means operating at less than rated V/Hz and above rated nameplate speed. Permanent magnet synchronous motors have quite limited field-weakening speed range due to the constant magnet flux linkage. Wound-rotor synchronous motors and induction motors have much wider speed range. For example, a 100HP, 460V, 60Hz, 1775RPM (4-pole) induction motor supplied with 460V, 75Hz (6.134V/Hz), would be limited to 60/75 = 80% torque at 125% speed (2218.75RPM) = 100% power. At higher speeds, the induction <b>motor</b> <b>torque</b> has to be limited further due to the lowering of the breakaway torque of the motor. Thus, rated power can be typically produced only up to 130-150% of the rated nameplate speed. Wound-rotor synchronous motors can be run at even higher speeds. In rolling mill drives, often 200-300% of the base speed is used. The mechanical strength of the rotor limits the maximum speed of the motor.|$|E

[...] Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30 percent of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to some [...] of drawbar pull for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. [...] In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as [...] "jerking a lung"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, [...] "jerking a lung" [...] could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of automatic train brakes installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.|$|E

Constant exciting current produces good linearity’s between torque and slip frequency. In current control, the primary current is the control input to the induction motor whereas the primary terminal voltage is the control input in voltage control. Two transient phenomena are associated with induction motor operation. One is the mechanical transient of the dynamic system driven by induction motor {{and the other is}} the electromagnetic transient within the induction motor. In the first, speed and position of the motor shaft are state variables whereas in latter voltage, current, magnetic field are the state variables. Even though the two systems are interconnected but they can be treated separately. In numerical analysis of electromagnetic transients, it is assumed that the related dynamic state variables are constant and the instantaneous value of the <b>motor</b> <b>torque</b> is found and is fed into the analysis of transients in the dynamic system.|$|E

For most robots, the only available data are the motor position and the <b>motor</b> <b>torques</b> which are calculated as the product of the known current reference signal by the joint drive gains. Then the accuracy of links parameters may be limited by noise and error modeling in the drive chains.
