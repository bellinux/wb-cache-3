Each canister was filled with approximately 2 kilograms of 49 wt percent lanthanide (Ln) loaded 25 SrABS glass during 5 inch Cylindrical Induction Melter (CIM 5) runs for TTR Tasks 3. 03 and 4. 03. Melter temperature, total <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> poured, and the glass pour rates were almost identical in both runs.

The schedule 10 canister was found to have a higher maximum surface temperature by about 50 [...] 100 C (depending on height) during the glass pour compared to the schedule 40 canister. The additional thermal mass of the schedule 40 canister accounts for this difference.

In the present study to investigate the specific pathogenic role of fiber number and dimensions, CL production from PMN exposed to anthophyllite asbestos mineral and glass fiber samples milled for different time periods was measured. Almost all the fibrous particles in the glass fiber sample were destroyed after milling for 30 minutes. With anthophyllite, the total number of fibrous particles remained almost constant for up to 240 minutes of milling, although the size of fibrous particles was reduced. CL produced by the same <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> fiber was elevated after milling for 15 minutes, but then declined when the milling time was further increased. Similarly, with anthophyllite, the production of CL was elevated at the first period of milling for 30 minutes, but then declined at the longer milling times. The level of CL produced was not correlated to the total number of fibrous particles, for both the glass fiber and the anthophyllite samples. Likewise for the glass fiber and anthophyllite samples, no specific range of fiber dimension was correlated to the peak hight CL production. These findings indicate that neither the total number, nor the specific range of fiber dimension solely determines CL production. As a consequence, it may be concluded that other physiochemical factors, such as the surface reactive characteristics of milled fibers, may be more closely related to CL production by PMN...|$|E

A linear relationship between the rate and the steady-state Si concentration (at Si concentrations less than 10 mg/L) was used to estimate the forward dissolution rate, which is the rate in the absence of dissolved Si. Participants were asked to sample the effluent solution at least five times after reaction times of between 3 and 14 days to measure the Si concentration and flow rate, and to verify that steady-state was achieved.

40|$|The {{production}} {{and application of}} coatings on glasses are used widely in technology. The coatings on glass are used for the regulation of optical, decorative, conducting and other technological and physical properties of glass. In particular, {{it is important to}} mention the application of glass fibres for the development of composite materials. However, the specific surface energy of glass and, consequently, its adhesion characteristics are relatively low. The values of these characteristics can be changed by the application of different metallic and nonmetallic coatings is characterised by high surface energy. To produce metallic coatings with the required adhesion strength of glass, it is necessary to have information on the specific surface energy of inorganic glass of different chemical composition. The determination of the relationships between the properties and composition of glass is one of the fundamental problems. At present, a large amount of investigations have been carried out into the investigations of the properties of glass in relation to its composition. However, the problem of establishment of relationships between the properties and composition of glass are especially difficult when examining multicomponent systems (technical glass). It is therefore, in to analyse in each case the properties of not the entire system has a whole but the variation of the properties with temperature of the individual components included in the system, the subsequent application of the additivity principle. The large majority of the glasses represent combinations of oxides of the elements of groups I-III and oxides of the transition metals, forming the mixtures, solid solutions of chemical compounds in the glass production process. Thus, analysis of the characteristics of oxides of the alkali, alkali-earth and transition metals makes it possible to obtain initial data for the evaluation of the surface energy, density, molecular <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> containing these oxides. At present, there is a large number of experimental data on the specific surface energy {{of a wide range of}} oxides glass at high temperatures.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of candidate materials {{used for the}} electrodes (Inconel 690 & 693) and the melt contact refractory (Monofrax K- 3) in a Joule Heated Melter (JHM) has been investigated at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) {{during the period from}} June 1, 2004 to August 31, 2005. This work was supported by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (DE-FG 02 - 04 ER 63831). The unusual properties and characteristics of iron phosphate glasses, as viewed from the standpoint of alternative glasses for vitrifying nuclear and hazardous wastes which contain components that make them poorly suited for vitrification in borosilicate glass, were recently discovered at UMR. The expanding national and international interest in iron phosphate glasses for waste vitrification stems from their rapid melting and chemical homogenization which results in higher furnace output, their high waste loading that varies from 32 wt% up to 75 wt% for the Hanford LAW and HLW, respectively, and the outstanding chemical durability of the iron phosphate wasteforms which meets all present DOE requirements (PCT and VHT). The higher waste loading in iron phosphate glasses, compared to the baseline borosilicate glass, can reduce the time and cost of vitrification considerably since a much smaller <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> will be produced, for example, about 43 % less glass when the LAW at Hanford is vitrified in an iron phosphate glass according to PNNL estimates. In view of the promising performance of iron phosphate glasses, information is needed for how to best melt these glasses on the scale needed for practical use. Melting iron phosphate glasses in a JHM is considered the preferred method at this time because its design could be nearly identical to the JHM now used to melt borosilicate glasses at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF), Westinghouse Savannah River Co. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} information for the corrosion of candidate electrode and refractory materials in iron phosphate melts in a JHM. During the period from June 1, 2004 to August 31, 2005, the {{corrosion resistance}} of coupons of Inconel 690 & 693 metals and Monofrax K- 3 refractory, partially submerged in several iron phosphate melts at 950 - 1200 &# 61616;C, has been investigated to determine whether iron phosphate glasses could be melted in a JHM equipped with such electrodes and refractory in the same manner as now being used to melt borosilicate glass. These representative iron phosphate melts, which contained 30 wt% Hanford LAW and 40 wt% Idaho SBW simulants, did not corrode the Inconel 690 to any greater extent than what has been reported for Inconel 690 in the borosilicate melt in the JHM at DWPF. Inconel 693 appeared to be an even better candidate for use in iron phosphate melts since its corrosion rate (1. 8 to 25. 4 ?m/day) was only about one half that (5. 4 to 45. 4 ?m/day) of Inconel 690. The dynamic corrosion measured for the candidate refractory, Monofrax K- 3, by iron phosphate melts is quite encouraging since the measured corrosion (0. 011 to 0. 132 mm/day at 9. 2 rpm) is less than the corrosion (0. 137 mm/day) that has been reported in the JHM used to melt borosilicate glass at DWPF.

40|$|This report {{provides}} data, analyses, {{and conclusions}} {{from a series}} of tests that were conducted at the Vitreous State Laboratory of The Catholic of America (VSL) to determine the processing rates that are achievable with AZ- 101 HLW simulants and corresponding melter feeds on a DuraMelter 100 (DM 100) vitrification system. One of the most critical pieces of information in determining the required size of the RPP-WTP HLW melter is the specific glass production rate in terms of the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> that can be produced per unit area of melt surface per unit time. The specific glass production rate together with the waste loading (essentially, the ratio of waste-in to glass-out, which is determined from glass formulation activities) determines the melt area that is needed to achieve a given waste processing rate with due allowance for system availability. Tests conducted during Part B 1 (VSL- 00 R 2590 - 2) on the DM 1000 vitrification system installed at the Vitreous State Laboratory of The Catholic University of America showed that, without the use of bubblers, glass production rates with AZ- 101 and C- 106 /AY- 102 simulants were significantly lower than the Project design basis rate of 0. 4 MT/m{sup 2 }/d. Conversely, three-fold increases over the design basis rate were demonstrated with the use of bubblers. Furthermore, an un-bubbled control test using a replica of the melter feed used in cold commissioning tests at West Valley reproduced the rates that were observed with that feed on the WVDP production melter. More recent tests conducted on the DM 1200 system, which more closely represents the present RPP-WTP design, are in general agreement with these earlier results. Screening tests conducted on the DM 10 system have provided good indications of the larger-scale processing rates with bubblers (for both HL W and LAW feeds) but significantly overestimated the DM 1000 un-bubbled rate observed for C- 106 /AY- 102 melter feeds. This behavior is believed to be a consequence of the role of heat transfer in rate attainment and the much greater role of wall effects in heat transfer when the melt pool is not agitated. The DM 100 melter used for the present tests has a surface area of 0. 108 m{sup 2 }, which is approximately 5 times larger than that of the DM 10 (0. 021 m{sup 2 }) and approximately 11 times smaller than that of the DM 1000 (1. 2 m{sup 2 }) (the DM 1000 has since been replaced by a pilot-scale prototypical HLW melter, designated the DM 1200, which has the same surface area as the DM 1000). Testing on smaller melters is the most economical method for obtaining data over a wide range of operating conditions (particularly at extremes) and for guiding the more expensive tests that are performed at pilot-scale. Thus, one objective of these tests was to determine whether the DM 100 melters are sufficiently large to reproduce the un-bubbled melt rates observed at the DM 1000 scale, or {{to determine the extent of}} any off-set. DM 100 -scale tests can then be used to screen feed chemistry variations that may serve to increase the un-bubbled production rates prior to confirmation at pilot scale. Finally, extensive characterization data obtained on simulated HLW melter feeds formed from various glass forming additives indicated that there may be advantages in terms of feed rheology and stability to the replacement of some of the hydroxides by carbonates. A further objective of the present tests was therefore to identify any deleterious processing effects of such a change before adopting the carbonate feed as the baseline. Data from the WVDP melter using acidified (nitrated) feeds, and without bubbling, showed productions rates that are higher than those observed with the alkaline RPP feeds at the VSL. Therefore, the effect of feed acidification on production rate also was investigated.

40|$|This report {{provides}} data, analysis, {{and conclusions}} {{from a series}} of tests that were conducted at the Vitreous State Laboratory of The Catholic University of America (VSL) to determine the melter processing rates that are achievable with RPP-WTP HLW simulants. The principal findings were presented earlier in a summary report (VSL- 00 R 2 S 90 -l) but the present report provides additional details. One of the most critical pieces of information in determining the required size of the RPP-WTP HLW melter is the specific glass production rate in terms of the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> that can be produced per unit area of melt surface per unit time. The specific glass production rate together with the waste loading (essentially, the ratio of waste-in to glass-out, which is determined from glass formulation activities) determines the melt area that is needed to achieve a given waste processing rate with due allowance for system availability. As a consequence of the limited amount of relevant information, there exists, for good reasons, a significant disparity between design-base specific glass production rates for the RPP-WTP LAW and HLW conceptual designs (1. 0 MT/m{sup 2 }/d and 0. 4 MT/m{sup 2 }/d, respectively); furthermore, small-scale melter tests with HLW simulants that were conducted during Part A indicated typical processing rates with bubbling of around 2. 0 MT/m{sup 2 }/d. This range translates into more than a factor of five variation in the resultant surface area of the HLW melter, which is clearly not without significant consequence. It is clear that an undersized melter is undesirable in that it {{will not be able to}} support the required waste processing rates. It is less obvious that there are potential disadvantages associated with an oversized melter, over and above the increased capital costs. A melt surface that is consistently underutilized will have poor cold cap coverage, which will result in increased volatilization from the melt (which is generally undesirable) and increased plenum temperatures due to increased thermal radiation from the melt surface (which mayor may not be desirable but the flexibility to choose may be lost). Increased volatilization is an issue both in terms of the increased challenge to the off-gas system as well as for the ability to effectively close the recycle loops for volatile species that must be immobilized in the glass product, most notably technetium and cesium. For these reasons, improved information is needed on the specific glass production rates of RPP-WTP HLW streams in DuraMelterJ systems over a range of operating conditions. Unlike the RPP-WTP LAW program, for which a pilot melter system to provide large-scale throughout information is already in operation, there is no comparable HLW activity; the results of the present study are therefore especially important. This information will reduce project risk by reducing the uncertainty associated with the amount of conservatism that mayor may not be associated with the baseline RPP-WTP HLW melter sizing decision. After the submission of the first Test Plan for this work, the RPP-WTP requested revisions to include tests to determine the processing rates that are achievable without bubbling, which was driven by the potential advantages of omitting bubblers from the HLW melter design in terms of reduced maintenance. A further objective of this effort became the determination of whether the basis of design processing rate could be achieved without bubbling. Ideally, processing rate tests would be conducted on a full-scale RPP-WTP melter system with actual HLW materials, but that is clearly unrealistic during Part B 1. As a practical compromise the processing rate determinations were made with HL W simulants on a DuraMelter J system at as close to full scale as possible and the DM 1000 system at VSL was selected for that purpose. That system has a melt surface area of 1. 2 m{sup 2 }, which corresponds to about one-third scale based on the specific glass processing rate of 0. 4 MT/m{sup 2 }/d assumed in the RPP-WTP HLW conceptual design, but would correspond to larger than full scale if the typical Part A test results of about 2. 0 MT/m{sup 2 }/d were realized. The DM 1000 system was used with the existing off-gas treatment system in order to expedite the collection of this information; while that system is somewhat different from the RPP-WTP conceptual design, that should have no effect on the processing rate measurements. Subsequent tasks supported the later modification of that off-gas system to obtain large-scale system performance information on the baseline off-gas design and those modifications are now complete. Work planned for Part B 2 includes similar pilot-scale testing with the prototypical off-gas system. Three HLW simulant compositions were used in the present tests: the tank AZ- 101 waste (the first B 2 HLW feed to the RPP-WTP), the 106 -C/AY- 102 blend (the largest B 2 HLW tank), and the HLW composition processed at West Valley...|$|E
40|$|Volatile {{materials}} {{dissolved in}} magmlas {{play an important}} role in the evolution of magmas and volcanic eruptions. During magma ascent, the magma may be saturated with the volatiles because of decrease in solubilities of the volatiles in silicate melts with pressure. Formation of a gas phase would lead to decrease in the bulk density of magma and thereby accelerate the magma ascent. Expansion of the resulting gas phase may induce a volcanic eruption. The major volatile components in a nlagma are H(2) 0, C 0 (2), S and Cl. Glass inclusions in phenocrysts are the most suitable samples for measuring volatile concentrations in pre-eruptive magmas. However, it has been difficult to measure the H(2) 0 and CO(2) concentrations in glass inclusions, mainly because the size of the glass inclusions is very small (50 - 200 μm) and the sensitivity of analytical methods is not　sufficient. In this study, we have developed a laser microprobe　technique for determining a minute amount of H(2) 0 and C 0 (2) dissolved in glass inclusions. The analytical system consisting of a Nd-YAG laser for selective heating of glass inclusions and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer for measuring a micro quantity of H(2) 0 and C 0 (2) dissolved in glass inclusions. The H(2) 0 and C 0 (2) were extracted from glass inclusions by laser heating under a vacuum. The extracted gas was collected in a cold trap and then introduced to GCMS by carrier gas. Gas concentration was calculated from the absolute amount of the extracted gas and the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> melted. The optimum working conditions (lamp current, pulse frequency and shooting duration) of laser extraction were decided using a basaltic glass sample. A glass sample ground to less than 100 μm thick was pierced by a laser beam and measured for diameter of the hole produced to obtain the accurate determination of the volume of the glass melted. The mass of the melted glass was calculated from its volume and density. Efforts were made for reduction of background level of C 0 (2) and H(2) 0. High purity helium carrier gas was farther purified with cold traps to remove C 0 (2) and H(2) 0 contained in the carrier gas. Analytical line was thoroughly baked out at 300 ℃ before the analyses. With these procedures, the blank C 0 (2) was reduced to less than 0. 07 ng and the blank H(2) 0 to less than 6 ng. The detection limit of the present system was found to be 0. 15 ng C 0 (2) and 15 ng H(2) 0, considering the confidence limit of the calibration. The repeated analyses of C 0 (2) in basaltic glass indicate that the present technique allows us to analyze C 0 (2) concentration of glass inclusions as small as 70 μm in diameter within an accuracy of ± 60 ppm, assuming that the glass inclusion contains 300 ppm C 0 (2). The H(2) 0 analyses of the glass by the present technique gave significantly lower H(2) 0 concentration than the bulk analysis, suggesting incomplete degassing of H(2) 0 from molten glass during laser irradiation due probably to its slow diffusion rate. The glass inclusion samples from Killauea volcano, Hawaii, and Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan, were analyzed to determine CO(2) concentrations of pre-eruptive magma. The C 0 (2) concentration of pre-eruptive magma in South-West Rift Zone of Kilauea volcano was 230 ppm. This suggests that the magma has been significantly degassed during its storage in the summit magma chamber and migration to the rift system. The depth of the magma chamber was estimated to be 2. 8 - 4. 0 km from the C 0 (2) concentration of the pre-eruptive magma, in good agreement with the geophysical estimation. Comparison of the volatile budget of Kilauea volcano based on the C 0 (2) analysis of glass inclusion with the observed C 0 (2) flux suggests that parental magma contains 3000 ppm C 0 (2). The bulk density of magma containing exsolved gases is not snlall enough to ascend to the surface by its own buoyancy. This is consistent with the present settings of the Kilauean magma; the sumrnit magma chamber and rift magma system extending from the summit caldera. The C 0 (2) concentration of pre-eruptive magma of Izu-Oshima volcano was found to be 1 70 ppm. The measured C 0 (2) concentration indicates that the magma chamber exists at a depth of about 2 km beneath the volcano. At this depth, the magma should be saturated with C 0 (2). The estimated bulk densities of the magma (d= 2. 4 - 2. 6 g/c㎥) containing C 0 (2) -rich gas phase are consistent with the density structure of the volcano, if the magma before degassing contains C 0 (2) more than 1700 ppm. The rate of magma supply was estimated from the C 0 (2) concentration of pre-eruptive magma and C 0 (2) fluxes based on measurements on surface volcanic gases. Assuming the primary magma contains 2500 ppm C 0 (2), the estimated rate of magma supply(6 - 19 x 10 (3) tons/day) is compatible with the observed rate of magma supply based on the total mass of ejecta of major eruptions during the last 1500 years...|$|E
