5|$|Buckles did {{not meet}} the {{criteria}} for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as he had never been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008.

He was Sorabji's closest friend for the last 16 years of Sorabji's life.|$|E

She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence and <b>met</b> <b>him</b> through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition {{class at the}} New School for Social Research: She was thus introduced to more of Cage's unconventional neo-Dadaism first hand and his New York City protégés Allan Kaprow, Brecht, Mac Low, Al Hansen and the poet Dick Higgins.|$|E
5|$|King Faysal, who {{recently}} returned to Iraq {{from a medical}} vacation, was very stressed during the crisis. His health deteriorated even more during the hot summer days in Baghdad. The British chargé d'affaires <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in his pajamas squatting in his bed on 15 August, where he denied that a massacre was committed in Simele. Faysal left Iraq again on 2 September 1933, seeking a cooler climate in London, where he died five days later.|$|E

5|$|When Mahmud died in 1030, the Ghaznavid dynasty {{fell into}} civil war; {{his two sons}} Mas'ud I and Muhammad Ghaznavi both claimed the Ghaznavid throne.

Maymandi first refused, but later agreed and began his second career as vizier in 1031.|$|E
5|$|AjTut {{was one of}} {{the lords}} of the {{northern}} Chak'an Itza province of the conquered Itza kingdom; friar Avendaño had <b>met</b> <b>him</b> during his expedition to Nojpetén. After the conquest he relocated from the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá to Mompana, a region lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic period ruins of Tikal.

5|$|Initially, Venkata Reddy had Akkineni Nageswara Rao in {{mind for}} the lead role. He later wanted to cast Raja Reddy in the lead role but {{replaced}} him with N. T. Rama Rao in the last minute, who made his debut by playing a minor character in Mana Desam (1949). Rama Rao was eventually signed {{as a part of}} his four-film contract with Vijaya Vauhini Studios after Venkata Reddy was impressed with Rama Rao when he <b>met</b> <b>him</b> on the sets of Samsaram (1950). With this film, Rama Rao became the first actor to have acted in two languages simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Magnus' final {{domestic}} dispute {{was with}} the noble Sveinke Steinarsson, who refused to recognise him as king. Although Sveinke reduced piracy in Viken, he was forced into exile for three years after negotiating with Magnus' men. Since piracy increased soon after Sveinke's departure (possibly encouraged by Sveinke himself), Magnus <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in the Danish province of Halland to request his return to Norway. They reconciled; Sveinke became a loyal supporter of Magnus, now the undisputed king of Norway.|$|E

Movies filmed in Sun Valley include I <b>Met</b> <b>Him</b> in Paris (1937), Sun Valley Serenade (1941), and Bus Stop (1956). Clint Eastwood's 1985 film Pale Rider was filmed in the SNRA, mostly in the Boulder Mountains in late 1984. The opening credits scene was shot south of Stanley {{in front of the}} Sawtooth Mountains.

5|$|On 10 March, Itza and Yalain emissaries {{arrived at}} Ch'ich' to {{negotiate}} with Ursúa. First came AjChan who had already <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Mérida; he was followed by Chamach Xulu, the ruler of the Yalain. Kan Ek' then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Ursúa received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors massed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{authorities}} apparently appreciated Vizzini, {{because he}} had opposed the Fascists and yielded substantial political power on the island. As far as Vizzini was concerned, he liked to boast about his excellent contacts with the Americans, and underlined {{their support for the}} separatist movement. Vizzini would become an important player {{in the midst of the}} separatist crisis later on. The Americans seem to have treated Vizzini as the Mafia’s overall boss. The OSS relied on the Mafia, and in particular on Vizzini, for its intelligence. His codename was ‘Bull Frog’ in secret communications. For a while, the chief of the OSS Palermo office, Joseph Russo, <b>met</b> <b>him</b> and other Mafia bosses ‘at least once a month’.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1972 season, Contreras {{was drafted}} from the Reds by the New York Mets. The <b>Mets</b> moved <b>him</b> {{steadily}} up the minor league ladder {{over the next}} three seasons, and Contreras reached Triple-A with the Tidewater Tides in 1975. That season, his first full season as a relief pitcher, he posted an impressive 1.95 ERA in 60 innings. Still, the <b>Mets</b> released <b>him</b> during spring training in 1976.|$|R

5|$|The {{course of}} the {{conflict}} took a radical turn when the central government charged Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then Count and later Duke of Caxias) with {{putting an end to}} the rebellion in late 1842. Marques de Sousa probably <b>met</b> <b>him</b> during Caxias' short trip to Rio Grande do Sul in 1839 as part of the Minister of War's entourage. They subsequently maintained a friendly correspondence. Marques de Sousa was removed from his position over the 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry and instead was given command of the 7th Brigade, which formed part of the 1st Division. The brigade consisted of his former 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry and a National Guard cavalry corps.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} contemporary, or near-contemporary, {{sources of information}} about the reign of Richard III. These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and {{because of the fact that}} none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard, even if they had <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in person.|$|E
5|$|Under pretence of {{siding with}} Vespasian, Civilis of Batavia {{had taken up}} arms and induced the {{inhabitants}} of his native country to rebel. The rebelling Batavians were immediately joined by several neighbouring German tribes including the Frisii. These forces drove out the Roman garrisons near the Rhine and defeated a Roman army at the Battle of Castra Vetera, after which many Roman troops along the Rhine and in Gaul defected to the Batavian cause. However, disputes soon broke out amongst the different tribes, rendering co-operation impossible; Vespasian, having successfully ended the civil war, called upon Civilis to lay down his arms, and on his refusal his legions <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in force, defeating him in the Battle of Augusta Treverorum.|$|E
