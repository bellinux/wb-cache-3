5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them all of the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> they were owed {{from the sale of}} their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|McCain won {{a highly}} contested primary {{election}} {{with the assistance}} of local political endorsements, his Washington connections, and <b>money</b> <b>that</b> his wife lent to his campaign. He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district.|$|E
5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for <b>money</b> <b>that</b> {{will be used to}} pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds used by a government to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment. The debts of permanent and proprietary funds are serviced within those funds, rather than by a separate debt service fund.|$|E

5|$|ETNC's {{early success}} also {{attracted}} the attention of other communities in North Texas, and in 1904 Denison attempted to entice Mayo to relocate the college there for a considerable amount of financial aid. Whether or not Mayo seriously considered the offer is unknown, but he was able to use it as leverage to persuade Commerce to give the college $30,000 {{over the next three years}} for the promise that it would remain, <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was mostly used to renovate and expand ETNC's physical plant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Money</b> <b>that</b> {{had been}} raised during the 1920s and {{financial}} backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped the school to survive through the Great Depression. During World War II, the university made important contributions to the Manhattan Project. The university {{was the site of}} the first isolation of plutonium and of the creation of the first artificial, self-sustained nuclear reaction by Enrico Fermi in 1942.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November 1204, King Emeric died, and Ladislaus succeeded him. Pope Innocent III sent {{a letter}} to Duke Andrew, warning him to respect the child king's interests. However, refusing to heed Innocent's warning, Andrew seized the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> Emeric had {{deposited}} in the Pilis Abbey for Ladislaus. Considering her son's position to be insecure, Constance fled to Austria, taking Ladislaus with her.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E
5|$|Sylvester was {{considered}} to be a prima donna by members of the Hot Band and could be temperamental and difficult with those whom he worked with. He found it difficult saving the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> he earned, instead spending it as soon as he obtained it, both on himself and on his lovers, friends, and family.|$|E
5|$|The Irons {{permanently}} adopted claret {{and blue}} for home colours {{in the summer}} of 1899. Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered <b>money</b> <b>that</b> one of them would win.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} was fiercely contested, {{and both sides}} incurred great expenses during the campaign. There was not another contested election in Taunton for almost twenty years, {{and during that time}} the Taunton Market House Society was set up with the aim of preventing the bad blood of a contested election, and to spend <b>money</b> <b>that</b> would have otherwise been spent on campaigning on improving the town. Maxwell remained as one of Taunton's members of parliament until 1768.|$|E
5|$|Tracing in English {{law is a}} {{procedure}} to identify property (such as <b>money)</b> <b>that</b> has been taken from the claimant involuntarily. It is not in itself a way to recover the property, but rather to identify {{it so that the}} courts can decide what remedy to apply. The procedure is used in several situations, broadly demarcated by whether the property has been transferred because of theft, breach of trust, or mistake.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new <b>money</b> <b>that</b> is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E

5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted in his diary on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the <b>money</b> <b>that</b> had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} in February 2007 {{placed the}} initial construction cost of One World Trade Center at about $3 billion, or $1,150 {{per square foot}} ($12,380 per square meter). However, the tower's total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by April 2012, making it the most expensive building {{in the world at}} the time. The tower's construction was partly funded by approximately $1billion of insurance <b>money</b> <b>that</b> Silverstein received for his losses in the September 11 attacks. The State of New York provided an additional $250million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds. The Port Authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds, with a 56percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015; however, the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower's construction.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} {{managers}} of pop groups {{knew about the}} income music merchandising could generate, as very few artists survived long enough in the pop domain {{to be a viable}} investment. As far as Epstein was concerned it was merely good public relations, and any revenue that arose from the sale of Beatles-endorsed products was regarded as merely extra <b>money</b> <b>that</b> supplemented the Beatles' individual incomes from live performances and record sales. Epstein had not recognised an industry which had grossed $20 million for Elvis Presley in 1957 alone.|$|E

5000|$|The Myth of Male Power was ardently {{challenged}} by some academic feminists, whose critique {{is that men}} earn more <b>money,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>money</b> is power. Farrell concurs that men earn more <b>money,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>money</b> is one form of power. However, Farrell also adds that [...] "men often feel obligated to earn money someone else spends while they die sooner--and feeling obligated is not power." [...] This perspective was to be more fully developed in Farrell's Why Men Earn More.|$|R

5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of <b>money.</b> <b>That,</b> of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{attended}} the University of Florida, majoring in accounting and meeting {{most of the}} costs himself using <b>money</b> <b>that</b> he had saved while working through high school. He joined Phi Eta Sigma, an honor society and professional fraternity, and Alpha Tau Omega, a social fraternity. In 1941, his brother Bruce also enrolled at Florida, straining the family's expenses; John dropped out after his second year so that his brother could complete his degree. Bolt enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in April 1941 to train as a pilot, but deferred his training when the Marine Corps offered him the chance to finish college and attend law school, paying him 500 a year to do so.|$|E
5|$|Captain Francis Laforey on Carysfort {{immediately}} {{attacked the}} larger ship {{and in an}} engagement lasting an hour and fifteen minutes successfully forced its captain to surrender, discovering a number of British prisoners of war below decks. Castor was subsequently taken back to Britain and an extended legal case ensued between the Admiralty and Captain Laforey over the amount of prize <b>money</b> <b>that</b> should be awarded for the victory. Ultimately Laforey was successful, {{in part due to}} testimony from the defeated French captain, proving his case and claiming the prize money. The lawsuit did not harm Laforey's career and he later served at the Battle of Trafalgar and became a prominent admiral.|$|E
