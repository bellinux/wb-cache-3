Bungie hired an expert in <b>motion</b> <b>capture</b> to develop more realistic character animations. Building a <b>motion</b> <b>capture</b> studio in-house saved Bungie time as <b>motion</b> <b>capture</b> data {{could be applied to}} the game models the same day it was shot. The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more open world or sandbox approach to battles.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 5 runs on version 1.4 of Capcom's MT Framework {{engine and}} scenes were {{recorded}} by <b>motion</b> <b>capture.</b> It {{was the first}} video game to use a virtual camera system, which allowed the developers to see character movements in real time as the motion-capture actors recorded. Actors Reuben Langdon, Karen Dyer and Ken Lally portrayed Chris Redfield, Sheva Alomar and Albert Wesker respectively. Dyer also voiced Alomar, while Redfield's voice was performed by Roger Craig Smith. Dyer's background training in circus skills helped her win the role of Alomar, as Capcom were searching for someone who could handle the physical skills her <b>motion</b> <b>capture</b> required. She performed her own stunts, and worked in production on the game for over a year, sometimes working 14 hours a day.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. In {{the context}} of {{intervertebral}} disc replacement and customized implants, human simulation studies are of great importance. Simulation models need input data. This study investigated different in vivo <b>motion</b> <b>capturing</b> methods to capture spinal kinematics that will serve as input for simulation models. Available scanning and <b>motion</b> <b>capturing</b> techniques for capturing cervical kinematics range from simple clinical methods, to expensive specialized equipment and software. With a variety of technologies comes a variety of applications. In this study {{the focus is on}} capturing the kinematics of the cervical spine. An important distinction was made between two types of <b>motion</b> <b>capturing</b> technologies: external <b>motion</b> <b>capturing</b> and internal imaging technologies. The available external <b>motion</b> <b>capturing</b> technologies pose many advantages in terms of cost, safety, simplicity, portability and producing accurate three dimensional position and orientation. However, the ability for external <b>motion</b> <b>capturing</b> technologies to give accurate information on the movements at each vertebral level is doubted by critics reasoning that the true vertebral motion is concealed by the skin and soft tissue. Although it would be ideal to use external <b>motion</b> <b>capturing</b> systems, one needs to be confident that these surface markers or sensors truly reflect the vertebral motion at each vertebral level. An empirical study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between <b>motion</b> <b>captured</b> on the skin surface and motion of the vertebrae. Twenty-one subjects received low dosage X-rays, while radio opaque markers were attached to the skin at each respective vertebral level. The motion of external markers and that of the vertebrae could be seen simultaneously on one medium. In the empirical study, two outputs were achieved. Firstly, intervertebral kinematic data, for use in further simulation studies was obtained. Secondly, the relationship between surface markers and vertebrae in different motion instances was investigated. Distance and angle parameters were constructed for vertebral prediction from skin surface markers. The causes of variation in these parameters were identified by investigating the correlations of these parameters with anthropometrical variables. Strong correlations of the parameters were observed in flexion, but in extension, especially full extension, the correlations were poor to insignificant. It was concluded that in neutral, half flexion and full flexion it is possible to predict the vertebral position from surface markers by using the parameters and anthropometrical variables. In half extension this prediction would be less accurate and in full extension alternative methods should be investigated for external <b>motion</b> <b>capturing...</b>|$|R

5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not bode well with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the <b>motion</b> <b>capture</b> performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the <b>motion</b> <b>capture</b> role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Kitase knew {{he wanted}} a {{thematic}} combination of fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed to include a cast of characters {{who appeared to be}} ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters—a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of <b>motion</b> <b>capture</b> technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in VII. <b>Motion</b> <b>capture</b> was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on <b>motion</b> <b>capture.</b> A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of VII, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.|$|E
5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for <b>motion</b> <b>capture,</b> and acted as if performing in a movie. <b>Motion</b> <b>capture</b> was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its ability to be shortened to Nate, and the perception that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E
