This approach is in line with Ein-steins concept of a physical space, with the difference that space is no longer seen as an all-encompassing entity. Besides reconciling the well-known non-expansion of astrophysical gravitationally-bound systems, with recent observational data obtained by NASA from the outer parts of the Solar system showing an expansion of our own galaxy, the model physically explains why the universe is seen as flat, and accommodates other astrophysical data on supernovae at redshift ranges going be-yond half the age of our galaxy that shows a deviation from Hubbles Law.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments on dynamical characterization of silicon nitride cantilevers. These devices {{play an important role}} in micro-and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). They consist of a mechanical part, a sensor or actuator, and an electronic part for readout and control. The core of NEMS and MEMS, the so called mechanical part, exists in various shapes. Examples include disk resonators, doubly clamped beams, tuning forks and cantilevers. These mechanical sensors are good candidates for applications in e. g the medical world, and telecommunication. Examples of applications include micro-array biosensors and ultrasensitive mass sensors. On a fundamental level they can be utilized to explore phenomena like the Casimir force and quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>zero</b> point motion. Mechanical resonators are fabricated through a top-down technique, making use of the bulk material and special micro-machining techniques. Experiments in this thesis are performed on cantilevers, which differ from each other in the clamping point due the release method, and in the accuracy in the pattern definition step. A short description of MEMS, NEMS and the fabrication is described in chapters 1 and 2. The cantilevers are dynamically characterized by measuring their eigenmodes, each with a specific resonance frequency and quality factor. From this information the effective Young's and shear modulus, and the dissipation mechanisms can be determined. The resonance frequency can be measured using an interferometric, capacitive or laser deflection technique. The latter is the most common technique and is used in atomic force microscopes (AFM). We have optimized this technique so that the cantilever deflection due to its thermal mechanical noise is probed. The output signal, the voltage difference generated by the reflected light focused on a two-segment diode, is measured using a spectrum analyser. The Fourier-transformed signal manifests itself as a Lorentzian peak, which contains the necessary information for the characterization. Amplitudes of the order of picometers can be detected with our setup. Details of the measurement technique are described in chapter 3. Chapter 4 describes the resonance frequency behavior as a function of cantilever dimensions. Two vibrational modes are distinguished; flexural and torsional modes, which are independently measured. Also higher order modes for each type of vibration are detected. Depending on the strength of the spring constant seven or more flexural modes and up to three torsional modes are observed. Furthermore we have investigated the dependence of the resonance frequency for different fabrication methods. For cantilevers with no undercut adding an additional length to the nominal length makes the resonance frequency behavior predictable by existing models. For resonance frequency behavior of cantilevers fabricated with no undercut such a correction is not necessary. Finite element simulations support the observations. The resonance frequency of the torsional modes as a function of dimensions is not properly described by commonly used models. It predicts lower frequencies. A different model describing torsional vibrations of airplane-wings, fits to our experimental data. Chapter 5 describes experiments on the behavior of the resonance frequency and quality-factor as a function of gas pressure. The experiments are performed in helium, argon, air and xenon environments. Three pressure regimes are distinguished in the pressure range between 10 ^{- 5 } mbar and atmospheric. Depending on the Knudsen number these regimes are known as 'intrinsic', 'molecular' and 'viscous'. Our experimental findings are well fitted by existing theories, for both the first and higher flexural modes. An unexpected slight increase in the resonance frequency in the viscous regime is observed, which is not predicted by the existing models. The increase is due to a slight stiffening of the cantilevers and might be caused by gas adsorption in the near surface. Measurements with higher laser power show a further increase in the anomalous resonance frequency shift. Its origin is not clear since a higher laser power is expected to further heat up the cantilever, and consequently decrease its resonance frequency. Chapter 6 discusses the behavior of Young's modulus as a function of decreasing thickness in the range of 20 to 680 nm. A significant decrease in the Young's modulus is observed for thicknesses below 150 nm, both in the first and second flexural modes. This decrease cannot be explained by neither a double layer and a sandwich model, in which case the extra layer(s) are considered to have a different Young's modulus. With a model including also a surface-elasticity term the experimental data can be understood. An infinitesimal thin layer with a certain surface elasticity, which is determined from a fit through the data, influences the Young's modulus. For thinner cantilevers this influence is even larger because at higher surface-to-volume ratios, surface-processes dominate the bulk properties. Finally chapter 7 describes measurements on the important application of cantilevers as ultrasensitive mass sensors. A cantilever can be considered as a harmonic oscillator so that the resonance frequency can be determined from its spring constant and the effective mass. By measuring the resonance frequency before and after mass loading, the amount of the added mass can be calculated, assuming the spring constant does not change. The first measurements are performed on cantilevers, with a homogeneously evaporated gold coating of 40 nm on top. A measured mass of 390 pg is calculated through resonance frequency shifts from both the first and the second mode. Mass of the gold layer calculated from the volume and mass density is 3 times higher. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the total Young's modulus due to the bilayer system is lower than that of bare silicon nitride. A lower effective Young's modulus decreases the resonance frequency and explains partially the mass difference. In a second measurement we performed mass sensing with smaller amounts of mass. For this purpose aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) is selectively coated as a monolayer. These so-called functionalized cantilevers are good candidates for selective mass sensing purposes. As an example, an array of cantilevers, each functionalized with a different coating on a single chip, can be used to simultaneously detect different targets such as DNA, viruses and bacteria. Experimental results on the first three flexural modes and first torsional mode show the same amount of added mass of approximately 10 pg. In contrast to this value, the calculated mass of a monolayer coverage of APTES gives 5 pg. A possible explanation for this difference might be a variation in the spring constant, which was assumed to be constan...|$|E

40|$|A {{transducer}} {{consisting of}} {{multiple layers of}} ionic polymer material is developed for applications in sensing, actuation and control. A multilayer transducer is fabricated by layering individual transducers {{on top of one}} another. Each multilayer transducer consists of two to four individual layers each approximately 200 µm thick. The electrical characteristics of the transducers can be varied by connecting the layers in either a parallel arrangement or a series arrangement. The tradeoff in deflection and force is obtained by controlling the mechanical constraint at the interface. Packaging the transducer in an outer coating produces a hard constraint between layers and reduces the deflection with a force that increases linearly with the number of layers. This configuration also increases the bandwidth of the transducer. Removing the outer packaging produces an actuator that maintains the deflection of a single layer with an increased force output. This is obtained by allowing the layers to slide relative to one another during bending. Experiments on transducers with one to three layers are performed and the results are compared to an equivalent circuit model which was modified to accommodate multilayer transducers. The modification is performed on four different boundary conditions: two electrical, the series and the parallel connection, and two <b>mechanical,</b> the <b>zero</b> interfacial friction and the zero slip on the interface. Expressions for blocked force, free deflection, and electrical impedance of the transducer are developed in terms of fundamental material parameters, transducer geometry, and the number of individual layers.

The usual class of PI in 3 dimensions (i. e. the self adjoint extensions of the Laplacian on the domain of smooth functions compactly supported away from the origin) is reconstructed. In addition a 1 -parameter family of GPI models termed resonance point interactions (RPI) is constructed, labelled by M. The case M 0 appears to be new. In both cases, the Hilbert space of states must be extended, for M 0, the Hilbert space is extended to a Pontryagin space. In the latter case, the space of physical states is identified as a positive definite invariant subspace.

For the interpretation of these experimental observations the axial symmetry breaking shows up in nearly all heavy nuclei as predicted by Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations [1]; this indicates a nuclear Jahn-Teller effect.

Compressing the packing very slowly, while maintaining a mechanical excitation, yields a granular glass, namely a frozen structure of vibrating grains. In this glass phase, we observe a remarkable dynamics of the contact network, which exhibits strong dynamical heterogeneities. Such heterogeneities are maximum at a packing fraction ϕ^*, distinct and smaller than the jamming packing fraction ϕ_J, which is indicated by the abrupt variation of the average number of contact per particle.

Following our joint work with Ramachandran, we then show how the noncommutative spaces associated to commensurability classes of Q-lattices up to scale have a natural geometric interpretation as noncommutative versions of the Shimura varieties Sh(GL_ 1,{± 1 }) in the Bost-Connes case and Sh(GL_ 2, H^±) {{in the case of}} the GL_ 2 system. We also show how this leads naturally to the construction of a system generalizing the Bost-Connes system that fully recovers the explicit class field theory of imaginary quadratic fields...|$|R
40|$|Computational procedures, {{based on}} (i) the Ramsey common origin {{approach}} and (ii) the continuous {{transformation of the}} origin of the quantum <b>mechanical</b> current density-diamagnetic <b>zero</b> (CTOCD-DZ), were applied at the Hartree-Fock level to determine electric quadrupole polarizabilities of nuclear magnetic shielding for molecules {{in the presence of a}} nonuniform electric field with a uniform gradient. The quadrupole polarizabilities depend on the origin of the coordinate system, but values of the magnetic field induced at a reference nucleus, determined via the CTOCD-DZ approach, are origin independent for any calculations relying on the algebraic approximation, irrespective of size and quality of the (gaugeless) basis set employed. On the other hand, theoretical estimates of the induced magnetic field obtained by single-origin methods are translationally invariant only in the limit of complete basis sets. Calculations of electric quadrupole polarizabilities of nuclear magnetic shielding are reported for H 2, HF, H 2 O, N H 3, and C H 4 molecules. © 2008 American Institute of Physics. Fil:Ferraro, M.
