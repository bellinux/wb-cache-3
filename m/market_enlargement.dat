40|$|This article {{studies the}} link between the Eastern {{enlargement}} of the European Union and issues of audiovisual policy and audiovisual markets. The main link between audiovisual policy and EU enlargement is through alignment with the Community acquis, in particular the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Legislative alignment has been achieved in all Central and Eastern European countries by adopting new media laws. This process can be described one of (neutrally defined) Europeanization. EU enlargement offers opportunities for Central and Eastern European audiovisual industries such as increased investments and funding, cooperation partners, and enhanced export possibilities, but also bears the threat of Europeanization as a process of cultural diffusion or cultural dominance. Both Eastern and Western Europe, however, are culturally and linguistically fragmented.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} deregulation and market integration policies {{on the structure of}} European banking markets. The paper argues that whether European integration will lead to an increased exploitation of scale advantages, or not, will depend {{on the extent to which}} competition in banking is based on fixed or variable costs. If competition focuses on variable costs, concentration will diminish with <b>market</b> <b>enlargement</b> when we control for the pro-concentration effect triggered by the deregulation process. Alternatively, when competition focuses on expenses unrelated to the level of intermediation, concentration will not tend to decline as the size of the market grows. This is due to the compensating effect of increased competition in fixed costs such as brand image or electronic banking. I propose a simple test using aggregate data to provide an empirical assessment of the dominant form of competition. The application of this procedure to data for eleven EU countries during the period from 1981 to 1995 yields parameter estimates which indicate that over the period of analysis, competition in Europe tends to be predominantly based on variable costs...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{consider}} a duopoly two-stage game model where firms first decide simultaneously whether to invest in advertising or not andthencompeteinprices. Twomaineffects of advertising will be examined, the <b>market</b> <b>enlargement</b> and the predatory interaction among firms. The former captures {{the expansion of the}} market that an advertised product is likely to experience; moreover, it also accounts for positive externalities accruing to rivals. The latter takes into account the interaction between firms in terms of gains and losses when they finance advertising. In particular, this second effect captures the own benefit thatafirm reaches at the expenses of the other if it devotes resources to advertising. Two main results will arise. First, in the analysis of the price equilibrium for the asymmetric case, we discover an interval of parameters characterized by endogenous exit. In this case the presence of a firm investing in advertising creates the conditions for the exit of the rival. Second, when we look at SPE of the game, we able to characterize the entire parameter space. Depending on the relative strenght of the two effects, different resultscomeout. Amongtheothers,wefind an asymmetric solution with only one firm investing in advertising. Hence, the price equilibrium with endogenous exit {{turns out to be a}} SPE of the extended game. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether and}} under what {{conditions}} the working of cooperative firms can be affected by competition law or market-enhancing regulations. The nature of collective benefits sought by different types of cooperative enterprises is analysed to show whether and how a tension may arise between the market mechanism and the mechanisms through which alternative collective benefits are attained by cooperative firms. On the whole, market-enhancing regulations have an ambiguous impact both on the working of cooperatives and on social efficiency. While benefitting society, a market enhancement reduces the scope for cooperative firms aiming at reducing the deadweight loss in imperfectly competitive markets. A similar conclusion holds if the cooperative firm aims at protecting an investment decision from a hold-up problem, provided that the market enhancement enlarges the set of outside options for the firm’s stakeholders. A <b>market</b> <b>enlargement</b> has a positive impact both on the working of cooperatives and on social efficiency when {{the aim of the}} cooperative firm is to prevent shirking in team production. In contrast, a negative impact ensues, with adverse consequences both for social efficiency and the cooperative firm, when the collective benefit sought by the latter is to overcome asymmetric information, as typically happens in the case of credit cooperatives...|$|E

40|$|Price {{transmission}} is a critically important issue that affects <b>market</b> <b>enlargement</b> and {{the unification of}} Canadian-U. S. agriculture. This study adopts alternative frameworks to examine the nature of cross-border integration in selected meat and livestock markets. The aim {{is to determine the}} extent to which selected meat and livestock markets transmit price signals across the international border using time-series data through 2001. Typically, price-based studies examining market integration across countries ignore important spatial and temporal factors affecting commodity price relationships such as adjustments lags, changes in the value of national currencies, and policy-induced trade barriers. Here, we account for such factors in our two model specifications. The first model is based upon the law-of-one price (LOP) framework and focuses on spatial efficiency. The second analytical framework is the vector autoregressive (VAR) model that highlights the dynamic notion of market connectedness. The LOP analysis permits us to formally test the existence of perfect market integration and complete market segmentation. The VAR analysis enables us to gauge price-shock transference. Empirical evidence is generated confirming that the two national markets for whole chicken are segmented, a not unsurprising finding given that poultry is a supply managed sector in Canada. The Canadian-U. S. hog- and pork-product markets were found to be more integrated than the Canadian-U. S. steer- and beef-product markets. Evidence is also provided showing that the Canadian-U. S. exchange rate inhibits cross-border integration in these commodity markets. " Copyright 2006 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society. ...|$|E

The starting point will be the identification of maritime societies. Who are those members and how each one of them acted adding new outlooks in the subject? As we all recognize the 14 th century has been a period of intense international bonds involving the major European costal zones: a period of development of enlarged maritime networks alongside with <b>market</b> <b>enlargement</b> and vital economic connections. Here we can find the origins of an enlarged maritime heritage which will be patent in times ahead, namely in the 16 th century Europe. In that way, we must try to define "maritime cultures" and articulated economic centres: from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, merchants and sailors find out how people deal with common problems in different areas: how to build a ship set to sail in a particular surrounding; how the seaports were planned and arranged; the rules and ways of commerce; the mentalities that were displayed by the men who lived from what the Sea provided. These are some of the basics of interaction and maritime cultural diffusion in this extended area.

The EU and EMU create important effects on internal and external trade possibilities, increased competition and increased competitiveness. The accession countries are preparing to enter this process. Globalisation encourages a world-wide search for improved competitiveness at the level of trade blocks, nations and regions. The completion of the internal <b>market,</b> <b>enlargement</b> and the launch of one currency in Europe are revolutionary changes. Therefore, the impact will probably be much more substantial than could have been estimated before this ‘change of regime’. Scholars and policy-makers, the business world and trade unions, civil society and consumer organisations, they all are worried about the impact on economic activities, growth, employment and social protection. What are the new trade patterns and what are the new comparative (or competitive?) advantages; what will the implications be for industrial change and industrial policy; what will be the role of the states and the regions in globalised competition (trade?) between trade blocs; what will be the possibilities for fiscal policies; what are the risks of social dumping or will there be persistent and continued growth in social protection? How do social security and the fight against poverty develop in competition for attention and in competition with market forces? This two day colloquium brought together scholars and practitioners of economic and social policy in order to obtain a balanced view and to exchange opinions.
