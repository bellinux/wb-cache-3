40|$|Male {{reproductive}} biology can by characterized through competition over mates {{as well as}} mate choice. Multiple mating {{and male}} mate choice copying, especially in internally fertilizing species, {{set the stage for}} increased sperm competition, i. e., sperm of two or more males can compete for fertilization of the female’s ova. In the internally fertilizing fish Poecilia mexicana, males respond to the presence of rivals with reduced expression of mating preferences (audience effect), thereby lowering the risk of by-standing rivals copying their mate choice. Also, males interact initially more with a non-preferred female when observed by a rival, which has been interpreted in previous studies as a strategy to mislead rivals, again reducing sperm competition risk (SCR). Nevertheless, species might differ consistently in their expression of aggressive and reproductive behaviors, possibly due to varying levels of SCR. In the current study, we present a unique data set comprising ten poeciliid species (in two cases including multiple populations) and ask whether species can be characterized through consistent differences in the expression of aggression, sexual activity and changes in mate choice under increased SCR. We found consistent species-specific differences in aggressive behavior, sexual activity {{as well as in the}} level of <b>misleading</b> <b>behavior,</b> while decreased preference expression under increased SCR was a general feature of all but one species examined.

One hypothesis is that privilege-seeking, that is, managing one's managers (also called rentseeking, management relations, or organizational politics), can be used by a worker to misrepresent his actual contribution. These activities lead to a reduction in productivity and consequently to a loss of profits. Management may decrease the firm's losses by engaging in costly monitoring activities. It is paradoxical that a behavior with such negative consequences is tolerated. A model is developed to show that an organization should be composed of employees with different levels of productivity; moreover, it may be optimal for the organization to have some employees who are good at privilege-seeking activities, forcing the remaining workers to invest in productive activities.

40|$|Several syntactic-based {{automatic}} worm signature generators, e. g., Polygraph, {{have recently}} been proposed. These systems typically assume that a set of suspicious flows are provided by a flow classifier, e. g., a honeynet or an intrusion detection system, that often introduces “noise ” due to difficulties and imprecision in flow classification. The algorithms for extracting the worm signatures from the flow data are designed {{to cope with the}} noise. It has been reported that these systems can handle a fairly high noise level, e. g., 80 % for Polygraph. In this paper, we show that if noise is introduced deliberately to mislead a worm signature generator, a much lower noise level, e. g., 50 % or below, can already prevent the system from reliably generating useful worm signatures. Using Polygraph as a case study, we describe a new and general class of attacks whereby a worm can combine polymorphism and <b>misleading</b> <b>behavior</b> to intentionally pollute the dataset of suspicious flows during its propagation and successfully mislead the automatic signature generation process.

In the present study, lung patients feel social and professional pressure concerning smoking and experience questions about smoking behavior as sensitive and tend to conceal embarrassing or threatening information. The randomized item-response survey method is expected to improve the accuracy of self-reports as individual item responses are masked and only randomized item responses are observed. We explored the validation of the randomized item-response technique in a unique experimental study. Therefore, we administered a new multi-item measure assessing smoking behavior by using a treatment–control design (randomized response (RR) or direct questioning). After the questionnaire, we administered a breath test by using a carbon monoxide (CO) monitor to determine the smoking status of the patient. We used the response data to measure the individual smoking behavior by using a mixture item-response model. It is shown that the detected smokers scored significantly higher in the RR condition compared with the directly questioned condition. We proposed a Bayesian latent variable framework to evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy of the questionnaire using the randomized-response technique, {{which is based on}} the posterior densities of the subject's smoking behavior scores together with the breath test measurements.

40|$|Seed {{germination}} and seedling {{growth are}} equally important processes for population survival. Observation of germinating orchid seeds {{in a natural}} substrate is inhibited by their minute size. There are basically two approaches to studying germination in situ: Search for spontaneous seedlings, and field sowing experiments; these may be supplemented with experiments in vitro. Finds of spontaneous seedlings are clearly irregular and fortuitous but may yield valuable, if fragmentary, input to hypothesis building. An understanding of the habitat dynamics may be helpful in the search of such seedlings. The seed package technique for germination in situ and its various adaptations can yield considerable information concerning spatial distribution and timing, identity of participating fungi, seedling growth rate and stimulatory environmental conditions. This approach constitutes the backbone to studies of germination ecology and still holds much unexplored potential. However, conditions that are suitable for orchid seed germination in nature are not necessarily identical to those supporting adult plant growth.

40|$|Abstract—Secondary {{spectrum}} {{data falsification}} (SSDF) {{is a common}} attack in cognitive radio networks, where dishonest nodes share spurious local sensing data. This <b>behavior</b> <b>misleads</b> the collective inference on spectrum occupancy. The situation is more aggravated when a collaborative SSDF attack is launched {{by a coalition of}} selfish nodes. Defense against such collaborative attacks is difficult with popularly used voting based inference models. This paper proposes a method based on Bayesian inference that indicates how much the collective decision on a channel’s oc-cupancy can be trusted. Using an anomaly monitoring technique, we check if the reports sent by a node match with the expected occupancy and classify the outcomes into three categories: i) if there is a match, ii) if there is a mismatch, and iii) if it cannot be decided. Based on the measured observations over time, we estimate the parameters of the hypothesis of match and mismatch events using a multinomial Bayesian based inference. We quantitatively define the trust as the difference between the posterior beliefs associated with matches and that of mismatches. The posterior beliefs are updated based on a weighted average of the prior information on the belief itself and the recently observed data. We conduct simulation experiments that show that the proposed trust model is able to distinguish the attacked channels from the non-attacked ones. Also, a node is able to rank the channels based on how trustworthy the inference on a channel is. We are also able to show that attacked channels have significantly lower trust values than channels that are not. I...|$|R

40|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} objective of any damage identification algorithms is to ascertain with confidence if damage is present or not. Many methods have been proposed for damage detection based on ideas of novelty detection founded in pattern recognition and multivariate statistics. The philosophy of novelty detection is simple. Features are first extracted from a baseline system to be monitored, and subsequent data are then compared to see if the new features are outliers, which significantly depart from the rest of population. In damage diagnosis problems, the assumption is that outliers are generated from a damaged condition of the monitored system. This damage classification necessitates the establishment of a decision boundary. Choosing this threshold value is often {{based on the assumption that}} the parent distribution of data is Gaussian in nature. While the problem of novelty detection focuses attention on the outlier or extreme values of the data i. e. those points in the tails of the distribution, the threshold selection using the normality assumption weighs the central population of data. Therefore, this normality assumption might impose potentially <b>misleading</b> <b>behavior</b> on damage classification, and is likely to lead the damage diagnosis astray. In this paper, extreme value statistics is integrated with the novelty detection to specifically model the tails of the distribution of interest. Finally, the proposed technique is demonstrated on simulated numerical data and time series data measured from an eight degree-of-freedom spring-mass system...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of damage detection is to ascertain with confidence if damage is present or not within {{a structure of}} interest. In this study, a damage classification problem is cast {{in the context of}} the statistical pattern recognition paradigm. First, a time prediction model, called an autoregressive and autoregressive with exogenous inputs (AR-ARX) model, is fit to a vibration signal measured during a normal operating condition of the structure. When a new time signal is recorded from an unknown state of the system, the prediction errors are computed for the new data set using the time prediction model. When the structure undergoes structural degradation, it is expected that the prediction errors will increase for the damage case. Based on this premise, a damage classifier is constructed using a sequential hypothesis testing technique called the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). The SPRT is one form of parametric statistical inference tests, and the adoption of the SPRT to damage detection problems can improve the early identification of conditions that could lead to performance degradation and safety concerns. The sequential test assumes a probability distribution of the sample data sets, and a Gaussian distribution of the sample data sets is often used. This assumption, however, might impose potentially <b>misleading</b> <b>behavior</b> on the extreme values of the data, i. e. those points in the tails of the distribution. As the problem of damage detection specifically focuses attention on the tails, the assumption of normality is likely to lead the analysis astray. To overcome this difficulty, the performance of the SPRT is improved by integrating extreme values statistics, which specifically models behavior in the tails of the distribution of interest into the SPRT.

If an automatic device could accurately record the duration and frequency for a given behavioral event, it would be a valuable alternative to the traditional use of human observers for behavioral studies. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy in the time spent at the waterer and the number of visits to the waterer by individually housed nursery pigs between human observers scoring video files using Observer software (OBS) and an automatic water meter Hobo (WM, control) affixed onto the waterline. Eleven PIC USA genotype gilts (22 ± 2 d of age; 6. 5 ± 1. 4 kg of BW) were housed individually in pens with ad libitum access to a corn-based starter ration and one nipple waterer. Behavior was collected on d 0 (day of weaning), 7, and 14 of the trial using 1 color camera positioned over 4 attached pens and a RECO- 204 DVR at 1 frame per second. For the OBS method, 2 experienced observers recorded drinking behavior from the video files, which was defined as when the gilt placed her mouth over the nipple waterer. Data were analyzed using nonparametric methods and the general linear model and regression procedures in SAS. The experimental unit was the individual pen housing 1 gilt. The GLM model included the method of observation (WM vs. OBS) and time (24 h) as variables, and the gilt nested within method was used as the error term. Gilts consumed more water (P = 0. 04) on d 14 than on d 0. The time of day affected (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) the number of visits and the time spent at the waterer regardless of the method. However, the OBS method underestimated (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) the number of visits to the waterer (3. 48 ± 0. 33 visits/h for OBS vs. 4. 94 ± 0. 33 for WM) and overestimated (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) the time spent at the waterer (22. 6 ± 1. 46 s/h for OBS vs. 13. 9 ± 1. 43 for WM) compared with WM.

The presence of this non-uniqueness problem can cause an overestimation of the Original Gas in Place and a negligence of the effect of a considerable encroaching aquifer that could be thought not to exist. This study shows several examples for synthetic gas reservoir/aquifer systems that are modeled mathematically, then programmed, to simulate the performance of these systems. Aquifer analytical models for linear and radial shapes were used to calculate for the effect of the water encroachment. It is shown that the performance plots for material balance techniques (p/z technique and Havlena-Odeh technique) show a <b>misleading</b> <b>behavior</b> that can be misinterpreted to be of a closed (volumetric) reservoir, while actually it is for a water-drive gas reservoir of much less Original Gas in Place. Two models for reservoir/aquifer systems were developed to illustrate the non-uniqueness performance. In the first model, which is the forward model, we input the rate schedule and we obtain the pressure performance throughout the production history. In the second model, which is the inverse model, we assume a fake overestimated Original Gas in Place (G'), which implicitly defines a specific cumulative production/ pressure history of a linear p/z plot. The output of the inverse model is a unique production rate schedule for a synthetic case of a water-drive gas reservoir. If we produce our synthetic case using this rate schedule, we will obtain an exact performance on material balance plots of what historically reservoir engineers believed to be a closed reservoir. The extrapolation of the plots in this latter case show a false overestimated Original Gas in Place (G'). In conclusion, we can say that under certain circumstances, the material balance techniques for determining the Original Gas in Place of gas reservoirs can exhibit a clear non-uniqueness problem...|$|E
