25|$|Furthermore, on a {{visit to}} New York City, he was struck by the {{apparent}} paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book Progress and Poverty, which was a great success, selling over 3 million copies. In it George made the argument that a sizeable portion of the wealth created by social and technological advances in a free market economy is possessed by land owners and monopolists via economic rents, and that this concentration of unearned wealth is the main cause of poverty. George considered it a great injustice that private profit was being earned from restricting access to natural resources while productive activity was burdened with heavy taxes, and indicated that such a system was equivalent to slavery – a concept somewhat similar to wage slavery. This is also the work in which he made the case for a land value tax in which governments would tax the value of the land itself, thus preventing private interests from profiting upon its <b>mere</b> <b>possession,</b> but allowing the value of all improvements made to that land to remain with investors.|$|E
25|$|The Protect Act §503 of 1992 (codified at 18 U.S.C. §2251 to 18 U.S.C. §2260) {{makes it}} a federal crime to possess or create sexually {{explicit}} images of any person under 18 years of age; this creates a federal age of consent of 18 for pornography. Thus, while some conduct covered by the statute is highly culpable, these penalties apply even when consensual sex between someone {{under the age of}} eighteen and someone over the age of eighteen is entirely legal under state law, the non-commercial possession of an explicit picture or video clip of the person under the age of eighteen (such as a cell phone photograph of a naked sexual partner, under the age of eighteen, of the person taking the photo) may still constitute a serious federal child pornography felony. The sentence for a first time offender convicted of producing child pornography under 18 U.S.C. §2251 (such as taking a suggestive cell phone picture of an otherwise legal sexual partner under the age of eighteen without an intent to share or sell the picture), face fines and a statutory minimum of 15 years to 30 years maximum in prison. While mandatory minimum offenses do not apply to <b>mere</b> <b>possession</b> of child pornography, it is almost always the case that a person in possession of child pornography is also necessarily guilty of either receipt of child pornography, which carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, or production of child pornography, which carries a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence.|$|E

25|$|Two {{high-profile}} cases {{show how the}} system of traditional courts was manipulated to silence opponents of the Banda government. Perhaps the most flagrant misuse of the Traditional Court system occurred in the trial in 1976 of Albert Muwalo (also known as Albert Muwalo Nqumayo), Secretary General of the Malawi Congress Party and Focus Gwede, Head of the Police Special Branch, {{on a charge of}} attempting to assassinate President Banda. Both these men had been closely associated with highly repressive government policies in the 1970s, but the crime they were accused of involved plotting to overthrow that government. Banda had defined plotting to overthrowing the government as merely speaking aloud about it, but there was little evidence that the accused had even done that. The only concrete evidence against the men was their illegal possession of firearms. However, the Traditional Court admitted as evidence three anonymous and unsubstantiated letters that denounced the men, on the basis, “…there is no smoke without fire” and recordings of two telephone conversations about the guns, which did not discuss any plans to use them. In order to establish a motive for the alleged treason, the court considered Muwalo’s possession of photographs of ex-ministers who fled Malawi after the Cabinet Crisis of 1964 and copies of books which the court deemed subversive, although only one was actually banned. The court held that <b>mere</b> <b>possession</b> of the photographs of people who had, “…rebelled against the Malawi government” made the owner a rebel, and owning the books was enough to brand their owner a communist sympathiser. There was even less “evidence” against Gwede, but both men were sentenced to death for treason. Muwalo was hanged, but Gwede received a last minute reprieve and remained in prison until 1993.|$|E

[...] He must recover on the strength of his own title, without regard to the weakness of that of his adversary. [...] It is necessary that the plaintiff be the owner of the property claimed to be converted, or that he be in possession or entitled to possession {{at the time of the}} alleged conversion. [...] Absolute and unqualified title is sufficient, but it is not necessary. [...] A <b>mere</b> right of <b>possession</b> is generally regarded as an interest sufficient to maintain an action.|$|R

[...] In order for a plaintiff to recover in a suit for conversion, {{it is necessary that}} the plaintiff establish a right to the property and what is converted. [...] An immediate right to possession at the time of conversion is usually all that is required in the way of title or possession to enable the plaintiff to maintain an action. [...] The possession of personal property carries with it the presumption of title, and enables the possessor to maintain an action for conversion against any person except the rightful owner. [...] As against a stranger with no possession rights, <b>mere</b> <b>possession</b> alone is good enough, and in such a case, the plaintiff need prove no more than possession.

2500|$|In {{response}} to Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, Congress passed the PROTECT Act of 2003 (also dubbed the Amber Alert Law) {{and it was}} signed into law on April 30, 2003, by President George W. Bush. The PROTECT Act amended the previous law on child pornography by adding an affirmative defense which states that [...] "the alleged child pornography was not produced using any actual minor or minors". The PROTECT Act also modified the law by changing the previous [...] "appears to be a minor" [...] section with [...] "indistinguishable from that of a minor" [...] phrasing, and it is specified that [...] "the term 'indistinguishable', used with respect to a depiction, means virtually indistinguishable, in that the depiction is such that an ordinary person viewing the depiction would conclude that the depiction is of an actual minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. This definition does not apply to depictions that are drawings, cartoons, sculptures, or paintings depicting minors or adults." [...] The PROTECT Act also enacted , which criminalizes material that has [...] "a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture or painting", that [...] "depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and is [...] "obscene" [...] or [...] "depicts an image that is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in ... sexual intercourse ... and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value". By its own terms, the law does not make all simulated child pornography illegal, only that found to be obscene or lacking in serious value. And <b>mere</b> <b>possession</b> of said images is not a violation of the law unless it can be proven that they were transmitted through a common carrier, such as the mail or the internet, or transported across state lines. There is also an affirmative defense made for possession of no more than two images with [...] "reasonable steps to destroy" [...] the images or reporting and turning over the images to law enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{charge against}} Muwalo and Gwede was of {{attempting}} to assassinate President Banda and overthrow his government. Banda had defined plotting to and overthrow his government as merely speaking aloud about it, {{but there was little}} evidence that the accused had even done that. The only concrete evidence against the men was their illegal possession of firearms. However, the Traditional Court admitted as evidence three letters that denounced them for colluding with ex-ministers who fled Malawi after the Cabinet Crisis of 1964. One of the letters was anonymous, and of the two signed letters, one was disowned by the supposed signatory and the signatory of the other did not exist. Nevertheless, the court admitted all three on the basis, [...] "...there is no smoke without fire". They also admitted recordings of two telephone conversations the defendants had about the guns, which did not discuss any plans to use them. In order to establish a motive for the alleged treason, the court considered Muwalo's possession of photographs of some of the ex-ministers and copies of books which the court deemed subversive, although only one was actually banned (this was George Orwell's Animal Farm). The court held that <b>mere</b> <b>possession</b> of the photographs of people who had, [...] "...rebelled against the Malawi government" [...] made the owner, Muwalo, a rebel, and owning the books was enough to brand him as a communist sympathiser. There was even less evidence, however unsatisfactory, against Gwede, but both men were sentenced to death for treason. Although Muwalo and Gwede were probably guilty of many crimes, the wholly insufficient evidence produced did not prove their guilt of the crime of which they were accused. An appeal against both conviction and sentence was heard by the National Traditional Court of Appeal in August 1977, but rejected. The two men were then transferred to the condemned cells of Zomba prison to await execution.
