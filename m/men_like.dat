5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{lived in}} Indiana from 1816 until 1830, age 7 to 21. It was {{during these years}} that Lincoln first {{encountered}} slavery and began to form his opinions. Growing up in a climate where the state politics were run by <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Jennings and Pennington would have much influence {{on the development of}} Lincoln's views.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Larry Kramer and Paul Popham, who had {{previously}} shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the Gay Men's Health Crisis {{to raise money for}} medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began getting sick with opportunistic infections. Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor Ed Koch and assistance from the city's Public Health Department to provide social services and preventive education about AIDS and unsafe sex.|$|E
5|$|Not {{everyone}} served aboard ships {{during the}} war. Some <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Jose R. Zaragoza served on missions on some lonely atolls. When 19-year-old Zaragoza, {{a native of}} Los Angeles, California, joined the Coast Guard, he was sent on patrols in the Pacific coast of the United States to defend against sabotage and invasion from the Japanese. Later he received instructions in the then-emerging and secretive field of LORAN navigation and was sent to Ulithi atoll, located between Guam and the Philippines. He assisted with LORAN research and development, and served on Ulithi for 15 months.|$|E

5|$|Sometime {{during their}} journey or their {{stay in the}} region, Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great {{mountain}} referred to as 'Kilimansharo', which reached the clouds and which was 'capped in silver'. The two <b>men,</b> <b>like</b> most Europeans at the time, were {{under the impression that}} snow and ice could not exist so close to the equator, and failed to realize the significance of the mountain being 'topped with silver'.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{complicated by the}} American spoils system. After Andrew Jackson assumed the U.S. presidency in March 1829, many competent Indian agents were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. <b>Men</b> <b>like</b> Thomas Forsyth, John Marsh, and Thomas McKenney were replaced by less qualified men such as Felix St. Vrain. In the 19th century, historian Lyman Draper argued that the Black Hawk War {{could have been avoided}} had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the then megas doux, Michael Stryphnos, was accused by Niketas Choniates of {{enriching}} himself by selling off the equipment {{of the imperial}} fleet, while by the early 13th century {{the authority of the}} central government had weakened {{to such an extent that}} various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces. The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Leo Sgouros in southern Greece and the imperial governor of Samos, Pegonites, to use their ships for their own purposes, launching raids of their own. Even Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually {{many of the young}} men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Moye Stephens.|$|E
5|$|In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher {{arrived at}} the castle and began {{production}} operations at a forge built within the bailey. A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120-day period was achieved by 1233, with <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Malemort being able to produce up to 100quarrels a day. Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford. The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies, with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh {{being one of the}} levers of royal power during the period.|$|E
5|$|Many of Grant's {{associates}} {{were able}} to capture his confidence through flattery and brought their intrigues openly to his attention. One of these men, Orville E. Babcock, was a subtle and unscrupulous enemy of reformers, having served as Grant's personal secretary for seven years while living in the White House. Babcock, twice indicted, gained indirect control of whole departments of the government, planted suspicions of reformers in Grant's mind, plotted their downfall, and sought to replace them with <b>men</b> <b>like</b> himself. Grant allowed Babcock to be a stumbling block for reformers who might have saved the President from scandal. Grant's secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, who was often at odds with Babcock, made efforts to save Grant's reputation by advocating that reformers be appointed to or kept in public office. Grant also unwisely accepted gifts from wealthy donors that cast doubts on his reputability.|$|E

5|$|The {{conservative}} Moderate {{opposition to}} Feijó had close links to coffee and sugar cane planter families and merchants in the Brazilian southeast and northeast. These groups wielded great political, {{social and economic}} influence. They began to see their interests more in alignment with <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Honório Hermeto, who were planters like themselves—people who supported the slave trade with Africa and desired a centralized state able to impose order. The often strongheaded Honório Hermeto, swallowing his pride, set aside his enmity toward Vasconcelos in pursuit of an alliance. Dubbed the Reactionary Party by Feijó and his allies in 1837, the conservative Moderate opposition born in late 1834 was the genesis of what would evolve into the Party of Order (c. 1843) and finally into the Conservative Party (c. 1853).|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in <b>men</b> <b>like</b> them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Ellsworth M. Toohey, {{who writes}} a popular {{architecture}} {{column in the}} Banner, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who {{wants to build a}} Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark's unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey convinces Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect due to his rejection of historical styles. Dominique speaks in Roark's defense, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, such as persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.|$|E

5|$|In 1282, {{war with}} Wales broke out again; {{this time it}} would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a {{full-scale}} war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted {{on the use of the}} feudal summons. To <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant rewards of land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 129495, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.|$|E
5|$|The naval {{section of}} Alsos flew into Paris soon {{after it had}} been liberated in August 1944. They went down to Bordeaux to inspect the {{captured}} German destroyer Z39. After the Alsos Mission became convinced that the Germans had not developed an atomic bomb, the naval section became the Naval Technical Mission Europe. They were {{particularly interested in the}} work of Dr Hellmuth Walter in the development of submarines and rockets. Most of the targets that they were interested in lay in the British sector, so they worked closely with their English allies. In {{the last days of the}} war, the Naval Technical Mission was part of a 75-man task force, most of whom were from 30 Assault Unit, that made a dash for Kiel, entering the city far in advance of the Allied advance. The whole garrison of the city, some 150,000 men, surrendered to the task force. They drove to Admiral Karl Dönitz's headquarters in Flensburg, where they saw but did not speak with him, as Dönitz was on his way to surrender. They spoke instead to Admiral Otto Backenköhler, and persuaded him to sign a release for German scientists, so <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Walter could freely discuss their work with the Allies. From April to December 1945, Mumma also served as assistant naval attaché.|$|E
5|$|The {{next most}} senior regular officers, all colonels, {{included}} <b>men</b> <b>like</b> Vernon Sturdee, Henry Wynter and John Northcott, {{all of whom}} had joined the Army before World War I. These officers held senior commands throughout the war, but seldom active ones. Below them were a distinct group of regular officers, graduates of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, which had opened in 1911. Their number included Frank Berryman, William Bridgeford, Cyril Clowes, Horace Robertson, Sydney Rowell and George Alan Vasey. These officers had fought in World War I and reached the rank of major, but their promotion prospects were restricted and they remained majors for twenty years. Many left the Army to join the British or Indian armies, or the RAAF, or to return to civilian life. As a group, they had become embittered and resentful, and determined to prove that they could lead troops in battle. Many regular officers had attended training courses or been on exchange with the British Army, which was important {{in the early years of}} the war when there was close cooperation between the two armies.|$|E
