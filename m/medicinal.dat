5|$|Many <b>medicinal</b> plants produce {{chemical}} compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in <b>medicinal</b> plants is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where <b>medicinal</b> plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the study}} of <b>medicinal</b> plants was not being {{neglected}} and a full synthesis of ancient Greek pharmacology was compiled in Materia Medica c. 60 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40-90 AD) who was a Greek physician with the Roman army.

2500|$|From the {{earliest}} records {{regarding the use}} of <b>medicinals</b> to today, the toxicity of certain substances has been described in all Chinese materia medica. Since TCM has become more popular in the Western world, there are increasing concerns about the potential toxicity of many traditional Chinese <b>medicinals</b> including plants, animal parts and minerals. For most <b>medicinals,</b> efficacy and toxicity testing are based on traditional knowledge rather than laboratory analysis. The toxicity in some cases could be confirmed by modern research (i.e., in scorpion); in some cases it could not (i.e., in Curculigo). Further, ingredients may have different names in different locales or in historical texts, and different preparations may have similar names for the same reason, which can create inconsistencies and confusion in the creation of <b>medicinals,</b> with the possible danger of poisoning. Edzard Ernst [...] "concluded that adverse effects of herbal medicines are an important albeit neglected subject in dermatology, which deserves further systematic investigation." [...] Research suggests that the toxic heavy metals and undeclared drugs found in Chinese herbal medicines might be a serious health issue.|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionChinese herbal {{medicine}} is an increasingly popular worldwide medical therapy {{which also has}} an impact in pregnancy. However, the question of its drug safety during pregnancy remains unresolved. Potential problems include teratogenicity, abortion, perinatal toxicity, pre- and postnatal developmental abnormalities, and eventually an increased risk for carcinomas in the offspring. Standard Materia Medica textbooks contain unreliable information {{when it comes to}} risks during pregnancy. Wang and co-workers conducted an experimental study (WS) on mice in which they investigated the effects of 17 Chinese <b>medicinals</b> regarding embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity. All these drugs seemed to exhibit multiple significant toxic effects. Another study by Li and co-workers (LS) investigated the reproductive toxicity of Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma in mice, rats and rabbits. They described an increased pre- and postnatal mortality and, at high doses, congenital malformations. In an attempt to identify the risks of the tested <b>medicinals</b> during pregnancy, we analysed these two experimental studies and compared their results with possible safety data for humans from two reviews of clinical studies on threatened miscarriage (AR and CR). MethodsWe re-evaluated WS and LS in relation to accordance with internationally accepted rules, equivalence to human dose, biometric accuracy, plausibility, and coherence. Eligible studies of the two reviews on threatened miscarriage were evaluated for specific pregnancy risks concerning the 17 <b>medicinals</b> tested in WS and LS. ResultsWe found that WS does not conform to international ICH guidelines and includes many inconsistencies, implausibilities and several severe biometrical flaws. It reported a total of 364 significant events out of which 145 false significant results are expected. The data-handling pointed to irregularities. Analysis of LS exhibited also many inconsistencies. The results regarding congenital malformations were statistically insignificant and are based on small case numbers. Insofar as the safety data of the 17 <b>medicinals</b> were documented by eligible studies of the two reviews, there was no indication of an increased abortion rate in humans. Fetal growth retardation was not observed in the human studies. For neonatal health and postnatal development, there were sufficient safety data only for a few <b>medicinals</b> in the human studies. As for teratogenicity, only small case numbers (0 to 109) were available from the human data. ConclusionWS and LS are not reliable data sources for deriving pregnancy risks in humans for the tested Chinese <b>medicinals.</b> In addition, the results appear to contradict the outcomes observed in the treatment of humans. Regarding teratogenicity, for most Chinese <b>medicinals,</b> neither the safety nor the risk during pregnancy can be definitively ascertained. Further studies on the risks of Chinese <b>medicinals</b> during pregnancy are urgently needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{literature}} survey {{of the field of}} bicyclic and cage compounds were presented, with the objective of identifying those types of compounds with unusual physical and chemical stability, and determining what practical applications have been found for these compounds. Major applications have been as polymers, polymer additives, <b>medicinals,</b> and pesticides. Lesser applications have included fuels, fuel additives, lubricants, lubricant additives, and perfumes.

5|$|Terpenes and terpenoids of {{many kinds}} {{are found in}} a variety of <b>medicinal</b> plants, and in {{resinous}} plants such as the conifers.

5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of <b>medicinal</b> plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in <b>medicinal</b> plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from <b>medicinal</b> plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a <b>medicinal</b> plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against <b>medicinal</b> plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E
5|$|With {{increasing}} {{trade in}} economic and <b>medicinal</b> plants {{the need for}} a more comprehensive classification system increased. Up to about 1650 CE plants had been grouped either alphabetically or according to utilitarian folk taxonomy – by their <b>medicinal</b> uses or whether they were trees, shrubs or herbs. Between 1650 and 1700 CE there was a move from the utilitarian back to a scientific natural classification based on the characters of the plants themselves.|$|E
