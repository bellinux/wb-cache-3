50|$|The cost of conduit {{installation}} {{is higher}} than other wiring methods due {{to the cost of}} materials and labor. In applications such as residential construction, the high degree of physical damage protection may not be required, so the expense of conduit is not warranted. Conductors installed within conduit cannot dissipate heat as readily as those installed in open wiring, so the current capacity of each conductor must be reduced (derated) if many are installed in one conduit. It is impractical, and prohibited by wiring regulations, to have more than 360 degrees of total bends in a run of conduit, so special outlet <b>fittings</b> <b>must</b> be provided to allow conductors to be installed without damage in such runs.|$|R
50|$|The {{fittings}} are not re-useable. If {{a design}} change is required or if a joint {{is found to}} be defective or improperly crimped, the already installed <b>fittings</b> <b>must</b> be cut out and discarded.

Whereas with a soldered fitting, a defective joint can just be re-soldered, or heated and turned if a minor change is required, or heated and removed without requiring any of the tubing to be cut away. This also allows more expensive fittings like valves to be re-used if they are otherwise in good to new condition, something not possible if the fitting is crimped on.|$|R

While information on the distribution is important for many population genetic models, it is also useful for inferring the replication mode of a virus. We have analyzed the distribution of mutants emerging from single bursts in the RNA bacteriophage φ 6 and find that the distribution closely matches a Poisson distribution. The match suggests that replication in this bacteriophage is effectively by a stamping machine model in which the parental genome is the main template used for replication. However, because the distribution deviates slightly from a Poisson distribution, the stamping machine is not perfect and some progeny genomes <b>must</b> replicate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive ages and masses for 276 {{clusters}} in the merger galaxy NGC 3256. This {{was achieved by}} taking accurate photometry in four wavebands from archival HST images. Photometric measurements are compared to synthetic stellar population (SSP) models {{to find the most}} probable age, mass and extinction. The cluster population of NGC 3256 reveals an increase in the star formation rate over the last 100 million years and the initial cluster mass function (ICMF) is best described by a power law relation with slope α = 1. 85 ± 0. 12. Using the observed cluster population for NGC 3256 we calculate the implied mass of clusters younger than 10 million years old, and convert this to a cluster formation rate over the last 10 million years. Comparison of this value with the star formation rate (SFR) indicates the fraction of stars found within bound clusters after the embedded phase of cluster formation, Γ, is 22. 9 %± 7. 39. 8 for NGC 3256. We carried out an in-depth analysis into the errors associated with such calculations showing that errors introduced by the SSP <b>fitting</b> <b>must</b> be taken into account and an unconstrained metallicity adds to these uncertainties.

6000|$|Then {{there was}} a great hubbub--cries of [...] "Order," [...] "Gresham," [...] "Spoke," [...] "Hear, hear," [...] and the like,--during which Sir Orlando Drought and Mr. Gresham both stood on their legs. So {{powerful}} was Mr. Gresham's voice that, through it all, every word that he said was audible to the reporters. His opponent hardly attempted to speak, but stood relying upon his right. Mr. Gresham said he understood that it was the desire of the House that he should explain the circumstances in reference to the charge that had been made against him, and it would certainly be for the convenience of the House that this should be done at the moment. The Speaker of course ruled that Sir Orlando was in possession of the floor, but suggested that it might be convenient that he should yield to the right honourable gentleman on the other side for a few minutes. Mr. Gresham, as a matter of course, succeeded. Rights and rules, which are bonds of iron to a little man, are packthread to a giant. No one in all that assembly knew the House better than did Mr. Gresham, was better able to take it by storm, or more obdurate in perseverance. He did make his speech, though clearly he had no right to do so. The House, he said, was aware, that by the most unfortunate demise of the late Duke of Omnium, a gentleman had been removed from this House to another place, whose absence from their counsels would long be felt as a very grievous loss. Then he pronounced a eulogy on Plantagenet Palliser, so graceful and well arranged, that even the bitterness of the existing opposition was unable to demur to it. The House was well aware {{of the nature of the}} labours which now for some years past had occupied the mind of the noble duke; and the paramount importance which the country attached to their conclusion. The noble duke no doubt was not absolutely debarred from a continuance of his work by the change which had fallen upon him; but it was essential that some gentleman, belonging to the same party with the noble duke, versed in office, and having a seat in that House, should endeavour to devote himself to the great measure which had occupied so much of the attention of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer. No doubt it <b>must</b> be <b>fitting</b> that the gentleman so selected should be at the Exchequer, in the event of their party coming into office. The honourable gentleman to whom allusion had been made had acted throughout with the present noble duke in arranging the details of the measure in question; and the probability of his being able to fill the shoes left vacant by the accession to the peerage of the noble duke had, indeed, been discussed;--but the discussion had been made in reference to the measure, and only incidentally in regard to the office. He, Mr. Gresham, held that he had done nothing that was indiscreet,--nothing that his duty did not demand. If right honourable gentlemen opposite were of a different opinion, he thought that that difference came from the fact that they were less intimately acquainted than he unfortunately had been with the burdens and responsibilities of legislation.|$|R

Old schooner captains they were, old South Sea traders, cooks, and mates; fine creatures, softened by residence among a softer race: full men besides, though not by reading, but by strange experience; and for days together I could hear their yarns with an unfading pleasure. All had, indeed, some touch of the poetic; for the beach-comber, when not a mere ruffian, is the poor relation of the artist. Even through Johnson's inarticulate speech, his [...] "O yes, there ain't no harm in them Kanakas," [...] or [...] "O yes, that's {{a son of a}} gun of a fine island, mountainous right down; I didn't never ought to have left that island," [...] there pierced a certain gusto of appreciation; and some of the rest were master-talkers.

The draughty, rowdy city of San Francisco, the bustling office where my friend Jim paced like a caged lion daily between ten and four, even (at times) the retrospect of Paris, faded in comparison.

40|$|A {{system for}} continuous, rapid {{deaeration}} of hydraulic oil {{has been built}} to replace a prior system that effected deaeration more slowly in a cyclic pressure/ vacuum process. Such systems are needed because (1) hydraulic oil has an affinity for air, typically containing between 10 and 15 volume percent of air and (2) in the original application for which these systems were built, there is a requirement to keep the proportion of dissolved air below 1 volume percent because a greater proportion can lead to pump cavitation and excessive softness in hydraulic-actuator force-versus-displacement characteristics. In addition to overcoming several deficiencies of the prior deaeration system, the present system removes water from the oil. The system (see figure) includes a pump that continuously circulates oil {{at a rate of}} 10 gal/min (38 L/min) between an 80 -gal (303 -L) airless reservoir and a tank containing a vacuum. When the circulation pump is started, oil is pumped, at a pressure of 120 psi (827 kPa), through a venturi tube below the tank with a connection to a stand-pipe in the tank. This action draws oil out of the tank via the standpipe. At the same time, oil is sprayed into the tank in a fine mist, thereby exposing a large amount of oil to the vacuum. When the oil level in the tank falls below the lower of two level switches, a vacuum pump is started, drawing a hard vacuum on the tank through a trap that collects any oil and water entrained in the airflow. When the oil level rises above higher of the two level switches or when the system is shut down, a solenoid valve between the tank and the vacuum pump is closed to prevent suction of oil into the vacuum pump. Critical requirements that the system is designed to satisfy include the following: 1) The circulation pump must have sufficient volume and pressure to operate the venturi tube and spray nozzles. 2) The venturi tube must be sized to empty the tank (except for the oil retained by the standpipe) and maintain a vacuum against the vacuum pump. 3) The tank must be strong enough to withstand atmospheric pressure against the vacuum inside and must have sufficient volume to enable exposure of a sufficiently large amount of sprayed oil to the vacuum. 4) The spray nozzles must be sized to atomize the oil and to ensure that the rate of flow of sprayed oil does not exceed {{the rate at which the}} venturi action can empty the tank. 5) The vacuum pump must produce a hard vacuum against the venturi tube and continue to work when it ingests some oil and water. 6) <b>Fittings</b> <b>must</b> be made vacuum tight (by use of O-rings) to prevent leakage of air into the system. The system is fully automatic, and can be allowed to remain in operation with very little monitoring. It is capable of reducing the air content of the oil from 11 to less than 1 volume percent in about 4 hours and to keep the water content below 100 parts per million...|$|R
40|$|Presbyacusis is {{the most}} common cause of hearing loss and is {{considered}} to be among the three most commonly reported chronic health problems of the elderly. In future years, the problem is predicted to be aggravated as the expected life span of the population increases. The psychological and social consequences of hearing impairment have been the subject of several texts. Numerous articles have been published expressing concerns involving the considerable number of hearing aids that are not being put to use and are permanently ending up in drawers. However, several unresolved issues regarding the practical implications of hearing loss, including the expectations and motivational factors regarding hearing aid use, still remain. These issues concern the elderly population, who represent the primary hearing aid users in society, in particular. Declining health, varying conditions of life, increased age and the considerable number of individuals living alone may influence the experience of hearing loss. Such knowledge could be of substantial importance to treatment and potentially be beneficial to the development of rehabilitation programmes. Objective and aims. The overall objective of this thesis was to obtain understanding and knowledge regarding hearing loss and hearing aid use among the elderly, in order to develop suitable audiological rehabilitation programmes. The specific aims: - To assess daily life consequences of hearing loss in older adults and to explore the influence of hearing loss through a subjective assessment of health and general life satisfaction, gender, age and marital status. - To describe preconceptions and expectations of older adults about getting hearing aids and to explore the influences of hearing loss, hearing aid experience, gender, age and marital status on these preconceptions and expectations. - To describe hearing aid use among older adults and to identify motivational factors associated with their use. Subjective and methods. This thesis is based on data from 174 men and women randomly selected from a waiting list for hearing aid fittings. The participants were all clients of the Department of Otolaryngology at the Lovisenberg Diakonale Hospital, a community hospital in Oslo. The inclusion criteria were that the participants were aged 65 years and above and that they expressed a need for hearing aids. Exclusion criteria were serious illness, senility and not being able to communicate in Norwegian. The study sample consisted of 174 individuals: 113 women (65 %) and 61 men (35 %) with an age range of 65 – 93 years. The mean age was 79. 7 years. All participants were examined by an ear, nose and throat specialist and were given a hearing test at their initial appointment at the hospital. Hearing loss was measured using pure tone audiometry according to recommended procedures. The Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale (HDHS) was used to measure perceived activity limitation and perceived participation restriction. The hearing aid scale, a 35 -item questionnaire in three sections, was constructed with specific focus on preconceptions and expectations regarding obtaining hearing aids and experiences regarding previous use. Demographic data were gathered to describe the study sample. Main findings. Perceived activity limitation was significantly associated with increased hearing loss and decreased health, and participation restriction significantly was associated with decreased life satisfaction. Gender, age and marital status did not appear to be determinant factors for perceived activity limitation and participation restriction. (Article I). Preconceptions and expectations of older adults regarding obtaining hearing aids revealed three factors: positive expectations, barriers and social pressure. Participants with moderate to severe hearing loss and hearing aid experience had significantly higher expectations towards hearing aids than participants with mild hearing loss and no hearing aid experience. The male gender was associated with fewer barriers toward hearing aids. Age and marital status had no influence on the three factors (Article II). The use of hearing aids was positively and significantly associated with follow-up support and acceptance of need. Twenty-two per cent had used their previously fitted hearing aids less than one hour a day. The degree of hearing loss, gender, age and marital status demographics were all not significantly associated with hearing aid use (Article III). Conclusions and implications for practice. The findings suggest that daily life consequences of hearing loss, health conditions and life satisfaction are closely related. The findings are also enlightening regarding the considerable impact on the individual experiencing hearing loss, whose life is affected and activities in daily life are limited. Health factors and psychosocial aspects should be considered as a part of the overall situation during the process of hearing aid fitting and rehabilitation. There are also indications of considerably varied preconceptions and expectations towards hearing aids among elderly hearing-impaired individuals. Less positive expectations and more problemoriented preconceptions among subjects with mild hearing loss may explain why hearing aids are scarcely used. The subjective acceptance of hearing loss, assessed need for hearing aids and experiences with follow-up support seem to be equally important to the benefits and use of hearing aids. Follow-up support, including individual rehabilitation programmes, may be of great importance to hearing aids being used, especially among individuals with a slight loss of hearing. Hearing aid <b>fitting</b> <b>must</b> be considered a long-term process that includes sufficient time for information, education and training as well as easy access to professionals when problems arise. The individual should be well informed regarding what the hearing rehabilitation process involves and what is required as far as individual achievements and patience. Our findings indicate an unmet need for audiological rehabilitation and follow-up support among elderly hearing aid users, which, at least to some extent, is verified by the vast number of fitted hearing aids that are seldom or never used. Audiological rehabilitation, including psychosocial aspects and educational aspects of hearing aids and communication, may well constitute an important contribution to increased social activity and participation rates by the elderly population with hearing impairments...|$|R
