However, as with ICCDs, the gain that is {{applied in the}} gain register is stochastic and the exact gain that {{has been applied to}} a pixel's charge is impossible to know. At high gains (> 30), this uncertainty has the same effect on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as halving the quantum efficiency (QE) with respect to operation with a gain of unity. However, at very low light levels (where the quantum efficiency is most important), it can be assumed that a pixel either contains an electron [...] - [...] or not. This removes the noise associated with the stochastic multiplication at the risk of counting multiple electrons in the same pixel as a single electron. To avoid multiple counts in one pixel due to coincident photons in this mode of operation, high frame rates are essential. The dispersion in the gain is shown in the graph on the right. For <b>multiplication</b> <b>registers</b> with many elements and large gains it is well modelled by the equation: ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{progress}} of characterization of a low-noise, photon counting Electron Multiplying Charged Coupled Device (EMCCD) operating in optical wavelengths and demonstrate possible {{solutions to the problems}} of Clock-Induced Charge (CIC) and other trapped charge through sub-bandgap illumination. Such a detector will be vital to the feasibility of future space-based direct imaging and spectroscopy missions for exoplanet characterization, and is scheduled to fly on-board the AFTA-WFIRST mission. The 512 × 512 EMCCD is an e 2 v detector housed and clocked by a Nüvü Cameras controller. Through a <b>multiplication</b> gain <b>register,</b> this detector produces as many as 5000 electrons for a single, incident-photon-induced photoelectron produced in the detector, enabling single photon counting operation with read noise and dark current orders of magnitude below that of standard CCDs. With the extremely high contrasts (Earth-to-Sun flux ratio is ∼ 10 ^- 10) and extremely faint targets (an Earth analog would measure 28 ^th - 30 ^th magnitude or fainter), a photon-counting EMCCD is absolutely necessary to measure the signatures of habitability on an Earth-like exoplanet within the timescale of a mission's lifetime, and we discuss the concept of operations for an EMCCD making such measurements.

50|$|Dr Bird and {{his team}} built a copy of Booth's machine in the BTM {{premises}} at Icknield Way Letchworth, which they called HEC 1. It was 1.5 m high by 3m wide by 0.5m deep and used simple circuits, with approximately 1000 ex-Government thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) mainly 6J6s which were B7G-based double triodes. The memory consisted of a 5.5 inch mm diameter, 1 inch mm wide drum rotating at 3000 rpm containing 32 tracks each storing sixteen 32-bit words giving a total of 2kilobytes. The drum had a special track from which the electronics were clocked. The machine had an accumulator and a multiplier register which were arranged to allow double length multiplication. As the multiplicand was repeatedly added to the product, it got longer while the multiplier got shorter so that the product could fill the accumulator and then continue into the multiplier <b>register.</b> <b>Multiplication</b> took up to 640ms for a 32-bit multiplier, which needed 32 drum accesses.|$|R
40|$|Several {{post-processing}} {{methods were}} proposed {{to overcome the}} excess noise factor induced by EMCCD <b>multiplication</b> <b>register.</b> Each method has a unique effect on SNR. However, since SNR {{does not account for}} photometric accuracy, it cannot be reliably used to directly compare the performance of these algorithms. A normalized quadratic error that accounts for both SNR and accuracy is proposed as an alternative figure of merit. This approach provides a quantitative and rigorous comparison. Using both experimental and simulated frames in the faint-flux range, it is used to compare the existing EMCCD post-processing methods...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} unsupervised technique, {{based upon}} a Bayesian framework, for the segmentation of low light level imagery is proposed. Primarily, Mixture Modelling is used to provide a baseline estimate. This estimate is then refined to consider spatial correlations using Markov Random Field (MRF) Modelling. The technique has been implemented assuming low-light level Poisson statistics, and the results compared to the more widely used assumption of Gaussian statistics. Investigations revealed the Poisson technique quantitatively outperforms the Gaussian technique for synthetic low light imagery, {{both before and after}} avalanche multiplication, via the <b>multiplication</b> <b>register</b> of a Low-light Level Charge Coupled Device (L 3 CCD). The technique was then applied to the task of segmenting a biomedical dataset obtained from a L 3 CCD. Qualitative results were promising, again showing improvement over the Gaussian technique. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} years, the EMCCD {{has had a}} {{profound}} influence on photon starved imaging applications relying on its unique <b>multiplication</b> <b>register</b> based on the impact ionization effect in the silicon. High signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) means high image quality. Thus, SNR improvement {{is important for the}} EMCCD. This work analyzes the SNR performance of an EMCCD with gain off and on. In each mode, simplified SNR models are established for different integration times. The SNR curves are divided into readout noise (or CIC) region and shot noise region by integration time. Theoretical SNR values comparing long frame integration and frame adding in each region are presented and discussed to figure out which method is more effective. In order to further improve the SNR performance, pixel binning is introduced into the EMCCD. The results show that pixel binning does obviously improve the SNR performance, but at the expensive of the spatial resolution. Keywords—EMCCD, SNR improvement, pixel binning I...|$|E

Plântulas, oriundas de sementes germinadas in vitro, com aproximadamente 1, 0 cm de comprimento, foram inoculadas em frascos com capacidade para 250 cm&sup 3;, contendo 60 mL de meio de cultura Knudson C nas concentrações de 0; 50; 100 e 200 % de sais minerais, acrescidos de GA 3 (0; 2, 5; 5; 7, 5; 10 mg L- 1). As culturas foram mantidas em sala de crescimento com irradiância em torno de 35 µmolm- 2 s- 1, temperatura de 25 ± 1 °C e fotoperíodo de 16 horas. Ao final de 90 dias, observa-se que, para Cattleya loddigesii, o meio Knudson C a 200 %, promove maior crescimento in vitro, sendo que a adição de 2, 5 mg L- 1 de GA 3 é eficiente no incremento do número de folhas. Maior multiplicação é registrada em meio Knudson C na concentração {{original}} de seus sais (100 %). Para Hadrolaelia lobatta x Hadrolaelia purpurata Aço, a concentração do meio Knudson C influencia o número de folhas (200 % de sais) e brotos (50 % de sais), mas não tem efeito no crescimento e biomassa. Não se verifica efeito do GA 3 no número de brotos, comprimento de parte aérea e matéria fresca para os dois genótipos. The {{aim of this}} research was to test different concentrations of culture medium Knudson C and gibberellic acid in the in vitro growth of Hadrolaelia lobatta x Hadrolaelia purpurata Aço and Cattleya loddigesii plantlets. Seedlings deriving from in vitro germinated seeds with approximately 1, 0 cm length, were inoculated in bottles of 250 cm³ containing 60 mL of Knudson C culture medium at salts concentrations of 0; 50; 100 e 200 %, and supplemented with 0; 2. 5; 5; 7. 5; 10 mg L- 1 of GA 3. The cultures were maintained in growth room with a 35 µmolm- 2 s- 1 irradiance, 16 hours photoperiod and 25 ± 1 °C of temperature. After 90 days, it is observed that the culture medium Knudson C 200 % for Cattleya loddigesii promote better in vitro growth. The addition of GA 3 (2. 5 mg L- 1) is efficient in the number of leaves increment. Better in vitro <b>multiplication</b> is <b>registered</b> in Knudson C medium in the original concentration (100 %). For Hadrolaelia lobatta x Hadrolaelia purpurata Aço, the concentration of Knudson C culture medium influences the number of leaves (salts 200 %) and sprouts (salts 50 %), but does not have effect in the growth and biomass. No effect of the GA 3 in number of sprouts, length of aerial part and fresh mass for the two genotypes was verified...|$|R
40|$|The Super Advanced X-ray Emission Spectrometer (SAXES) is an {{instrument}} at the Swiss Light Source designed for Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering with an energy resolution (E/ΔE) better than 12000 at 930 eV. Improvements to the instrument have been predicted that could allow the energy resolution to be improved {{by a factor of}} two. To achieve this, the spatial resolution of the detector (currently a Charge-Coupled Device, CCD) over which the energy spectrum is dispersed would have to be improved to better than 5 μm. X-ray photons with energies between a few hundred to a few thousand electron volts primarily interact within the field-free region of back-illuminated CCDs, where each photon forms an electron cloud that diffuses isotropically before reaching the depleted region close to the electrodes. Each photon's electron cloud is likely to be detected as an event with signal split across multiple pixels. Analysing these split events using centroiding techniques allows the photon's interaction position to be determined to a sub-pixel level. PolLux is a soft X-ray microspectroscopy endstation at the Swiss Light Source that can focus 200 eV to 1200 eV X-rays to a spot size of approximately 20 nm. Previous studies using data taken with a linear scan across the centre of a pixel in 3 μm steps predicted an improved resolution by applying centroiding techniques and using an Electron-Multiplying CCD (EM-CCD). In this study, a full 2 D map of the centroiding accuracy in the pixel is presented, formed by rastering in two dimensions across the image plane in single micron steps. The improved spatial resolution from centroiding events in the EM-CCD in all areas of the pixel over the standard CCD is attributed to the improved signal to noise ratio provided by the <b>multiplication</b> <b>register</b> even at high pixel readout speeds (tens of MHz) ...|$|E
