40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the role of}} <b>Myanmar’s</b> military, the Tatmadaw, in the country’s political economy. Using a hybrid of the New Institutional Economics and the developmental state model as the analytical framework, a historical comparative analysis of <b>Myanmar’s</b> political economic institutions during its socialist period (1962 – 1988) and market liberalization period (1988 – 2010) reveals that the Tatmadaw was a major actor with a dominant role in shaping <b>Myanmar’s</b> political economic institutions. <b>Myanmar’s</b> socialist trajectory was enabled by the Tatmadaw’s monopoly of force and motivated largely by national security and the Tatmadaw leaders’ colonial experiences. Under the Tatmadaw’s leadership, socialist and militaristic institutions became ingrained in <b>Myanmar’s</b> political economy while the development of market-oriented institutions became significantly restrained. Although distorted political economic institutions caused the decline of <b>Myanmar’s</b> economy, the Tatmadaw’s desire to maintain political power was the key motivator for the regime to abandon socialism and embrace capitalism. Granted that <b>Myanmar’s</b> private sector has grown since market liberalization, lingering socialist-era norms continue to negatively influence the development of <b>Myanmar’s</b> economic policy and misshape emerging economic institutions.

5|$|Shortly after Giri was {{classified}} a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of <b>Myanmar.</b> Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, {{this was because}} forecasters did not anticipate Giri to strengthen {{as quickly as it}} did. The greatest fear of the residents was the aftermath of the storm. There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta. The chief of the <b>Myanmar</b> Climate Change Watch, a branch within the <b>Myanmar</b> Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6m (12ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, authorities used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri. According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.|$|E

An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia.
