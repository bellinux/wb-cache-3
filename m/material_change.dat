2500|$|On May 2 around 10:30a.m., {{the federal}} {{government}} attempted to file its appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. [...] However, the steel companies had already filed (at 9:00a.m.), which permitted them to open and close oral argument. In accepting the case, the Supreme Court ruled that no <b>material</b> <b>change</b> in the terms and conditions of employment be made. The ruling was inopportune: [...] President Truman had called steelmakers and the union to the White House that morning to reach an agreement. At roughly 3:00p.m., after Sawyer, Fairless and Murray had bargained for five hours, a tentative agreement had been reached. [...] But word of the high court's acceptance of the case led the steel executives {{to back out of}} the deal. With Truman unable to force a resolution by threatening to impose a contract, the steelmakers' hands were strengthened. Talks continued sporadically until May 10, but Sawyer ended them when it became clear the employers were not willing to come to an agreement.|$|E
2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the sound velocities (both longitudinal and shear wave velocities) of an elastic <b>material</b> <b>change</b> if subjected to an initial static stress field. This is a non-linear effect of the constitutive relation between mechanical stress and finite strain in a material of continuous mass. In classical linear elasticity theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This relationship {{is commonly known as}} the generalised Hooke's law. The linear elastic theory involves second order elastic constants (e.g. [...] and [...] ) and yields constant longitudinal and shear sound velocities in an elastic material, not affected by an applied stress. The acoustoelastic effect on the other hand include higher order expansion of the constitutive relation (non-linear elasticity theory) between the applied stress and resulting strain, which yields longitudinal and shear sound velocities dependent of the stress state of the material. In the limit of an unstressed material the sound velocities of the linear elastic theory are reproduced.|$|E

Any <b>material</b> <b>changes</b> are then removed from this specular-free image by using an inpainting technique. The performance of the proposed approach has been tested on synthetic images.
