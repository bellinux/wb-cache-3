500|$|Antony Beaumont {{comments}} that Busoni wrote virtually no chamber music after 1898 and no songs between 1886 and 1918, commenting {{that this was}} [...] "part {{of the process of}} freeing himself from his Leipzig background... worlds of middle-class respectability in which he was not at home, and [...] the shadows of Schumann, Brahms and Wolf loomed too large." [...] The first decade of the 20th century is described by Brendel as being for Busoni [...] "a creative pause" [...] after which he [...] "finally gained an artistic profile of his own" [...] as opposed to the [...] "easy routine which had kept his entire earlier production on the tracks of eclecticism". During this period appeared his Piano Concerto, Op. 39, one of the largest such works ever written both in terms of duration and [...] of resources. [...] Dent comments [...] "In construction [...] is difficult to analyse... on account {{of the way in which}} themes are transferred from movement to another. The work has to be considered as a whole, and Busoni always desired it to be played straight through without interruption." [...] The press reaction to the premiere of the Concerto was largely outraged: the [...] complained of [...] "Noise, more noise, eccentricity and licentiousness"; another journal opined that [...] "the composer would have done better to stay within more modest boundaries". The other major work during this [...] "creative pause" [...] was the Turandot Suite. Busoni employed motifs from Chinese and other oriental music in the suite, though, as Leichtentritt points out, the Suite is [...] "in fact the product of an Occidental mind, for whom the exact imitation of the real Chinese model would always be unnatural and unattainable... the appearance is more artistic than the real thing would be."

As hypothesized, the tonal language group was significantly faster and more accurate at discriminating all spoken items on the basis of pitch contour; they also recorded superior reaction times in the <b>musical</b> context. <b>Musical</b> <b>items</b> were most easily discriminated on the basis of contour–the feature that most closely resembles pitch change in speech. The results support the contention that contour analysis is domain-general and that the early language environment fosters development of general feature extraction processes for pitch contour. 1...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of King's culture is the annual House Music competition. This {{is divided into two}} parts: the Small House features a small group (usually no more than 15) of students from each House, who perform a vocal <b>musical</b> <b>item,</b> with optional instrumental accompaniment. The other part of the competition, Big House, requires each House to perform a <b>musical</b> <b>item</b> involving all of their students. The results are then added together, with the points going towards the Cultural Challenge Shield. The Big House Music night, now held at Auckland's Spark Arena, is {{one of the highlights of}} the school year and attracts large audiences of families and friends. Music is an important part of the College curriculum and not only is it taught as a core subject through to senior level but many students take advantage of the wide range of itinerant music teachers who are available to teach, on an individual basis, a great range of instruments. Piano, strings, brass and woodwind with classical guitar and percussion are the most popular chosen by students. The College is proud of its orchestra and bands which perform regularly at College functions and are frequent competitors in inter-school festivals.|$|E
50|$|From {{the meaning}} of being unusual usage is derived {{the concept of the}} novelty dance (a type of dance that is popular for being unusual or humorous); the novelty song (a <b>musical</b> <b>item</b> that capitalizes on {{something}} new, unusual, or a current fad); the novelty show (a competition or display in which exhibits or specimens are in way some novel); and novelty architecture (a building or other structure that is interesting because it has an amusing design). It is also this sense that applies to a novelty item, a small manufactured adornment, toy or collectible. These, in turn are often used as promotional merchandise in marketing. The chess term, novelty, is used for a move in chess which has never been played before in a recorded game.|$|E

Later the Monday night activity became a time when the building missionaries were able to evaluate their progress with reports on the status of the individual projects.

40|$|Social tagging is {{the process}} by which many users add {{metadata}} in the form of keywords, to annotate information items. In case of music, the annotated items can be songs, artists, albums. Current music recommenders which employ social tagging to improve the music recommendation, fail to always provide appropriate item recommendations, because: (i) users may have different interests for a <b>musical</b> <b>item,</b> and (ii) musical items may have multiple facets. In this paper, we propose an approach that tackles the problem of the multimodal use of music. We develop a unified framework, represented by a 3 -order tensor, to model altogether users, tags, and items. Then, we recommend musical items according to users multimodal perception of music, by performing latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction using the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition technique. We experimentally evaluate the proposed method against two state-of-the-art recommendations algorithms using real Last. fm data.
