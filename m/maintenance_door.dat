5000|$|Its first {{director}} was Arvin Sloane, who also gave the organization its name as an inside joke since {{the main entrance}} to APO's headquarters was behind a <b>maintenance</b> <b>door</b> in the Los Angeles subway system marked [...] "Authorized Personnel Only". Concerned that increased public scrutiny of the CIA and resulting red tape has impeded their ability to do their job, the CIA asked Sloane {{to set up the}} covert unit as one that is still governed by U.S. laws, but unhampered by bureaucratic chain of command with no accountability except to themselves. Sloane was chosen because of his experience running SD-6, which successfully posed as a CIA black ops division for several years. All of its initial members were hand picked by Sloane, and in order to maintain APO's cover as a unit that officially doesn't exist, all members from previous seasons officially resign from the CIA under varying circumstances to work for APO.|$|E

Increasing the effectiveness of those processes and reducing the investment required is an outstanding issue. In this paper, we present an experiment (n= 20) that shows how modern metaphors such as collaborative Mixed Reality can be used to transmit procedural knowledge and could eventually replace other forms of face-to-face training. We implemented a Mixed Reality setup with see-through cameras attached to a Head Mounted Display. The setup allowed for real-time collaborative interactions and could simulate conventional forms of training. We tested the system implementing a manufacturing procedure of an aircraft <b>maintenance</b> <b>door.</b> The obtained results indicate that performance levels in the Immersive Mixed Reality training were not significantly different than in the conventional face-to-face training condition. These results and their implications for future training and the use of Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality and Augmented Reality paradigms in this context are discussed in this paper...|$|E

Eight items for general residential and neighborly satisfaction were included (Bonaiuto et al. 2003) to test the respondents’ general tendency towards their neighborhood atmosphere and if it is influenced to any degree by their likely view to the neighboring building through the side setback areas. A Likert 5 -point scale was used in which 1 means ‘totally disagree’ and 5 means ‘totally agree’. All the respondents were asked to fill out this section of the questionnaire regardless of whether they actually have neighboring side setback areas, in order to examine general awareness about such side setback areas following Canter’s notion of individuals conceptualizing spaces against actual ‘users’ (Canter 1986), as well as Stockols’ evaluation of the quality of alternative places (Stockols and Shumaker 1981), which here would be an actual experience of place.|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} of risk within {{a nursing home}} environment is widely viewed as an undertaking perfom 1 ed by the owners or managers of nursing homes. The residents of these homes are reliant upon the owners and managers to keep them safe, {{due in part to}} a traditional belief that they are the experts and have a greater understanding of risk. To establish risk it is first a requirement to have an understanding of levels of risk and risk management techniques.

However, there are issues that support fire and life safety non-compliance, such as government funding of nursing homes linked with self assessed assurance. In addition, most aged nursing homes are facility managed by on-site care personnel as a secondary role, emergency agencies no longer complete scheduled audits, auditing by government funding agencies is restricted, and fire and life safety are not considered {{by the majority of}} residents or visitors. The higher level of risk within a nursing home environment is due to the demographic of the residents. Such increase in risk places a greater importance on risk mitigation systems, with fire and smoke doors being a pivotal component.

40|$|Security {{is applied}} in the built {{environment}} and this requires {{a close relationship with}} facility managers. Therefore, this study puts forward an approach to establish the facility management knowledge categories within the built environment. In part, the significance of the study stemmed from research undertaken into the compliance to Australian fire <b>door</b> <b>maintenance</b> within nursing homes, which demonstrated 87 percent noncompliance. This high level of non-compliance appeared to identify a lack of facility management knowledge, among other issues (Doleman & Brooks, 2011). The article uses a method to test the supposition of facility management knowledge construct in a three-phase Grounded Theory analysis. Phase-one examines international tertiary Facility Management courses, where course content is critiqued through linguistic analysis to extract the knowledge categories. Phase-two of the study further analyses these findings through the use of multidimensional scaling to present underlying conceptual knowledge interrelationships. The final third-phase uses experts in order to validate the findings of the previous two phases. A pilot study identified 18 common knowledge concepts, for example project management, space planning, budgeting and principles of facility management. The study outcomes will improve the understanding of building knowledge requirements within the built environment, resulting in a framework of facility management knowledge categories. Such an outcome will support the consensual development of a facility management body of knowledge. The specific outcomes put forward for this research includes establishing the primary knowledge categories found within the Facility Management Industry. In addition, the outcomes will support the consensual development of a facility management body of knowledge, support policy, education and the relationship with security...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} assessment of damages caused by high water {{in the city of}} Venice. In particular, we focus our attention on a valuation exercise that addresses the estimation of monetary, short period, on-site damages due to high water events on the different business activities located in Venice. On-site damages include both mitigation costs, which refer to all types of financial expenditure undergone to avert physical and material damages caused by flooding, and remediation costs, i. e. costs to be sustained for maintenance and substitution of affected building elements. Hence, the present study can be considered as a pioneering attempt to analytically quantify, from an economic point of view, on-site damages from high water. An integrated dose-response modelling and an expert-based valuation approach have been selected as the most suitable economic valuation methodology to shed light on the on-site damages. The main focus of the work is to assess dose-response relationships, which are able to describe the physical effects of high water on the different on-site damage categories, including inner and front <b>doors</b> <b>maintenance,</b> cleaning of pavements and maintenance of the walls. Bearing in mind such an economic valuation framework, we proceed with the estimation of on-site damages not only for the present high water situation (business as usual) but also extend the valuation exercise to three additional high water scenarios: (1) a climate change scenario; (2) a high water protection scenario; and, (3) a combined climate change and protection scenario. Estimation results show that the welfare loss due to on-site, short-term damages supported by the business activities ranges from 3. 41 to 4. 73 million Euro per year, respectively for the business as usual and climate change scenarios. Finally, we can conclude that the introduction of a public policy protection mechanism that defends the city of Venice from any flooding above 110 cm above the Punta della Salute Tidal Datum, such as the MOSE, will reduce the on-site damages supported by the business activities up to 2. 87 million Euro per year.

This paper summarizes the history prior to 2009, the major D&D activities, and final end state of the facility at completion of decommissioning in June 2011. The HWCTR facility was built in 1961, operated from 1962 to 1964, and {{is located in the}} northwest quadrant of the Savannah River Site (SRS) approximately three miles from the site boundary. The HWCTR was a pressurized heavy water test reactor used to develop candidate fuel designs for heavy water power reactors.

Atomic Energy Commission to redirect research and development work on heavy water power reactors to reactors cooled with organic materials. For about one year, site personnel maintained the facility in a standby status, and then retired the reactor in place. In the early 1990 s, DOE began planning to decommission HWCTR. Yet, in the face of new budget constraints, DOE deferred dismantlement and placed HWCTR in an extended surveillance and <b>maintenance</b> mode. The <b>doors</b> of the reactor facility were welded shut to protect workers and discourage intruders. In 2009 the $ 1. 6 billion allocation from the ARRA to SRS for site footprint reduction at SRS reopened the doors to HWCTR - this time for final decommissioning. Alternative studies concluded that the most environmentally safe, cost effective option for final decommissioning was to remove the reactor vessel, both steam generators, and all equipment above grade including the dome. The transfer coffin, originally above grade, was to be placed in the cavity vacated by the reactor vessel and the remaining below grade spaces would be grouted.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this master thesis {{have been to}} model and simulate oxy-combustion CO 2 capture in a cement plant. The model developed is a process simulation of the calcination process with varying degree of air in-leakage, where heat is supplied by combustion in an oxygen rich environment, followed by capture of the CO 2. The further gas separation after H 2 O condensation to achieve the required CO 2 quality was evaluated. In addition to the process simulations, a review of literature related to oxy-combustion CO 2 capture and cement production was performed, and an engineering evaluation of the necessary modifications to the cement plant conducted. A simulation model was built in Aspen HYSYS, and student Jelmer de Winter s project work was utilized as a starting point. The model was developed with the aim to achieve results comparable to a process model constructed by the European Cement Research Academy (ECRA) in 2009. The goal was to capture {{as much of the}} CO 2 as possible, and to achieve a CO 2 purity of minimum 95 mol-% after the CO 2 Compression and Purification Unit (CPU). CO 2 purity in the dry flue gas of ~ 85 mol % was achieved, with a CO 2 capture rate up to 96. 4 %. Five different air in-leakages (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % of total flue gas flow) were tested. The results showed that the CO 2 concentration in the flue gas decreased with increasing degree of air in-leakage. The decrease in CO 2 concentration causes an increase of the power consumption of the CO 2 CPU of ~ 2. 6 % per percentage point of air in-leakage, and the CO 2 capture rate was also reduced when the air in-leakage increased. These results agree well with results from previous oxy-combustion studies, and show the importance of minimizing air in-leakages in the cement plant. If oxy-combustion capture is to be utilized at a cement plant, some process modifications and additional equipment is required. An Air Separation Unit (ASU) is needed to provide almost pure oxygen for the combustion process. A Compression and Purification Unit (CPU) is also required, in order achieve the necessary CO 2 purity and transport conditions. When using oxy-combustion technology, both the material conversion in the cement kiln system and the operational specifications of the overall process are different from those in conventional kiln operation. However, research made by ECRA in 2012 showed that the negative impacts of oxy-combustion on the product quality seem to be negligible. Other necessary process modifications when retrofitting with oxy-combustion are news design of the kiln burner and the clinker cooler in the cement plant. In addition, prevention of excessive air in-leakage by improving sealing locations at the cement plant is necessary, as the simulation results show. This is possible e. g. by waste gas flushed systems, or by an improved <b>maintenance</b> of inspection <b>doors</b> and similar devices. The CPU is up to a certain point capable of handling changes in the flue gas composition at short-term inspections; however it limits its efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR) {{facility}} (Figure 1) {{was built}} in 1961, operated from 1962 to 1964, and {{is located in the}} northwest quadrant of the Savannah River Site (SRS) approximately three miles from the site boundary. The HWCTR facility is on high, well-drained ground, about 30 meters above the water table. The HWCTR was a pressurized heavy water test reactor used to develop candidate fuel designs for heavy water power reactors. It was not a defense-related facility like the materials production reactors at SRS. The reactor was moderated with heavy water and was rated at 50 megawatts thermal power. In December of 1964, operations were terminated and the facility was placed in a standby condition {{as a result of the}} decision by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission to redirect research and development work on heavy water power reactors to reactors cooled with organic materials. For about one year, site personnel maintained the facility in a standby status, and then retired the reactor in place. In 1965, fuel assemblies were removed, systems that contained heavy water were drained, fluid piping systems were drained, deenergized and disconnected and the spent fuel basin was drained and dried. The doors of the reactor facility were shut and it wasn't until 10 years later that decommissioning plans were considered and ultimately postponed due to budget constraints. In the early 1990 s, DOE began planning to decommission HWCTR again. Yet, in the face of new budget constraints, DOE deferred dismantlement and placed HWCTR in an extended surveillance and <b>maintenance</b> mode. The <b>doors</b> of the reactor facility were welded shut to protect workers and discourage intruders. The $ 1. 6 billion allocation from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to SRS for site clean up at SRS has opened the doors to the HWCTR again - this time for final decommissioning. During the lifetime of HWCTR, 36 different fuel assemblies were tested in the facility. Ten of these experienced cladding failures as operational capabilities of the different designs were being established. In addition, numerous spills of heavy water occurred within the facility. Currently, radiation and radioactive contamination levels are low within HWCTR with most of the radioactivity contained within the reactor vessel. There are no known insults to the environment, however with the increasing deterioration of the facility, the possibility exists that contamination could spread outside the facility if it is not decommissioned. An interior panoramic view of the ground floor elevation taken in August 2009 is shown in Figure 2. The foreground shows the transfer coffin followed by the reactor vessel and control rod drive platform in the center. Behind the reactor vessel is the fuel pool. Above the ground level are the polar crane and the emergency deluge tank at the top of the dome. Note the considerable rust and degradation of the components and the interior of the containment building. Alternative studies have concluded that the most environmentally safe, cost effective option for final decommissioning is to remove the reactor vessel, steam generators, and all equipment above grade including the dome. Characterization studies along with transport models have concluded that the remaining below grade equipment that is left in place including the transfer coffin will not contribute any significant contamination to the environment in the future. The below grade space will be grouted in place. A concrete cover will be placed over the remaining footprint and the groundwater will be monitored for an indefinite period to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The schedule for completion of decommissioning is late FY 2011. This paper describes the concepts planned in order to remove the major components including the dome, the reactor vessel (RV), the two steam generators (SG), and relocating the transfer coffin (TC) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Just as the {{aviation}} system {{is complex and}} interrelated, so is aviation safety. Aviation safety involves design of aircraft and airports, training of ground personnel and flight crew members' maintenance of aircraft, airfields, en route and terminal area navigation and communication facilities definition and implementation of Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) l air traffic control procedures and much more. Ultimately, every part of aviation has a safety aspect. No other transportation mode has its safety record so rigorously scrutinized. In part {{this is due to}} the general societal (and media) fascination with infrequent large disasters in part because U. S. legislators have a personal interest in air safety, as they rely upon aircraft for their seasonal commutes to Washington, and in part because people in the industry are aware that their paychecks ultimately depend on their customers' perception that travel by air is as safe as possible. (Various airlines still conduct aircraft familiarity classes for travelers who have a fear of flying, although as the younger generation of Americans gains experience with airlines, this particular phobia should become less prevalent.) Aside from the industry's self-enforcement attempts, the Federal government tries to assure safety of the traveling public through regulation. The National Transportation Safety Board (NISB) investigates all major air carrier accidents and subsequently makes safety recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) - which the FAA may or may not choose to accept. One of the long lasting standoffs in aviation safety is between the NPSB (backed by Congressional committees), whose sole concern is safety,and the FAA, which must also take the economics of safety regulations into account-unless it wishes to run into a buzzsaw of industry reaction every time it changes (or issues) a FAR. On the international side, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) issues technical rules affecting aviation safety, although such decisions as its upcoming ruling on twinjet aircraft over-water flights may be tinged with economic considerations as well. But for safety regulations, whether external or internal to the aerospace industry, to make any sense, they must be grounded, to some degree, in reality, i. e. they must be backed up by some technical, statistical, or economic factors which people can address on their own merits. The more quantitative the supporting data are for rule justifications or changes, the greater the likelihood is that the regulations will be successfully promulgated and accepted by industry. Thus aviation safety analysis came into existence. Most broadly stated, the purpose of safety analysis is to improve safety. The spectrum of analysis ranges from the investigative to the predictive. At one end of the spectrum is the after-the-fact investigation of accidents and a search for causes at the other end is the attempt to seek out likely causes (or, more typically, combination of causes) of system failure before the system is put into operation. However, the great quandary of aviation system analysis is the lack of sufficient data to make probabilistic statements - even while the goal of this analysis is the elimination of the very accidents that provide the data. Practitioners of classical statistics, who have grown up considering probability as the likely outcome of an event based on a large number of repeated trials, face a mental hurdle when asked to accept the concept that an event which has never taken place can nevertheless be assigned a 0. 95 probability of success. This is essentially the dichotomy between the investigative and the predictive ends of safety analysis - one is based on few accidents (but real accidents nonetheless), the other is based on more subjective probabilities of system (and subsystem) failures. (cont.) But safety analysts cannot throw up their hands and say that there is insufficient data after only one accident occurs and simply wait for the next one to happen. They must combine forces with their predictive brethren and attempt to head off the next accident. Only when this becomes the rule will aviation safety analysis rest on a sound base. Until this millennium, however, much remains to be done to improve safety analysis at each end of the analysis continuum, and also where the two occasionally intersect by chance. The investigative techniques depend on data: of incidents, accidents, near misses, and the like. The FAA, NASA, NSB, ICAO, aircraft manufacturers, airlines, etc., all maintain various types of data bases, most of which are incompatible (in the sense that they keep track of slightly different variables). A further complication is that some bases are computerized (different data base management systems are usually involved) and some are manual. The safety analyst, attempting to establish broad trends, is immediately faced with this incompatibility problem. Still, if the focus of the investigation is narrow enough (for example, a failure of a mechanical part on a specific aircraft), it may be possible to extract enough information from the various data bases to find a definitive cause. This is especially true when the cause of the incident is, in fact, mechanical - it is here that repeated failures should be noticed, isolated, and corrective action taken. Flight International (1984) provides a typical example that an alert safety analyst (or system) should have anticipated and caught: "Mis-rigging of the baggage door operating mechanism and the failure of the door warning arrangements to give adequate warning of door safety led to the fatal crash of a Dan-Air BAe 748 - 2 A in June 1981, according to the official report. The baggage door at the rear end of the cabin, blew out and became fixed on the tailplane, thus making the aircraft uncontrollable. Subsequently, the wings were overstressed and suffered structural failure. The condition of the door operating mechanism, says the report, made it impossible to lock the door fully using the outside handle. But it was probably by the outside handle that the door had last been closed. Crew checks failed to discover the fault because of "a combination of shortcomings in the design, construction, and <b>maintenance</b> of the <b>door</b> warning systems and the appearance of the visual indications". The report notes that there have been 35 instances of the 748 baggage door malfunction reported in the past". Very rarely do accidents have such obvious design-induced crew error precursors. Most accidents result from interactive causes, rather than one specific factor, and one of the causes is, invariably, a human being - the pilot, the air traffic controller, or the maintenance worker. These acts of human beings do not fit readily into data banks, there to be identified by a specific parts number, and the safety analyst must now switch to the other end of the spectrum and try to isolate the sequence of events that lead to "pilot error". These accidents involving human performance usually turn out to be oneof- a-kind events - and it should be the aim of the safety analyst to ensure that they remain so. Data unavailability and incompleteness, however, are always present and it is up to the skill (and luck) of the analyst to uncover the sequence of events leading to the accident. If a procedural error is found, it can be immediately correctedy more difficult are those amorphous incidents where it is not at all clear why there was human error. (If it were possible to obtain quantitative estimates of human performance, such as human error rates per task, it would be a simple matter to incorporate them into operational reliability equations to determine system reliability.) Just as the role of analysis of incident and defect reporting systems should be to find mechanical failures before they become accidents, the human incident reporting systems should be designed to cause humans to "confess" their incidents so that the analyst can isolate potentially dangerous trends and practices before they too become accidents. (The Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) managed by NASA is a step in the right direction.) It is the purpose of this report is to discuss various aspects of aviation safety analysis, ranging from general aviation to the public transportation system, and then to make some recommendations for improving the methodology of safety analysis. *April 1984 Includes bibliographical referencesSupported by Dept. of Transportation, Transportation Systems Cente...|$|R
