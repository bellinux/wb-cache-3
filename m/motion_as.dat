5|$|Camouflage is {{sometimes}} facilitated by <b>motion,</b> <b>as</b> in the leafy sea dragon and some stick insects. These animals complement their passive camouflage by swaying like plants, either preventing predators from detecting them, or appearing as {{something other than}} prey.|$|E
5|$|One {{strategy}} is to minimise actual <b>motion,</b> <b>as</b> when predators such as tigers stalk prey by moving very slowly and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids the need to camouflage motion.|$|E

5|$|As Kepler-8b orbits its star, it {{demonstrates}} the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, {{in which the}} host star's spectrum becomes red- and, later, blueshifted, as a body transits it. The identification of this effect established Kepler-8b as orbiting in a prograde <b>motion</b> (<b>as</b> opposed to retrograde motion, in which a planet orbits in a direction opposite of its star's rotation).|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

5|$|Here {{we can see}} how {{important}} the exemplary function of the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} months after Gebhard's conversion, two {{competing}} armies rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electoral territory {{in the destruction of}} the so-called Oberstift. Villages, abbeys and convents and several towns, were plundered and burned, by both sides; Linz am Rhein and Ahrweiler avoided destruction by swearing loyalty to Salentin. In the summer of 1583, Gebhard and Agnes took refuge, first at Vest in Vest Recklinghausen, a fief of the Electorate, and then in the Duchy of Westphalia, at Arensberg castle. In both territories, Gebhard set in <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> much of the Reformation as he could, although his soldiers indulged in a bout of iconoclasm and plundering.|$|E
5|$|Recurving to the northeast, Faye {{continued}} weakening due {{to strong}} wind shear, with dissipation as a tropical cyclone occurring {{on the afternoon}} of August27. The remnants of the typhoon initially continued moving east-northeast before stalling that evening. Faye began to reorganize, and was estimated to have re-attained typical storm strength on August28. Faye intensified slightly, nearly attaining typhoon intensity on August29, but this trend was short-lived due to increased wind shear. By August31, a building ridge to Faye's north led to a southwest <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> the system steadily weakened. However, Faye managed to maintain its identity as a weak tropical cyclone for several days, before finally dissipating on September3.|$|E

5|$|Sega AM2's {{first attempt}} in the genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown {{with the release}} of Virtua Fighter for the same {{platform}} the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.|$|E
5|$|The {{expanded}} surface coverage {{provided by}} Cassini has {{allowed for the}} identification of additional regions of smooth plains, particularly on Enceladus's leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> it orbits Saturn). Rather than being covered in low-relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region. This area is {{on the opposite side}} of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn's tides on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Fabian was disorganized and had restricted outflow. An eastward moving upper-level trough imparted a northeast <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> well as unfavorable wind shear. Despite the atmospheric conditions, Fabian intensified slightly to peak winds of 45mph (75km/h), although the strongest winds were located primarily {{east of the}} center. Late on October15, the storm moved over the Isle of Youth before crossing over western Cuba. By early on October16, the center was becoming difficult to locate on satellite imagery. The storm moved through the Florida Straits, passing just southeast of the Florida mainland and into the Bahamas. There was initial uncertainty whether Fabian would be absorbed by the approaching trough or maintain its separate identity. By late on October16, Fabian transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it was absorbed into the trough.|$|E

5|$|As a quickly {{organizing}} tropical cyclone, Francisco {{developed an}} eye feature late on October16 {{in the center}} of the convection, as outflow improved and an anticyclone formed aloft. Based on the improved structure, the JMA upgraded Francisco to a severe tropical storm at 18:00UTC on October16, followed by upgrading it to typhoon status at 06:00UTC the next day. Francisco slowed its forward <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> steering currents weakened, with a north-northwest drift beginning on October17 due to an extension of the subtropical ridge. By later that day, the typhoon had a well-defined eye 28km (17mi) across and surrounded by deep convection, while passing west of Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands. The track accelerated more to the northwest, steered by the strengthening ridge. With the eyewall convection become more distinct, Francisco continued to intensify, and the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon on October18. At 18:00UTC, the JMA estimated the typhoon attained peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). On October19, the JTWC upgraded Francisco to peak 1‑minute winds of 260km/h (160mph), the equivalent of a Category5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale; by that time, the eyewall contracted to just 19km (12mi) in diameter.|$|E
5|$|By 1697 the English Royal Navy had 323 warships, while Scotland {{was still}} {{dependent}} on merchantman and privateers. In the 1690s, two separate schemes for larger naval forces {{were put in}} <b>motion.</b> <b>As</b> usual, the larger part was played by the merchant community rather than the government. The first was the Darien Scheme to found a Scottish colony in Spanish controlled America. It was undertaken by the Company of Scotland, who created a fleet of five ships, including the Caledonia and the St. Andrew, built or chartered in Holland and Hamburg. It sailed to Isthmus of Darien in 1698, but the venture failed and only one ship returned to Scotland. In the same period {{it was decided to}} establish a professional navy for the protection of commerce in home waters during the Nine Years' War, with three purpose-built warships bought from English shipbuilders in 1696. These were the Royal William, a 32-gun fifth rate, and two smaller ships, the Royal Mary and the Dumbarton Castle, each of 24 guns and generally described as frigates. After the Act of Union in 1707, the Scottish Navy merged with that of England and the three vessels of the small Royal Scottish Navy were transferred to the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|Erika {{continued}} to the west-northwest, {{and in the}} early hours of September 4, an eye-like feature appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection. The feature was not an eye, though, as visible satellite imagery revealed a center partially exposed from the convection. Despite unfavorable wind shear, Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4, while located 530miles (850km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe. Deep convection re-developed near the center, and the hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west-northwestward. Hurricane Erika decelerated its forward <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> it approached the Lesser Antilles, and passed within 85miles (135km) of the islands as a Category 1 hurricane. An approaching trough weakened the subtropical ridge, resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast. On September 7, Erika began to quickly intensify, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125mph (205km/h) on September 8, while located about 350miles (565km) north of the Lesser Antilles. Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24hours before weakening over cooler waters.|$|E

5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} for relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but remanded the issue {{in order to give}} the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers filed a civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo {{filed a motion}} to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{created the}} game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use. The memory limits also prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were created at the pixel level and hand-animated. To animate the birds, Hendricks used Eadweard Muybridge's book Animals In <b>Motion</b> <b>as</b> a reference. Given the limited memory, {{she had to}} balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked gray for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the color palette as the developers had only 16colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character sprites, Newcomer finalized {{the look of the}} platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap, other sound effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} purple liquid forming the word 'JANET'. Jackson is then shown {{sitting on top of}} a planet in outer space, wearing a {{bodysuit}} adorned with jewelry, long ponytail, and mask. Various asteroids and dancers mounting planets in black latex attire and helmets are shown. Jackson flips her ponytail, revealing her face as cosmic dust is tossed about. Several dancers leap to other planets as Jackson descends to a cratered surface, performing abstract choreography with two dancers. Jackson jumps to another setting, shown in slow <b>motion</b> <b>as</b> the audio is filtered, landing on a white liquid surface with a crimson atmosphere. Backed by eight dancers, Jackson performs the song's choreography as various objects crash into the liquid. Jackson and the dancers fall into the liquid, with Jackson reemerging in a red catsuit. Jackson then performs a dance routine with six glowing spheres. The final sphere ascends upward as fourteen white liquid objects explode.|$|E
