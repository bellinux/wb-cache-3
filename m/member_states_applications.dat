Some traditionally influential <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in EU asylum politics, e. g.

Yet, governments of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> with small <b>application</b> numbers (among whom several Eastern European governments were particularly vocal) had incentives to undercut responsibility-sharing to avoid similar pressures. Having a better alternative to the potentially negotiated agreement, these governments successfully blocked the introduction of permanent refugee quotas. Besides explaining the absence of an effective response to one of the root causes of the asylum crisis (i. e. unequal strains) through asymmetrical interdependence, the article further develops Liberal Intergovernmentalist arguments and shows how national electorates influence positions taken by governments at the EU level when they are mobilised by right-wing populist parties...|$|R

40|$|Asylum is {{a common}} concern for both Northern and Southern European countries, {{although}} {{they look at the}} problem from different perspectives. Southern countries are in fact exposed to pressures of irregular migration and asylum seeking because of their geographical proximity to zones of instability and conflict and have to find ways to effectively filter mixed flows, providing international protection to those who need it and managing irregular migration. On the other hand, Northern European countries are more “protected” from irregular migration because of their geographical position but have been traditionally the preferred destinations of asylum seekers and hence face mostly the problem of properly processing applications rather than that of filtering them at their borders. There is an important gap, though, in the asylum acquis that needs to be addressed.

The {{invitation}} {{to speak on}} {{whether there is a}} latin model underlying the way human resources are managed in Spanish firms evoked in me a positive, albeit complex, reaction. Por one thing, the word "model" suggested a specific way of approaching and visualizing a complex situation before tackling it. The project of building up the European Community seems to qualify as a situation complex enough to call for different models and styles of going about it. Leaving aside other aspects of the problem, not all the EEC countries enjoy the same level of economic wellbeing.

40|$|Europeanised {{procedures}} of marketing authorisation for medicines {{are becoming increasingly}} important within EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> relative to national licensing systems. Since 1 January 1998 parallel national applications for drug approvals in EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have disappeared {{and it is only}} possible to market a new drug in more than one <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> via Europeanised procedures. Yet the implications of these Euro-procedures for public health remain little researched or debated. This paper discusses the health and safety implications of three key features of such Europeanisation, namely, the harmonisation of drug safety standards, the competition between the national regulatory agencies of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> for <b>application</b> fees from industry and the industrial capture of regulators within the regulatory process. Drawing on 42 interviews in Brussels, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK, the perspectives of European regulators, industrial scientists and regulatory affairs managers on these matters are analysed. While most industry sources believe that the new Euro-procedures will not harm public health, {{at least half of the}} regulators were concerned that European harmonisation of safety standards and competition between national agencies to accelerate approval times in order to attract industry fees pose a threat to public health and safety. National regulatory agencies find themselves in an internal EU market competing for regulatory fees from industry. This marketisation of regulation puts pressure on regulators to `sell themselves' as the fastest in reviewing and approving drugs. Swedish regulators displayed the greatest anxieties about these matters. Unfortunately, we found it impossible to verify these regulators' worries or industry's optimism because of the secrecy that attends these Euro-procedures. Thus, a situation obtains in which a significant number of regulators are warning that the EU medicines licensing systems, which are being put in place, might well compromise safety, yet these systems are deficient in their capacity to accommodate independent scrutiny, upon which informed policy changes could be based...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} fundamental freedoms of the EC Treaty prescribe most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment. The right to MFN treatment concerns the issue whether taxpayers resident in one <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> can “cherry-pick” the most beneficial tax treaty available to other taxpayers. Two issues of fundamental impor-tance are {{examined in this}} thesis. First, whether a resident of a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (A) who receives income in another <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (B), can claim from that state, the most beneficial tax treaty available to a resident of a third <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (C). Second, whether a resident can claim from his state of residence (A), the same tax treatment as provided in a tax treaty concluded by his state of residence and another <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (C), when this tax treaty provides better treatment in terms of avoiding double taxa-tion {{in the state of}} residence than the tax treaty applicable to the source of income (B). The ECJ has held that discrimination arises only through the application of different rules to comparable situations or the application of the same rule to different situa-tions. The current state of EC law prohibits unequal treatment of residents and non-residents as well as residents who have exercised their rights to free movement in comparison to residents who have not. The condition is that they must be considered to be in comparable situations and that there is no objective difference to justify the difference in treatment. The ECJ has so far not ruled on the MFN issue. It is there-fore uncertain as to whether <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are obligated to treat; 1) different non-resident taxpayers equally and, 2) whether <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are prohibited from treat-ing their own residents differently when they exercise their rights to free movement in different <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> This thesis identifies the requirements for the application of MFN treatment and ex-amines in which tax treaty provisions it is possible to apply MFN treatment. The ECJ, has in its case law, concluded that the application of tax treaties must be exer-cised in accordance EC law. It can be argued that a well-functioning internal market cannot allow bilateral tax treaties to provide preferential tax treatment to residents of one <b>Member</b> <b>State,</b> while denying it to residents of the remaining <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> However, the <b>application</b> of MFN treatment could have far-reaching ramifications on the Member States’ existing tax treaty network.

40|$|The Brussels I Regulation ((EU) No 1215 / 2010) {{governs the}} {{division}} of jurisdiction between the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> of the European Union and provides for the circulation of judgments within the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in civil and commercial matters. Arbitration is excluded from {{the scope of the}} Regulation, and the Regulation should not affect the application of the New York Convention in the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The arbitration exclusion reflects a traditional understanding that the systems of international civil procedure and international arbitration are expected to function autonomously. Despite this, the two systems occasionally collide as parties to a dispute attempt to initiate parallel court and arbitral proceedings. Further, if parallel court and arbitral proceedings on the same matter and between the same parties cannot be prevented, they may result in two at least partially overlapping and conflicting decisions. This study concerns first whether parallel court and arbitral proceedings can be prevented in ways that are compatible with the Regulation and the New York Convention. The second research question concerns on which grounds a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> court is able to refuse recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment that conflicts with an arbitral award. The study is based on doctrinal research, and the objectives of the study are twofold. First, the study examines the prevailing interpretation of the Regulation’s interface with arbitration and secondly, the study aims at presenting a recommendation regarding the application of the Regulation in case a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> court is requested to enforce a judgment conflicting with an arbitral award. Regarding the first research question, the study examines the availability of measures restricting or discouraging parallel court and arbitral proceedings. The prohibition of court-ordered anti-suit injunctions established in the case-law of the CJEU under the old Brussels I Regulation ((EC) No 44 / 2001) remains applicable under the recast Regulation. Further, the assessment of whether <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> courts are permitted to order damages for breach of arbitration agreement appears to give a negative answer as such damages are argued to be contrary to the principle of mutual trust between <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> courts. On the contrary, the recognition and enforcement of anti-suit injunctions ordered by arbitrators and arbitral awards ordering damages for breach of arbitration agreement appear to be outside the scope of the Regulation but national laws of the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> strongly limit the availability and enforceability of such measures. This leads to a conclusion that parallel court and arbitral proceedings cannot be effectively prevented under the Regulation. As a main rule, the decision which is rendered first is to be recognised and enforced in other <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> on the <b>application</b> of a party regardless of any pending parallel proceedings. The Regulation particularly prescribes that it shall not affect the application of the New York Convention, which has led to a discussion concerning the possibility of anti-enforcement injunctions directed against the enforcement of a judgment that has been rendered prior to an arbitral award on the same matter and between the same parties. Such injunctions appear, however, both incompatible with the Regulation and unnecessary with regard to the unaffected application of the New York Convention. If a Brussels I regime judgment has been given first, it can be enforced in accordance with the Regulation. The same applies to an arbitral award under the New York Convention if the recognition and enforcement of the award is sought first. The Regulation does not address on which grounds a <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> court may refuse the enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment in case the enforcement is requested only after a conflicting arbitral award is recognised and enforced in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> addressed. It appears clear that the enforcement must be refused in such situation but, on the other hand, the grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment are exhaustively listed in the Regulation. The study discusses four alternative grounds for refusing the enforcement. It is concluded that the enforcement of a conflicting Brussels I regime judgment should be refused on the grounds of being contrary to the public policy in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> addressed since the national public policy cannot accommodate recognition and enforcement of two irreconcilable decisions...|$|R

There is, in fact only one <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (Denmark) that does not have a reduced rate of VAT.|$|R
40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R
