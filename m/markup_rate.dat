In this paper, we use the agent-based modeling of a modular economy to study the <b>markup</b> <b>rate</b> dynamics in a duopolistic setting. We find that there are multiple equilibria in the market, characterized by either a fixed point or a limit cycle.

40|$|To combat {{global warming}} several European {{countries}} have introduced carbon taxes. The latter imply {{a shift in}} comparative advantage, depending {{on the level of}} the carbon tax {{and the degree to which}} various industries differ in terms of emission intensity. There has been extensive empirical work on the economic adjustment induced by environmental taxes in open economies under the assumptions of constant unit costs and perfect competition. What has been largely ignored, however, is that these shifts in comparative advantage may be significantly reinforced under imperfect competition where changes in market structure affect both production costs as well as <b>markup</b> <b>rates.</b> Under conditions of imperfect competition with free entry and exit, the number and size of firms and, hence, their ability to exploit economies of scale depend on the elasticity of market demand. If market demand is composed of domestic demand and export demand, each characterized by a different demand elasticity, the elasticity of total market demand will depend on the shares of domestic sales and sales abroad. To the extent that environmental taxes lead to a shift in comparative advantage, these shares will change, and so will firm size and unit costs, i. e. economies of scale.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} more channels {{through which}} the optimal patent life is determined in a R&D-based endogenous growth model that permits growth of new varieties of consumer goods over time. Its modeling features include an endogenous hazard rate facing incumbent monop-olists, the prevalence of research congestion, and the aggregate welfare importance of product differentiation. As a result, a patent’s effective life is endogenized and less than its legal life. The model is calibrated to a global economy {{with a set of}} baseline parameter values. Under the benchmark patent length of 20 years, the calibrated model can deliver along the balanced growth path a plausible innovation rate of 2. 84 % per year and an economy-wide <b>markup</b> <b>rate</b> of 1. 15.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of the Chilean economy since the mid 1980 s, has certainly been successful in macroeconomic terms. In fact, the restoration of growth and the correction of external imbalances after the severe economic crises of 1982 - 83 {{has taken place in}} a macroeconomic environment of moderate inflation, without major fiscal imbalances, exports have expanded significantly and foreign debt burden indicators have improved. However, distributive and poverty related indicators point to pending problems. The major challenge, therefore, is to maintain sustainable rates of economic growth, address the social issues of poverty reduction and improve income distribution patterns, while preserving macroeconomic and financial stability. The paper is organized as follows : Section I is an introduction. Section II presents a formal macroeconomic model that identifies major constraints (external, savings and fiscal) that shape the scope for growth. In Section III the model is numerically calibrated with parameters of the economy and three policy exercises are explored : i) an increase in public spending; ii) a reduction of interest payments of 3 % of potential GDP; and iii) a reduction of the <b>markup</b> <b>rate</b> of 4 %.

40|$|A common {{occurrence}} {{in many countries}} is that policy outcomes differ from the official objectives of the policy directives. A good example {{can be found in}} China. In 1994, the fertilizer market in China underwent a significant change. In response to strong complaints from farmers in a number of regions about shortages and substantial price increases, the central government set the <b>markup</b> <b>rate</b> for fertilizer as it moved from fertilizer plants to farmers and granted the Agricultural Means of Production Corporations(AMPCs) a monopoly role as the supplier of fertilizer. The results of the 1994 policy reforms were not as expected. Controls on maximum retail prices failed to produce the desired effect and prices for agricultural inputs continued to increase by large margins. In both 1995 and 1996, the actual fertilizer price greatly exceeded the government-mandated price (Xiao, 1998). Nor did enterprises fully follow the controls in other respects. Some broke the allowed limit of 10 percent for products to be sold directly by fertilizer producers, and some trading agencies overcharged by adding more transport and handling expenses than were allowed (Zhou, 1996; Zhang and Ji, 1995; MOA, 1996). In addition, although the AMPCwas to be the sole trader, the private traders in many provinces continued to play a significant role – the market share of the private traders ranged from approximately 5 percent in Yunnan province to nearly 25 percent in Shaanxi (Xiao, 1998). Thus, while private trading was not officially sanctioned, a well-defined grey market clearly existed in which private dealers purchased fertilizer from the AMPC and retailed it to farmers.

In this paper I investigate the effects of exchange rate changes on firm investment through the export channel and imported input channel using U. S. manufacturing firm level data for 1998 - 2007. For this study, I create a 'small' sample, where the export ratio is 'export to sales ratio' obtained from financial statements, and a 'large' sample using industry level 'export to shipment ratio' as a proxy for the 'export to sales ratio'. Considering the possible dynamic panel bias problem in the empirical model, I use the 'difference' GMM and the 'system' GMM for the econometric methods. The findings of my study are as follows: appreciation (depreciation) of domestic currency reduces (increases) firm investment through the exports channel. Also appreciation (depreciation) of the domestic currency increases (reduces) firm investment through the imported input channel. Firms with low <b>markup</b> <b>rates</b> are more sensitive in their investment responses to the movement in exchange rate changes both in terms of the exports channel and imported input channel. Low cash flow firms are more sensitive in terms of investment responses to the exchange rate changes than high cash flow firms. Also smaller firms are more responsive in their investments to exchange rate changes than larger firms. The findings on the role of cash flow and firm size indicate that U. S. firms are exposed to widespread financial constraints. With regard to the role of leverage, overall estimation results imply that leverage does not affect the relationship between the exchange rate changes and firm investment. In most of the results in this paper, the coefficients associated with the export channel are more significant than those of the imported input channel. This suggests that firms' responses to the movement of exchange rates are more sensitive through the export channel than through the imported input channel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In 2009, China {{implemented}} the National Essential Medicines Policies (NEMPs) {{as part of}} a new round of medical system reforms. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of the NEMPs on primary healthcare institutions and discuss the roles of the policies in the new healthcare reforms of China. Methods The study selected a total of six representative provinces of China, generating a sample of 261 primary healthcare institutions from August to December in 2010. A questionnaire survey developed by the study team was distributed to all of the primary healthcare institutions. Nine indicators from three dimensions as the outcome variables were used and calculated to evaluate the impacts of implementation of policies. All of the outcome variables were tested using independent-samples T test between the treatment group (with the NEMPs implemented) and the control group (without the NEMPs implemented). Results The ratio of drug sales and institution revenues at primary healthcare institutions was 42. 99 % in the treatment group, which was significantly lower than the control group (53. 90 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), while the ratio of financial subsidies of the treatment group was shown to be higher (30. 78 % VS 20. 82 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 01). The rate of healthcare workers income growth was greater in the treatment group (15. 35 % VS 5. 79 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 006). The treatment group exhibited higher outpatient and emergency visits per month in urban areas (2720 VS 1763 visits per month) and rural areas (3830 VS 3633), and higher prescriptions per month in urban areas (2048 VS 1025, p[*]=[*] 0. 005) and rural areas (3806 VS 3251). The treatment group used more essential medicines and received greater income from essential medicines while the drug price <b>markup</b> <b>rate</b> was lower. Conclusions The NEMPs appear to affect the transformation of the operation mechanisms of primary healthcare institutions, the improvement of the mechanisms for government investment, and the healthcare pricing system. Meanwhile, the gaps between urban and rural areas need to be addressed. In conclusion, the NEMPs of China are instrumental to the aim of providing basic healthcare services to every citizen...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic model of {{capacity}} utilization and growth which takes into due account the joint {{determination of the}} international competitiveness (measured by the real exchange rate) and functional income distribution. It follows that how distribution, capacity utilization and growth vary with the real exchange rate depends on the cause {{of change in the}} latter (nominal exchange <b>rate</b> or <b>markup).</b> Over the medium run, the nominal exchange <b>rate</b> (<b>markup)</b> changes when the actual real exchange rate differs from the level preferred by the government (capitalists). While there is a medium-run equilibrium in which capitalists and the government come to share a preferred real exchange rate, the economy may not converge to it. In fact, when the government is primarily concerned with preserving workers’ share in income when manipulating the nominal exchange rate, a limit cycle obtains: the economy experiences endogenous cyclical fluctuations in the real exchange rate, distribution, capacity utilization and growth that resemble the experience of several developing countries. Thus, growth regressions featuring the real exchange rate should include distribution in the vector of control variables, which has not been the case. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} model of {{discrimination}} {{in the market for}} mortgages. The model explains accepted loan applications and simultaneously determines loan sizes and interest rates. A competitive and a discriminating monopoly version of the model are proposed. Offered interest rates and loan sizes are a function of observable borrower characteristics. The competitive model rests on a marginal condition, reflecting contract optimality, to which a zero-profit condition is added. In contrast, the discriminating monopoly maximizes profits under a borrower participation constraint, reflecting the availability of a rental market as an outside option. Each version of the model is a bivariate, nonlinear model, and is estimated by standard maximum likelihood methods. The data used for estimation is a sample of clients of a French network of mortgage lenders. We show the presence of “social discrimination” in the data, the loan conditions depending not only on the borrower's wage and down payment, but also on the borrower's occupational status. Abnormally high risk premia in the competitive version of the model suggest the presence of market power, justifying an attempt at estimating its monopolistic version. The discriminating monopoly model estimates show that the borrowers' price-elasticity of demand for housing varies with occupational status, and is inversely related with the lender's interest <b>rate</b> <b>markups.</b> This confirms that the lender exploits structural differences in the preferences to discriminate, as predicted by standard theories...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{continues}} where Kemmerer and Lu (2008) left off, and {{explores the}} relationship between royalty rates and market structure among industries. Economists have studied innovation, R&D, and market structure for decades, and also have investigated patent licensing methods across industries. However, {{there is very little}} research on the relationships between market structure and royalty rates. In this paper, we first show that royalty rates are positively associated with price markup, a market power and market performance measure, and then move to explore {{the relationship between}} royalty rates and market structure. Two complementary sets of market structure factors are discussed. The first one is technology intensiveness or technology opportunity, on which we demonstrate that technology intensive sectors tend to have higher royalty rates than other sectors. The second set covers the traditional measures of barriers of entry. Regression analysis reveal that royalty rates exhibit a negative linear relationship with two measures of barriers to entry, the ratio of sales to capital invested and the ratio of sales to operating costs. Finally, cluster analysis is conducted to reveal group pattern among the industries studied, using royalty <b>rate,</b> <b>markup,</b> and the ratio of sales to capital invested as variables. The analysis yields four distinguishable groups of industries, and the characteristics of each group are discussed. Cluster analysis also corroborates our conclusion that while both traditional barriers of entry and technology intensiveness contribute to determining market power, one set of factors can exert more dominant and pronounced impact than the other one in a specific industry, as evidenced by media and internet/software sectors, in which market power is mainly created by their technology and know-how embedded in legally-protected IP...|$|R
40|$|We {{quantify}} {{the extent to}} which buyers received false information about the true quality of assets in contractual disclosures by intermediaries during the sale of mortgages in the $ 2 trillion nonagency market. We construct two measures of misrepresentation of asset quality [...] misreported occupancy status of borrower and misreported second liens [...] by comparing the characteristics of mortgages disclosed to the investors at the time of sale with actual characteristics of these loans at that time that are available in a dataset matched by a credit bureau. About one out of every ten loans has one of these misrepresentations. These misrepresentations {{are not likely to be}} an artifact of matching error between datasets that contain actual characteristics and those that are reported to investors. At least part of this misrepresentation likely occurs within the boundaries of the financial industry (i. e., not by borrowers). The propensity of intermediaries to sell misrepresented loans increased as the housing market boomed. These misrepresentations are costly for investors, as ex post delinquencies of such loans are more than 60 % higher when compared with otherwise similar loans. Lenders seem to be partly aware of this risk, charging a higher interest rate on misrepresented loans relative to otherwise similar loans, but the interest <b>rate</b> <b>markup</b> on misrepresented loans does not fully reflect their higher default risk. Using measures of pricing used in the literature, we find no evidence that these misrepresentations were priced in the securities at their issuance. A significant degree of misrepresentation exists across all reputable intermediaries involved in sale of mortgages. The propensity to misrepresent seems to be largely unrelated to measures of incentives for top management, to quality of risk management inside these firms or to regulatory environment in a region. Misrepresentations on just two relatively easy-to-quantify dimensions of asset quality could result in forced repurchases of mortgages by intermediaries up to $ 160 billion...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 studies price {{discrimination}} in advertising sales to Political Action Committees (PACs) in the 2012 Presidential Election. These groups have grown rapidly - expenditures neared $ 500 {{million in the}} 2012 presidential election - and their effect on elections depends on regulation and its interaction with imperfect competition. While the government tightly proscribes station behavior vis-a-vis official campaigns, it does not protect Political Actions Committees (PACs). Television stations potentially wield considerable power to shape access to the electorate. Using novel data on prices paid for individual ad spots from the 2012 presidential election, I find PACs pay a 40 % <b>markup</b> above campaign <b>rates,</b> {{and that there are}} differences in prices paid by Republican and Democratic groups for indistinguishable purchases. I then develop and estimate a model of political demand for ad spots, exploiting misalignments of state borders and media markets to address potential price endogeneity. Findings indicate that pricing to PACs reflects buyer willingness-to-pay for viewer demographics. Chapter 2 investigates spillover effects of regulation protecting campaign advertising purchases, a most favored nation clause. This regulation guarantees campaigns the lowest rate received by any advertiser, incentivizing stations to sell less airtime to commercial advertisers to buoy campaign prices. Using spot-level data on presidential campaign advertising purchases from 2012, I find that campaign ad prices drop following the institution of rate regulation (sixty days preceding election day). I then develop a model of station {{price discrimination}}, and estimate the effect of regulation on campaign and commercial prices relative to a counterfactual without regulation.
