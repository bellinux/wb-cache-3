30|$|Our results {{give some}} {{support to the}} {{hypotheses}} that override, punish, and neglect are maladaptive emotion socialization strategies of PE. We theorized {{that they may be}} less optimal maternal socialization strategies for adolescent’s PE as they may lead the adolescent to experience fewer PE and/or less intense or durable. Indeed, we found that adolescents that perceived parents as expressing disapproval for the expression of PE (punish), ignoring that expression (neglect), or trying to distract the adolescent from that PE (override) also perceived parents as using harsher parenting. More overprotection was also {{associated with the use of}} punish and override; being less emotionally warm was also related with the use of punish and neglect. Interestingly, we found a non-significant association between override and emotional warmth, whereas a negative association was expected. This result does not support our hypothesis that override is a maladaptive emotion socialization strategy in all circumstances. In some situations, these reactions may be adequate: for an overjoyed adolescent that was allowed to go out with friends, parents may adaptively ask the adolescent to calm down, in order to make her/him focus on homework. A limitation of this study was that item 10 in override of overjoy (…bought <b>me</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> liked) <b>did</b> not contribute to the factor and had to be removed. A possible explanation is that buying a gift is a pleasurable experience, not associated with the downregulation of positive affect. Future work using this instrument could benefit from rewriting this item, but also item 14 as it has also been excluded from the model of neglect because of low factor loadings. This may be the case because this item describes parental maladaptive behavior (…did not pay attention to my overjoy) while the other two items are positive reactions (…took time to focus on me). In the case of the emotion of overjoy, this may also be connected with the low internal consistency of the scale, the only regarding overjoy.|$|R
