To this end, a study was done to evaluate and compare the conventional insecticides with <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> <b>spray</b> (MOS) for the control of citrus pests and adverse effects in citrus orchards in Mazandaran province.

For all experiments, <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> (Argenfrut®) was <b>sprayed</b> on sweet orange plants at 1 % concentration. Landing-permanence and oviposition were assessed using choice and non-choice tests. For the first parameter, 50 adult psyllids were released {{in the center of}} the screen house (5 mx 2. 5 mx 2 m) (n = 10) and the number of psyllids/plant at different time intervals were counted. For the oviposition trial, which was conducted under laboratory conditions, 20 psyllids were confined in a cage to oviposit (n = 10) and after three days the number of eggs/plant were counted. The effect of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> on psyllid mortality was assessed by confining 10 adult psyllids per plant (n= 4) with fully expanded mature leaves after spray.

Differences were found among the various concentrations of MSO {{in the number of}} mines and live larva per leaf, sampled 5 days after the application of 3 sprays at an interval of 5 days. <b>Mineral</b> <b>spray</b> <b>oil</b> applied at a rate of ≥ 0. 65 % in water, showed no significant differences when compared with Confidor, and Dursban.

Generally, a concentration of ≥ 0. 65 % MSO in water caused a significant damage reduction. However, by reducing the MSO concentration, the rate of control was decreased. In another field experiment conducted in mature citrus orchards, the effect of two pest management types (applying just MSO vs. usage of synthetic pesticides) on the activity of P. citrella, was evaluated.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{influence}} of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> {{on the field}} spread of the aphid-borne bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) in bean was studied in 1972 and 1973. <b>Oil</b> <b>sprays</b> failed to significantly reduce virus spread in the 1972 BYMV experiment. However, the data did suggest that {{the efficiency of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> could be greatly improved by timing the applications to periods of peak aphid activity. Several factors were identified which could have contributed to the failure of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> to reduce the incidence of BYMV in 1972. An excessive time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application resulted in a considerable amount of virus spread within all of the plots before any <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were applied. In addition, some of the treatments were subject to a disproportionate number of the dispersing aphid population which resulted in non-uniform virus spread throughout the study area. And all treatments were exposed for an excessive length of time to the gladioli or primary virus reservoir. As a result, the <b>oil</b> <b>sprayed</b> areas were subject to extreme pressure from the secondary and primary virus reservoirs. Results of the 1973 BYMV field experiment clearly indicate that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> can protect bean plants against spread of BYMV under field conditions. A number of changes in the experimental design were responsible for the overall success of the 1973 experiment. The time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application was eliminated. This change prevented an excessive amount of virus spread early in the season, thus eliminating the high, non-differential virus spread that results when {{there is a lack of}} virus protection early in the season. And the exposure period of beans to the gladioli, primary virus source, was substantially reduced so that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were directed against the secondary virus source and not both primary and secondary virus sources. Harvest data collected during 1973 indicated that an increase in plant weight may not occur as a result of virus reduction by <b>oil</b> <b>sprays.</b> The data suggest that repeated applications of oil may bring about a physiological response resulting in an increase in plant weight unrelated to virus reduction...|$|R

Dutcher, Ely and Honeywell (1927) fed rats limited amounts of vitamin A and varying amounts of <b>mineral</b> <b>oil</b> and found that growth of rats was prevented when the oil was added to the diet.
