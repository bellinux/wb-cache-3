Using too heavy a line on too light on a rod, or vice versa, will dramatically affect casting performance. It may also permanently warp the rod blank. Generally speaking, you can safely go one line weight more or less (i.e. using an 8wt or 10wt line on a 9wt rod). There are also rods stamped with a range of weights. For example, a rod may be rated 7-8wt. This indicates the rod is designed for either a 7 or 8 weight fly line. There are also some rods rated for wider ranges (e.g. 8-9-10wt). The drawback to <b>multi-rated</b> rods is that compromises in flexibility or action are made in order to accommodate a wider range of line weights. For example, a rod rated for 8-9 weight line will be slightly stiffer than a straight 8wt but slightly softer than a straight 9wt rod.

Some {{research has demonstrated that}} HRM processes positively influence organisational-level performance, but these effects are often examined in isolation, without exploring how they may influence performance via interactions with other sub-system processes. In this study, we develop and test a model of how HRM processes influence hospitals' clinical performance (continuity of quality patient care) in the context of processes emerging from three other hospital sub-systems (strategic and operations management, information management, and health and safety). Utilising rigorous <b>multi-rated,</b> industry-based hospital accreditation data relating to 465 Australian hospitals, we first evaluated the construct validity, reliability and discriminant validity of the data as being reflective of the clinical performance outcome, and the enacted processes emerging from four distinct hospital sub-systems. In testing the hypotheses, we found that in the context of management, information management, and health and safety processes, the effective functioning of HRM processes significantly influenced the continuity of quality patient care. There was also further evidence that the effectiveness of HRM processes significantly moderated the relationships between: (1) strategic and operations management processes; and (2) health and safety processes and the continuity of quality patient care. On the basis of these findings, we argue that the simultaneous and interdependent influence of multiple processes should be considered when examining the influence of the effective functioning of HRM processes on organisational-level performance in hospitals.

40|$|Recommender systems, {{also known}} as {{recommender}} engines, have become an important research area and are now being applied in various fields. In addition, the techniques behind the recommender systems have been improved over the time. In general, such systems help users to find their required products or services (e. g. books, music) through analyzing and aggregating other users’ activities and behavior, mainly in form of reviews, and making the best recommendations. The recommendations can facilitate user’s decision making process. Despite wide literature on the topic, using multiple data sources of different types as the input has not been widely studied. Recommender systems can benefit from the high availability of digital data to collect the input data of different types which implicitly or explicitly help the system to improve its accuracy.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 For today’s {{ubiquitous}} portable devices, innovative {{integrated circuits}} with high performance yet very low power are necessary. As these devices {{are used to}} communicate and sense real world signals in the environment, analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and systems are the key interface circuits needed to digitize the sensed information and they represent {{one of the most}} challenging aspects in the overall design. Fundamentally, {{this is due to the}} inherent imperfections in integrated circuit process technology because they cause degradations in the ADC performance. In this thesis, noise-shaping techniques are used to mitigate analog inaccuracies such as non-linearity and mismatch. These approaches are applied to ΔΣ analog-to-digital based systems. Two systems are presented in this work. The first is an architectural technique to highlight the benefits of low power, highly digital VCO-based analog-to-digital converters. It overcomes the limited SFDR due to VCO non-linearity. In this approach, a multi-loop delta-sigma (ΔΣ) ADC architecture is introduced that has a <b>multi-rated</b> VCO-based ADC in its second stage. A custom IC prototype of this architecture fabricated in a 130 nm 1 P 8 M CMOS process achieves 77. 3 dB signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over a 4 MHz signal bandwidth with a power consumption of 13. 8 mW. The second system includes a new dynamic element matching (DEM) algorithm in the reference generating circuit of a ΔΣ modulator. The most basic DEM algorithm known as data weighted averaging (DWA) increases in-band noise due to intermodulation between the DEM tone and quantization error. In the proposed technique, by completing an integer multiple of the DEM cycles within one ΣΔ cycle, the DEM tone is moved to an integer multiple of the ΣΔ sample rate. As a result, with no additional circuitry or power consumption, the new DEM technique prevents any increase in the in-band noise. To prove its effectiveness, the DEM algorithm is embedded in a temperature-to-digital Converter (TDC) which requires a high precision reference. This TDC consists of a BJT-based temperature sensor followed by a 2 nd-order feed-forward ΔΣ ADC as a readout circuit. It is fabricated in an 180 nm 1 P 5 M CMOS process consuming 5 µA current from 1. 4 V supply voltage achieving resolution of 25 mK/Conversion...|$|R

H 577 P COMP 2015 Wangxxii, 123 pages :illustrations; 30 cmWith {{the growing}} {{interconnectedness}} {{of the world}} and advances in transportation and communication, an increasing number of people are travelling as independent tourists, putting together their own itineraries and activities from information researched from social media. Moreover, a growing number of travellers post reviews and give ratings online to share experiences and opinions, which have become one important source of information. However, the explosive growth of travel information and the proliferation of uninformative, biased or false information make it very time-consuming and challenging for travellers to find helpful and credible information. Recommender systems can assist travellers in managing the information available and facilitate their travel decisions. There have been some recommender systems developed in the tourism domain. However, these systems usually apply collabo-rative filtering-based, content-based or knowledge-based approaches, which require historical ratings, description of items, or extra knowledge about users' needs. It is difficult for them to generate reliable recommendation when the ratings, description as well as the knowledge are insufficient, and they cannot make recommendations when there is no such information. In the tourism domain, ratings, description and knowledge available are much fewer than the equivalent for books or movies. Therefore, they usually suffer from the sparseness and cold-start issues. Addressing the sparseness issue, we apply rating inference method to augment ratings for rating-based recommender systems. We investigate several clustering approaches to do sentiment analysis on travel reviews to generate numerical ratings. The clustering methods include K-means, co-clustering, hierarchical co-clustering, and six state-of-the-art traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms. Moreover, we compare different features extracted from reviews to choose more suitable features for each clustering method. Experimental results show that hierarchical algorithms (traditional hierarchical clustering and hierarchical co-clustering) with stepwise exploiting strategy lead to more accurate clustering results than non-hierarchical algorithms (K-means and co-clustering). Especially, hierarchical co-clustering method gets better clusters than all of the other clustering methods, no matter what features it uses. From the investigation, we also found {{that it is difficult to}} get very accurate <b>multi-rating</b> clusters by using these unsupervised approaches. Rating inference on reviews can augment ratings for recommendation, but it is not helpful for solving the cold-start issue, since a new item or traveller has no review. Therefore, a demographic recommender system is applied to the recommendation of attractions to overcome the cold-start problem. Our system categorizes travellers using their demographic information and then makes recommendations based on demographic classes. Its advantage is that the history of ratings, description of attractions and extra knowledge are not necessary, so even a new traveller can obtain recommendations. Different machine learning methods are adopted to produce prediction of ratings, so as to determine whether these approaches and demographic information are suitable for providing recommendations. Our preliminary results show that these machine learning methods and demographic information can be used to predict travellers' ratings on attractions. But only limited accuracy can be achieved using demographic information alone. Although recommender systems are able to provide travellers with recom-mendations, most of them make recommendations based on existing ratings or reviews, which may contain uninformative, biased or even false information. Recommendations will be not so helpful or reliable if the recommender systems generate them based on these unreliable information. For instance, TripAdvisor, the world's largest travel community supplies a recommender system which can ranks reviews on an attraction for travellers based on posting dates or ratings. Travellers can then read some top ranked reviews on the attraction. However, there may be some incredible information involved in the top ranked reviews. Hence, it is critical to help travellers seek credible information from such amounts of travel information. Most current work applies mainly qualitative approaches to investigate the credibility of reviews or reviewers without quantitative evaluation. This thesis presents a method that quantifies the credibility of reviewers, to help travellers find more credible information. We propose an Impact Index to quantify the credibility of reviewers by simultaneously evaluating the expertise and trustworthiness based on the number of reviews posted by reviewers and the number of helpful votes received by those reviews. Furthermore, Impact Index is enhanced into the Exposure-Impact Index by considering in addition the number of destinations on which the reviewer posted reviews. Our experimental results show that both methods perform better than the state-of-the-art method in discovering credible reviewers. To further examine the effectiveness and applicability of Impact Index and Exposure-Impact Index, we evaluate them on the data sets collected from two rather different online travel communities: TripAdvisor, the world{ 174 }s largest travel community, and Qunar, one of the most popular travel communities in China, by taking into consideration the differences between these two travel communities, such as different languages, scales and data distributions. Experimental results show that both Impact Index and Exposure-Impact Index lead to results more consistent with human judgments. They can not only discover more credible reviewers, but also provide better ranking of reviewers, which manifest their effectiveness and applicability across diverse travel communities.
