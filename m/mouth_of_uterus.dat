50|$|Lachapelle is {{credited}} with several worthwhile innovations in patient care and midwives' training. It is known that she tried to exclude the hordes of observers from the delivery room, that she advised immediate repair of a torn perineum, that in cases of placenta praevia she quickly dilated the <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>uterus</b> with tampons and extracted the infant by turning it, thus saving two lives. She also invented a method of deftly turning a face or oblique presentation so that the infant could be born with forceps, and of replacing a protruding arm or shoulder {{before it was too}} late.|$|R

There is a growing rate of venous blood flow <b>of</b> lower <b>uterus</b> segment and cervix <b>of</b> <b>uterus</b> at rest as well as at peak of contractions. Conclusion. Veins are transformed into structures similar to lacunae at the physiological course of preliminary period.

40|$|In {{inversion}} <b>of</b> <b>uterus,</b> fundus <b>of</b> <b>uterus</b> {{comes down}} in reverse direction, through the cervix, exposing endometrial surface. Diagnosis <b>of</b> inversion <b>of</b> <b>uterus</b> is often difficult. Cervix is drawn up and vaginal portion of cervix {{would not be}} palpable.

40|$|Goal of {{this thesis}} was {{development}} of {{interactive graphic editor}} for graphic representation, examinationh and annotating of records of electrohysterogram (electromyogram <b>of</b> <b>uterus).</b> We developed a graphic user interface LANNOT, which displays signals of records, allows manual and semi-automatic setting, deleting and examining of annotations, full editing of accompanied clinical information, generation of scripts and generation of new procedures. The types of the annotations should regard true contractions, other electrical activities <b>of</b> <b>uterus,</b> baby movements, and noise of signals. The interface was developed using Netbeans IDE tool to develop interactive graphic user interfaces. The developed editor is based on object-action paradigm. During designing of the editor, we followed Nielsen's principles of interface design and commonly accepted guidelines of user interface design, while the most important usability dimension was efficiency. The developed editor will be used by expert obstetricians during their clinical praxis.
