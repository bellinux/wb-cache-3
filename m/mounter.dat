25|$|A double mini-trampoline {{competition}} {{consists of}} two types of pass. In the one, which {{is known as a}} <b>mounter</b> pass, the athlete performs one skill in the jump from the sloping end to the flat bed and a second skill as they dismount from the flat bed to the landing mat. In the second, which is known as a spotter pass, the athlete does a straight jump from the sloping end to the flat bed to gain height, then after landing on the flat, performs the first skill, then after landing on the flat a second time, performs a second skill as they dismount. These skills are similar to those performed on a regular trampoline except that there is forward movement along the trampoline.|$|E

The reader will have observed that [...] I strictly limited the perfection of Turner's works to the time of [...] their first appearing {{on the walls of the}} Royal Academy. It bitterly [...] grieves me to have to do this, but the fact is indeed so. No [...] picture of Turner's is seen in perfection a month after it is [...] painted. The Walhalla cracked before it had been eight days in the [...] Academy rooms; the vermilions frequently lose lustre long before the [...] exhibition is over; and when all the colors begin to get hard a year [...] or two after the picture is painted, a painful deadness and opacity [...] comes over them, the whites especially becoming lifeless, and many [...] of the warmer passages settling into a hard valueless brown, even if [...] the paint remains perfectly firm, which is far from being always the [...] case. I believe that in some measure these results are unavoidable, [...] the colors being so peculiarly blended and mingled in Turner's [...] present manner as almost to necessitate their irregular drying; but [...] that they are not necessary to the extent in which they sometimes [...] take place, is proved by the comparative safety of some even of the [...] more brilliant works. Thus the Old Temeraire is nearly safe in [...] color, and quite firm; while the Juliet and her Nurse is now the [...] ghost of what it was; the Slaver shows no cracks, though it is [...] chilled in some of the darker passages, while the Walhalla and [...] several of the recent Venices cracked in the Royal Academy. It is [...] true that the damage makes no further progress after the first year [...] or two, and that even in its altered state the picture is always [...] valuable and records its intention; but it is bitterly to be [...] regretted that so great a painter should not leave a single work by [...] which in succeeding ages he might be estimated. The fact of his [...] using means so imperfect, together with that of his utter neglect of [...] the pictures in his own gallery, are a phenomenon in human mind [...] which appears to me utterly inexplicable; and both are without [...] excuse. If the effects he desires cannot be to their full extent [...] produced except by these treacherous means, one picture only should [...] be painted each year as an exhibition of immediate power, and the [...] rest should be carried out, whatever the expense of labor and time [...] in safe materials, even at the risk of some deterioration of [...] immediate effect. That which is greatest in him is entirely [...] independent of means; much of what he now accomplishes [...] illegitimately might without doubt be attained in securer [...] modes--what cannot should without hesitation be abandoned. [...] Fortunately the drawings appear subject to no such deterioration. [...] Many of them are now almost destroyed, but this has been I think [...] always through ill treatment, or has been the case only with very [...] early works. I have myself known no instance of a drawing properly [...] protected, and not rashly exposed to light suffering the slightest [...] change. The great foes of Turner, as of all other great colorists [...] especially, are the picture cleaner and the <b>mounter.</b>|$|E

Female-male mounting is hypothesized to be adaptive, and female-female mounting is a functionless by-product of this adaptation. In this thesis, the proximate and ultimate forces behind both forms of mounting were explored using Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation. In Chapter 2, the hypothesized adaptive value of female-male mounting was supported, as female-male mounts {{were related to}} greater subsequent male-female mounting. Additionally, the majority of female-male mounts were female-initiated, and males stood to be mounted in response to both ambiguous cues and explicit signals put out by females. In Chapter 3, the phylogenetic relatedness of female-male and female-female mounting was investigated by comparing the limb positions employed by <b>mounters</b> during both behaviours.

5000|$|Endicott and his Puritan {{followers}} suppress {{freedom and}} individuality, {{a common theme}} for Hawthorne. At {{the beginning of the}} story [...] "jollity" [...] and [...] "gloom" [...] are said to be contending for an empire, the Merry Mount colonists personifying jollity or mirth and the Puritans being the emblems of gloom. Hawthorne satirizes both parties and the narrative point of view seems to oscillate between them. It is perhaps worth noting that Hawthorne chooses to use [...] "jollity", [...] "mirth" [...] and [...] "gloom" [...] and not [...] "joy", [...] "woe" [...] or [...] "sadness". Real joy, Hawthorne seems to be saying, arises spontaneously out of contrasts. The only time he mentions it is when the youth and maiden suddenly realise that their mirth is visionary and that by truly loving they had subjected themselves [...] "to earth's doom of care and sorrow, and troubled joy, and had no more a home at Merry Mount". The youth and maiden go from being Merry <b>Mounters</b> to, presumably, becoming members of the Puritan community.

30|$|The {{structure}} of wire mechanisms are often employed to configure fast mechanisms. Wire mechanisms reduce the inertia {{of the top}} plate, enabling large acceleration motions. For example, the wire driven method called ‚ÄúFALCON‚Äù was configured in a high-speed manipulator [1], with a peak acceleration of 43 ¬†G. In this method, the redundant drive concept was applied in a parallel mechanism to produce a large resultant force. The ‚ÄúNINJA‚Äù mechanism [2] was rendered light-weight by arranging the motors on a base. Its top plate with {{six degrees of freedom}} (DOF) was driven by four sub-arms with a parallel link structure. The design parameters of the mechanism were optimized while reducing the inertia of the top plate. In experiments, the encoders computed that ‚ÄúNINJA‚Äù can accelerate to > 100 ¬†G. The mechanisms of ‚ÄúDELTA‚Äù [3] and ‚ÄúHEXA‚Äù [4] were based on similar concepts. Later, Nagai et al. [5] introduced a high-speed parallel mechanism for electronic part <b>mounters,</b> known as ‚Äúthe constrained differential drive mechanism‚Äù (CDDM). They analyzed a typical four-DOF pick-and-place motion and divided the trajectory into two regions, A and B. In region A, high-precision motions were produced, whereas high-acceleration motions were produced in region B. Thereafter, they integrated CDDM and the virtual force redundancy (VFR) concept into a high-speed parallel mechanism. Experimentally, this mechanism accelerate to > 20 ¬†G. Recently, a mechanism known as ‚Äúthe capturing robot‚Äù was introduced, which achieved accelerations of 100 ¬†G [6] by utilizing the spring energy in the pre-shaping dynamics of the link fingers. However, high-acceleration motions were limited to one direction when moving to grasp an object.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt present, {{manufacturing}} {{industries are}} required to consider sustainability of the global environment in addition to minimization of production cost. The digital eco-factory has been proposed for a simultaneous examination of environmental performance, productivity and manufacturability. This paper entertains how to construct the digital eco-factory with high accuracy and usability. In general, the digital eco-factory is constructed on the virtual production line modelling an actual production line and its components. A multi-agent based construction of the digital eco-factory was applied and a trial digital eco-factory has been implemented for a PCA (Printed Circuit Assembly) line. A PCA line consists of a solder paste printer, two or three electronic part <b>mounters,</b> reflow soldering oven and testing machine. In the PCA line, processes for the above machines proceed in sequence, these machines‚Äô capabilities are modelled as individual machine agents. There are several types of printed boards produced, depending {{on the number of}} mounted electronic components and the temperature of the solder. When a blank PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is input to a solder paste printing machine, the production process is started. A PCB is modelled as a part agent {{which is one of the}} product agents. For some example virtual productions, power consumption of each machine on each line from the environmental view and productivity of each machine and each line are monitored. From the results of the trial implementation, it can be said that all components on the production line could be configured as software agents with required accuracy. These agents are called ‚Äúmachine agents. ‚Äù In addition to machine agents, manufactured products such as workpiece and parts are also configured as software agents...|$|R

30|$|Development of {{parallel}} mechanism for high acceleration and high precision motions for industrial applications {{has been a}} focus of research {{for a long period}} of time. Wire mechanism has structure {{of parallel}} mechanism and it has been developed to produce high acceleration because of the small inertial moment of the top plate. For example, a high-speed manipulator using wire driven method called ‚ÄúFALCON‚Äù was proposed [1], which attained a peak acceleration of 43 G. The redundant drive concept was applied in a parallel mechanism to produce a large resultant force. In [2], a mechanism called ‚ÄúNINJA‚Äù was proposed; this was made light-weight by arranging the motors on a base. Its top plate with six degrees of freedom (DOF) was driven by four sub-arms with a parallel link structure. An optimum method was proposed to find the design parameters of the mechanism while reducing the inertia of the top plate. In experiments, the computation from encoders shows that NINJA can achieve an acceleration of ‚â• 100 G. A high speed parallel mechanism for electronic part <b>mounters,</b> known as ‚Äúconstrained differential drive mechanism‚Äù (CDDM), was introduced [3]. In this research, a typical four DOFs pick-and-place motion was analyzed, and the trajectory was divided into two regions A and B. In region A, high precision motions were produced, whereas high acceleration motions were produced in region B. Thereafter, the virtual force redundancy (VFR) concept was introduced to the design of the high-speed parallel mechanism using CDDM. The experimental results showed that the mechanism could achieve an acceleration of ‚â• 20 G. Recently, a mechanism known as ‚ÄúCapturing robot‚Äù which could achieve 100 G was introduced [4]. To achieve that high acceleration, spring energy was utilized in the pre-shaping dynamics of link fingers. However, this robot could only give high acceleration motion in one direction when moving to grasp object.|$|R
