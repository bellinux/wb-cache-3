5|$|Employment {{possibilities}} within El Hatillo – {{a bedroom}} community of Caracas – are reduced; {{businesses in the}} municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space underdevelopment has resulted {{from a lack of}} land for large scale office construction, making it costly to locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses <b>must</b> <b>look</b> outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the high traffic to, from, and in El Hatillo.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I <b>must</b> <b>look</b> for some other milk.|$|E

25|$|Empedocles {{noted the}} {{limitation}} and narrowness of human perceptions. We see {{only a part}} but fancy that we have grasped the whole. But the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and reflection <b>must</b> <b>look</b> at the thing from every side. It is the business of a philosopher, while laying bare the fundamental difference of elements, to show the identity that exists between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Any {{principle}} of relativity prescribes a symmetry in natural law: that is, the laws <b>must</b> <b>look</b> {{the same to}} one observer as they do to another. According to a theoretical result called Noether's theorem, any such symmetry will also imply a conservation law alongside. For example, if two observers at different times see the same laws, then a quantity called energy will be conserved. In this light, relativity principles make testable predictions about how nature behaves, and are not just statements about how scientists should write laws.|$|E

25|$|Their {{first attempt}} ends up recreating (after a liberal {{interpretation}} of the results) the Mary Magdalene conspiracy theory central to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Casaubon jokingly suggests that to create something truly new Belbo <b>must</b> <b>look</b> for occult connections in non-obvious contexts, such as by linking the Kabbalah to a car's spark plugs. (Belbo actually does this, and after some research concludes that the powertrain {{is a metaphor for}} the Tree of life.) Pleased with the results of the random text program, the three continue resorting to Abulafia whenever they reach a dead-end with their game.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of VC/NVA {{performance}} <b>must</b> <b>look</b> {{beyond the}} American interlude, and the guerrilla warfare phases {{to the final}} outcome of the Vietnam War in 1975. Well before the end, the Viet Cong were reduced to a minor force, and regular PAVN formations controlled the field. While final victory was aided by absence of American airpower, the PAVN/VPA armies were no longer the light-infantry formations mauled at the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965, but a tough, proficient, well-equipped modern force. Their capabilities had grown considerably, and several shortcomings of the conventional 1972 Easter Offensive were remedied.|$|E
25|$|Churches {{are allowed}} in Malaysia, {{though there are}} {{restrictions}} on construction of new churches through discriminatory zoning laws. No pre-existing churches have been closed down {{by the government and}} no standing congregations have been disbanded. However, it is difficult to build new churches. For instance, it took more than twenty years for the local council in Shah Alam to allow a church to be built there, with an additional condition that the church <b>must</b> <b>look</b> like a factory and not a more conventional church appearance. Most of the time, new churches are started in a clandestine manner as ordinary businesses in shops, especially in major cities like Kuala Lumpur.|$|E

25|$|Though Leslie {{does not}} possess or {{understand}} some human ideas like love, {{he does have}} prejudices against others. Charlie tries and fails to explain what bigotry is to the lizard after Leslie speaks badly of fish. Leslie thinks they are dirty and too numerous. He also looks down on humans {{because they do not}} lay eggs. Yet Leslie also has some empathy for the humans. Leslie knows that he and Sarah <b>must</b> <b>look</b> odd to Charlie and Nancy. He also understands that Charlie is being difficult when Nancy mentions that her husband thinks they are dead and that this situation is some sort of hallucination.|$|E
25|$|Because the Histeridae {{family can}} be found on carrion, they have proven to be {{important}} in certain forensic investigations. The predacious Hister beetles will feed on the various insects on the body, primarily Diptera. To estimate a person's time of death, forensic investigators <b>must</b> <b>look</b> at the insects on the body and determine time of colonization. If the Histeridae beetles are present, the investigator can assume that some of the other insects have been eaten by the Hister beetles. Due to their importance in forensic entomology, research is continually being conducted on this family's life cycle and development, their prevalence in specific locations, and their geographical distribution.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach {{to the study of}} history that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact that}} it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one <b>must</b> <b>look</b> at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Traditional cycle lanes {{increase}} vehicle/bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist <b>must</b> <b>look</b> {{ahead to}} avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a crosswalk. As the intersection curves {{away from the}} exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To {{give way to a}} cyclist on the outside, requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at St. John's roundabout in Newbury, Berkshire, England and at Museum Road, Portsmouth, England. The cycle lanes at Museum Road were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing, while the St. John's roundabout retains perimeter cycle lanes.|$|E
25|$|One of Boring's best-known {{projects}} is his 1940 {{study of the}} moon illusion. Boring and fellow researcher A. H. Holway hypothesized that the moon appears larger on the horizon because the eyes view it directly at a leveled position, while the moon overhead appears smaller because the eyes <b>must</b> <b>look</b> up. They tested this experimentally, and found that for an observer whose eyes were kept in a fixed position while a circle representing the moon moved up (through {{the use of a}} pulley system), the moon appeared to increase in size. This illusion did not occur when participants were lying down while viewing the moon, and they also found some evidence of it not occurring when viewing the moon with only one eye. These results led the researchers to conclude that the illusion of moon shrinkage depends on the movement of the eyes in the head, not the movement of the actual head, and that it depends on binocular vision, that is, the use of both eyes together. This study exemplifies Boring’s interest in misperceptions of sensory experience.|$|E
25|$|In Deathly Hallows, the {{students}} who {{need a place to}} hide from the Carrows, two Death Eater professors, use the room. It is also revealed that the Room of Requirement's current version can change while still occupied, though should a completely different version be required (e.g. the Room of Hidden Things instead of DA Headquarters) the room must be empty. The Room can also answer to the desire of the wizard within the room, such as providing Harry with a whistle when he needed one during a Dumbledore's Army meeting, or creating a passage to the Hog's Head (as the room cannot produce food). Later, Ravenclaw's diadem is found to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes and has been hidden in the Room of Hidden Things by Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the Room, with Harry knowing that he <b>must</b> <b>look</b> for a place to hide things, and find the tiara; but they are ambushed by Draco, Crabbe and Goyle. The diadem is finally destroyed when Crabbe fills this version of the Room with what Hermione believes to have been Fiendfyre; a destructive magical fire. It is not known if the room continues to function after the events of Deathly Hallows; Ron expresses concern that it may have been ruined in all of its forms by the cursed fire.|$|E

500|$|Former {{journalist}} Basil Clarke {{is considered}} the founder of PR in the UK. He founded the UK's first PR agency, Editorial Services, in 1924. He also authored the world's first code of ethics for the field in 1929. Clarke wrote that PR, [...] "must look true and it <b>must</b> <b>look</b> complete and candid or its 'credit' is gone". He suggested that the selection of which facts are disseminated by PR campaigns {{could be used to}} persuade the public. The longest established UK PR agency is Richmond Towers, founded by Suzanne Richmond and Marjorie Towers in 1930.|$|E
500|$|Most notably, Weizsäcker {{spoke of}} the danger of forgetting and {{distorting}} the past. [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} the guilt or innocence of an entire nation. Guilt is, like innocence, not collective but personal. There is discovered or concealed individual guilt. There is guilt which people acknowledge or deny. [...] All of us, whether guilty or not, whether young or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by the consequences and liable for it. [...] We Germans <b>must</b> <b>look</b> truth straight in the eye – without embellishment and without distortion. [...] There can be no reconciliation without remembrance." ...|$|E
