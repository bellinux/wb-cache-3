The temple rises [...] high. The massive roofcomb that topped the temple was originally decorated with a giant sculpture of the enthroned king, although little of this decoration survives. The tomb of the king was discovered by Aubrey Trik of the University of Pennsylvania in 1962. Among items recovered from the Late Classic tomb were a large collection of inscribed human and animal bone tubes and strips with sophisticated scenes depicting deities and people, finely carved and rubbed with vermilion, as well as jade and shell ornaments and ceramic vessels filled with offerings of food and drink. The shrine at {{the summit of the}} pyramid has three chambers, each behind the next, with the doorways spanned by wooden lintels fashioned from <b>multiple</b> <b>beams.</b> The outermost lintel is plain but the two inner lintels were carved, some of the beams were removed in the 19th century and their location is unknown, while others were taken to museums in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} a {{detailed discussion of}} various issues involved in designing a medium access control (MAC) protocol for multihop wireless networks with nodes employing <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> smart antennas. <b>Multiple</b> <b>beam</b> smart antennas can form several beams simultaneously and can initiate concurrent transmissions or receptions in them, thereby increasing the throughput of the bottleneck nodes. Traditional on-demand MAC protocols for omnidirectional and single beam directional antennas based on the IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism cannot {{take advantage of this}} unique capability of <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> antennas as they do not facilitate concurrent transmissions or receptions by a node. This paper introduces a novel protocol, hybrid MAC (HMAC), which enables concurrent packet reception (CPR) and concurrent packet transmission (CPT) at a node equipped with <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> antennas and is backward compatible with IEEE 802. 11 DCF. Simulation results show the superior performance of HMAC in most ad hoc scenarios. Moreover, in some sample topologies, the throughput of HMAC is close to the theoretical maximum. The paper also {{presents a}} wireless mesh network architecture with heterogeneous antenna technologies and illustrates the advantages of employing <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> smart antennas and HMAC in such networks.

40|$|Abstract. There is a {{need for}} high power RF sources for the next {{generation}} of accelerators and colliders. Sources that operate at reduced beam voltage allow solid state power supplies with significant cost reduction over conventional pulse modulators. <b>Multiple</b> <b>beam</b> RF sources provide reduced beam voltage by using a multiplicity of beamlets that traverse the RF circuit through individual beam tunnels, reducing the space charge forces that drive the voltage requirement. The current generation of <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> devices typically use Brillouin focusing, which limits high power operation. The devices reported here utilize confined flow focusing which allows much tighter control of the electron beamlets and consequently, higher power operation.

Advanced transmission antenna technology is critical to generate and switch narrow beams rapidly among {{a large number of}} users under quality of service (QoS) constraints such as average delay. In this paper, we jointly optimize resource allocation and congestion control, and compare the performances of two types of satellite transmit antennas: a <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> antenna and a phased array antenna. For a <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> antenna with traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA), throughput is decided by either the most demanding user or the average of all user parameters. For a phased array antenna, joint antenna gain patterning and beam scheduling is given as a function of channel conditions, interference (depending on users' geographical distribution), and average delay requirements. We then develop a low-complexity on-line algorithm of choosing either interference suppression or sequential service for the active users who are closely located within the width of a spotbeam. Due to flexible power allocation, the phased array antenna can provide better performance than the <b>multiple</b> <b>beam</b> antenna when a small number of users are very demanding or many users are densely crowded in a small area.
