5000|$|One {{tactical}} innovation {{adopted by}} 2nd TAF Spitfires was the [...] "Fluid Six"' formation, {{which had been}} developed through combat experience in Europe and North Africa. The first use of the tactic dated back to at least November 1941. It is known that No. 112 Squadron RAF used this in the North African campaign. This formation [...] "was considered the best fighter formation of the war". It abandoned the leader-wingman combination that had existed before. Instead, {{it was based on}} three pairs of Spitfires which could provide <b>mutual</b> <b>cover</b> and support: the pairs were 'stacked' in altitude so that the pair (e.g.: 5 & 6) flying up-sun, and covering the tails of the leaders (1 & 2), flew higher, while the other pair (e.g.: 3 & 4) flew lower. Any attacking aircraft could be sandwiched between two pairs of Spitfires, no matter the direction or altitude of the attack. Another advantage of this formation was that when operating at squadron strength a flight commander was able to lead six aircraft of his own flight, [...] "whereas, with formations of four there would more likely be one formation from each flight with the third consisting of aircraft from another flight." ...|$|E

The relationship between these two perspectives is explored. It is shown that there are l-complexes Y for which the computational decision problem which takes input finite I-complex X and determines if X covers Y is NP-complete for both simplicial (combinatorial) and topological covering projections. A theorem of Leighton concerning finite common covers of I-complexes, which holds both c. ornbinatorially and topologically, is shown to fail topologically for 2 -complpxes.

40|$|Several {{contributions}} to this department {{have emphasized the}} importance of design by contract in the construction of reliable software. Design by contract, as you will recall, is the principle that interfaces between modules of a software system— especially a mission-critical one— should be governed by precise specifications, similar to contracts between humans or companies. The contracts will <b>cover</b> <b>mutual</b> obligations (preconditions), benefits (postconditions), and consistency constraints (invariants). Together these properties are known as assertions, and are directly supported in some design and programming languages. A recent $ 500 million software error provides a sobering reminder that this principle is not just a pleasant academic ideal.

We model the role of a public <b>mutual</b> fund to <b>cover</b> these “collective risks”. We start from the under-investment problem stemming from the moral hazard of Local administrations when the fund is managed by the Central government, which also takes into account the equalisation of resources across administrations. We then study the potential role of private insurers in solving the under-investment problem. Our analysis shows that the public fund is always superior to the private insurance solution in the presence of hard budget constraints. However, when the Central government cannot credibly commit to an optimal transfer rule, private insurers are sometimes able to improve on the public mutual fund solution by inducing a higher level of investments. intergovernmental relations, private insurer, collective risks...|$|R
40|$|In network science, {{researchers}} {{often use}} mutual information {{to understand the}} difference between network partitions produced by community detection methods. Here we extend the use of <b>mutual</b> information to <b>covers,</b> that is, the cases where a node can belong to more than one module. In our proposed solution, the underlying stochastic process used to compare partitions is extended to deal with covers, and the random variables of the new process are simply fed into the usual definition of mutual information. With partitions, our extended process behaves exactly as the conventional approach for partitions, and thus, the mutual information values obtained are the same. We also describe how to perform sampling and do error estimation for our extended process, as both are necessary steps for a practical application of this measure. The stochastic process that we define here is not only applicable to networks, but {{can also be used to}} compare more general set-to-set binary relations. Comment: 8 page...|$|R
40|$|There {{are various}} {{definitions}} of mutual information. Essentially, these definitions {{can be divided}} into two classes: (1) definitions with random variables and (2) definitions with ensembles. However, there are some mathematical flaws in these definitions. For instance, Class 1 definitions either neglect the probability spaces or assume the two random variables have the same probability space. Class 2 definitions redefine marginal probabilities from the joint probabilities. In fact, the marginal probabilities are given from the ensembles and should not be redefined from the joint probabilities. Both Class 1 and Class 2 definitions assume a joint distribution exists. Yet, they all ignore an important fact that the joint or the joint probability measure is not unique. In this paper, we first present a new unified definition of <b>mutual</b> information to <b>cover</b> all the various definitions and to fix their mathematical flaws. Our idea is to define the joint distribution of two random variables by taking the marginal probabilities into consideration. Next, we establish some properties of the newly defined mutual information. We then propose a method to calculate mutual information in machine learning. Finally, we apply our newly defined mutual information to credit scoring...|$|R
40|$|In [3] {{a notion}} of a covered ideal was introduced. The aim of the present paper is to show some other {{properties}} and the <b>mutual</b> relation betwen <b>covered</b> ideals and bases of semigroups. Definition 1. A proper left ideal L of S is called a covered left ideal (briefly a CL-ideal) if LczS(S-L). Analogously a covered right ideal (CR-ideal) is defined. The case of two-sided ideals will be treated later. Clearly if S contains a zero element 0 and card | S | ^ 2, then 0 is a CL-ideal. Note that by definition S itself is not a CL-ideal. Lemma 1. If S contains two different left ideals Lx and L 2 such that L 2 = S, then none of the ideals Lu L 2 is a CL-ideal. Proof. If L tuL 2 = S, then S-L 2 czL,, and S-L,c=L 2. Now L,czS(S-L 1) mplies LxczSL 2 czL 2 and L 2 czS(S-L 2) implies L 2 czSLxczLu hence Li = L 2 a:ontradiction. Corollary. If S contains more than one maximal left ideal, then none {{of them is a}} CL-ideal of S. If L is a left ideal of S and L^Sa, then L is certainly a CL-ideal. (For, in thi...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{intended}} as an advanced text for courses in antennas, {{with a focus}} on the mature but vital background field of aperture antennas. The book is aimed at final year, MSc, PhD and Post-Doctoral students, as well as readers who are moving from academia into industry, beginning careers as wireless engineers, system designers, in R&D, or for practising engineers. It assumes the reader has undertaken an earlier course of study on Maxwell's equations, fields and waves. Some of these topics are summarised in the early few chapters in order to provide continuity and background for the remaining chapters. The aperture antennas covered include the main types of horns, reflectors and arrays as well as microstrip patches, reflectarrays and lenses. To provide more than a superficial treatment of arrays, the topic of <b>mutual</b> coupling is <b>covered</b> in greater detail than most similar books in the area. Also included is an introduction to arrays on non-planar surfaces, which is of importance for applications that involve curved surfaces such as in aerodynamics or for making aperture antennas unobtrusive. A chapter is included on some modern aperture antennas to illustrate design techniques beyond the most common types of aperture antennas described in the early chapters. This is to show where advances have recently been made and where they could be improved in the future. Also included are selected topics of a practical nature for aperture antennas, namely fabrication and measurement. 430 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Islam Abad region, {{located in}} the southwestern of Kermanshah Province, is a karst region where {{over-exploitation}} from the deep karst water resources has directly affected the water balance of the whole area. Using a combination of geophysical investigations and analysis of well log data and other relevant hydrogeological studies, we looked for the actual relationship between over-exploitation from deep-water wells, penetrated into the covered karst aquifer, and the drying out {{of some of the}} main karst springs throughout the study area. In total, 20 piezometric wells and 4 main karst springs have been chosen for groundwater monitoring network. By integrating GIS processing system and a classical water balance method together with hydrogeology and hydrogeochemical spatial maps, critical zones of human impacts on groundwater resources, made by water extraction for agricultural demand, were identified. Results show that water balance in the Islam Abad basin is in clear disequilibrium, since 2. 15  mcm of water depletes from the main aquifers of the study area, annually. This volume of water shortage has resulted in a 7  m groundwater level decline in the last decade, which caused both drying out and reduction in discharge rate of some of the main karst springs throughout the study area. Depths of penetration of deep-water wells into the covered karst aquifer vary from 1 to 93  m. Hydrogeochemical evaluations, including ion relations and hydrogeochemical diagrams, show interactions between karst and alluvium aquifers. Results showed a broad connection between these two resources and, therefore any pressure on alluvium aquifer will affect the karst aquifer, especially by excessive deep-water wells drilling in <b>mutual</b> alluvial and <b>covered</b> karst aquifers...|$|R
