40|$|Halogenated very {{short-lived}} substances (VSLS) {{are expected}} to contribute significantly to the stratospheric halogen loading and therefore to the stratospheric ozone chemistry. Tropical waters and upwelling regions in the oceans {{have been identified as}} potentially important source regions for the naturally produced VSLS, such as volatile brominated and iodinated halocarbons. Our understanding of the transport of VSLS from the marine boundary surface into the stratosphere is crucial to estimate their contribution to stratospheric halogen loading. In particular, the chemical degradation, wet and dry deposition as well as their transport through the free troposphere up to the stratosphere play important roles in determining whether VSLS and their organic product gases are able to reach the stratosphere. In this study we investigate the VSLS emissions in the tropical East Atlantic and tropical West Pacific and their contribution to the stratospheric halogen loading. For this purpose we use the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, which simulates transport, small scale mixing, washout and photochemical decay of three VSLS (bromoform, dibromomethane and <b>methyliodide).</b> The transport simulations are based on the VSLS sea-to-air flux obtained from the tropical East Atlantic in May/June 2010 and from the tropical Western Pacific in October 2009. While relatively large brominated VSLS fluxes are found in the Mauritanian upwelling in the East Atlantic, the VSLS transport is most efficient in the Western Pacific atmosphere, a region characterized by a high convective activity throughout the year. We show, based on the evaluations for the two tropical campaigns that the peak emissions of brominated VSLS together with strong convective transport lead to significant abundances in the TTL, which are comparable to available upper air measurements. For <b>methyliodide</b> however the Western Pacific emission-based profiles are larger than observations, which suggests that existing measurements may not be representative and <b>methyliodide</b> could have a larger impact on the stratospheric halogen loading than assumed so far.

40|$|Quantum {{chemical}} calculations {{have been}} performed to investigate radical cation rearrangement, radical carbonylation, and homolytic substitution reactions of organic molecules. The rearrangement of the bicyclopropylidiene radical cation to the tetramethyleneethane radical cation is predicted to proceed with stepwise disrotatory opening of the two rings. Each ring opening {{is found to be}} combined with a striking pyramidalization of a carbon atom in the central bond. The isomerization of the norbornadiene radical cation to the cycloheptatriene radical cation (CHT. +), initialized by opening of a bridgehead–methylene bond, is investigated. The most favorable path involves concerted rearrangement to the norcaradiene radical cation followed by ring opening to CHT. +. The barrier of this channel is found to be significantly reduced upon substitution of the methylene group with C(CH 3) 2. Stepwise mechanisms are predicted to be favored over concerted isomerization for the McLafferty rearrangement of the radical cations of butanal and 3 -fluorobutanal. The barrier for the concerted rearrangement is found to be lowered by 17. 2 kcal/mol upon substitution, a result which is rationalized by the calculated dipole moments and atomic charges. Recent experiments showed that photoinitiated carbonylation of alkyl iodides with [11 C]carbon monoxide may be significantly enhanced by using small amounts of ketones that have nπ* character of their excited triplet state. DFT calculations show the feasibility of an atom transfer type mechanism, proposed to explain these observations. Moreover, the computational results rationalize the observed differences in yield when using various alcohol solvents.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} an investigation into the thermal and photochemical reactivity of dihydrodiazines. In order to prepare the title compounds the diazines and some phenyldiazines are treated with phenyllithium in ether, yielding adducts resulting from attack of phenyllithium on the various positions of the heteroaromatic ring. With pyrimidine addition takes place mainly at C(4), with pyridazine at C(3). By using TMEDA, addition at C(2) in 4 -phenylpyrimidine and at C(4) in pyridazine is strongly promoted. The structure of the adducts is studied by n. m. r. spectroscopy. The charge distribution pattern in the C(4) -adduct of pyrimidine and in both the C(3) -adduct and the C(4) -adduct of pyridazine is determined by comparing the carbon chemical shifts of these compounds with those of the corresponding dihydrodiazines obtained by hydrolysis of the adducts. C(5) in the phenyllithium-pyrimidine adduct carries little negative charge, C(4) in the phenyllithium-pyridazine adduct has a considerable amount of charge while the charge density at C(6) in the 3 -adduct and both C(3) and C(5) in the 4 -adduct of pyridazine is moderate. Some organolithium-diazine adducts and some dihydropyrimidines are treated with electrophilic reagents. Both 4, 6 -diphenyl- 1 (3) -lithio- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine and 4, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 4 (3. 4) -dihydropyrimidine are attacked by the electrophilic reagent (<b>methyliodide,</b> methyl chloroformate) at N(3), yielding 4, 6 -dipheny]- 3 -methyl(methoxycarbonyl) - 3, 4 -dihydropyrimidine. 4, 4, 6 -Triphenyl- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine gives upon treatment with <b>methyliodide</b> mainly 3 -methyl- 4, 4, 6 -triphenyl- 3, 4 -dihydropyrimidine. The 3, 4 -dihydro structure of the products is established both spectroscopically and chemically. Reaction of 2 -lithio- 3 -methyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyridazine with <b>methyliodide</b> (methyl chloroformate, tosylchloride) gives the corresponding 2, 3 -dimethyl-(2 -methoxycarbonyl- 3 -methyl-, 2 -tosyl- 3 -methyl-) 2, 3 -dihydropyridazine. 1 -Lithio- 2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -dihydropyrazine yields upon treatment with <b>methyliodide</b> 5 -methyl- 2 -phenylpyrazine. Reaction with carbonyl compounds only yields high molecular material. Photolysis of 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidines causes rearrangement to 5 -R- 1, 2 (2, 3) -dihydropyrimidines, provided that the substituent R contains a π-bond in αposition to the heterocyclic ring (R=phenyl,isobutenyl,phenylethynyl). 4 -Methyl- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine does not show this rearrangement. Chemical evidence is presented that the rearrangement occurs via the di-π-methane mechanism leading to 6 -R- 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene. This latter intermediate undergoes a thermal homo [1, 5] hydrogen shift into 5 -R- 2, 5 -dihydropyrimidine which on tautomerization gives the final product. The reaction can be sensitized by acetone. 4, 5 -Diphenyl-, 5 -methyl- 4 -phenyl and 5 -bromo- 4 -phenyl- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine do not rearrange under photochemical conditions. Several 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidines (R= 2 - or 3 -thienyl, 2 -furyl, 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolyl and 3 -pyridyl) containing heteroaryl vinyl methane moieties undergo photochemical rearrangement into 5 -R- 1, 2 (2, 3) -dihydropyrimidines. Oxidation of these compounds yield 5 -heteroarylpyrimidines. The chemical yields are strongly dependent {{of the nature of the}} heteroaryl group. The existence of a 6 -R- 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene as an intermediate in the photoisomerization of 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) - dihydropyrimidines into 5 -R- 1, 2 (2, 3) -dihydropyrimidines is confirmed spectroscopically in case R= p -trifluoromethylphenyl. It is established that the p -trifluoromethylphenyl group is in exo position in the bicyclic compound. 6 - Exo -(p -trifluoromethylphenyl) - 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene immediately gives 5 -(p -trifluoromethylphenyl) - 1, 2 (2, 3) - dihydropyrimidine upon addition of potassium hydroxide in methanol. Photolysis of 4 -R- 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidines causes ring contraction into imidazoles, provided that the substituent R is sufficiently capable of stabilizing an anionic centre (R= 2 -thiazolyl and 2 - or 4 -pyridyl). Chemical evidence is presented that the ring contraction of 6 -phenyl- 4 -(2 -pyridyl) - 1, 4 (3, 4) -dihydropyrimidine occurs via heterolytic fission of the C(1) -C(6) bond of intermediate 1 -phenyl- 6 -(2 -pyridyl) - 2, 4 -diazabicyclo [3. 1. 0] hex- 2 (3) -ene. The anion stabilizing effect of R is correlated with the acid strength (pKa) of R-CH 3 .

The method employs a "mass-tag" strategy where LCBs are chemically derivatized with deuterated <b>methyliodide</b> (CD 3 I) to produce trimethylated derivatives having a positively charged quaternary amine group.

Solid KOH in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) {{is a very strong}} base with a pKa-value of 27 or even higher. l- 3 On the other hand, the nucleophilicity of this re-agent is low due to the low solubility of KOH in DMSO which allows only sur-face reactivity. Therefore, the mixture is especially prone as a base for nucleophilic displacement reactions. This simple and inexpensive reagent has already been used for the alkylation of OH groups in phenols and alcohols 4 - 5 and of the nitrogens of carboxylic amides 6 with high yields. The reaction of ketones with an alkylation reagent in presence of strong bases is an attractive way for the preparation of peralkylated ketones. However, peralkylations are reported to be achieved by stepwise reactions. 7 The use of NaH in THF is an essential improvement. 8 Solid KOH has been appli-cated in toluene as a solvent, ' but crown ether had to be added. The basicity of the reagent KOH/DMSO is high enough for the direct al-kylation of ketones in CL position, and the preparation procedure can be car-ried out in a very simple manner. 10 All reagents can be used without drying, for the solid KOH binds small amounts of water. l- 3 Technical grade KOH can be applicated in pellets without further purification.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an investigation {{on the total}} synthesis of physiologically active nor-diterpene dilactones, called Podolactones. In Chapter I a survey is given of the known Podolactones {{with the emphasis on}} their structure, biogenesis and biological activities. Chapter II deals with the chemical reactivity of the isolated Podolactones and with the two reported total syntheses of the Podolactone LL-Z 1271 α. Also a strategy for the synthetic investigation described in this thesis is outlined. The construction of functionalized decalines, which can be further elaborated into Podolactones, is the subject of Chapter III. The synthesis of these bicyclic compounds is based on a Dieckmann cyclisation of a saturated-unsaturated diester, which is obtained from a 2, 2 -disubstituted cyclohexanedione- 1, 3 by addition of lithiumethoxyethyne and a subsequent Meyer Schuster rearrangement of the formed ethynylcarbinol. Careful control of the reaction conditions results in a stereoselective, high-yield formation of the necessary intermediates. Several approaches to tricyclic γ-lactones from bicyclic precursors are discussed in Chapter IV. Lactonisation of the 6 -bromo-, 6 -hydroxy- and 3, 6 -dihydroxyesters is investigated. The alkylation and reduction of the 6 -hydroxyester and derivatives revealed interesting substituent effects. In the reduction of the 6 -hydroxyester with lithium in liquid ammonia a strong temperature dependence was observed as well. Reduction at - 78 °C yields selectively an ester with a cis ringjunction, while at - 33 °C not only a trans ringjunction is established, but also a γ-lactone is formed. Moreover addition of <b>methyliodide</b> to the intermediate anion results in the formation of a C(4) -methylated γ-lactone. The residual carbonyl groupat C(3) is protected as a benzoyl- or β-methoxyethoxymethyl-enolether. A model study for the construction of the BC-ring system of Podolactones can be found in Chapter V. After conversion of cyclohexanones into the corresponding a-butylthiomethylenecyclohexanones, addition of lithiumethylacetate and a Hg ++ -assisted hydrolysis results in γ-formylesters, which can be transformed into δ-substituted δ-lactones by reaction with organolithium reagents. This annellation method is applied to both mono- and bicyclic model compounds. The investigations on model compounds also resulted in the synthesis of the fully functionalized ring B of the potent antifeedants Warburganal and Muzigadial. Finally in Chapter VI an evaluation of the results in relation to the total synthesis of Podolactones is given. ...|$|E

Describing their marine emissions in atmospheric chemistry models as accurately as possible {{is necessary to}} quantify their impact on ozone depletion and Earth's radiative budget. So far, marine emissions of trace gases have mainly been prescribed from emission climatologies, thus lacking {{the interaction between the}} actual state of the atmosphere and the ocean. Here we present simulations with the chemistry climate model EMAC (ECHAM 5 /MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) with online calculation of emissions based on surface water concentrations, in contrast to directly prescribed emissions. Considering the actual state of the model atmosphere results in a concentration gradient consistent with model real-time conditions at the ocean surface and in the atmosphere, which determine the direction and magnitude of the computed flux. This method has a number of conceptual and practical benefits, as the modelled emission can respond consistently to changes in sea surface temperature, surface wind speed, sea ice cover and especially atmospheric mixing ratio. This online calculation could enhance, dampen or even invert the fluxes (i. e. deposition instead of emissions) of very short-lived substances (VSLS). We show that differences between prescribing emissions and prescribing concentrations (− 28 % for CH 2 Br 2 to + 11 % for CHBr 3) result mainly from consideration of the actual, time-varying state of the atmosphere. The absolute magnitude of the differences depends mainly on the surface ocean saturation of each particular gas. Comparison to observations from aircraft, ships and ground stations reveals that computing the air–sea flux interactively leads in most of the cases to more accurate atmospheric mixing ratios in the model compared to the computation from prescribed emissions. Calculating emissions online also enables effective testing of different air–sea transfer velocity (k) parameterizations, which was performed here for eight different parameterizations. The testing of these different k values is of special interest for DMS, as recently published parameterizations derived by direct flux measurements using eddy covariance measurements suggest decreasing k values at high wind speeds or a linear relationship with wind speed. Implementing these parameterizations reduces discrepancies in modelled DMS atmospheric mixing ratios and observations by a factor of 1. 5 compared to parameterizations with a quadratic or cubic relationship to wind spee...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 - This {{first part}} of the chapter aims to give the reader a flavour of the {{chemistry}} concerning phosphorus-nitrogen hybrid ligands containing both phosphorus and nitrogen donor atoms. This will be achieved by highlighting selected relevant examples from the literature. The second part will introduce the ligand 2 -(diphenylphosphino) -N-[2 -(diphenylphoshino) benzylidene]benzeneamine, (PNCHP), which is the subject of Chapters 2 through 6. Chapter 2 - The ligand PNCHP reacts with [Mo(CO) 3 (1, 3, 5 -cycloheptatriene) ] to give the complex fac-[Mo(CO) 3 (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] which readily isomerises to mer-[Mo(CO) 3 (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ]. Kinetic studies on the isomerisation in acetone yielded the first-order forward rate constants (k 1) 1. 22 x 10 - 5, 4. 18 x 10 - 5, 1. 72 X 10 - 4 and 4. 89 x 10 - 4 s- 1 at 19. 5, 29. 7, 40. 0 and 49. 5 °C respectively, with thermodynamic activation parameters ΔH 1 ‡ and ΔS 1 ‡ of 95 kJ mol- 1 and - 14. 1 J mol- 1 K- 1 respectively. The related complex fac-[Mo(CO) 3 (PNHCH 2 P-K 3 P,N,P) ] (PNHCH 2 P = 2 -(diphenylphosphino) -N-[(2 -diphenylphosphino) benzyl]benzeneamine does not undergo isomerisation. The complex cis-[Cr(CO) 4 (PNCHP-K 2 N,P) ] reacts with sulfur to give cis-[Cr(CO) 4 (SPNCHP-K 2 N,P) ] and reacts with <b>methyliodide</b> under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide to yield the anion [Cr(CO) 5 I]-. Chapter 3 - The complexes [M(CO) 3 (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] (M = Cr, Mo or W), containing a terdentate PNCHP ligand, react with H+ to give the protonated products [M(CO) 3 {PN(H) CHP-k 2 P,P-η 2 (C=N) }]+, where the imino group has 'slipped' from a K 1 N to a η 2 (C=N) coordination mode {{as a result of the}} protonation of the nitrogen atom. When the acid is HC 1 the above cation [M(CO) 3 {PN(H) CHP-K 2 P,P-η 2 (C=N) }]+ (M = Mo or W) converts to cis-[M(CO) 2 C 12 (PNHCH 2 P-K 3 P,N,P) ]. In this unusual reaction the imine group of the PNCHP ligand has been reduced to an amine concurrently with the two electron oxidation of the metal. In contrast, on reaction of cis-[Cr(CO) 4 (PNCHP-K 2 N,P) ] with H+, the bidentate PNCHP ligand dissociates from the metal resulting in cyclisation of the ligand to give a phosphonium salt. Chapter 4 - PNCHP favours terdentate coordination with Pd(II) and Pt(II). The complexes [Mcl(PNCHP-K 3. P,N,P) ]Cl and [Pd(CH 3) (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ]Cl are synthesised starting with [MCl 2 (1, 5 -cyclooctadiene) ] and [M(CH 3) Cl(1, 5 -cyclooctadiene) ], respectively. The ionic chlorides can be exchanged with BF 4 - using AgBF 4. Abstraction of the covalent chloride with AgBF 4 in the presence of acetonitrile yields [Pt(CH 3 CN) (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] 2 +. The acetonitrile ligand of this dication can be substituted with triphenylphosphane, 2 -picoline, or 3 -picoline. The reaction of [Pt(CH 3 CN) (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] 2 +. with 1, 10 -phenanthroline, 2, 2 '-bipyridine, bis(diphenylphosphino) ethane or 2, 2 ': 6 ', 2 "-terpyridine (L-L) yields complexes of the type [Pt(L-L) (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] 2 + - the first five-coordinate platinum(II) dications. Chapter 5 - The complex [RhCl(PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] is synthesised by reacting the PNCHP ligand with 0. 5 equivalents of [{RhCl(1, 5 -cyclooctadiene) } 2]. This extremely reactive compound undergoes oxidative addition of dichloromethane and chloroform to yield complexes of the type [RhCl 2 (R) (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] (R = CH 2 Cl or CDCl 2). Addition of carbon monoxide to [RhCl(PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] results in the adduct [RhCl(CO) (PNCHP-k 3 P,N,P) ] which is in equilibrium with square planar complex [Rh(CO) (PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ]Cl. The coordinated chloride ligand of [RhCl(PNCHP-K 3 P,N,P) ] can be substituted with tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or triphenylphosphane. Chapter 6 - The triosmium clusters [Os 3 (CO) 11 (CH 3 CN) ] and [Os 3 (CO) 10 (CH 3 CN) 2] react with PNCHP to give [{Os 3 (CO) 11 } 2 (PNCHP-K 2 P,P) ] (containing PNCHP bridging equatorially two osmium triangles), two coordination isomers of [Os 3 (CO) 11 (PNCHP-K 1 P) ] and 1, 1 -[OS 3 (CO) 10 (PNCHP-K 2 P,P) ], respectively. When 1, 1 -[Os 3 (CO) 10 (PNCHP-K 2 P,P) ] is reacted with one equivalent of trimethylamineoxide the major product is [OS 3 (μ-H) (CO) 7 (μ 3 -PNCP) ], in which the imine hydrogen of PNCHP has migrated to the osmium cluster and PNCP is left to act as a triply bridging nine-electron donor. Two geometrical isomers of [Os 3 (μ-H) (CO) 8 (μ 2 -PNCP) ] are found as minor products, with PNCP acting as a doubly bridging seven-electron donor ligand...|$|E
40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) utilises positron emitting radiopharmaceuticals {{in the study}} of metabolic and physiological processes. After the injection of a carbon- 11 or fluorine- 18 labelled tracer, the space- and time-resolved image of positron annihilations is detected externally using rings of coincidence detectors placed around the subject (a PET scanner). New tomographs allow simultaneously recording of both CT or MRI and PET providing both anatomical information from CT (or MRI) and functionality from PET. PET investigations using 2 -[18 F]fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) become available in a large number of hospitals worldwide. FDG-PET is a useful technique for tumour detection, diagnosis of tumour recurrence. However, FDG has disadvantages. It is not only taken up by tumours, but also in the heart and the brain. This phenomenon hampers detection of tumours in these tissues. High physiological FDG uptake can be seen in muscle tissue, macrophages and other cells in inflammatory processes or activated after chemotherapy or radiation therapy causing false positive results. Decreased uptake can cause false negative results in patients with hyperglycaemia. More specific tracers are therefore being developed. The incorporation of labelled amino acids into brain tumours and into some other organ with high physiological consumption of glucose is the superior diagnostic method for its much higher selectivity compared to FDG. The first synthesis of an [11 C]amino acid was published in 1973. Enantiomerically pure [11 C]amino acids with exception of [11 C]methionine are not yet available for routine PET diagnostics. Low availability hampers their evaluation as biological probes. Enantioselective synthesis of large aromatic α-[11 C]methyl-α-amino acids by α-methylation of amino acids derivatives is an especially challenging goal due to relatively low steric volume of the methylation agent (<b>methyliodide</b> or methyltriflate). On the other hand, availability of both 11 СH 3 I and 11 СH 3 OSO 3 CF 3 as starting materials makes the synthesis and disclosure of α-[11 C]methylaminoacids diagnostic impact especially attractive for future routine application in PET diagnostics. Each large aromatic α-[11 C]methyl amino acid has specific (potential) advantage based on its metabolic behaviour. In vivo, α-[11 C]methyltryptophan is converted to the corresponding 5 -hydroxyderivative followed by decarboxylation to α-[11 C]methylserotonin. For this reason it is very useful for quantitative measurement of serotonin biosynthesis. Unlabelled α-MeTyr is routinely used for pre-surgery treatment of pacients with pheochromocytomas due to its high accumulation in this tumour followed by competitive suppression of uptake of tyrosine leading to lower biosynthesis of catecholamines. Thus α-[11 C]MeTyr could be useful for diagnostics of pheochromocytomas, similar to application of fluorine- 18 labelled α-MeTyr and the SPECT radiotracer 123 I-IMT. This compound is not decarboxylated in vivo thus being a promising radiodiagnostic drug candidate for measurement of LAT expression in tumour cell membranes. Similarly to widely used FDOPA and ß-[11 C]DOPA, α-[11 C]MeDOPA may be applied for diagnostics of other neuroendocrine tumours and visualisation and possibly quantification of dopamine metabolism in the brain. Application of nickel(II) complexes BPB and α-amino acids for asymmetric synthesis of α-amino acids becomes a popular synthetic method due to cheap starting compounds, easy chromatographic detection of starting and alkylated complexes and re-usage of BPB without loss of enantiomeric purity of its stereogenic centre after several turnovers. The complexes provide easy generation of an intermediate carbanion due to high acidity of α-hydrogen of an amino acid fragment (pKa ≈ 19). The main aims of the work presented in this thesis are: 1. to increase stereochemical output of alkylation of the chiral nickel complexes derived from amino acids in order to avoid or at least simplify separation of diastereomeric products of alkylation; 2. to develop a new approach to create a quaternary asymmetric centre via alkylation of a chiral tertiary carbanion by 11 CH 3 I or 11 CH 3 OTf and evaluate the applicability of metallocomplex chiral synthons of α-amino acids for asymmetric synthesis of 11 C-labeled α-methyl amino acids. Proximity of ortho-protons of the benzyl group to both the α-proton of the proline residue and substituents in α-position of the amino acid fragment in CDCl 3 solution of the simplest studied complex led to formulation of the first hypothesis about structure of the improved synthon providing higher asymmetric induction. It should carry substituents in ortho-positions of the benzyl group. The donation of electron density from the π-system of the benzyl ring to nickel orbitals should influence the stereochemical result of alkylation of the complexes under thermodynamically controlled conditions. Replacement of the N-benzyl group by an polyalkyl-substituted benzyl group should also result in steric hindrance of 'ring-edge' bonding (between the η 2 -bonded aromatic ring and the metal atom), compared to 'ring-centre' bonding where the polyalkyl-substituted benzyl group is a η 6 -ligand. The polyalkyl-substituted benzyl group may also increase steric hindrance with respect to alkylation of the α-carbon of the glycine or the alanine fragment, thereby enhancing the diastereoselectivity of the reaction. X-Ray charge density studies of the Ni(II) complex of the Schiff base of BPB proved an interaction between Ni 2 +(dz 2) orbital and benzyl π-electron density. Due to occupation of the dz 2 orbital with two electrons no donation of electron density from the π-system of the benzyl ring to nickel orbitals is possible. Instead, polarisation of the π-system of the benzyl ring by a positive charge of the nickel atom leads to electrostatic attraction between the benzyl group and the nickel atom. Introduction of -C(CH 3) 3 substituents in meta-positions of the benzyl group or use the pentamethylbenzyl group in Ni(II) complexes of Schiff bases of (S) -N-(2 -benzoylphenyl) - 1 -benzylpyrrolidine- 2 -carboxamide and glycine and alanine gave very efficient synthons of glycine and alanine capable of stereospecific preparation of α-monosubstituted glycines or highly stereoselective synthesis of α-methyl α-amino acids. A synthetic procedure suitable for the routine preparation of (S) -α-[11 C]methylDOPA and (S) -α-[11 C]methyltyrosine was developed, final radiochemical synthetic steps are now being optimised. Search for a suitable protective group for the indole nitrogen atom of similar tryptophan synthon for the preparation of enantiomers of α-[11 C]methyltryptophan and, in the case of success, for preparation of enantiomers of α-[11 C]methyl- 5 -hydroxytryptophan, is in progress. Preparation of the complexes was optimised with respect to minimisation of amount of nickel compounds in waste water. ...|$|E
