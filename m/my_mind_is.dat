500|$|India toured South Africa in December 2013 {{for three}} ODIs and two Tests. Kohli {{averaged}} 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck. In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa and batting at 4 {{for the first}} time, Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, [...] "The one word that comes to <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> responsibility. I think he [...] showed great discipline and responsibility. It reminds me of Sachin Tendulkar when they came here in 1996." [...] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match. India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.|$|E
500|$|On {{the opening}} track [...] "No Introduction", Nas {{reflects}} on his impoverished upbringing and maturation into a [...] "graphic, classic song composer". The song's subject matter ranges from lifestyle boats to revolutionary ideals: [...] "Hood forever, I just act like I’m civilized / Really what’s in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> organizing a billion Black muthafuckas / To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs / And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back". [...] "Loco-Motive" [...] has an underground vibe and keyboards similar to Nas' 1994 song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind". [...] "A Queens Story" [...] has boom bap and classical elements in its production, including classical piano, orchestral strings and funky drums. Its lyrics {{pay homage to}} Nas' native Queens and his creative influences. [...] "Accident Murderers" [...] incorporates pipe organ in its production, and its lyrics addresses senseless violence with a rags-to-riches narrative by Rick Ross.|$|E
500|$|Taylor's {{performance}} in Green Bay's 16–7 {{win over the}} Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness. In frigid conditions at Yankee Stadium, Taylor carried 31 times for 85yards and scored the Packers' only touchdown against what was considered the league's best defense, both statistically and by reputation. Lombardi entrusted Taylor with the ball, as he was confident his fullback {{would be able to}} move the offense and not turn it over. The game was highlighted by the fierce rivalry between Taylor and Giants linebacker Sam Huff. The two clashed on nearly every play and engaged in trash talk throughout the game. Steve Sabol, who filmed the game with his father for NFL Films, described it as such:The lasting image of that game in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> the ferocity and anger of Jim Taylor ... his barely restrained rage as he ran with the ball. Taylor just got the shit kicked out of him all day long ... There was all this trash-talking between him and especially Sam Huff ... Tons of profanity when they tackled him. I had never experienced anything like that.|$|E

500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin is {{dominated}} by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery. While Stowe weaves other subthemes throughout her text, such as the moral authority of motherhood and the redeeming possibilities offered by Christianity, she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery. Stowe sometimes changed the story's voice so she could give a [...] "homily" [...] on the destructive nature of slavery (such as when a white woman on the steamboat carrying Tom further south states, [...] "The most dreadful part of slavery, to <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>is</b> its outrages of feelings and affections—the separating of families, for example."). One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery [...] was how this [...] "peculiar institution" [...] forcibly separated families from each other. One of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance. Stowe made it somewhat subtle {{and in some cases}} she weaved it into events that would also support the dominant theme. One example of this is when Augustine St. Clare is killed, he attempted to stop a brawl between two inebriated men in a cafe and was stabbed. One other example is the death of the slave woman Prue who was whipped to death for being drunk on a consistent basis; however, her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby. In the opening of the novel, the fates of Eliza and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine. Considering that Stowe intended this to be a subtheme, this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in a bad light.|$|E

[...] The king eventually made him the team leader of eighty artisans and sent him to Lhasa. He was only seventeen when he departed from Nepal.|$|E
2500|$|The venture was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} solo album for Swarbrick, who later said of it: [...] "Gottle O'Geer, I would like to say once and for all was not ever supposed to be a Fairport album.

Chris Blackwell, who to <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> the richest, clueless, most unscrupulous pillock it was ever my misfortune to meet, had other ideas." [...] As such, the basic line-up of Swarbrick and rhythm section was augmented by numerous guest appearances.|$|E

2500|$|Unity {{advocates have}} also {{suggested}} word {{changes in the}} first part of the poem that would make the shift in tone less abrupt. For example, it has been suggested to change possem ("Would that I were able") to posse ("to be able") in line 9, resulting in the variant translation [...] "To be able to play with you as she does and to relieve the sad cares of <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> as pleasant to me as ...". Heyworth calls that construction convoluted and says it undermines the theme that the speaker wishes he were in the position of the woman in lessening his own longings by playing with the bird.|$|E

He had long condemned vows of celibacy on Biblical grounds, but his decision to marry surprised many, not least Melanchthon, who called it reckless. Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524, [...] "I shall never take a wife, as I feel at present. Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex (for I am neither wood nor stone); but <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> averse to wedlock because I daily expect {{the death of a}} heretic." ...|$|E

[...] "The one thing I'd say about criticism of whether I could replicate my domestic performances at Test level, and can only speak for myself - I have played in A team cricket in 2013 versus India and Sri Lanka, playing against guys like [...] Sehwag, [...] Gambhir, [...] Pujara, Yuvraj [...] and got five-wicket hauls and was the leading West Indies A wicket-taker. Yes, the standard (of West Indies domestic cricket) could improve to another level, but if it was I believe I'd still do well, because if you're good, you perform despite the standard." ...|$|E

2500|$|Israelis {{marked the}} 40th {{anniversary of the}} Munich {{massacre}} in London, during which prayers were read for the 11 murdered Israelis, wreaths were laid, and a plaque was unveiled approximately four miles from the Olympic Stadium. London Mayor Boris Johnson attended the event, and recalled watching the massacre in 1972 unfold when he was 8 years old. Johnson said, “What sticks in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> that sense of sacrilege {{and a feeling of}} horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives. And I think the world watched with a sense of numb disbelief as those events unfolded because sport should transcend politics." [...] In addition, Israeli TV commentators held an informal 30-second silence during the Olympics opening ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In 1793 the French Revolutionary Wars {{broke out}} and Louis was {{immediately}} recalled to service to command HMS Cumberland in the Channel Fleet.

In 1796 he convoyed supplies to the West Indies and then joined the Mediterranean fleet under Horatio Nelson. Two years later, Louis [...] and Minotaur were present at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798. At the battle, Minotaur fought a two-hour duel against Aquilon, ultimately forcing her surrender and there is a possibly apocryphal story that Louis was personally thanked by the seriously wounded Nelson, who is reported to have said [...] "Farewell dear Louis, I shall never forget the obligation I am under to you for your brave and generous conduct; and now, whatever may become of me, <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> at peace".|$|E
2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less.

I am lazy, and I never have done things myself that I could get someone to do for me. I can thank heredity for a sound constitution, and myself for taking care of that constitution."
