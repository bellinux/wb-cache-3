5|$|The Itanium 2 {{processor}} {{was released}} in 2002, and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for the whole gamut of high-end computing. The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by HP and Intel. It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million transistors (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium <b>metallization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The voltage {{dependence}} of capacitance in the both diagrams above shows curves from ceramic capacitors with NME <b>metallization.</b> For capacitors with BME <b>metallization</b> the voltage {{dependence of}} capacitance increased significantly.|$|E
25|$|But BME <b>metallization</b> {{produced}} different electrical properties; for example, {{the voltage}} dependence of X7R capacitors increased significantly (see picture). Even the loss factor and the impedance behavior of class 2 ceramic capacitors were lessened by BME <b>metallization.</b>|$|E

40|$|Higher {{frequencies}} in the MHz and GHz {{range and}} the increasing miniaturization lead to a higher load of the SAW (surface acoustic wave) <b>metallizations.</b> This higher SAW load and the intrinsic stresses result in a stress induced material transport, called acoustomigration. These microstructural changes can destroy the characteristic of the SAW device. Different Al based material combinations were investigated by different authors to improve {{the reliability of the}} <b>metallizations</b> and to delay the cost-intensive change to Cu based <b>metallizations.</b> The Cu based <b>metallizations</b> with TaSiN diffusion barriers were also investigated in this work. The barrier layers are necessary to impede the oxygen diffusion into the Cu layer and the Cu diffusion into the piezoelectric substrate. Also in this work the analytical TEM were used as a tool to investigate these microstructural changes in the SAW electrodes. Chemical changes in the <b>metallizations</b> were analysed by EDXS and EELS. The locally high resolved stress measurement in <b>metallizations</b> is a challenge for the future. The CBED (convergent beam electron diffraction) technique has shown the best resolution, however, it can only be applied to TEM lamellas. The aim of this work was to measure the stress within the SAW <b>metallizations</b> by using the CBED method. With it, we could correlate the microstructural changes with the causing stresses within the <b>metallizations.</b> To qualify the CBED method the thermal expansion of Al and Cu single crystals was measured by using a new model for thin TEM lamallas...|$|R
25|$|The {{surge current}} rating of film {{capacitors}} {{can be enhanced}} by various internal configurations. Because <b>metallization</b> is the cheapest way of producing electrodes, optimizing {{the shape of the}} electrodes is one way to minimize the internal resistance and to increase the current-carrying capacity. A slightly thicker <b>metallization</b> layer at the schoopage contact sides of the electrodes results in a lower overall contact resistance and increased surge current handling, without losing the self-healing properties throughout the remainder of the <b>metallization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{electrodes}} of the capacitor are {{deposited on}} the ceramic layer by <b>metallization.</b> For MLCCs alternating metallized ceramic layers are stacked one above the other. The outstanding <b>metallization</b> of the electrodes at {{both sides of}} the body are connected with the contacting terminal. A lacquer or ceramic coating protects the capacitor against moisture and other ambient influences.|$|E
25|$|The {{self-healing}} {{capability of}} metallized films is used multiple {{times during the}} manufacturing process of metallized film capacitors. Typically, after slitting the metallized film to the desired width, any resulting defects can be burned out (healed) by applying a suitable voltage before winding. The same method is also used after the <b>metallization</b> of the contact surfaces ("schoopage") to remove any defects in the capacitor caused by the secondary <b>metallization</b> process.|$|E

40|$|The initial {{results of}} work on a class of {{semiconductor}} <b>metallizations</b> which appear to hold promise as primary <b>metallizations</b> and diffusion barriers for high temperature device applications are presented. These <b>metallizations</b> consist of sputter-deposited films of high T sub g amorphous-metal alloys which (primarily because {{of the absence of}} grain boundaries) exhibit exceptionally good corrosion-resistance and low diffusion coefficients. Amorphous films of the alloys Ni-Nb, Ni-Mo, W-Si, and Mo-Si were deposited on Si, GaAs, GaP, and various insulating substrates. The films adhere extremely well to the substrates and remain amorphous during thermal cycling to at least 500 C.

25|$|Paper as {{carrier of}} the {{electrodes}} has {{the advantages of}} lower cost and somewhat better adherence of <b>metallization</b> to paper than to polymer films. But paper alone as dielectric in capacitors is not reliable enough for the growing quality requirements of modern applications. The combination of paper together with polypropylene film dielectric is a cost-effective way to improve quality and performance. The better adhering of <b>metallization</b> on paper is advantageous especially at high current pulse loads, and the polypropylene film dielectric increases the voltage rating.|$|E
25|$|After cutting, the binder is burnt {{out of the}} stack. This is {{followed}} by sintering at temperatures between 1,200 and 1,450°C producing the final, mainly crystalline, structure. This burning process creates the desired dielectric properties. Burning {{is followed}} by cleaning and then <b>metallization</b> of both end surfaces. Through the <b>metallization,</b> the ends and the inner electrodes are connected in parallel and the capacitor gets its terminals. Finally a 100% measuring of the electrical values will be done and the taping for automated processing in a manufacturing device are performed.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{technique}} is developed to measure quantitatively the adhesion strength of <b>metallizations</b> deposited on substrates such as silicon. Electrostatic adhesion testing employs electrostatic forces to generate delaminating stresses in thin metallic films. The interfacial adhesion strength is readily {{calculated from the}} electrode geometry and the applied electrostatic field at failure. Unlike other adhesion tests, this technique does not require any mechanical contact and is virtually independent of the plastic deformation of the film. Furthermore. this test provides direct strength measurements as opposed to work or energy of adhesion measurements obtained by the common peel-test. The adhesion strengths of several <b>metallizations</b> (Cu, Al, Al-Cu alloy, and TiN) are characterized using this electrostatic technique. The distribution of stress-at-failure data follows Weibull statistics. Field emission scanning electron microscopy reveals that films are delaminated in a micro-blister-type mode. Annealing of <b>metallizations</b> causes reactions and changes flaw distributions. The presence of brittle compounds near the interface may create easy fracture paths and can act as stress concentrators to initiate and propagate the fracture. These stressed areas may lead to localized adhesion failure under applied stress. It is shown that electrostatic adhesion testing is effective in providing quantitative values for the adhesion strengths and failure probabilities of thin-film <b>metallizations...</b>|$|R

25|$|The initial {{prediction}} {{about the}} amount of pressure needed was eventually shown to be too low.

Electro-thermal self-consistency is achieved by solving the coupled nonlinear system made of a temperature dependent device electrical model, and of an approximate description of the device thermal behavior through a thermal impedance matrix. The numerical solution is pursued in the frequency domain by the Harmonic Balance technique.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{and reliability of}} semiconductor devices depend critically on the electrical quality and stability of the metal contacts. Gold-based <b>metallizations</b> are generally used to form ohmic contacts and Schottky barriers to the III-V ma-terial systems. In this paper, we study the interfacial reaction of Be-Au and Sn-Au ohmic contact <b>metallizations</b> on InP, InGaAsP, and InGaAs. Staining, cathodoluminescence imaging, and x-ray microanalysis are {{used to analyze the}} metallurgi-cal interactions. Under typical alloying conditions for ohmic contact formation (420 ~ for 10 min), the depth of metal-semiconductor interaction is found to depend on the amount of gold deposited. For the same thickness of contact metalliza-tion, this depth is largest for InGaAs, followed by InGaAsP and then InP. Analysis of InP/InGaAsP LED's shows that the 3 ~m thick Sn-Au n-contact penetrates- 3 ~m into the InP window layer. The 2. 9 ks thick Be-Au p-contact completely penetrates the contact layer which is typically 0. 5 ~m of InGaAsP (~ = 1. 1 ~m) or InGaAs (k = 1. 6 ~m). The InP / InGaAsP material system is presently used for light emitt ing diodes (LED's), diode lasers, and FET's.

A strong microstructure damage of the metal finger electrodes by void and hillock formation results in an irreversible degradation of the electrical characteristics of the device.

25|$|However, the {{roughness}} of a metallized paper surface can cause many small air-filled bubbles between the dielectric and the <b>metallization,</b> decreasing the breakdown voltage of the capacitor.

The Galerkin’s method in the spectral domain is applied for determining the current density on the <b>metallizations</b> of the circuits when their feeding lines are excited by means of delta-gap generators, and the matrix pencil technique is subsequently used for deembedding the scattering parameters from the computed current densities. Results are presented for the scattering parameters of some microstrip discontinuities and filters printed on both isotropic dielectric substrates and anisotropic dielectric substrates. These results show that when substrate dielectric anisotropy is ignored, errors arise when computing the scattering parameters of microstrip discontinuities and when predicting the operating frequency band of microstrip filters.
