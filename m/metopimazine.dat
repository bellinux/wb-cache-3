40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{antiemetic}} efficacy and tol-erability of ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine</b> with ondan-setron plus <b>metopimazine</b> plus prednisolone during nine cycles of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: A total of 221 women with stage I or II {{breast cancer and}} no prior chemotherapy who were scheduled to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil and methotrexate or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil given every 3 weeks were included in a double-blind parallel trial. Patients were randomized to 3 days of oral treatment with ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine,</b> or ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine</b> plus prednisolone. Ondansetron was administered as 8 mg bid, <b>metopimazine</b> as 30 mg qid, and prednisolone as 50 mg qd. Results: In all, 216 patients (97. 7 %) were assess-able for efficacy during a total of 1, 462 cycles. In cycle 1, complete protection from emetic episodes/nausea day 1, days 2 through 5, and days 1 through 5 was achieved in 84. 4 %/ 51. 4 %, 82. 6 %/ 41. 3 %, and 79. 8 %/ 34. 9 % with ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine</b> and in 84. 1 %/ 57. 0 %, 86. 8 %/ 53. 8 %, and 79. 4 %/ 43. 0 % with ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine</b> plus prednisolone, re-spectively. In cycle 1, the three-drug combination was superior only {{in the treatment of}} nausea on days 2 through 5 (P 5. 0497). The cumulative emetic protection rate after nine cycles was 0. 52 with ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine</b> and 0. 75 with ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine</b> plus prednisolone. Side effects were generally few and mild with both treatments. Constipa-tion was the only adverse event significantly more frequent with the three-drug combination (P 5. 029). Conclusion: Ondansetron plus <b>metopimazine</b> plus prednisolone is highly effective and superior to ondan-setron plus <b>metopimazine</b> during nine cycles of moder-ately emetogenic chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePurpose: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to determine the ability of some antiemetic compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and thereby to determine possible side effects of compounds for the central nervous system (CNS). Methods: We compared the brain penetration of some antiemetic compounds using an in vitro BBB model consisting in brain capillary endothelial cells co-cultured with primary rat glial cells. Results: This study clearly demonstrated that the <b>metopimazine</b> metabolite, <b>metopimazine</b> acid, has a very low brain penetration, lower than <b>metopimazine</b> and even less than the other antiemetic compounds tested in this study. Conclusions: The poor brain penetration of <b>metopimazine</b> acid, <b>metopimazine</b> biodisponible form, seems very likely related to the clinically observed difference in therapeutic and safety profile...|$|E
40|$|Two {{controlled}} double-blind {{studies were}} carried out successively on a cancerous out-patient population receiving multiple combination chemotherapy at successive treatment courses to show the anti-emetic efficiency of <b>metopimazine</b> compared to a placebo. The patient was taken as his own control and the treatment. order was randomly selected. The first trial • consisting of sixty-seven patients, showed a weak statistically significant difference (0 · 05 < p < 0 · 10) between <b>metopimazine</b> at doses of 30 mg/day or 15 mg/day and a placebo. The second trial • comparing a higher dose of <b>metopimazine</b> (45 mg/day) among one hundred and sixteen patients, showed a highly statistically significant therapeutic advantage over a placebo (0 · 001 < p < 0 · 01). Different multiple combination chemo-therapies administered in cancerology are very often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The toxic action of products on the digestive mucous membrane has been implicated, but it is certain that there exists a strong psycho-logical factor at the release of these phenomena as well as central nervous system effects. Although these secondary effects may be minor, it still seems important to fight them effectively to improve the comfort of these patients. The choice of an effective anti-emetic treatment should therefore rest upon objective and controlled arguments. Numerous controlled trials have been performed notably in the USA; Moertel & Reitemeier in particular, compared several different products to a placebo, thus revealing, during their successive studies, the significant action of such drugs as thiopropazate", prochlorperazinet", thiethylperazinevv " and metopimazine··· · (Moertel & Reitemeie...|$|E
40|$|Inter{{national}} audienceINTRODUCTION: Given {{the national}} therapeutic guidelines in France, halofantrine represents {{the first line}} treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria in children. But several disadvantages exist using halofantrine in paediatrics. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy of mefloquine as the first line treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in a paediatric emergency department. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate whether symptomatic measures may improve the gastrointestinal tolerance of mefloquine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study includes all the patients who have been treated for acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the paediatric emergency department of the Hospital Trousseau (Paris, France) in 2003. RESULTS: First line treatment was mefloquine in 35 children. Early vomiting occurred in 22 (63 %) cases. All children responded to mefloquine therapy except two children who had persistent vomiting early after mefloquine therapy and required intravenous quinine. Those two children had initial vomiting. Light meal and <b>metopimazine</b> prophylaxis did not precede mefloquine intake in those two children. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that mefloquine treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is effective and well tolerated in children. Furthermore, a light meal and <b>metopimazine</b> prophylaxis preceding mefloquine intake may improve its gastrointestinal tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of the antiemetic <b>metopimazine</b> (MPZ) given {{as a single}} dose of (a) 40  mg microenema, (b) 40  mg orally and (c) 10  mg as a 60  min i. v. continuous infusion was investigated in six healthy volunteers. Blood samples were drawn and the serum concentrations of MPZ and its acid metabolite were measured. The bioavailability of MPZ given orally and as enemas was 22. 3 and 19. 5 % respectively. Partial avoidance of hepatic first pass metabolism was seen with the enemas, {{which in contrast to}} suppositories, seems to represent a reliable form of rectal administration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccurate, {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} stability indicating high performance thin layer chromatographic (HPTLC) method {{was developed and}} validated for determination of <b>Metopimazine</b> (MPZ) in presence of its degradation products; including the oxidative degradation product (Deg I) and the alkaline hydrolysis degradation product (Deg II; formerly reported as acid metabolite). The proposed method was applied for analysis of MPZ in pure form, pharmaceutical formulation (tablets) and human plasma over the concentration range of 0. 4 – 1. 4  μg band− 1 with accuracy of mean percentage recovery 100. 10  ±  0. 941. The method depends on separation of MPZ from its degradation products on HPTLC silica gel 60 F 254 plates using chloroform–methanol–ammonia (12 : 2 : 0. 1, by volume) as developing system followed by densitometric measurement of bands at 254  nm. The method was validated according to ICH guidelines. The degradation products were well resolved from the pure drug with significantly different Rf values (MPZ, Rf =  0. 58, Deg I, Rf =  0. 35 and Deg II, Rf =  0. 03). The results obtained by the proposed method were statistically compared to the reported HPTLC method, {{and there was no}} significant difference between them regarding both accuracy and precision; indicating the ability of the proposed method to be used for routine analysis of drug product...|$|E
