5|$|When {{she became}} a mother in 1999, Thompson <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> {{decision}} to reduce her workload, and in the following years many of her appearances were supporting roles. She was not seen on screen again until 2000, with {{only a small part}} in the British comedy Maybe Baby, which she appeared in as a favour to its director, her friend Ben Elton.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{said that}} Spira {{deviates}} from {{the worlds of}} past Final Fantasy games most notably {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|Selbie also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> {{effort to}} attract the wealthy classes to the railway. Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve golf courses and hunts along the route, and horse-vans were {{provided}} at stations serving hunts and point to points. Two Pullman cars were introduced in 1909 on selected services between the City of London and Chesham, Aylesbury and Verney Junction {{for the benefit of}} businessmen travelling to work and theatregoers returning from London.|$|E

5000|$|Yumura {{studied at}} Tama Art University and drew covers for the {{magazine}} Garo in the 1970s and 1980s. He collaborated with copywriter Shigesato Itoi in short comics such as Penguin Shuffle and Jonetsu Penguin no Gohan. He also collaborated with the American magazines Wet and Raw. [...] Yumura's comics were influenced by American pop culture; his artwork is characterized by crudely done drawings <b>made</b> in <b>a</b> <b>conscious,</b> deliberate manner. This style became known as heta-uma (bad but good).|$|R
5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some throughout his career. He died in late 1849, and following his death nude paintings went rapidly out of fashion in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Khan, Chopra, and Rampal {{underwent}} extensive {{martial arts}} training from an expert from the Shaolin Temple. The principal cast received training in {{different kinds of}} martial arts. Khan revealed that he {{had always wanted to}} look the way Amitabh Bachchan had in his films, but he said he gave his own interpretation to the role. After signing to do the film, Chopra was very excited, but a few days later, she became nervous, wondering if {{she would be able to}} do justice to the character. Having seen the original film as a teenager, Chopra avoided watching the film again as she did not wanted to imitate Zeenat Aman's portrayal of Roma. She <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to give her own look and style to the character.|$|E
5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidentalâ€”Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> decision to write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
50|$|The {{hall was}} {{designed}} by the New York City firm of Mann & MacNeille, whose principals, Horace Mann and Perry MacNeille, were both summer residents of Bailey Island. The design was made in 1909 and the hall was built in 1911-12. It was <b>made</b> as <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> imitation of the main house at Mount Vernon in Virginia, reflecting the then-popular Georgian Revival in architecture. The building served {{as a model for}} later community hall buildings the architects designed for several industrial working-class communities.|$|R
5000|$|The four albums {{released}} {{during this}} period mainly featured English lyrics. Liwa has stated that he had in fact already begun writing German lyrics but {{that at the time}} German songtexts were considered [...] "unhip". Although his English texts had received praise in music magazines, the later decision to begin recording songs in German rather than English was <b>made</b> in <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to address what Liwa perceived as a failure to communicate the deeper meanings in his lyrics to an audience beyond music critics.|$|R
50|$|Distrust of Ptolemy's {{observations}} {{goes back}} {{at least as far}} as doubts raised in the 16th century by Tycho Brahe and in the 18th Century by Delambre. Arthur Berry made similar remarks in about 1899. R. R. Newton also <b>made</b> <b>a</b> charge of <b>conscious</b> falsification.|$|R
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines that felt unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E
5|$|West <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> {{decision}} {{to abstain from}} the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was {{brought on by the}} alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

50|$|Nociception usually {{involves}} {{the transmission of}} a signal along nerve fibers {{from the site of}} a noxious stimulus at the periphery to the spinal cord. Although this signal is also transmitted on to the brain, a reflex response, such as flinching or withdrawal of a limb, is produced by return signals originating in the spinal cord. Thus, both physiological and behavioral responses to nociception can be detected, and no reference need be <b>made</b> to <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> experience of pain. Based such criteria nociception has been observed in all major animal taxa.|$|R
60|$|Ricardo now {{looked at}} her calm face with {{something}} like respect. He was even a little awed by her stillness, by her economy of words. Womanlike, she felt the effect she had produced, the effect of knowing much and of keeping all her knowledge in reserve. So far, somehow, this had come, about of itself. Thus encouraged, directed {{in the way of}} duplicity, the refuge of the weak, she <b>made</b> <b>a</b> heroically <b>conscious</b> effort and forced her stiff, cold lips into a smile.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Jones {{left the}} band and Lanny Hussey was {{promoted}} to full membership. Ginger then <b>made</b> <b>a</b> more <b>conscious</b> effort to develop its own distinctive sound, adding some trip hop and electronic elements to their album Suddenly I Came to My Senses. [...] Jones played keyboards on the album, billed as a [...] "special guest"; long-time session sideman Ashby was also a guest performer. Sarah McLachlan (billed merely as an [...] "additional musician") performed some of the backing vocals on the album. The song, [...] "Come To Me" [...] was featured in the film Kissed, and was included on the soundtrack album as well.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Nintendo <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> {{effort to}} revitalize the PokÃ©mon brand with the PokÃ©mon Black & White duology, which {{streamlined}} the battle system and introduced an entirely new lineup of characters in a new region based on New York City. These games were followed up with a direct numbered sequel in 2012, a first for the main series. 2012 also saw the release of PokÃ©mon Conquest, a crossover with the Nobunaga's Ambition series of strategy role-playing games.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the demographic trend of longer lifespans and an expanding older market, and to its child-centered image, McDonald's <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> decision to attempt to market its food to a more adult audience. Rather than change its existing menu items or marketing strategy, the company decided {{to create a new}} line of sandwiches with what would hopefully be perceived as more sophisticated ingredients. It commissioned Executive Chef Andrew Selvaggio to create the Deluxe line of burgers including the Fish Filet Deluxe, Grilled Chicken Deluxe, Crispy Chicken Deluxe, and the flagship Arch Deluxe.|$|E

A banged-up Perth was swept out of the playoffs in 2015 following a fourth-place finish which marked an underwhelming follow-up to its title-winning campaign in 2014. Gleeson <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort during the 2015 off-season {{to make sure that}} first and foremost, the chemistry is right.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{deconstruct}} images of empresses (archduchesses) from the Habsburg- Lorraine dynasty, currently present in the pop culture.

25|$|In 1989, Loung {{graduated}} from high school, and in the fall, she entered Saint Michael's College with the financial assistance of a full four-year scholarship provided by the Turrell Scholarship Fund. During her college years, she <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> decision to become an activist, and met her future husband. In early 1992, Loung studied at Cannes International College as part of Saint Michael's curriculum.

25|$|For a while 1914 {{looked like}} {{it was going to be}} the first ever {{relatively}} calm year for Merezhkovsky. With the two Complete Works Of editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic Nestor Kotlyarevsky nominated the author for the Nobel Prize for literature. Then World War I broke out. Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> effort to distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with Alexander Kerensky and joining the Maxim Gorky-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the painless possible way.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1934, S. Sadanand (who {{was running}} The Free Press Journal) started the Tamil daily Dinamani with T.S. Chockalingam as editor.

But by focussing on their circumstances it is as if we see voters as a manipulated group rather than as individuals who <b>made</b> <b>a</b> free and <b>conscious</b> decision, explains Alexis Papazoglou. Regardless of how one chooses to explain the result, key Leave campaign promises were false, and so a general election, where parties set out detailed and costed plans for citizens to decide on, must be the next step...|$|R
40|$|The {{opportunity}} to co-develop this tool with Karen Schoeneman of CMS has been exciting In {{the course of}} the project, Karen and I became partners truly developing the Artifacts of Culture Change tool and authoring this report in tandem.

It offers a means for innovative providers to capture the real changes they have <b>made</b> after making <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> commitment to resident-directed care. To date, what has been collected has largely consisted of clinical data, satisfaction measures and assessment of organizational stages. I would like to thank Karen Schoeneman for her partnership, insight and wise counsel in the writing of this report...|$|R
25|$|Whedon <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> {{effort to}} focus on Willow and Tara's {{relationship}} instead of either's identity as a lesbian or the coming out process. When Willow discloses to Buffy what she feels for Tara, she indicates that she has {{fallen in love with}} Tara, not that she is a lesbian, and avoids categorizing herself. Some critics regard this as a failure on Willow's part to be strong; Em McAvan interprets this to mean that Willow may be bisexual. Scholar Farah Mendlesohn asserts that Willow's realization that she is in love with Tara allows viewers to re-interpret Willow's relationship with Buffy; in the first three seasons, Willow is often disappointed that she is not a higher priority to Buffy, and even after Willow enters a relationship with Tara, still desires to feel integral to Buffy's cause and the Scooby Gang.|$|E
25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> decision to tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E
25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> {{decision}} to use Holinshed more frequently during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one must ask why he may have done so. True Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major {{difference between the two}} that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E

The profession has been generous in providing programs, training and tools to up-skill pharmacists {{in the clinical}} how-to's of new service delivery.

50|$|Completeness {{implies that}} some choice will be <b>made,</b> <b>an</b> {{assertion}} {{that is more}} philosophically questionable. In most applications, the set of consumption alternatives is infinite and the consumer is not conscious of all preferences. For example, {{one does not have}} to choose over going on holiday by plane or by train: if one does not have enough money to go on holiday anyway then {{it is not necessary to}} attach a preference order to those alternatives (although it can be nice to dream about what one would do if one would win the lottery). However, preference can be interpreted as a hypothetical choice that could be <b>made</b> rather than <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> state of mind. In this case, completeness amounts to an assumption that the consumers can always make up their mind whether they are indifferent or prefer one option when presented with any pair of options.|$|R
60|$|Then, as I looked, the mist, or smoke, or cloud, or {{whatever}} one may call it, seemed to coalesce and solidify at two points quite close together, and I was aware, with a thrill of interest {{rather than of}} fear, that these were two eyes looking out into the room. A vague outline of a head I could see--a woman's by the hair, but this was very shadowy. Only the eyes were quite distinct; such eyes--dark, luminous, filled with some passionate emotion, fury or horror, I could not say which. Never have I seen eyes which were so full of intense, vivid life. They were not fixed upon me, but stared out into the room. Then as I sat erect, passed my hand over my brow, and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>conscious</b> effort to pull myself together, the dim head faded in the general opacity, the mirror slowly cleared, {{and there were the}} red curtains once again.|$|R
