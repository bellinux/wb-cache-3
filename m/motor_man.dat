60|$|In {{the same}} mail with your letter, arrived the {{enclosed}} from Orme the <b>motor</b> <b>man.</b> You will observe {{that he has}} an office. I will explain {{that this is a}} law office and I think it probably does him as much good to have a law office without anything to do in it, as it would another man to have one with an active business attached. You see he is on the electric light lay now. Going to light the city and allow me to take all the stock if I want to. And he will manage it free of charge. It never would occur to this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me, to hire him on a good salary not to manage it. Do you observe the same old eagerness, the same old hurry, springing from the fear that if he does not move with the utmost swiftness, that colossal opportunity will escape him? Now just fancy this same frantic plunging after vast opportunities, going on week after week with this same man, during fifty entire years, and he has not yet learned, in the slightest degree, that there isn't any occasion to hurry; that his vast opportunity will always wait; and that whether it waits or flies, he certainly will never catch it. This immortal hopefulness, fortified by its immortal and unteachable misjudgment, is the immortal feature of this character, for a play; and we will write that play. We should be fools else. That staccato postscript reads as if some new and mighty business were imminent, for it is slung on the paper telegraphically, all the small words left out. I am afraid something newer and bigger than the electric light is swinging across his orbit. Save this letter for an inspiration. I have got a hundred more.|$|E

Ernest Lowe was a cinema proprietor and ran the Strand Pictures in West Wallsend. He eventually acquired both cinemas operating in Gloucester at the time the Majestic and the Star. The company had a franchise from the Gloucester Shire Council to run the business for a period of 25 years when the council could exercise their right to acquire and operate the undertaking themselves.At the time of the changeover of the companies Fred Lowe met and married Mabel Newbery, who had been visiting a friend in Gloucester who was the daughter of the local Police Sergeant, Sgt.
