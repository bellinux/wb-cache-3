25|$|The {{criticism}} of the American Dream, which {{lies at the heart}} of All <b>My</b> <b>Sons,</b> was one reason why Arthur Miller was called to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950s, when America was gripped by anti-communist hysteria. Miller sent a copy of the play to Elia Kazan who directed the original stage version of All <b>My</b> <b>Sons.</b> Kazan was a former member of the Communist Party who shared Miller's left-wing views. However, their relationship was destroyed when Kazan gave names of suspected Communists to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare.|$|E

25|$|In All <b>My</b> <b>Sons,</b> these {{elements}} are all present; {{it takes place}} within a 24-hour period, has a protagonist suffering from a previous offense, and the punishment for that offense.

25|$|Henrik Ibsen's {{influence}} on Miller is evidenced from the Ibsen play The Wild Duck, where Miller took {{the idea of}} two partners in a business where one is forced to take moral and legal responsibility for the other.

25|$|Miller {{is known}} for the {{consciousness}} of the characters in his play. In his plays, he confronts a level of banality with the roller coaster of guilt and responsibility. Some strong examples of characters who portray this struggle between their conscious and their social responsibility are Joe Keller in All <b>My</b> <b>Sons</b> and John Proctor in The Crucible. Miller often creates consequences for characters who ignore or violate their social responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, Miller {{exchanged}} {{letters with}} Eugene O'Neill regarding Miller's production of All <b>My</b> <b>Sons.</b> O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, {{he wrote a}} letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of Death of a Salesman. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his Parkinson's disease made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, which never occurred.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Miller’s {{writing in}} All <b>My</b> <b>Sons</b> often shows {{great respect for}} the great Greek tragedies of the likes of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. In these plays the tragic hero or protagonist will commit an offense, often unknowingly, which will return to haunt him, {{sometimes}} many years later. The play encapsulates all {{the fallout from the}} offense into a 24-hour time span. During that day, the protagonist must learn his fate and suffer as a result, and perhaps even die. In this way the gods are shown to be just and moral order is restored.|$|E
25|$|Laughlin {{decided to}} become an actor after seeing a {{production}} of A Streetcar Named Desire.
