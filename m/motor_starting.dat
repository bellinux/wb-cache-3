2500|$|A magnetic-hydraulic {{circuit breaker}} uses a solenoid coil to provide {{operating}} force {{to open the}} contacts. Magnetic-hydraulic [...] breakers incorporate a hydraulic time delay feature using a viscous fluid. A spring restrains the core until the current exceeds the breaker rating. During an overload, {{the speed of the}} solenoid motion is restricted by the fluid. The delay permits brief current surges beyond normal running current for <b>motor</b> <b>starting,</b> energizing equipment, etc. Short-circuit currents provide sufficient solenoid force to release the latch regardless of core position thus bypassing the delay feature. Ambient temperature affects the time delay but does not affect the current rating of a magnetic breaker.|$|E

Analyses of high voltage longwall coal mine power systems were conducted using commercial power system analysis software. Distribution voltage, transformer impedance, power center location, and motor size affected magnitude of short circuits and <b>motor</b> <b>start</b> currents. Phase angles between voltage and current were longer for <b>motor</b> <b>starts</b> than for short circuits. A prototype with an induction motor was developed and tested in the laboratory. Minimizing the intentional time delays in short circuit protection will help ensure temperatures of ignition thresholds for gas and dust are not be exceeded on energized electrical apparatus surfaces.

50|$|To {{observe the}} effect of Back-EMF of a motor, one can perform this simple exercise. With an {{incandescent}} light on, cause a large motor such as a drill press, saw, air conditioner compressor, or vacuum cleaner to start. The light may dim briefly as the <b>motor</b> <b>starts.</b> When the armature is not turning (called locked rotor) there is no Back-EMF and the motor's current draw is quite high. If the <b>motor's</b> <b>starting</b> current is high enough it will pull the line voltage down enough to notice the dimming of the light.|$|R

50|$|Start {{capacitors}} briefly increase <b>motor</b> <b>starting</b> {{torque and}} allow a motor to be cycled {{on and off}} rapidly. A start capacitor stays in the circuit long enough to rapidly bring the motor up to a predetermined speed, which is usually about 75% of the full speed, and is then {{taken out of the}} circuit, often by a centrifugal switch that releases at that speed. Afterward the motor works more efficiently with a run capacitor.|$|E
