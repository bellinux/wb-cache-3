40|$|A {{brand is}} {{a mean of}} product {{differentiation}} {{and a kind of}} a sign by which we can distinguish one commodity from another. Consumers' utility, as well as commodity prices are affected by brands. Therefore, the <b>market</b> <b>positioning</b> of branded products is important for firms, too, since it affects profits. This paper presents a theoretical framework that incorporates aspects of brand in microeconomic analysis and the tools for an effective <b>market</b> <b>positioning</b> of differentiated products.

In two experimental studies we found that: (1) a brand elicits higher authenticity evaluation when paired with incongruent <b>marketing</b> <b>positioning</b> images than when paired with congruent <b>marketing</b> <b>positioning</b> images and (2) consumers’ expertise significantly influence their ability to process brand attributes, which in turn affects their authenticity evaluation of the brand. The findings have important implications for <b>market</b> <b>positioning</b> and brand management...|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the methods}} Starbucks has used to expand and {{maintain}} their dominant <b>market</b> <b>position,</b> including buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Mooney Airplane Company of Kerrville, Texas, {{designed}} a six-seat pressurised light aircraft, {{powered by a}} single 360hp (268kW) piston engine, which they designated the Mooney 301. On 7 April 1983, the prototype 301 conducted its maiden flight. During 1985, the Mooney Aircraft Company was acquired by new French owners, who promptly {{took an interest in}} the further development of the fledgling 301. Coinciding with the company's acquisition, French light aircraft manufacturer SOCATA, who had identified a vacant <b>market</b> <b>position</b> for a purpose-built optimised single-engine aircraft capable of fast personal transport and light cargo duties, identified the piston-powered 301 as a potential starting point to satisfy this niche.|$|E

The SuperSeaCats {{trafficking}} between Helsinki and Tallinn {{were not included in}} the sale as their purchase would have given Tallink a dominant <b>market</b> <b>position</b> on the route, which would have resulted in the competition regulators of Finland and Estonia not approving the sale. As a result, Sea Containers (that had barely a year ago announced their intention to give up the ferry business completely) continued operating them under the SuperSeaCat brand. In late 2006 the land organisations of Tallink and Silja Line were reorganised in Finland so that Tallink Finland and Superfast Finland were merged into Oyj Silja Abp, which now took care of all Finnish operations of Tallink/Silja. Shortly afterwards Oyj Silja Abp was renamed into Tallink Silja Oy. Similarly the land organisations in Sweden became Tallink Silja AB.|$|E

Although the network already owned KDAF, Fox sought the opportunity to align with KDFW because of its stronger <b>market</b> <b>position</b> (the station placed second, behind WFAA, in total day and news viewership at the time) and its operation of a news department; as a result, Fox Television Stations decided to sell KDAF, which would ultimately trade it to Renaissance Broadcasting in exchange for existing Fox affiliate KDVR in Denver.|$|E
