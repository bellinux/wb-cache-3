At {{some distance from the}} current-introducing contacts, electrons pile up on the left side and deplete from the right side, which creates an electric field ξy {{in the direction of the}} assigned VH. VH is negative for some semi-conductors where [...] "holes" [...] appear to flow. In steady-state, ξy will be strong enough to exactly cancel out the magnetic force, thus the electrons follow the straight arrow (dashed).|$|E

40|$|In Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) {{of large}} {{structures}} we often need to process sensor data from multiple non-simultaneously recorded <b>measurement</b> <b>setups.</b> These setups share some sensors in common, the so-called reference sensors that are fixed {{for all the}} measurements, while the other sensors are moved from one setup to the next. To obtain the modal parameters of the investigated structure {{it is necessary to}} process the data of all the <b>measurement</b> <b>setups</b> and normalize it as the unmeasured background excitation of each setup might be different. In this paper we present system identification results using a merging technique for data-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI), where the data is merged and normalized prior to the identification step. Like this, the different <b>measurement</b> <b>setups</b> can be processed in one step and {{do not have to be}} analyzed separately. We apply this new merging technique to measurement data of the Heritage Court Tower in Vancouver, Canada. ...|$|R

The ideal OMT splits the two polarizations at the dual-polarized port into two standard single-polarized ports and such arrangement allows the direct measurement of all the scattering parameters of the DUT (either by using a 4-port vector network analyzer (VNA) or a 2-port one with 2 single-polarized loads used in several combinations).|$|E

Relevant standards are supported for other bus systems as well, such as FIBEX for FlexRay, LDF for LIN and EDS/DCF/XDD for CANopen.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{challenges}} for HW or SW designers is to validate their simulation data with empirical data. They require some type of utility or tool to measure power consumption and compare with their simulation data. One of these methods to capture real time data to validate power or thermal models is an infrared <b>measurement</b> <b>setup</b> developed by F.J. Mesa-Martinez, J.Nayfach-Battilana and J. Renau at University of California Santa Cruz. Their approach is to capture thermal maps using infrared cameras with high spatial resolution and high frame rate. Then a genetic algorithm finds a power equation for each floorplan block of processor that produces the capture thermal map to give detailed information about power breakdown (leakage and dynamic). They also developed an image processing filter to increase the thermal image accuracy. The biggest challenge for this approach is to obtain a detailed power map from the thermal measurements. There is no direct mapping between measured information and power. A genetic algorithm was developed described in reference that iterates multiple thermal traces and compares them with the results from thermal simulator {{to find the best}} power correlation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{advantages}} of the use of optical sensors, and in particular sensors based on FBG (Fibre Bragg Grating), for the analysis of dynamical interaction between pantograph and catenary are discussed. The experience of a real application where FBG sensors were used on a pantograph of underground vehicle is presented and the related experimental results are discussed. Optical sensors are very suitable for the analysis of pantograph-catenary interaction because they are intrinsically electrically insulated and insensitive to the electromagnetic disturbances and they do not need electrical power supply: these features make the optical <b>measurement</b> <b>setup</b> very simple with respect to the electrical <b>measurement</b> <b>setup</b> for the particular application. This paper aims at presenting the main features of FBG sensors and at comparing performances of optical sensor and traditional electrical sensors by means of results of experimental tests performed to analyse the interaction between pantograph and catenary for an underground line.
