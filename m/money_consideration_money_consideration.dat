40|$|Consumers {{often make}} product choices that involve the <b>consideration</b> of <b>money</b> and time. Building on dual-process models, the authors propose {{that these two}} basic {{resources}} activate qualitatively different modes of processing: while money is processed analytically, time is processed more affectively. Importantly, this distinction then influences the stability of consumer preferences. An initial set of three experiments demonstrates that, compared with a control condition free of the <b>consideration</b> of either resource, <b>money</b> <b>consideration</b> generates significantly more violations of transitivity in product choice, while time consideration has no such impact. The next three experiments use multiple approaches to demonstrate the role of different processing modes associated with <b>money</b> versus time <b>consideration</b> in this result. Finally, two additional experiments test {{ways in which the}} cognitive noise associated with the analytical processing that <b>money</b> <b>consideration</b> triggers could be reduced, resulting in more consistent preferences...|$|R

[...] Similarly, when the Sudeten German heroine of Die goldene Stadt allows herself to be seduced and impregnated by a Czech, she drowns herself. Even fairy tales were put to use for this purpose, with Cinderella being presented as a tale of how the prince's racial instincts lead him to reject the stepmother's alien blood for the racially pure maiden.

All our motives are mixed; and his wicked desire to do evil to Lady Mason in return for the evil which she had done to him was mingled with professional energy, and an ambition to win a cause that ought to be won--especially a cause which others had failed to win. He said to himself, on finding those names and dates among old Mr. Usbech's papers, that there was still an opportunity of doing something considerable in this Orley Farm Case, and he had made up his mind to do it.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a remanufacturing system with two streams of returned products and different variability levels (high and low). The arrival of returns with high variability is modeled with a hyperexponential renewal process {{and that of}} returns with low variability is modeled with a Poisson process. The reman-ufacturing facility can process the returned products in two ways. For the first way, each type of returns is remanufactured by a dedicated capacity. For the second way, returns from two different markets are remanufactured by a merged capacity. Analytical queueing models with the time value of <b>money</b> <b>consideration</b> are proposed for the admission decision, which decides on the acceptance or not of returned products based on quality and processing time. The proposed modeling determines the admission decision threshold value {{in order to maximize}} the total expected profit of the remanufacturing system. Our analysis also allows to study the interaction between the overall utilization and the arrival process variability. The results show the impact of the model parameters on the admission decision value and the total expected discounted profit. Also, the total expected discounted profit under the separated and merged capacities are compared...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{financial}} structure of megaprojects, {{known in the}} literature as project finance, {{is characterized by the}} creation of a legally independent project company financed with a concentrated equity ownership and a high level of non-recourse debt. Research in this field may yield new ideas and theories about the existing theoretical framework on capital structure, stakeholder management and risk management. A case-study is analyzed in this paper: the financial performance of the first metro line in Seville (Spain). In spite of previous cost overruns in the construction stage, the present operation stage is considered successful {{from the point of view}} of social and financial profitability, whereby the risks have been theoretically transferred to stakeholders, as defined by Value for <b>Money</b> <b>considerations.</b> The objective of this study involves: first to determine whether this megaproject meets the expectations for which it was created in terms of hope of return of the shareholders, and the expectations of the economic and financial feasibility under a change of subsidy policies; and secondly to determine whether the conditions remain for not including the investment as public debt. This issue is crucial in a budgetary constraint context for the planning of future metro lines. By taking this first experience into account, this article also provides information for potential participants in the projects of the new metro lines, which are currently in the planning stage...|$|R
40|$|Firms are {{resource}} integrating actors, which co-create value {{with the}} consumer of service. Value co-creation occurs through the consumer’s {{acceptance of a}} value proposition afforded by bundles of resources in a specific use context. Service is exchanged for service. Hence, the provider of a service must also receive a value proposition afforded by bundles of resources in a specific use context in return. This is the consideration. In the service for service exchange between provider and consumer, consideration {{can be viewed as}} the exchange value. In traditional (single) markets, exchange value manifests as purchase price, and hence the <b>consideration</b> to the firm is <b>money.</b> <b>Consideration</b> {{does not have to be}} financial in nature (non-pecuniary). However, if the purpose of a firm is to achieve superior financial performance, at some point a service-providing firm must receive financial consideration. Ideally, the non-pecuniary consideration received as part of one exchange should be integrated into a different exchange e. g. in two-sided markets. This process is the commodification of non-pecuniary consideration or monetization. In the Digital Economy (DE), many types of non-pecuniary consideration are used (e. g. personal data). Despite certain success stories (e. g. Google) monetization is still a challenge for many firms in the DE and it is the purpose of this research to identify why some firms are better at the commodification of non-pecuniary consideration in the DE...|$|R
40|$|Health care {{resources}} available for medical procedures, including pharmaceuticals, are limited worldwide. Health economic evidence is now accepted {{as an essential}} component of health technology appraisal, realizing the importance of value for <b>money</b> <b>considerations</b> for a more efficient (cost-effective) prescribing. Regulatory agencies in more and more countries perform economic evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis in order to decide about reimbursement of a new and almost always more expensive drug. Pharmacoeconomy is now acknowledged as a science. Cost-effective analysis is just one of its approaches, measuring cost in money and benefit in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Year, a new outcome measure which combines quantity/quality of additional life-years gained with the new drug/technology. A growing body of pharmacoeconomic evidence about new anticoagulant drugs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is now available. Most of this evidence comes from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, the most referenced regulatory agency in the world. Compared to current standard therapies (warfarin), dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban are cost-effective treatments for the whole population of patients with atrial fibrillation, independently of poor/good international normalized ratio control (time in therapeutic range) and risk stratification for stroke (CHADS 2 score). Significant innovation and the lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke coupled with the new drugs are the key drivers of these results...|$|R

In becoming the son-in-law of a millionaire he would receive the honest congratulations of all his friends,--on condition that he received some comfortable fraction out of the millions, but he knew well that he would subject himself to their ridicule were he to take the girl and lose the plunder. If he were to answer them now as they would have him answer he would commit himself to the girl without any bargain as to the plunder. And yet what else was there for him to do? He must be a brave man who can stand up before a girl and declare that he will love her for ever,--on condition that she shall have so many thousand pounds; but he must be more than brave, he will be heroic, who can do so in the presence not only of the girl but of the girl's mother and married sister as well.

He had a double purpose in accepting Clayton's offer. Primarily, the <b>money</b> <b>consideration</b> influenced him strongly, as the ape was no longer a source of revenue to him, having consistently refused to perform upon the stage after having discovered Tarzan. It was as though the beast had suffered himself to be brought from his jungle home and exhibited before thousands of curious spectators for the sole purpose of searching out his long lost friend and master, and, having found him, considered further mingling with the common herd of humans unnecessary. However that may be, the fact remained that no amount of persuasion could influence him even to show himself upon the music hall stage, and upon the single occasion that the trainer attempted force the results were such that the unfortunate man considered himself lucky to have escaped with his life. All that saved him was the accidental presence of Jack Clayton, who had been permitted to visit the animal in the dressing room reserved for him at the music hall, and had immediately interfered when he saw that the savage beast meant serious mischief.|$|R
