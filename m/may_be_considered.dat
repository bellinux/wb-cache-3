5|$|The 1947 Sun Bowl was the Bearcats' first {{official}} bowl game, but two 1902 post-season games in New Orleans, Louisiana, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> the first bowl games in Cincinnati football history.

Following the conclusion of its football schedule, the Bearcats were invited to New Orleans by the Southern Athletic Club to play a football game on New Year's Day. Cincinnati easily defeated the Athletic Club team, and at the victory party following the win, students from nearby Louisiana State University invited the Cincinnati players {{to come to their}} school to play another game. That game, which took place a few days later, resulted in a 22–0 Cincinnati win, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> the first bowl game.|$|E

Walkthroughs may alternatively be set up as a playthrough, where players record themselves playing through a game and upload or live-stream it to the internet.

5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available.

5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b> Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered,</b> however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E
40|$|Hundreds of {{societies}} publish journals {{in collaboration with}} publishers. Some <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>considering</b> how and whether to renegotiate or go out to tender. Some <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>considering</b> whether they can/should/wish to change the business model of the journal (e. g. by a move to Open Access). Other societies <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>considering</b> using an external publisher for the first time. This guide, based on our experience, is written for all of these. In their negotiations with publishers learned societies – especially smaller ones – may have difficulty articulating their requirements and assessing the publishers’ offerings. This is true where they wish to compare the newer models with typical "conventional" models, or simply compare different conventional offerings. The reasons are complex and include: * {{lack of knowledge of}} the publishing industry {{on the part of the}} society's executive staff (who cannot always find the time to acquire the knowledge); * the "author/research funder pays" models, which, whilst becoming more prevalent in the domains of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), appear (but <b>may</b> not actually <b>be)</b> rather less feasible in other domains.
