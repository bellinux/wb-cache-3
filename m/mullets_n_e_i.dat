The nighttime electron density (<b>N</b> <b>e),</b> electron temperature (T <b>e),</b> ion density (<b>N</b> <b>i),</b> ion temperature (T i) and whistler counts (C w) are investigated. A {{statistical analysis of}} the box-and-whisker method is applied to see if data {{of two or more}} groups under study are significantly different. A cross-examination of temporal variations before and after shows that <b>N</b> <b>e</b> and <b>N</b> <b>i</b> (C w) increases (decreases) appear 10 – 20 days before the earthquake. A comparison of data over the epicenter and those over its reference area can be employed to discriminate the earthquake-related anomalies from global effects. Results prove that anomalous enhancements of <b>N</b> <b>e,</b> <b>N</b> <b>i,</b> and T i occur specifically around the epicenter area.
