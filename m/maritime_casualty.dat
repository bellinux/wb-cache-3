40|$|ABSTRACTShip {{damage caused}} by <b>maritime</b> <b>casualties</b> leads to marine {{pollution}} and loss of life and property. To prevent serious damage from <b>maritime</b> <b>casualties,</b> several types of safety regulations are applied in ship design. Damage stability regulation {{is one of the}} most important safety issues. Designs of ships for long international voyages must comply with these regulations. Current regulations, however, do not consider the characteristics of the operating route of each ship and reflect only ship size and type of cargo. In this paper, a damage safety assessment was undertaken for a ship carrying radioactive waste in actual wave conditions. Damage cases for safety assessment were constructed on the basis of safety regulations and related research results. Hull form, internal arrangement, loading condition and damage condition were modeled for damage safety simulation. The safety simulation was performed and analyzed for 10 damage cases with various wave heights, frequency and angle of attack on an operating route. Based on evaluation results, a design alternative was generated, and it was also simulated. These results confirmed that damage safety analysis is highly important in the design stage in consideration of the operating route characteristics by simulation. Thus a ship designer can improve safety from damage in this manner...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} and analyse the types and circumstances of all natural and non-natural deaths among seamen on board Danish merchant ships. METHODS: Data on 147 cases {{were obtained from}} maritime authorities, an insurance company, shipping companies, hospitals, death registers, and death certificates in the period from 1986 - 93. RESULTS: The 53 natural deaths were dominated by cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. Insufficient treatment on board {{was identified as a}} contributing factor for death in some cases. Medical advice was not always sought and the advice given was in some cases insufficient. 73 fatal accidents were identified. The incidence of accidents of 5. 29 / 10, 000 person-years was 11. 5 times higher than the incidence of 0. 46 / 10, 000 for the Danish male workforce ashore. 23 accidents (31 %) were due to <b>maritime</b> <b>casualties</b> and 26 (36 %) were occupational accidents. The remaining 24 (33 %) were accidents during off duty hours including six self intoxications. Rough weather, inadequate awareness of safety, lack of use of personal protection devices, and inexperience were associated with many of the fatal injuries directly related to work. Alcohol played a major part in 12 out of 18 fatal injuries occurring during off duty hours. CONCLUSIONS: The maritime workplace was identified as a high risk workplace and in many aspects differs from the conditions ashore. Acute diseases and serious injuries pose special risks to seamen {{because of a lack of}} direct access to professional medical care at sea. Primary prevention of certain diseases is needed and possible. Improved training, improved systems of work, improved safety awareness, and greater use of personal protection devices are needed to prevent fatal injuries.

40|$|Statistics of <b>maritime</b> <b>casualties</b> {{continue}} to be the driver of improvement of human performance or rather reduction of human error. Still, too many accidents occur and some {{can be traced back to}} the lack of proper training and the lack of certain required skills and competences of the seafarer. One possible means of performance improvement is envisaged to come from (additional) high quality training, using maritime simulator systems. If so, (additional) costs will occur. But if the amount of the increased costs of training is less than the funds to be saved by avoiding accidents, it will justify that such trainig efforts should take place. The overall objective of this thesis is thus to demonstrate how and by how much, well structured, high quality, maritime simulator training can positively influence the safety and economic efficiency of shipping operations. This requires a description of the education and training efforts, simulator applications, human error catagories, performance improvement and the costing and comparison of these various items. The main and novel research efforts will be to determine what percentage performance improvement can be achieved with high quality simulator training. This is done by observations of groups of simulator trainees during various and multiple types of exercises. When the simulator training is performed in the structured manner as described, it should lead to an improved performance and thus a reduction of the number of maritime accidents by an appreciable percentage. The overall result when implemented, could then be that shipping operations become both safer and economically more efficient. As this is usually seen as a contradiction, in which safety is regarded to cost money and economy to generate money this initiative would indeed be worthwhile...|$|R

E-mail:hazmirusli@usim. edu. my. ［Abstract］The Straits of Malacca and Singapore {{are two of}} the world's most {{significant}} maritime chokepoints with navigational traffic amounting to approximately 74, 000 vessels annually. Part III of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) prescribes that vessels and aircraft of all flags may exercise the right of unimpeded transit passage when navigating through straits used for international navigation. Conceptually, through the introduction of the transit passage regime, the UNCLOS has prohibited any form of toll imposition on transiting ships. The conferment of this right to ships of all flags has created a difficult situation for the States bordering these busy waterways, particularly in protecting the marine environment of such straits from vessel-source pollution. Australia has been successful in designating the Torres Strait as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) in 2005 ，with compulsory pilotage as the applicable Associated Protective Measure (APM), thus, minimising the risks of <b>maritime</b> <b>casualties</b> in the said waterway. Assuming that the PSSA designation is also extended to the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, the implementation of the most potentially suitable APM would probably materialise through the introduction of a “cost recovery mechanism” which could be in the form of toll-levying scheme, given the nature of the Straits which are busy with transiting traffic. The funds collected from toll collection could be used to maintain and upgrade the aids to navigation installed along the Straits, which, in turn, would enhance the safety of navigation, hence reducing the risks of maritime accidents that may pose threats to the marine environment of the Straits. This paper aims to discuss the question of the viability and practicability of the application of this toll-levying scheme if such is introduced in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore and the potential legal and political implications arising out of such an implementation. ［文摘］马六甲和新加坡海峡是世界上两个重要的海上通道，每年有总计约 7. 4 万艘船舶的航行交通量。 1982 年《联合国海洋法公约》第三部分规定，所有船旗国的船舶和飞机，在通过用于国际航行的海峡时，都享有不受阻碍的过境通行权。从概念上来说，通过引入过境通行制度，《联合国海洋法公约》已经禁止对过境船舶征收任何形式的通行费。给予所有船旗国船舶这一权利，令毗邻这些繁忙航道的国家处境困难，尤其是在保护海峡海洋环境免受来自船舶的污染方面。澳大利亚已于 2005 年成功指定托雷斯海峡为“特别敏感海域”，并以强制引航作为可适用的相关保护措施，这有助于托雷斯海峡海上事故风险的最小化。假定将马六甲和新加坡海峡也指定为特别敏感海域，鉴于其繁忙的过境交通性质，通过引入“成本回收机制”(以通行费征收制度的形式) ，或许能实现最适宜的相关保护措施的实施。收取通行费而筹集的基金可以用于维护和更新沿整个马六甲和新加坡海峡设置的助航设备，提高航行安全，从而降低可能对海峡海洋环境造成威胁的海上事故的风险。本文旨在探讨在马六甲和新加坡海峡引入这种通行费征收制度的可行性和实用性问题，以及实施中可能引起的法律和政治影响...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{knowledge}} available on the importance of ergonomics for successful (and unsuccessful) systems. Domain specific handbooks, guidelines and standards can be found also for the maritime industry. Yet, the deteriorating figure of <b>maritime</b> <b>casualties</b> and the high incidence of occupational accidents suggest this knowledge is not utilised to its full potential. Emphasis in this thesis was given to the knowledge base of ergonomics in vessel design and operation. Specifically, the aim was to develop a value proposition of maritime ergonomics, positioning the potential core values of ergonomics that can be delivered to stakeholders within and outside the maritime transport system. This project has therefore taken an exploratory qualitative approach. Seven studies have been performed, structured around three themes: maritime ergonomics, the effects of maritime ergonomics on operational performance, and the development and transfer of ergonomics knowledge. The methods used were mainly literature studies, individual and focus group interviews, observation and case study. The results of the studies show a link between ergonomics and the value creating process in the maritime transport system. The developed value proposition describes the value for the employee in terms of improved health and well-being, learning, performance, skill discretion and independence in life. Values for the company include increased operational performance and flexibility, advantages in recruiting and retaining personnel and organizational learning. Values for the sector include competitive strength, attractiveness of work and increased organizational learning across the industry. Values for the society include reduced costs for health care and social security, reduced environmental impact, and a sustainable working life. To conclude, these results {{can be seen as a}} first step to make visible the effects of ergonomics management on overall systems performance in the maritime domain. Suggestions for further work include complementary studies to investigate the feasibility in early crew participation and incorporating ergonomics methods and techniques in the toolboxes of naval architects and other system builders...|$|R

40|$|For {{organizations}} whose {{objective is}} not necessarily the maximization of a financial quantity, there is little written in the economics and management literature about methods that quantify their effectiveness. Potential users of such methodologies are typically governmental organizations and agencies to whom Congress allocates funding periodically, but may also include many nonprofit organizations. Such research is importantly needed because government is no longer making outlay allocations on a merely historical basis, but is using as a criterion how effectively an organization uses its resources in meeting its objectives. In this paper we analyze the Maritime Safety Program of the U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), which is responsible for monitoring the quality of vessels that sail in U. S. waters, and present measures of effectiveness (MOEs) for the Program. We do this at two levels of activity: at an overall program level (Level I) and at a component activity level (Level II). Poisson models are used to construct the MOEs using data on <b>maritime</b> <b>casualties</b> (accidents) between 1990 [...] 1993 from the real-time Marine Safety Management System (MSMS) database maintained by the Coast Guard. A feature of the empirical methodology is the Bayesian imputation of missing data. The MOEs constructed here have at least four important uses. First, as the name suggests, they perform the function that financial quantities such as returns on equity or returns on sales perform for private-sector organizations [...] -that is, they are indicators of efficiency. Second, they can be used as inputs into allocative decisions within the organization. For example, the Level II MOEs can be used as inputs into a programming problem that determines the optimal allocation of resources among component activities. Third, internal performance evaluation across USCG Programs or across Port Units (called Marine Safety Offices) can be based on their respective Level I MOEs. Fourth, and possibly the most important long-run consideration, MOEs provide the basis for better regulation by the government. Without MOEs the nature of regulation is probably suboptimal. By adopting these MOEs as criteria, it will be easier for the government to redesign those aspects of its regulation of the Coast Guard which curtail incentives. measures of effectiveness, government agencies, Poisson models, missing data...|$|R

In order to decrease the risk of grounding in such cases, this paper explores the ship movement during navigation when an extraordinary event occurs, such as steering system failure that affects the vessel’s direction directly and speed indirectly. One way to determine the ship movement in such circumstances is by simulating the ship movement on the navigational simulator according to the predefined scenarios, as explained in this paper. A total of 60 scenarios were researched, in the process of which ship type, ship size, ship speed and rudder deflection angle were varied. During the simulation, all relevant data concerning current movement of the ship and a graphical display of the performed simulation were recorded every 30 seconds. On the basis of the simulation results it is possible to determine the worst case scenario which can be used to define the consequence of grounding, one of the parameters necessary for the assessment of the risk of grounding...|$|R
