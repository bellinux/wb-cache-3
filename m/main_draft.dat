25|$|The 24th Battalion {{was formed}} on 1 February 1940 at Narrow Neck Military Camp with {{personnel}} drawn {{largely from the}} Auckland region. It {{was the first of}} three infantry battalions that formed part what was initially known as the Third Echelon of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and which would later be designated the 6th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd New Zealand Division. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clayden Shuttleworth, of the New Zealand Staff Corps, a cadre of 150 officers and non-commissioned officers underwent training aimed to prepare them for the task of preparing the volunteers that would make up the bulk of the battalion's personnel. After an initial period at Narrow Neck, the men moved to Papakura Military Camp where the <b>main</b> <b>draft</b> of the battalion arrived on 15 May 1940 for training.|$|E

50|$|In June 1993 Yeltsin decreed the {{creation}} of a special constitutional convention to examine the draft constitution that he had presented in April. This convention was designed to circumvent the parliament, which was working on its own draft constitution. As expected, the two <b>main</b> <b>drafts</b> contained contrary views of legislative-executive relations. The convention, which included delegates from major political and social organizations and the 89 subnational jurisdictions, approved a compromise draft constitution in July 1993, incorporating some aspects of the parliament's draft. The parliament failed to approve the draft, however.|$|R

40|$|Various {{theoretical}} {{properties of}} the structure function are evaluated. Additional functions are constructed to describe the overall influence of stratification, the anisotropy and intermittency of the turbulence, and the asymmetry of the <b>main</b> <b>drafts.</b> These functions and the usual spectral decomposition are computed from aircraft-measured turbulence data collected in nocturnal boundary layers and in turbulence over mountainous terrain. Certain features of the turbulence are found to depend more on stability than on the external situation. Three general types of turbulence are found: 1) intermittent turbulence driven by shear-driven overturning; 2) continuous turbulence where strong drafts {{in the presence of}} shear are characterized by sharp boundaries or microfronts, particularly on their upstream sides; and 3) weaker continuous turbulence. The costructure fields are generally consistent with vertical gradient transfer. However, the bora turbulence on larger scales is dominated by horizontal motions perpendicular to the mean shea...|$|R
50|$|Self-trained as an architect, Will Bruder {{received}} a Bachelor of Fine Arts in sculpture from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, taking supplemental courses in structural engineering, philosophy, art history, and urban planning. Bruder {{was a student}} of Paolo Soleri, where he acquired field experience in woodwork, metal work, and masonry. In the summer of 1967, Bruder participated in Soleri's Silt Pile Workshop, and in 1968, he was an apprentice of Soleri at his Cosanti studio. Projects that he worked on during that time with Soleri include construction of the concrete vaults of the <b>main</b> <b>drafting</b> room, the 3D Jersey Project, and Soleri's book Arcology: The City in the Image of Man. After graduating from college in 1969, Bruder spent a year as an apprentice of Gunnar Birkerts, where he aided {{in the design of}} the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. In 1973, he obtained registration as an architect and opened his first studio in 1974. In 1987, he was a fellow at the American Academy in Rome.|$|R
50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>drafting</b> sets of four nibs came in two kinds: Gold and Silver. The Silver was for rough tracing paper, and the Gold was for {{plastic film}} (velograph or durables). Drawing boards changed {{as a result}} of {{technical}} pens—a hard (not spongy) surface was required, and when plastic film was used, the static attraction between plastic cursors, T-squares, set-squares etc. meant that as one lifted the edge from the film, the film would rise through static attraction and the ink would blot. The solution was to stick down a plastic sheet (Osalid) that attracted the film more strongly than the drafting instruments. The tracing paper or velograph sheet would be placed on the Osalid sheet stuck onto the drawing board and the air brushed away. Brushing charged the surface, and the film would then be taped taut (but released {{at the end of each}} working day to allow for overnight temperature expansions and contractions).|$|R

5000|$|The AFL {{pre-season}} {{draft is}} {{the drafting of}} uncontracted players to teams in the Australian Football League. The draft is conducted after the national AFL draft and {{before the start of}} the next AFL season. It is conducted at the same time as the AFL rookie draft. The pre-season draft is a place for any uncontracted players to nominate that missed the AFL draft or who were delisted after the <b>main</b> <b>draft.</b> It was first held in 1989 and has been diminishing greatly in its importance; the last five years have only averaged 8 selections per year, compared to over 50 in each of the first five years. [...] It was considered that the pre-season draft only existed to protect the league from writs for restraint-of-trade, but due to the introduction of free agency in 2012, there have been calls to scrap the pre-season draft and extend the free agency period.|$|E
50|$|The NFL {{operates}} {{several other}} drafts {{in addition to}} the NFL draft. The league holds a supplemental draft annually. Clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft. Players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility. The league holds expansion drafts, the most recent happening in 2002 when the Houston Texans began play as an expansion team. Other drafts held by the league include an allocation draft in 1950 to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved All-America Football Conference and a supplemental draft in 1984 to give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the <b>main</b> <b>draft</b> but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the United States Football League or Canadian Football League.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} technological parameters of spinning of 100 % CV Vortex yarns of different counts and its selected geometrical parameters (a lead of helix of wrapping fibre ribbon, yarn diameter) as well as yarn properties. The number of twist of wrapping fibre layer is determined. The effect of the yarn delivery speed, hollow spindle diameter, and the <b>main</b> <b>draft</b> on the hairiness, mass irregularity, tenacity, elongation, resistance to abrasion and bending rigidity of Vortex yarn is observed. The yarn properties are compared with the properties of open-end rotor spun yarns. Slivers of the same spinning lot {{were used for the}} production of both kinds of yarn. The results showed that the delivery speed in combination with spindle diameter affects yarn diameter, hairiness and abrasion resistance. Mass irregularity and imperfections of yarn is mainly affected by the <b>main</b> <b>draft</b> of drafting unit. Technological parameters of spinning do not affect the level of bending rigidity of the Vortex yarn.

40|$|Dissipation can {{fundamentally}} influence quantum many-body {{systems and}} their phase transitions in often counter-intuitive ways. For example, new universality classes emerge in driven-dissipative systems, and dissipation can generate topological effects. Open system dynamics is particularly relevant as {{state of the}} art experiments are able to engineer and control dissipation channels. Concurrently, due to the inapplicability of the framework of equilibrium statistical physics, our understanding of driven-dissipative models remains limited. Here, we explore the influence of dissipation on a paradigmatic driven-dissipative model, hosting a multicritical point and phase transitions breaking discrete and continuous symmetries. We show that already infinitesimal dissipation radically alters the model's phase diagram, resulting in rich phenomena, including a splitting of the multicritical point into two tricritical points, coexistence of phases, and relics of the continuous symmetry in rotated order parameters. Furthermore, we analyze the model's quantum fluctuations and find that the dissipation-induced tricritical points which mark the meeting between first- and second-order symmetry-breaking transitions exhibit anomalous finite fluctuations, as opposed to standard tricritical points arising in $^ 3 He-^ 4 He$ mixtures. Our work has direct implications for a variety of fields, including cold atoms and ions in optical cavities, circuit-quantum electrodynamics, THz light-matter systems as well as optomechanical systems.
