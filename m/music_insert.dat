The crew behind Global Village, namely M.U.D., were very supportive of the more cutting edge live acts, for example Voiteck, Zen Paradox, Soulenoid, Guyver III, Sense and TR-Storm - who were then known as Void - and it gave these guys the opportunity to play before large and often more-into-it or dare I say 'enlightened' audiences. It also gave audiences the opportunity to see these guys because at more mainstream parties or clubs more mainstream music was played." ...|$|E

50|$|To {{a certain}} extent, channel drift can also occur in radio, {{especially}} music radio: see, for instance, {{the transition from}} oldies to classic hits, beautiful music to smooth jazz, and MOR to adult contemporary. In these cases, channel drift occurs when a format's older music becomes less popular or profitable (often due to the fans of that music dying, retiring, and leaving the area, or aging out of advertising demographics) and newer <b>music</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the playlist to draw younger listeners.|$|R

50|$|Serov died, however, in 1871 before {{composing}} {{anything for}} the work. Gedeonov revised his conception as an opera-ballet, with a libretto by Viktor Krïlov, and in 1872 proposed through Vladimir Stasov a collaborative effort by four members of The Mighty Handful - César Cui, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, Modest Mussorgsky and Aleksandr Borodin - who were to write music for the sung portions of the libretto and dramatic action. Ludwig Minkus, {{at that time the}} Bolshoy Kamenniy Theatre's First Imperial Ballet Composer, was to write ballet <b>music</b> to be <b>inserted</b> at various points.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{original}} ballet {{is only about}} 85 minutes long if performed without applause or an intermission, and therefore much shorter than either Swan Lake or The Sleeping Beauty, some modern staged performances have omitted or re-ordered some of the <b>music,</b> or <b>inserted</b> selections from elsewhere, thus adding to the confusion over the suites. In fact, most of the very famous versions of the ballet have had {{the order of the}} dances slightly re-arranged, if they have not actually altered the music. For instance, the 1954 George Balanchine New York City Ballet version adds to Tchaikovsky's score an entr'acte that the composer wrote for act 2 of The Sleeping Beauty, but which is now seldom played in productions of that ballet. It is used as a transition between the departure of the guests and the battle with the mice. Nearly all of the CD and LP recordings of the complete ballet present Tchaikovsky's score exactly as he originally conceived it.|$|R
500|$|Originally, Fincher {{envisioned the}} film's soundtrack to be {{composed}} of 40 cues of vintage music spanning the nearly three decades of the Zodiac story. With music supervisor George Drakoulias, the director searched for the right pop songs that reflected the era, including Three Dog Night's cover of [...] "Easy to Be Hard" [...] because [...] "it's so ingrained in my psyche as being what the summer of '69 sounded like in northern California". Initially, Fincher did not envision an original score for the film, but rather a tapestry of sound design, vintage songs of the period, sound bites and clips of KFRC (an AM radio giant) and [...] "Mathews Top of the Hill Daly City" [...] (home of a prominent hi-fi dealership of the time). The director told the studio {{that he did not}} need a composer and would buy various songs instead. They agreed, but as the film developed, sound designer and longtime Fincher collaborator Ren Klyce felt there were places in some scenes that could have used <b>music.</b> So, he <b>inserted</b> <b>music</b> from two of his favorite soundtracks, David Shire's scores for The Conversation and All the President's Men. Fincher was eager to work with Shire as All the President's Men was one of his favorite films and one of the primary cinematic influences on Zodiac. He reminded Klyce of the deal that he had made with the studio.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{there are}} {{situations}} in an opera which allow for easy insertion of arias. Operas such as The Barber of Seville contained lesson scenes, {{in which the}} singer sings a song {{as part of the}} plot. This lesson scene's status as an [...] "opera within an opera" [...] allowed prima donnas to manipulate Rossini's text more freely than was often possible, even at a time when aria insertions were still fairly typical. Throughout much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a spurious myth positing a [...] "lost original" [...] justified the tendency to <b>insert</b> <b>music</b> into this scene.|$|R
5000|$|Turandot (with Stern's {{scenery and}} costumes, and Fried conducting) opened on 8 January 1913 at the St James's Theatre, London. However, Busoni {{had not been}} to any rehearsals, and when he {{attended}} the first performance he was appalled. Johan Wijsman (the dedicatee of the Berceuse, BV 252), had made an unauthorised reduced version of Busoni's score for a 20-piece theatre orchestra. The producer had <b>inserted</b> <b>music</b> by other composers alongside Busoni's own, and the orchestra was out of tune. Busoni left in a rage after the second act and went to listen to Saint-Saëns' symphonic poem Le Rouet d'Omphale at another concert.|$|R
50|$|The director/producer {{will discuss}} their {{vision for the}} project with the music {{supervisor}}, and how they expect the music to enhance this vision. The visual media will then be spotted by the supervisor - a process of choosing where selected <b>music</b> will be <b>inserted</b> (Schulenberg). Traditional spots include the main title, opening credits, and closing credits, while additional spots are incorporated to trigger emotional responses from viewers (Austin). Scores, or background music, are also an important consideration for enhancing visual media. Scores can range from the background to a dramatic scene to television bumpers - the music signifying leading into or coming back from a commercial break (Schulenberg).|$|R
5000|$|According to The Residents' lore, in 1937, N. Senada premiered his masterpiece, [...] "Pollex Christi", {{which means}} either Thumb of Christ or Big Toe of Christ. This work mainly {{consisted}} of borrowed pieces from other composers, namely Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 and Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, among others. He also left large {{holes in the}} work so that the performers could <b>insert</b> <b>music</b> of their choosing, thus [...] "becoming composers themselves". Senada justified his work with [...] "house" [...] analogies claiming {{that he did not}} make the [...] "bricks" [...] but [...] "cemented them together"; he was not the [...] "architect", just the [...] "builder".|$|R
5000|$|After <b>music</b> {{has been}} <b>inserted</b> into a {{production}} - a movie for example - a musical cue sheet is completed containing {{all the details}} of the music in that movie. This cue sheet is then submitted to The Music People and the movie's producers are charged a fee. This fee is to obtain a [...] "Synchronization Licence". A [...] "Sync Licence" [...] gives the movie's producers the permission to [...] "marry" [...] a piece of music in a timed relationship to a piece of film, videotape, etc. The fee for a [...] "Sync Licence" [...] will vary. The fee usually increases as the movie's audience increases.|$|R
5000|$|The series {{features}} {{two pieces}} of theme <b>music</b> and one <b>insert</b> theme. Angela performed the opening theme entitled [...] "Shangri-La", the insert theme [...] "Proof" [...] in episode 15, and the ending theme [...] "Separation". Sōkyū no Fafner: RIGHT OF LEFT, a 50-minute prequel special to the television series, aired on December 29, 2005. The ending theme [...] "Peace of Mind" [...] for the special was also performed by Angela. The TV series was originally licensed by Geneon under the shortened title, Fafner, but has since been out of print. The series is set make its North American television debut on the Funimation Channel on October 29, 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Changes {{specific}} to [...] "The End" [...] include bluescreen elements {{added to the}} opening scene with skutters - small maintenance robots — placed in the foreground of Rimmer and Lister. Silhouettes of the crew's heads {{were added to the}} foreground of George McIntyre's funeral scene. Background noise was added to the soundtrack {{to give the impression that}} the ship was busy with a full crew on board. The George McIntyre funeral scene was trimmed down, with shots that did not work removed, and a new shot of the canister leaving the ship was <b>inserted.</b> <b>Music</b> and sound effects were added to Cat's entrance, with hissing noise added when he tries to frighten Lister and Rimmer.|$|R
5000|$|Music, by veteran TV composers Mike Post, Pete Carpenter, and Walter Murphy, long-time {{collaborators}} with Cannell, {{played a}} large part in the series. In addition to frequent quick-cutting of visuals {{in time with the}} incidental music, the show also <b>inserted</b> <b>music</b> video style interludes, complete with original, script-specific [...] "pop songs" [...] written by Stephen Geyer (co-writer [...] "Theme for The Greatest American Hero", [...] "Theme for Hardcastle & McCormick", [...] "Theme for Blossom", etc.) and Post, and sung by (usually) semi-obscure pop and rock vocalists (for example, David Pack singing [...] "Signs of Human Error" [...] in the episode [...] "Playback"). Notable vocalists include José Feliciano, Richie Havens, Taj Mahal, Timothy B. Schmit, Jennifer Warnes.|$|R
500|$|... "Pinkeye" [...] was {{the first}} South Park episode to feature a cold open, or an opening scene jumping right into the story before the opening credits are shown. In all {{previous}} episodes, {{and the majority of}} those following it, the episode starts after the opening credits and follows a three-act model, more in the style of a short film than a traditional television episode. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] {{was the first}} episode in which Kenny's death was a key element of the episode and a catalyst of the plot, rather than a throwaway gag. It was also the first time Kenny died multiple times: once in the beginning, once as a zombie and once at the end when he is resurrected a second time. The blood featured in the episode was deliberately designed to look primitive as a reference to The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone that served as a precursor to South Park, in which the blood was literally drawn with a Sharpie marker. For the final scene when Kenny comes back to life a second time, the dramatic <b>music</b> was <b>inserted</b> at the last moment by Parker with a synthesizer.|$|R
