40|$|Abstract- To {{help guide}} the {{development}} of multi-sensor machine vision systems for defect detection in lumber, a fundamental understanding of wood defects is needed. The purpose {{of this research was}} to advance the basic understanding of defects in lumber by describing them in terms of parameters that can be derived from color and x-ray scanning technologies and to demonstrate how these parameters can be used to differentiate defects in lumber. Color and x-ray images of intergrown knots, bark pockets, stain / <b>mineral</b> <b>streak,</b> and clearwood were collected for red oak (Quercus rubra), Eastern white pine, (Pinus strobus), and sugar maple, (Acer saccharum) Parameters were measured for each defect class from the images and class differences were tested using analysis of variance techniques (ANOVA) and Tukey’s pair-wise comparisons with = 0. 05. Discriminant classifiers were then developed to demonstrate that an in-depth knowledge of how defect parameters relate between defect types could be used to develop the best possible classification methods. Classifiers developed using the knowledge of defect parameter relationships were found to provide higher classification accuracies for all defects and species than those which used all parameters and where variable selection procedures had been used...|$|E

50|$|Mockernut hickory is {{extremely}} sensitive to fire {{because of the}} low insulating capacity of the hard, flinty bark. Mockernut {{is not subject to}} severe loss from disease. The main fungus of hickory is Poria spiculosa, a trunk rot. This fungus kills the bark, which produces a canker, causes heart rot and decay, and can seriously degrade the tree. <b>Mineral</b> <b>streaks</b> and sapsucker-induced streaks also degrade the lumber. In general, the hard, strong, and durable wood of hickories makes them relatively resistant to decay fungi. Most fungi cause little, if any, decay in small, young trees.|$|R
40|$|Wood edge glued {{panels are}} used {{extensively}} in the furniture and cabinetry industries. They are used to make doors, tops, and sides of solid wood furniture and cabinets. Since lightly stained furniture and cabinets are gaining in popularity, there is an increasing demand to color sort the parts used to make these edge glued panels. The goal of the sorting processing is to create panels that are uniform in both color and intensity across their visible surface. If performed manually, the color sorting of edge-glued panel parts is very labor intensive and prone to error. This paper describes a complete machine vision system for performing this sort. This system uses two color line scan cameras for image input and a specially designed custom computing machine to allow real-time implementation. Users define the number of color classes {{that are to be}} used. An “out ” class is provided to handle unusually colored parts. The system removes areas of character mark, e. g., knots, <b>mineral</b> <b>streak,</b> etc., from consideration when assigning a color class to a part. The system also includes a better face algorithm for determining which part face would be the better to put {{on the side of the}} panel that will show. The throughput is two linear feet per second. Only a four inch between part spacing is required. This system has under gone extensive in plant testing and will be commercially available in the very near future. The results of this testing will be presented...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} of the color image analysis is to identify surface stains and other small defects such as small worm holes or small pin knots {{that are hard to}} detect in either the laser image or the X-ray image. However, the analysis of the color image is fully capable of detecting and identifying any of the visible defects that have been mentioned throughout the course of the discussion in the last two chapters. That is to say the system is capable of identifying all these defects in the form that they would present themselves {{at this stage of the}} processing, i. e., after the analysis of the laser image, L(i, j), and the analysis of the X-ray image, X(i, j), have both been completed. The complete list of defects that the analysis of the color image must be able to handle include surface stain, small or shallow <b>mineral</b> <b>streak,</b> small or shallow knots, small holes, wane containing bark, and small splits, i. e., special versions of all the defects that system is supposed to be able to identify. Note that all of these defects manifest themselves as a discoloration of the board’s surface and hence are detectable in the color image. The color image of a board’s face is obtained using a color line-scan camera. The line-scan camera provides raw color image, CRAW(i, j), that has higher cross board spatial resolution than the raw images provided by either of the other two imaging modalities, i. e., LRAW(i, j) an...|$|E
5000|$|The streak (also called [...] "powder color") of {{a mineral}} {{is the color}} of the powder {{produced}} when it is dragged across an un-weathered surface. Unlike the apparent color of a mineral, which for most minerals can vary considerably, the trail of finely ground powder generally has a more consistent characteristic color, and is thus an important diagnostic tool in mineral identification. If no streak seems to be made, the <b>mineral's</b> <b>streak</b> is said to be white or colorless. Streak is particularly important as a diagnostic for opaque and colored materials. It is less useful for silicate minerals, most of which have a white streak or are too hard to powder easily.|$|R

50|$|The {{colors in}} the cliffs are created by the large amounts of {{minerals}} in the rock. The cliffs are composed of the Munising Formation of 500-million-year-old Cambrian Period sandstone. The Munising Formation sits atop Precambrian sandstone of the Jacobsville Formation. The mottled red Jacobsville Formation is the oldest rock in the park. On top of the Munising Formation is the younger Au Train Formation from the Ordovician Period. The Au Train Formation is a hard sandstone and acts as a cap over the other layers. Streaks {{on the face of}} the cliffs come from the groundwater leaching out of the rock. With it come iron (red), manganese (black-white), limonite (yellow-brown), copper (pink-green), and other minerals. As the water evaporates, these <b>minerals</b> leave <b>streaks</b> of color.|$|R

40|$|Metamorphic core {{complexes}} (hereafter MCC) {{revealed in}} the Transbaikalia have similar features of their patterns. Three levels can be distinguished by structural­material indicators: core, zone of mylonites (dynamically metamorphosed rocks) and overlying formations. The cores are composed of the Paleozoic granites and granitogneisses. Zones of mylonites skirt the cores and are characterized by various tectonites which are formed {{at the expense of}} the core rocks. The overlying formations include volcanogenic­sedimentary series of the Mesozoic and the Upper Palaeozoic. The rocks are not metamorphosed, yet subject to brittle deformations. Structurally, they are detached and deposited above the zone of mylonites. In Transbaikalia, MCC are characterized by synmetamorphic structural paragenesises of one type: low­angle schistosity, micro­ and macro­structures (folds, <b>mineral</b> <b>streaking,</b> boudinage, pressure shadows, C–S structure, kick­bends). According to the kinematic analyses, they were formed by the simple shear mechanism along the zones of deeply penetrating regional dislocations which plunged in the south­eastward direction. Tectonic transportation of the materials developed in the same direction, i. e. the top parts of tectono­stratigraphic sections were displaced against the lower parts in the south­eastward direction. Extension deformations tended in the north­west – south­east direction. Such movements facilitated formation of synthetic listric normal faults and rift basins. The most intensive tectonic exposure period is determined as 112 – 123 mln years, while the period of metamorphism is assessed as 140 – 130 mln years. The rocks in depth of the deep dislocation were transformed in conditions of amphibole facies of metamorphism (Т= 590 – 640 °С; Р= 3. 2 – 4. 6 kbar). According to our structural-­geological, petrological and isotopic data, the age of the majority of the metamorphic formations of the Transbaikalia is determined as the Late Mesozoic. They were formed in the extension regime due collapse of the Late Mesozoic orogeny, that was caused by accretion­collision events during the Early Mesozoic. Thickening of the continental crust contributed to increase of heat flow and higher plasticity at the crustal bottom. The orogen was thus unstable and flowing and caused regional extension and dislocations at the middle­crust level. Thinning of the crust was accompanied by isostatic uplifting which facilitated emergence of the structural metamorphic complexes of the middle­crust levels on the surface and formation of the metamorphic core complexes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Biogeochemistry investigates {{chemical}} cycles which {{influence or}} {{are influenced by}} biological activity. Astrobiology studies the origin, evolution and distribution {{of life in the}} universe. The biogeochemical Fe cycle has controlled major nutrient cycles such as the C cycle throughout geological time. Iron sulfide minerals may have provided energy and surfaces for the first pioneer organisms on Earth. Banded iron formations document the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. To assess the potential habitability of planets other than Earth one looks for water, an energy source and a C source. On Mars, for example, Fe minerals have provided evidence for the past presence of liquid water on its surface and would provide a viable energy source. Here we present Mössbauer spectroscopy investigations of Fe and C cycle interactions in both ancient and modern environments. Experiments to simulate the diagenesis of banded iron formations indicate that the formation of ferrous minerals depends on the amount of biomass buried with ferric precursors rather than on the atmospheric composition at the time of deposition. Mössbauer spectra further reveal the mutual stabilisation of Fe-organic matter complexes against mineral transformation and decay of organic matter into CO 2. This corresponds to observation of a ‘rusty carbon sink’ observed in modern sediments. The stabilisation of Fe-organic matter may also aid transport of particulate Fe in the water column while having on adverse effect on the bioavailability of Fe. In the modern oxic ocean, Fe is insoluble and particulate Fe represents an important source. Collecting that particulate Fe yields small sample sizes that would pose a challenge for conventional Mössbauer experiments. We demonstrate that the unique properties of the beam used in synchrotron-based Mössbauer applications can be utilized for studying such samples effectively. Reactive Fe species often occur in amorphous or nanoparticulate form in the environment and are therefore difficult to study with standard mineralogical tools. Sequential extraction techniques are commonly used as proxies. We provide an example where Mössbauer spectroscopy can replace sequential extraction techniques where mineralogical information is sought. Where mineral separation is needed, for example in the investigation of Fe or S isotope fractionation, Mössbauer spectroscopy can help to optimize sequential extraction procedures. This can be employed in large number of investigations of soils and sediments, potentially even for mineral separation to study Fe and S isotope fractionation in samples returned from Mars, which might reveal signatures of biological activity. When looking for the possibility of life outside Earth, Jupiter’s icy moon Europa {{is one of the most}} exciting places. It may be just in reach for a Mössbauer spectrometer deployed by a future lander to study the red <b>streak</b> <b>mineral</b> deposits on its surface to look for clues about the composition of the ocean hidden under the moon’s icy surface...|$|R
