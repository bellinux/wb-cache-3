5000|$|Putnam's {{frustration}} with the changing role of social ties in civic engagement and social capital formation pre-dates {{the rise of the}} internet, but strongly mirrors Evgeny Morozov's criticism about low-effort acts of social engagement. As noted by Putnam in [...] "Bowling Alone", mass <b>membership</b> <b>organizations</b> like The Sierra Club and American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) are significantly different from civic associations and other venues for collective action of the past. These mass <b>membership</b> <b>organizations,</b> Putnam argues, allow members to be very loosely connected, perhaps only by shared values or ideals. Members may never knowingly encounter another member of the organization and their ties are to the organization’s principles and not to one another as in traditional civic groups. Membership in such mass <b>membership</b> <b>organizations</b> may solely consist of writing a check or reading a newsletter and not sustained or more in-depth actions, which may facilitate more active engagement leading to a higher propensity for social change.|$|R
