5|$|During the Han dynasty under Han Wudi (141–87 BCE), the Chinese {{government}} {{united and}} became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia. Han China's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system, which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations. The {{growth of the}} Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with {{virtually all of the}} known world as reached from Asia, and Chinese silks spread through Asia and Inner Asia and even to Rome. The early T'ang dynasty saw China as even <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> foreign influence and the T'ang dynasty becoming a great empire. Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly, and China's East and Southern Coasts, once distant and unimportant regions, gradually became chief areas of foreign trade. During the Song Dynasty China's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation, and China's maritime commerce also increased exponentially.|$|E
25|$|Rising income {{inequality}} {{has been linked}} to the political polarization in Washington DC. According to a 2013 study published in the Political Research Quarterly, elected officials tend to be <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> the upper income bracket and ignore lower income groups.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{rationales}} behind demonstrating {{and later}} formalizing Managed Medicare into Part C of Medicare {{had been the}} expectation that the introduction of competition among the participating insurance companies would provide higher-quality care and plans that were <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> beneficiaries' needs than traditional Medicare, at similar or lower cost.|$|E

The Authors studied the effectiveness of daylight in low-birth-weight newborns. The results obtained show that the reduction of bilirubin induced by phototherapy is related with gestational age and intra-uterine growth. The very low-birth-weight infants, at higher risk of kernicterus, as they are <b>more</b> <b>responsives</b> <b>to</b> phototherapy, as well they are, probably, more susceptibles to side-effects.

25|$|Several {{economists and}} {{political}} scientists {{have argued that}} economic inequality translates into political inequality, particularly in situations where politicians have financial incentives to respond to special interest groups and lobbyists. Researchers such as Larry Bartels of Vanderbilt University have shown that politicians are significantly <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> the political opinions of the wealthy, even when controlling {{for a range of}} variables including educational attainment and political knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The K-MAX {{relies on}} two primary {{advantages}} of synchropters over conventional helicopters: The increased efficiency compared to conventional rotor-lift technology; and the synchropter's natural tendency to hover. This increases stability, especially for precision work in placing suspended loads. At the same time, the synchropter is <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> pilot control inputs, {{making it possible}} to easily swing a load, or to scatter seed, chemicals, or water over a larger area.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{joined the}} United Mine Workers and became active in Local 2903. Local 2903 {{had led the}} 1912-13 strike and was known for its activism. Miller was first elected to the union's safety {{committee}} and later became local president. Although he briefly considered moving to Florida, Miller instead decided to become active in national union politics {{in order to get}} the union to be <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> miners' needs.|$|E
50|$|With the {{increase}} in U.S. naval forces, there also existed {{the need for a}} <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> organization <b>to</b> provide for supervision of uni-service Navy matters. Again, geography prevented effective supervision by Commanding General, III MAF, and to an even greater extent prevented effective participation by Commander U.S. Naval Forces, Philippines.|$|R

25|$|The era of {{inflation}} targeting—i.e. maintaining inflation within a band—has perhaps begun in Egypt more recently. Country experiences show that inflation targeting is a best-practice strategy for monetary policy. While the monetary policy appears <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> inflationary pressures recently in Egypt, it is {{noted that there}} is no core inflation measure and the Central Bank of Egypt takes targeting decisions based on the inflation rate released by the CAPMAS consumer price index off-the-shelf.|$|E
25|$|Within {{weeks of}} being {{admitted}} to Children's Hospital Genie became much <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> nonverbal stimuli, although at first her own demeanor remained devoid of nonverbal signals. During {{the first months}} that she lived at the hospital, she gradually began to express more of her emotions outward. After a fairly short time, Genie's nonverbal communication skills became exceptional. Everyone who worked with her said she had an indescribable way of eliciting emotions, and she seemed able to communicate her desires without talking.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of patronage networks between local politicians {{and ethnic groups}} {{make it easier for}} politicians to mobilize ethnic groups and instigate ethnic violence for electoral gain since the neighborhood or city is already polarized along ethnic lines. The dependence of ethnic groups on their co-ethnic local politician for access to state resources is likely to make them <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> calls of violence against other ethnic groups. Therefore, the {{existence of}} these local patronage channels generates incentives for ethnic groups to engage in politically motivated violence.|$|E

25|$|The Poor Law Commission was {{abolished}} {{following the}} Andover workhouse scandal. Tensions among Commissioners {{meant that the}} central administration of the system needed to change. The New Poor Law Board had a sitting President, usually a Cabinet Minister, so that the Board could be both accountable to Parliament and <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> its wishes. The Local Government Board took {{over the role of}} the Poor Law Board after the passing of the Second Great Reform Act. The Reform Act enfranchised a greater number of people meaning that Parliament became more concerned with welfare.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have also}} {{exhibited}} {{the effects of}} alcohol myopia's ability to disrupt the inhibition conflict. Research conducted in 2002 determined {{that there was a}} positive relationship between college females’ level of sobriety and their decisions to engage in risky sexual behavior. Results showed that a majority of college aged females who had been drinking chose not to address risk topics before sexual intercourse with a partner. Alcohol myopia can explain this relationship. The inebriated females’ abilities to analyze internal cues warning them of the risks of sex were inhibited by alcohol, while alcohol caused them to become <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> the salient cue of arousal.|$|E
25|$|The new {{legislation}} {{was intended to}} enable British Telecommunications to become <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> competition in GB and to expand its operations globally. Commercial freedom granted to British Telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, {{to engage in the}} manufacture of its own apparatus. The company's transfer into the private sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6% of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8%. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising £5billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.|$|E

25|$|It has an {{appearance}} on electrocardiography of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern. It may be described as 'coarse' or 'fine' depending on its amplitude, or as progressing from coarse to fine V-fib. Coarse V-fib may be <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> defibrillation, while fine V-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain. Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V-fib {{in the hope that}} it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life, whereas others will deliver CPR and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} core of St Alkmund's prebends and Belmeis family donations {{formed a}} concentration within Shropshire and Staffordshire. This {{was only slightly}} expanded by later grants. Significant parts of the abbey's holdings lay in Leicestershire and Derbyshire, where it was forced to maintain granges and to send canons. The major territorial magnates in the area, like the Fitzalans and Lestranges, made grants but these were quite small. They made much larger benefactions to Haughmond Abbey, which was only {{a short distance from}} Lilleshall, had a similar regime, and, not being a royal foundation, was much <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> their needs. A comparison with the distribution map of Haughmond's estates reveals that Lilleshall's was a more widely distributed estate, resulting in higher running costs and less local support.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few weeks}} Genie became much <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> other people, and shortly {{afterwards}} began paying attention to people speaking, but at first she remained mostly unexpressive and {{it was unclear whether}} she responded more to verbal or nonverbal stimuli. Shortly afterwards Genie showed clear responses to nonverbal signals, and her nonverbal communication skills quickly became exceptional. A month into her stay Genie started becoming sociable with familiar adults, first with Kent and soon after with other hospital staff. She was clearly happy when someone she knew visited and sometimes worked very hard to get a person to stay, expressing disappointment if she failed; for no discernible reason, her greetings were far more energetic than her relatively mild unhappiness when people left. After the state dropped charges against Genie's mother she began visiting Genie twice a week, and {{over the course of a}} few months they steadily grew better at interacting with each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{previous}} section showed how self-efficacy {{can be related}} to a person's locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external locus of control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. In the {{previous section}}, the different types of locus of control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external locus of control, we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external locus of control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> stress.|$|E
25|$|The 1998 {{election}} of Gro Harlem Brundtland as Secretary General, {{along with a}} series of reforms, including expansion of the Emerging and other Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control (EMC) Division, has placed WHO {{in a better position to}} revitalize itself. Internal oversight and transparency have been expanded, programs and budgets are undergoing closer scrutiny, and management accountability is looming larger. Bruntland has moved quickly to revitalize top management, mostly from outside the organization, including from the private sector. She also strengthened country offices and to make the regional offices <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> central direction. WHO is increasing its focus on the fight against resurgent malaria, while a better-funded EMC is expanding efforts to establish a global surveillance and response system in cooperation with UNAIDS, UNICEF, and national entities such as the U.S. CDC, the U.S. DoD, and France's Pasteur Institute. Margaret Chan, the current Director-General, is still being assessed; there were questions about her performance as chief of public health for Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to a psychoactive {{substance}} can cause {{changes in the}} structure and functioning of neurons, as the nervous system tries to re-establish the homeostasis disrupted {{by the presence of}} the drug (see also, neuroplasticity). Exposure to antagonists for a particular neurotransmitter can increase the number of receptors for that neurotransmitter or the receptors themselves may become <b>more</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> neurotransmitters; this is called sensitization. Conversely, overstimulation of receptors for a particular neurotransmitter may cause a decrease in both number and sensitivity of these receptors, a process called desensitization or tolerance. Sensitization and desensitization are more likely to occur with long-term exposure, although they may occur after only a single exposure. These processes are thought {{to play a role in}} drug dependence and addiction. Physical dependence on antidepressants or anxiolytics may result in worse depression or anxiety, respectively, as withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, because clinical depression (also called major depressive disorder) is often referred to simply as depression, antidepressants are often requested by and prescribed for patients who are depressed, but not clinically depressed.|$|E
