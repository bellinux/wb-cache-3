However, it can guarantee detection of transient errors only, and may have a substantial power and area overhead. In this paper we present Self-Imposed Temporal Redundancy (SITR), a form of TR {{that can be applied}} to pipelined FUs and does not suffer from the aforementioned problems. A SITR-enhanced FU forces redundant computations to fire in consecutive cycles and requires a single additional cycle for the second computation and the comparison of the two results. We evaluate the power and area overhead of SITR and conclude that is always smaller than that of standard TR and that it does not depend on the FU complexity. We also use SITR to improve {{the reliability of}} the execution datapath of a simple out-of-order engine, typical of that used in high reliability embedded systems and future many-core architectures. Our simulations show that SITR outperforms TR, especially in FP applications.

40|$|All {{conventional}} paper machines {{exhibit a}} profile of cross-machine direction (CD) shrinkage which is developed during the drying stage of production. This paper suggests {{a new approach to}} the understanding of these profiles by suggesting that CD shrinkage at a point in the paper depends on the distance of that point from both edges of the sheet and also on the length of the unsupported draws in the dryer section. The nature of the func-tion is unimportant as long as it can be made to fit data for one combination of <b>machine</b> <b>width</b> and effective draw length; substi-tuting other values will then change the shape appropriately. In this paper, a simple exponential decay of shrinkage with distance from the edge is used successfully. This approach is initially demonstrated for laboratory results from the literature, where it successfully predicts changes pro-duced by varying the length, width and by reversing the MD/CD orientation of samples. It is then shown to be consistent for changes of paper machine furnish, press section draw and sheet grammage produced in a series of trials on M-real, New Thames PM 6.

To solve this problem, a dual drive curve tool path planning method is proposed in this article. First, the maximum <b>machining</b> strip <b>width</b> of a whole tool path can be obtained through optimizing each tool position with multi-point machining (MPM) method. Second, two drive curves are then determined according to the obtained maximum <b>machining</b> strip <b>width.</b> Finally, the tool is positioned once more along the dual drive curve under the condition of tool path smoothness. A computer simulation and cutting experiments are carried out to testify {{the performance of the}} new method.

The filling insertion systems that are currently being used in the market have reached their maximum potential in terms of speed and production rate.

These set maximums and limitations have led us to seek an alternative method to insert weft yarns into fabrics. In this study, electromagnetic force is being used as an alternative method for inserting weft yarn. In order to accomplish this, an electromagnetic launcher called a coil gun is used to launch a ferromagnetic projectile which would carry the weft yarn through the shed of the warp yarns in order to achieve the interlacing necessary to form a woven fabric. It is expected that this new method of weft insertion would reduce the energy costs that are associated with other weaving machines.

We compare three reuse schemes: store value reuse, loaded value reuse, and macro data reuse [12], [13]. Macro data reuse, enabled by macro data loads, capitalizes on under-utilized cache port bandwidth and makes use of the spatial locality found in port-wide macro data. Using a generalized memory value reuse table (MVRT) model, we present the results of (1) per program reuse analysis, (2) per data size analysis, (3) per region analysis, (4) per MVRT size analysis, and (4) estimating the impact of ISA and <b>machine</b> <b>widths.</b> The macro data load mechanism is shown to open up significantly more loaded value reuse instances compared with previous loaded value reuse proposals: over 75 % (SPEC 2 k integer), 23 % (SPEC 2 k floating-point), and 139 % (MiBench) more load-to-load forwarding opportunities using a 64 -entry MVRT. We also perform a quantitative study using a realistic processor model and show that over 35 % of L 1 cache accesses in the SPEC 2 k integer and MiBench programs can be eliminated, resulting in a related energy reduction of 27 % and 31 % on average, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm that predicts {{the shape of}} material removed by a flat-end milling tool, {{and this may be}} used to compute <b>machining</b> strip <b>width</b> and scallop height at different positions of the tool path track. The algorithm computes swept sections, profiles which are swept by a moving tool bottom by passing through given planes. The technique is applicable for finish and semi-finish multi-axis milling strategies that use flat-end tools. For these strategies, the algorithm complexity can be reduced from computation of the 3 D envelope of swept volumes to computation of plane-circle intersections. A new adaptive derivative-free method to sample tool motion provides robust means to generate intermediate tool positions. The step length is constrained by and dependent on different geometrical measures. At each point of a tool path, in the plane perpendicular to the cutting direction, the bottom profile of the swept section is an estimate of the profile of material left. By calculating the distance between part geometry and the computed profile of removed material, <b>machining</b> strip <b>width</b> and a scallop profile can be derived.
