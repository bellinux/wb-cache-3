5|$|Long hair is a hairstyle {{where the}} head hair {{is allowed to}} grow to {{considerable}} length. Exactly what constitutes long hair can change from culture to culture, or even within cultures. For example, a woman with chin-length hair in some cultures <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have short hair, while a man with the same length of hair {{in some of the}} same cultures would be said to have long hair.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{history of}} {{philosophy}} in Poland <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have {{begun in the}} fifteenth century, following {{the revival of the}} University of Kraków by King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1400.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} or {{suspicion of}} LGS {{is often a}} question of probability rather than certainty. This is because the varied presentations of LGS share features with other disorders, many of which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have overlapping characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|After Stimson’s {{wife died}} in 1904, {{the house was}} {{purchased}} by a civil engineer named Alfred Solano. [...] In 1918, Edward R. Maier, sportsman and owner of Maier Brewing Co., bought the house, and it served as the Maier family home until 1940. <b>Maier</b> <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have stored his wines and liqueurs in the labyrinthine basement.|$|R

25|$|These 'Five Confessors', in {{obeying the}} laws of the Church, {{suffered}} deprivation and imprisonment under the P.W.R. Act, and by their witness and steadfastness <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have brought to an end the policy of legal persecution.|$|E
25|$|The {{languages}} of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, {{in which the}} spoken {{languages of}} the tribes <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{references}} to the method are: Carlini in 1817, Liouville in 1837, Green in 1837, Rayleigh in 1912 and Gans in 1915. Liouville and Green <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have founded the method in 1837, {{and it is also}} commonly referred to as the Liouville–Green or LG method.|$|E

50|$|Cornelius <b>May</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{from the}} city of Hoorn but <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> born in the small village of Schellinkhout, just east of Hoorn, as he appears to have been the brother of Jan Jacobszoon May van Schellinkhout, after whom the island of Jan Mayen is named. Both {{brothers}} were the cousin of, in his day, a far more famous sailor, Jan Cornelisz May, who led several expeditions to explore the Northeast passage and between 1614 and 1617 circumnavigated the world with Joris van Spilbergen.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} singing, {{as in most}} other matters, the Tahitians widely differ from {{the people of the}} Sandwich Islands; where the parochial flocks <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> rather <b>to</b> Heat than sing.|$|R
25|$|The {{so-called}} Green Corn Rebellion <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{have started}} on Thursday, August 2, 1917, when a Seminole County sheriff and his deputy were ambushed near the Little River, {{a tributary of}} the Canadian river. Raiding parties followed this action, cutting telephone lines and burning railroad bridges.|$|E
25|$|Later Canaletto painted grand {{scenes of}} the canals of Venice and the Doge's Palace. His {{large-scale}} landscapes portrayed the city's pageantry and waning traditions, making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong local colors. For these qualities, his works <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have anticipated Impressionism.|$|E
25|$|Cabaret, {{which gave}} birth to {{so many of the}} arts of modernism, {{including}} the immediate precursors of film, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have begun in France in 1881 {{with the opening of the}} Black Cat in Montmartre, the beginning of the ironic monologue, and the founding of the Society of Incoherent Arts.|$|E
5000|$|If a tight {{collection}} [...] {{consists of}} a single measure , then (depending upon the author) [...] <b>may</b> either <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a tight measure or to be an inner regular measure.|$|R

25|$|The cross-in-square church <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{constitute}} a unique artistic {{development of the}} middle Byzantine period. Early Byzantine churches were predominantly basilical or centrally planned (e.g. cruciform tetraconch churches, octagons). The question {{of the origins of}} the cross-in-square form has therefore engaged art historians since {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, although no single account has ever received the unanimous assent of the scholarly community.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, the Swedish Language Council is {{similarly}} {{funded by the}} Swedish government and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have a semi-official status as a regulatory body being a joint effort that includes the Swedish Academy, Swedish Radio, Swedish Broadcasting Corporation and several other organizations representing journalists, teachers, actors, writers and translators. The recommendations of these bodies are not legally binding, though they are generally respected.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} testing student {{achievement}} is not new, although the current Australian approach <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have {{its origins in}} current educational policy structures in both the USA and the UK. There are several key differences between the Australian NAPLAN and the UK and USA strategies. Schools that {{are found to be}} under-performing in the Australian context will be offered financial assistance under the current federal government policy.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "sampler" [...] is {{sometimes}} inaccurately applied to {{any piece of}} needlework meant for display. However the genre <b>may</b> broadly <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> include any needlework in sampler style with or without lettering.|$|R

5000|$|Historian Cornelius Clifford says: [...] "His career almost personifies {{a crisis}} in the history of Christianity; and he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> rather <b>to</b> have shaped the events in which he took part than to have been shaped by them." ...|$|R
25|$|In the 20th-century, {{the site}} of the present Castello Dei Baroni was an uncultivated {{agricultural}} field incorporating the 18th-century building and rubble walls. Sometimes in the early 20th-century, the Attard Montalto family built the Castello Dei Baroni, presumably named after the Barons of the family, and used it as a country residence. The Barons probably used it as a hunting lodge, and thus it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have been a baronial hunting lodge.|$|E
25|$|If the shoal {{becomes more}} tightly organised, {{with the fish}} {{synchronising}} their swimming so they all move {{at the same speed}} and in the same direction, then the fish <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be schooling. Schooling fish are usually of the same species and the same age/size. Fish schools move with the individual members precisely spaced from each other. The schools undertake complicated manoeuvres, as though the schools have minds of their own.|$|E
25|$|The speech which Weston {{delivers}} at the book's climax (in Chapter 20), and Ransom's {{effort to}} render {{it into the}} Old Solar spoken by the Malacandrians, demonstrate the enormous gulf in cultural and moral perceptions, which renders Weston's value judgements utterly untranslatable and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> make them absurd; thus creating a sort of social criticism. The “translation” that we read is {{to be understood as}} a back-translation into English of what Ransom said in Old Solar.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{universal}} agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. Life <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> simply the characteristic state of organisms.|$|R
25|$|Parsons Green is a mainly {{residential}} district of Fulham in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. It straddles the King's Road, A308 road and Parsons Green Lane. It is bounded by the Harwood and Wandsworth Bridge Roads, A217 {{road to the}} East and Munster Road to the West, while the Fulham Road, A3219 road <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> define its northern boundary. Its southern boundary is less clearly defined as it melds with the Peterborough estate and Hurlingham.|$|E
25|$|A second 'deliberate' {{mechanism}} is called replicative senescence or cellular senescence. Metaphorically, a cell <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> 'count' (with its telomeres) {{the number of}} times that it has divided, and after a set number of replications, it languishes and dies. It has been proposed that this mechanism evolved to suppress cancer. Many invertebrates experience replicative senescence, though they never die of cancer. Even one-celled organisms count replications, and will die if they don't replenish their telomeres with conjugation (sex).|$|E
25|$|These {{apparently}} irreconcilable {{differences of}} opinion have led to some conflicts among performers. For example, {{more than thirty years}} after the hugely successful illusionist Uri Geller made his first appearances on television in the 1970s to exhibit his self-proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons, his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers, because he claimed he was not using conjuring techniques. On the other hand, because Geller bent—and continues to bend—spoons within a performance context, the Dunninger quote <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> apply.|$|E
50|$|American English {{does not}} have minimal pairs {{indicating}} the existence of chronemes or <b>may</b> theoretically <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have only one chroneme. Some other dialects such as Australian English have contrastive vowel length, {{but it is not}} analysed as the consequence of a chroneme.|$|R
