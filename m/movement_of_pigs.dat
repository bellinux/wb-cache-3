40|$|Population origins, animal movements, and the {{presence}} of non-local individuals have all been addressed through the analysis of strontium isotope ratios in dental tissues. There has been extensive research regarding the preservation of biogenic Sr in various human tissues: bone, tooth enamel and dentine, but little into non-human species. The applicability of this methodology to pigs in particular may be problematic with some studies considering there to be no differences between porcine and human enamel and others suggesting differences do exist. As a result it remains unclear whether porcine enamel is more susceptible to diagenetic processes and re-equilibration with diagenetic fluids from the local burial environment. Whilst several programmes of strontium isotope analysis have included pig enamel samples, very few have produced samples of allocthonous origin and the validity of the technique for reconstructing <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> remains in question. This study tests the validity of using strontium isotope ratios in porcine enamel for tracking the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> in two ways. Firstly, the susceptibility of modern and archaeological pig and cattle teeth to diagenetic changes was assessed by submerging enamel samples in a solution of known strontium isotope composition for a period of up to 10 months and measuring the level of uptake as a proxy for diagenetic alteration. Secondly, the strontium isotope ratios of porcine enamel samples from five archaeological assemblages, identified as likely to contain imported, non-local pigs, were analysed to determine whether individuals that are allocthonous in origin could be identified...|$|E

First, we focus on the mathematical formulation of each component of the model.

These strains were spread to United States in 2013 through an intercontinental transmission from China with further spreading across the world, evidencing the emergent nature of these strains. In the present study, an analysis of PEDV field sequences from Ecuador was conducted by comparing all the PEDV S gene sequences available in the GenBank database. Phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were also conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. The sequence from the PED-outbreak in Ecuador was grouped into the clade II of PEDV genogroup 2 a together with other sequences of isolates from Mexico, Canada, and United States. The phylogeographic study revealed {{the emergence of the}} Chinese PEDV strains, followed by spreading to US in 2013, from US to Korea, and later the introduction of PEDV to Canada, Mexico, and Ecuador directly from the US.

40|$|Before an {{efficient}} control strategy for livestock-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in pigs can be decided upon, {{it is necessary}} to obtain {{a better understanding of how}} LA-MRSA spreads and persists within a pig herd, once it is introduced. We here present a mechanistic stochastic discrete-event simulation model for spread of LA-MRSA within a farrow-to-finish sow herd to aid in this. The model was individual-based and included three different disease compartments: susceptible, intermittent or persistent shedder of MRSA. The model was used for studying transmission dynamics and within-farm prevalence after different introductions of LA-MRSA into a farm. The spread of LA-MRSA throughout the farm mainly followed the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs.</b> After spread of LA-MRSA had reached equilibrium, the prevalence of LA-MRSA shedders was predicted to be highest in the farrowing unit, independent of how LA-MRSA was introduced. LA-MRSA took longer to spread to the whole herd if introduced in the finisher stable, rather than by gilts in the mating stable. The more LA-MRSA positive animals introduced, the shorter time before the prevalence in the herd stabilised. Introduction of a low number of intermittently shedding pigs was predicted to frequently result in LA-MRSA fading out. The model is a potential decision support tool for assessments of short and long term consequences of proposed intervention strategies or surveillance options for LA-MRSA within pig herds...|$|E

The initial outbreak of NiV infection occurred in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998 – 1999; relatively small, sporadic outbreaks among humans have occurred in Bangladesh since 2001. We characterized the complete genomic sequences of identical NiV isolates from 2 patients in 2008 and partial genomic sequences of throat swab samples from 3 patients in 2010, all from Bangladesh. All sequences from patients in Bangladesh comprised a distinct genetic group. However, the detection of 3 genetically distinct sequences from patients in the districts of Faridpur and Gopalganj indicated multiple co-circulating lineages in a localized region over a short time (January–March 2010). Sequence comparisons between the open reading frames of all available NiV genes led us to propose a standardized protocol for genotyping NiV; this protcol provides a simple and accurate way to classify current and future NiV sequences. Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly paramyxovirus that was first described during 1998 – 1999 in Malaysia and Singapore, when a large epidemic of fatal encephalitis occurred in humans (283 cases, 109 deaths) (1).

40|$|PROLIFERATIVE enteropathy (PE) is an endemic {{bacterial}} disease <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> caused by infection with Lawsonia intracellularis (McOrist and others 1993). The use of targeted intervention programmes against PE {{is most likely}} to have a reliable beneficial effect where the time of onset of infection is known. Pigs in single-site farms in Europe are weaned at a minimum of three weeks <b>of</b> age; <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> within the farm during the wean-to-finish stages are common, due to inflexible pen designs.

Records showed that all six affected pigs had access to dirt-floored pens at least 81 days prior to slaughter. The mycobacteriosis lesion rate for pigs exposed to dirt pens was 9. 4 % while in nonexposed pigs the lesion rate was zero. The risk associated with <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> from concrete floored pens to dirt pens was evaluated by a field trial. In the field trial, two litters (5 of 15 pigs) exposed to dirt pens at 12 - 24 days of age but none of nine nonexposed litters (39 pigs) developed lesions. Mycobacterium avium-complex bacteria were recovered from both exposed litters (9 of 15 pigs) but from none of nine nonexposed litters. Serovars of M. avium-complex isolated from trial pigs included 1, 4, 8, 9, the dual serovar 4 / 8, and an untypable serovar. Incense-cedar bark (Calocedrus decurrens) used as a flooring material in the pens was demonstrated to be a potential source of M. avium-complex serovar 9. The dual serovar 4 / 8 and an untypable M. avium-complex were isolated from the dirt-floored pens. No evidence of cross-transmission of M. avium-complex infection was detected. The sporadic pattern of mycobacteriosis observed in the herd probably resulted from infrequent exposure to a common environmental source...|$|E
40|$|Humans {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} {{large role in}} the expansion of invasive species’ distributions, but few (if any) studies have evaluated anthropogenic factors associated with intentional translocation of invasives. The wild pig (Sus scrofa) is an extremely destructive and rapidly expanding invasive species whose movement {{is thought to be}} facilitated by humans. We sought to (1) identify a suite of genetic markers that can be applied to population genetic analyses of wild pigs, (2) find quantitative evidence of human-mediated dispersal of wild pigs, and (3) determine which anthropogenic factors were associated with their translocation. We identified 43 polymorphic microsatellite loci and employed population genetic analyses to evaluate population structure and movement of wild pigs among populations in California, USA. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic covariates on wild pig movement, and to predict migration risk. Natural dispersal of wild pigs among populations was low, as indicated by a large number of genetic clusters (K = 21), significant population differentiation, and low rates of recent migration. This suggests that the observed movement resulted from human-mediated translocation. <b>Movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> was positively predicted by the number of domestic pig farms, the number of captive game hunting farms, the amount of public land, the number of wild pigs harvested by hunters, and the number of game outfitters.

40|$|Nearly 75 % of all {{emerging}} {{infectious diseases}} (EIDs) that impact or threaten human health are zoonotic. The majority have spilled from wildlife reservoirs, either directly to humans or via domestic animals. The emergence of many {{can be attributed}} to predisposing factors such as global travel, trade, agricultural expansion, deforestation habitat fragmentation, and urbanization; such factors increase the interface and or the rate of contact between human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations, thereby creating increased opportunities for spillover events to occur. Infectious disease emergence can be regarded as primarily an ecological process. The epidemiological investigation of EIDs associated with wildlife requires a trans-disciplinary approach that includes an understanding of the ecology of the wildlife species, and an understanding of human behaviours that increase risk of exposure. Investigations of the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 provide useful case studies. The emergence of Nipah virus was associated with the increased size and density of commercial pig farms and their encroachment into forested areas. The <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> for sale and slaughter in turn led to the rapid spread of infection to southern peninsular Malaysia, where the high-density, largely urban pig populations facilitated transmission to humans. Identifying the factors associated with the emergence of SARS in southern China requires an understanding of the ecology of infection both in the natural reservoir and in secondary market reservoir species. A necessary extension of understanding the ecology of the reservoir is an understanding of the trade, and of the social and cultural context of wildlife consumption. Emerging infectious diseases originating from wildlife populations will continue to threaten public health. Mitigating and managing the risk requires an appreciation of the connectedness between human, livestock and wildlife health, and of the factors and processes that disrupt the balance...|$|E

However, {{the use of}} complete movements' dataset to conduct policy-relevant predictions has been so far limited by the massive amount of data {{that have to be}} processed (e. g., in intensive commercial systems) or the restricted availability of timely and updated records on animal movements (e. g., in areas where small-scale or extensive production is predominant). The aim {{of this study was to}} use exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to reproduce, understand, and predict pig trade networks in different European production systems. Three trade networks were built by aggregating <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> batches among premises (farms and trade operators) over 2011 in Bulgaria, Extremadura (Spain), and Côtes-d'Armor (France), where small-scale, extensive, and intensive pig production are predominant, respectively. Three ERGMs were fitted to each network with various demographic and geographic attributes of the nodes as well as six internal network configurations. Several statistical and graphical diagnostic methods were applied to assess the goodness of fit of the models. For all systems, both exogenous (attribute-based) and endogenous (network-based) processes appeared to govern the structure <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> trade network, and neither alone were capable of capturing all aspects of the network structure. Geographic mixing patterns strongly structured pig trade organization in the small-scale production system, whereas belonging to the same company or keeping pigs in the same housing system appeared to be key drivers <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> trade, in intensive and extensive production systems, respectively.

The objectives of this study were to examine farmer practices and the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> and poultry within the Pacific Islands using questionnaires and social network analysis (SNA) tools to understand disease spread in the region. Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted in Fiji, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands and Vanuatu with interviews <b>of</b> 310 <b>pig</b> farmers and 491 poultry farmers. Pacific Island farmers were found to have few animals (median = 7 pigs/farm, IQR 4 – 12), (median = 50 chicken/farm, IQR 23 – 52), (median = 10 ducks/farm, IQR 4 – 25), (median = 12 Muscovy ducks/farm, IQR 7 – 28) and a diversified number of species. A large proportion of farmers (44. 6 – 61. 3 %) do not implement any preventive or control measures, yet the majority (80. 6 – 88 %) did not experience any animal diseases over the past 12 months. Most farmers never ask for veterinary care, never engage in laboratory testing and do not report when their animals show clinical signs. Many pig farmers (31. 8 %) trade within their communities only and sell (24. 5 %) directly to consumers which reduces the risk of diseases spreading. Our results show an association between farmers that report having had disease on their farm in the past 12 months and <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> animals on and off their farms. The capitals of the studied provinces in PNG, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands were identified as the most connected nodes <b>of</b> both <b>pig</b> and poultry trade, while Fiji networks appeared much less connected.

40|$|Classical {{swine fever}} (CSF) has been {{eradicated}} from the United States since 1978, its re-introduction {{could have a}} huge impact on the US swine industry. Movement restriction, an essential CSF control strategy, could result in animal welfare concerns in pigs due to overcrowding or feed interruption. The study aims were to estimate the magnitude and pattern of a CSF outbreak, to evaluate the effects of various movement restriction zone sizes, and to estimate the extent of animal welfare mitigation strategies in CSF outbreak control in Indiana. Risk metrics were developed to identify the most likely CSF outbreak scenarios in Indiana. The impacts of various movement restriction zone sizes (3 km, 5 km, 9 km, and 11 km) were evaluated and compared to a 7 km zone size. Risk assessment models were developed to estimate the time to animal welfare concerns, the number of swine premises to experience animal welfare concerns, and the extent of animal welfare mitigation strategies (e. g., on-farm euthanasia, <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> to slaughter plants). ^ Nineteen single-site (i. e., with one index premises at the onset of an outbreak) and 15 multiple-site (i. e., with 3 ̆e 1 index premises at the onset of an outbreak) CSF outbreak scenarios were selected and simulated.

40|$|The study {{hypothesis}} was that pre-slaughter handling is not conducted {{in such a}} way that pigs can be considered humanely slaughtered, nor is it conducive to promoting those properties of fresh meat that could enhance pork quality. The 1 st phase of the investigation was aimed at confirming the present compliance level within the prescribed norms. To this end the importance of stunning induction requirements for effective electrical stunning, the welfare implications relating to the pre-slaughter handling of pigs and the stunning and sticking techniques were investigated. Pre-slaughter welfare of the pigs at the abattoir was found to be influenced at the outset by the origin and type of pig slaughtered, the daily throughput range of pigs and the type of abattoir involved. A disappointing pre-arrival aspect was that deficiencies in road motor vehicles were observed while off-loading pigs. Through poor design or lack of maintenance, another factor that hampered free <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> was the off-loading facilities. The nature of animal behaviour in the pens, in the passages and when going into the stunning area was directly related to the pig handling efficiency and to the nature and extent of design and maintenance problems with equipment. None of the abattoirs had a well designed in-feed to a well planned stunning area / facility, and a very high level of pig pre-slaughter stress prevailed. The optimum position of the electrodes is virtually impossible to attain under practical conditions and the practice of repeat application of electrical stunning is common. Of the total sample size (n = 1175), 34 % were difficult to shackle, 90 % of these being from the abattoirs tending to slaughter more routinely a wide range of different sized pigs.

40|$|Small-scale pig {{producers}} {{are believed to}} pose higher biosecurity risks for the introduction and spread of exotic diseases than commercial pig producers. However, the magnitude of these risks are poorly understood. This study is a comparative assessment {{of the risk of}} introduction and spread of foot and mouth disease (FMD) through different sectors of the pig industry: 1) large-scale pig producers; 2) small-scale producers (< 100 sows) selling at saleyards and abattoirs; and, 3) small-scale producers selling through informal means. An exposure and consequence assessments were conducted assuming FMD virus was introduced into Australia through illegal importation of infected meat. A quantitative assessment, using scenario trees and Monte Carlo stochastic simulation, was used to calculate the probabilities of exposure and spread. Input data for these assessments were obtained from a series of data gathering exercises among pig producers, industry statistics and literature. Findings of this study suggest there is an Extremely low probability of exposure (8. 69 × 10 - 6 to 3. 81 × 10 - 5) for the three sectors of the pig industry, with exposure through direct swill feeding being 10 to 100 times more likely to occur than through contact with infected feral pigs [...] Spread of FMD from the index farm is most likely to occur through movement of contaminated fomites, pigs and ruminants. The virus is more likely to spread from small-scale piggeries selling at saleyards and abattoirs than from other piggeries. The most influential factors on the spread of FMD from the index farm is the ability of the farmer to detect FMD, the probability of FMD spread through contaminated fomites and the presence of ruminants on the farm. Although small-scale producers selling informally move animals less frequently and do not use external staff, <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> to non-commercial pathways could jeopardize animal traceability {{in the event of a}} disease outbreak.

40|$|Disease {{modelling}} is {{one approach}} for providing {{new insights into}} wildlife disease epidemiology. This paper describes a spatio-temporal, stochastic, susceptible- exposed-infected-recovered process model that simulates the potential spread of classical swine fever through a documented, large and free living wild pig population following a simulated incursion. The study area (300 000 km 2) was in northern Australia. Published data on wild pig ecology from Australia, and international Classical Swine Fever data was used to parameterise the model. Sensitivity analyses revealed that herd density (best estimate 1 - 3 pigs km- 2), daily herd movement distances (best estimate approximately 1 km), probability of infection transmission between herds (best estimate 0. 75) and disease related herd mortality (best estimate 42 %) were highly influential on epidemic size but that extraordinary <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> and the yearly home range size <b>of</b> a <b>pig</b> herd were not. CSF generally established (98 % of simulations) following a single point introduction. CSF spread at approximately 9 km 2 per day with low incidence rates (< 2 herds per day) in an epidemic wave along contiguous habitat for several years, before dying out (when the epidemic arrived {{at the end of}} a contiguous sub-population or at a low density wild pig area). The low incidence rate indicates that surveillance for wildlife disease epidemics caused by short lived infections will be most efficient when surveillance is based on detection and investigation of clinical events, although this may not always be practical. Epidemics could be contained and eradicated with culling (aerial shooting) or vaccination when these were adequately implemented. It was apparent that the spatial structure, ecology and behaviour of wild populations must be accounted for during disease management in wildlife. An important finding was that it may only be necessary to cull or vaccinate relatively small proportions of a population to successfully contain and eradicate some wildlife disease epidemics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the dynamics and control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV) in the pig population of Great Britain (GB). The roles of the metapopulation of pig herds (metaherd) and individual herd characteristics are examined, and different control and intervention strategies assessed. A novel stochastic model of a metaherd was created, incorporating the births, deaths, slaughter, culls and <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> within and between herds. The metaherd was structured to have characteristics representative of the GB metaherd: the distribution of herd sizes, ‘source’ herds per herd, and numbers of pigs moved per movement. The metaherd was arranged into a typical pyramidal structure. A stochastic infectious process of PRRSV was included. Herd size {{was found to be}} key to within herd persistence of PRRSV, with infection failing to persist in smaller (250 sow) herds. Fadeout did not occur in larger herds once infection established in the rearing herd. PRRSV reduces productivity of herds and the metaherd. There was variability in productivity both between herds and within herds over time. The number of source herds did not influence the dynamics, persistence or prevalence of infection within a herd. Breeding herd production was further decreased by PRRSV when the herd also had a rearing herd (breeder finisher). The model was extended to test the effects of control and intervention strategies. Vaccination effect increased with herd size, and reduced variability in production. Vaccination in small herds was ineffective in increasing production due to PRRSV failing to persist regardless of vaccination. Vaccination of the breeding herd produced higher gains per vaccine dose than vaccination of the rearing herd only. Vaccination of the rearing herd only resulted in higher total herd and metaherd gains, with less variability. Partial de-population combined with vaccination increased the probability of increasing herd performance unless the herd was small (1000 sows). Results highlighted the value of modelling to support the decisions of individual farmers to vaccinate and partially depopulate, showing that the optimal decision is influenced by the herd size. Results also demonstrated that the decision to introduce interventions is different for individual farmers...|$|E

During lactation, all pigs fostered, removed, or found dead were weighed, and the event was recorded. No litters were provided creep feed or supplements during lactation. Pigs were individually weighed and assigned a BCS (1 = emaciated, 2 = thin, or 3 = full-bodied) at weaning over 6 weaning days during a 19 -d period, which resulted in a mean weaning age of 25 d. For data analysis, individual birth weight was used to assign pigs to 4 birth weight categories (≤ 2. 3 lb, 2. 4 to 3. 3 lb, 3. 4 to 4. 3 lb, and ≥ 4. 4 lb), and the number of total born in each pig’s litter of origin was used to assign pigs to 3 total born categories (≤ 11, 12 to 14, and ≥ 15). As expected, birth weight was greater (P < 0. 0001) for pigs of heavier birth weight categories. Pigs of heavier birth weight categories were associated (P < 0. 02) with a decreased number of total and live born. Also, preweaning ADG, weaning weight, weaning BCS, and preweaning mortality were improved (P < 0. 0001) for pigs of heavier birth weight categories. Birth weight decreased (P < 0. 04) for pigs of greater total born categories, and an increased sow BCS was associated (P < 0. 0001) with total born category ≥ 15. As expected, the litter total born, as well as live born and number born dead, increased (P < 0. 0001) with greater total born categories. Preweaning ADG (0. 51, 0. 50, and 0. 50 lb/d, respectively) and weaning weight (16. 3, 15. 9, and 15. 8 lb, respectively) were modestly improved (P < 0. 04) for pigs from the smallest total born category compared with the 2 larger categories. These data indicate that low-birth-weight pigs had poorer preweaning growth performance and survivability. Although larger litters resulted in a greater number of low-birth-weight pigs, the number of heavier pigs also increased. In addition to increasing litter size, maximizing reproductive and economic efficiency of swine requires identifying methods to improve birth weight and performance of the lightest pigs born...|$|E
40|$|Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a {{controlled}} disease in South Africa. This disease {{is caused by}} an Arterivirus and occurs commonly in Europe (European serotype) and in the United States of America (American serotype); therefore PRRS is not a trade sensitive disease. However, the disease has severe economic implications for the producer and the local pork industry and {{the decision was made}} by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in association with the South African Pork Producers’ Organization (SAPPO) to eradicate the disease when the first outbreak occurred in 2004 in the Western Cape. Severe disease leading to acute mortalities and almost 100 % mortality and morbidity rate in a few pig units in the Jacobsdal area (Kuilsrivier district) in the Cape Town peninsula, alarmed local veterinary consultants during the autumn of 2004. A first diagnosis of Salmonella choleraesuis was confirmed at the Provincial Veterinary Laboratory in Stellenbosch. Antibiotic treatment did not resolve the clinical picture. Sows still aborted and died and young pigs still died from acute respiratory distress. The syndrome was similar to “blue ear disease” because of severe cyanosis visible on the extremities of affected pigs. The first suspected diagnosis of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) was made on post mortem examination on 10 June 2004 and was confirmed on 17 June 2004 with positive ELISA (Idexx Herdchek PRRSV Ab test kit 2 XR) results. A stamping out procedure immediately followed through slaughtering of all affected pigs showing clinical signs of PRRSV infection. Pigs in close proximity with possible contact and infection risk were also slaughtered. The <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> was only allowed under Red Cross permit and all pig auctions were stopped. A local and countrywide serological survey was implemented immediately. The results of this survey luckily showed that the outbreak was limited to a few districts in the Western Cape. The probable source of infection is suspected to be uncooked swill originating from the Cape Town Harbour or the Cape Town International Airport, which was fed to pigs. The PRRSV responsible for the outbreak was confirmed on 5 July 2004 as the American serotype by RT-PCR test done at Lelystad, Netherlands. The National Department of Agriculture (NDA) * agreed to compensate pig owners for slaughtered pigs. This decision was further made possible by funding from SAPPO to protect the rest of the commercial pig herd in South Africa to ensure food safety and security. A total of 32 pig units were affected by PRRS of which only one was a commercial unit. All affected pigs were slaughtered by the end of August 2004. Units were cleaned and disinfected by the staffs of the Boland and Swartland State veterinary departments with approved disinfectants which is effective against PRRSV. Cleaned units had to stay empty of pigs for at least 8 weeks after disinfection was completed. Restocking was only allowed from known PRRS-free pig suppliers and regular monitoring was implemented of all previously infected sites and units in high risk areas. On-going serological monitoring revealed no more positive cases since May 2005. It seems that the stamping out procedure and a temporary ban on movement and auctions of live pigs played a primary role in eradication of the PRRSV outbreak in South Africa in 2004. * The name of the NDA has been changed to the National Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) in 2009, but because the NDA was the applicable name when the PRRS outbreak occurred, NDA will be used in this document.

40|$|In an {{experimental}} study on a piggery {{it was found}} that haemolytic Escherichia coli of O-serotypes 138 or 139 proliferated in the intestinal tracts <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> following weaning, with E. coli of the O- 138 type also being occasionally recovered from unweaned pigs, and once from a sow. Organisms of the O- 138 type produced heat labile enterotoxin and their presence in weaned pigs was associated with the development of severe post-weaning diarrhoea. E. coli of O- 139 type produced a vero cell cytotoxin and were associated with a milder diarrhoea in weaned pigs. Under various managemental circumstances the O- 138 type E. coli almost invariably proliferated after weaning. The O- 139 strain of E. coli did however proliferate rather than the O- 138 strain following the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> weaned <b>pigs</b> to new accommodation, after weaned pigs were returned to their sow and then weaning again 5 days later, and very occasionally in pigs weaned at 5 weeks of age.

The incursion and spread of a disease such as African swine fever (ASF), which emerged in Eastern Europe in 2007, could have devastating socioeconomic consequences for both the Chinese and the global pig industry. The Chinese government consequently attributes a very high priority to ASF and is actively seeking to improve its preparedness. This paper discusses different drivers and pathways of potential emergence of ASF in China in light of the country's specificities, including international <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> people, <b>pigs</b> and pig products, swill feeding practices and wild boar populations.

40|$|Abstract Disease {{modelling}} is {{one approach}} for providing {{new insights into}} wildlife disease epidemiology. This paper describes a spatio-temporal, stochastic, susceptible- exposed-infected-recovered process model that simulates the potential spread of classical swine fever through a documented, large and free living wild pig population following a simulated incursion. The study area (300 000 km 2) was in northern Australia. Published data on wild pig ecology from Australia, and international Classical Swine Fever data was used to parameterise the model. Sensitivity analyses revealed that herd density (best estimate 1 - 3 pigs km - 2), daily herd movement distances (best estimate approximately 1 km), probability of infection transmission between herds (best estimate 0. 75) and disease related herd mortality (best estimate 42 %) were highly influential on epidemic size but that extraordinary <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> and the yearly home range size <b>of</b> a <b>pig</b> herd were not. CSF generally established (98 % of simulations) following a single point introduction. CSF spread at approximately 9 km 2 per day with low incidence rates (< 2 herds per day) in an epidemic wave along contiguous habitat for several years, before dying out (when the epidemic arrived {{at the end of}} a contiguous sub-population or at a low density wild pig area). The low incidence rate indicates that surveillance for wildlife disease epidemics caused by short lived infections will be most efficient when surveillance is based on detection and investigation of clinical events, although this may not always be practical. Epidemics could be contained and eradicated with culling (aerial shooting) or vaccination when these were adequately implemented. It was apparent that the spatial structure, ecology and behaviour of wild populations must be accounted for during disease management in wildlife. An important finding was that it may only be necessary to cull or vaccinate relatively small proportions of a population to successfully contain and eradicate some wildlife disease epidemics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome (PRRS) {{is a viral disease}} of pigs, which affects all production stages and has severe economic {{consequences for the}} swine industry. The virus is primarily spread between farms through direct and indirect contacts. A limited number of studies have been carried out to understand the between-farm transmission dynamics of the virus. The objectives of this thesis were to explore the contact structures among swine farms in Canada and to use these contact structures to better understand the pattern and dynamics of between-farm spread of PRRS virus among Canadian swine herds. Four different studies were designed and implemented to achieve these objectives. The first study used network analysis tools to analyse pig movement data which revealed characteristics of contact patterns between swine herds and suggested a hierarchical structure within the Canadian swine industry, where pigs typically move in a unidirectional manner from one production stage to another. The median in-degree and out-degree for farms in this study was 1 and ranged between 0 - 26 and 0 - 10 respectively for the overall network. The degree distributions demonstrated characteristics of a power-law distribution, suggesting the presence of scale-free structure while the size of clustering coefficient suggested presence of small-world structure in the swine movement network. Additionally, high levels of truck sharing between farms were noted in this study, with a typical truck, during the study period, being shared among four different farms. The second and third studies simulated the between farm spread of the PRRS based on the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> and the sharing of trucks among swine farms, using the North American Animal Disease Spread Model and the network-based models respectively. These studies provided a means to assess the relative importance of direct and indirect contact via truck sharing on between farm spread of PRRS virus. By including the transmission by trucks in the model, the median number of infected farms increased by 18 % and the median epidemic size increased by 44 % in the spatial model. Furthermore, with the addition of trucks in the model, the hierarchical structure of the industry was significantly altered and multidirectional disease spread was observed. On the other hand, the network-based models assessed the impact of scale-free, small-world and random network structures on the between farm spread of PRRS virus and demonstrated the influence these network structures can have on the spread of the virus. The spread on scale-free networks resulted in the smallest stochastic die-out percentage with highest epidemic sizes compared to spread on small-world or random networks. Similarly, the incorporation of transmission by trucks in the model had the highest impact on small-world and random networks, where the epidemic size doubled, compared to scale-free networks, where it increased by 20 - 29 %. Given the importance of transmission of the virus via truck (e. g. indirect contacts) identified in the previous studies, the last chapter aims at (i) quantifying the likelihood that a pig transport truck shared among farms could remain contaminated with PRRS virus at the end of Day 1 and to (ii) evaluate the efficacy of commonly used cleaning and disinfection protocols in eliminating the virus from these trucks. The results of this study suggested, when no cleaning and disinfection protocol is applied, that it is moderately likely that the truck could become contaminated and remain infected with the PRRS virus (mean probability ranged between 0. 338 - 0. 352, when the truck was shared between two farms), and that this risk marginally increased with {{an increase in the number}} of farms the truck was shared among. This final study also suggested that once contaminated, most of the contaminated trucks would likely remain infected for more than one day. The studies presented in this thesis have not only provided a clearer insight into the pattern of contacts between farms, and the impact these contacts can have on PRRS virus spread, but have also highlighted the importance of including data on the sharing of trucks among farms, since trucks will tend to connect farms which would otherwise share no connection. Moreover, the studies in this thesis have reinforced the importance of the proper cleaning and disinfection of trucks between successive shipments, as the findings presented here suggest that with an increasing level of truck sharing between farms, shared trucks are likely to remain contaminated with the virus and sharing of trucks significantly increased the risk of between farm spread of PRRS virus. Not only do the shared trucks have a high probability of becoming contaminated with the virus, but once contaminated, they are likely to remain infected for a comparatively long period particularly in the absence of adequate disinfection. It should be noted that the pig movement data used in this study was not very recent and consisted of movements reported for only four months time period. Additionally, the described models could not be validated due to unavailability of data is another noteworthy limitation of the studies described in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|We applied {{social network}} {{analysis}} to pig trader networks on the Kenya-Uganda border. Social network analysis is a recently developed tool, which is useful for understanding value chains and improving disease control policies. We interviewed a sample of 33 traders about their experiences with trade and African swine fever (ASF), analyzed the networks they generated in purchasing pigs and selling pork and their potential contribution to modulating dissemination of the ASF virus (ASFV). The majority of the traders were aware of clinical signs of ASF {{and the risk of}} trade transmitting ASFV. Most said they avoided buying pigs from ASF outbreak villages or sick pigs but their experiences also indicated that inadvertent purchase was relatively common. Traders had early knowledge of outbreaks since they were contacted by farmers who had heard rumours and wanted to sell their pigs to avoid the risk of them dying. Individual traders bought pigs in up to nine villages, and up to six traders operated in a village. Although each trade typically spanned less than 5 km, networks of the various traders, comprising <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> from source villages to slaughter slabs/sites and retail outlets, and <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> pork to villages where it was consumed, linked up indirectly across the 100 km x 50 km study area and revealed several trade pathways across the Kenya-Uganda border. ASF could potentially spread across this area and beyond through sequential pig and pork transactions. Regulation <b>of</b> the <b>pig</b> and pork trade was minimal in practice. The risk of ASFV being spread by traders was compounded by their use of poorly constructed slaughter slabs/sites with open drainage, ineffective or non-existent meat inspection services, lack of provision for biosecurity in the value chain, and sales of pork to customers who were unaware of the risks to their own pigs from contact with ASF infected pork. More effective regulation is warranted. However, limitations on government capacity, together with the strong self-interest that established traders have in reducing the disruption and financial losses that outbreaks cause, highlight the importance of governments and traders co-developing an approach to ASF control. Formation of trader organizations or common interest groups warrants government support as an important step in engaging traders in developing and implementing effective approaches {{to reduce the risk of}} ASF outbreaks.

40|$|Livestock play an {{important}} role in the social, cultural and economic environment of the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs). Currently, the development of the livestock sector in the Pacific region is constrained by a number of factors, including animal health status requirements. So far, the Pacific Islands region has a favourable animal health situation but it is a challenge to maintain a disease free environment in an area composed of 25, 000 islands dispersed over 180 million square kilometres. While most of the PICTs face a critical shortage of veterinarians and have limited financial resources, this study aims to examine ways by which animal disease surveillance in the Pacific Islands region could be better targeted to enable more efficient use of scarce resources in the PICTs. Within this context, a literature review was conducted to synthesize data across studies from peer-reviewed and grey literature on the animal diseases in the Pacific Islands region. Based on the outputs of the meta-analysis, a multicriteria prioritization process was then developed to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national levels. Pig and poultry husbandry being of primary importance for the Pacific communities, farmer practices and the <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> and poultry were then examined in four selected PICTs (Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu), using questionnaire survey and social network analysis tools in view of better predicting how diseases could potentially spread in the region. Finally, a combined pig and poultry market chain and risk pathway analysis was conducted in these four PICTs to identify the highest risk areas (risk hotspots) and risky practices and behaviours (risk factors) of animal disease introduction and/or spread, using highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) as model diseases because of their potential importance in the region.
