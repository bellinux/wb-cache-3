The resulting speed difference between <b>mainshaft</b> and reverse idler gear produces gear noise grinding. The reverse gear noise reduction system employs a cam plate which {{was added to the}} reverse shift holder. When shifting into reverse, the 5th/reverse shift piece, connected to the shift lever, rotates the cam plate. This causes the 5th synchro set to stop the rotating <b>mainshaft.</b> (13-4) ...|$|E

5000|$|Today, the Triumph Vitesse is much sought-after car by enthusiasts; parts {{supply is}} excellent, and the cars have a {{reputation}} for near [...] "bullet-proof" [...] mechanics. This is not completely warranted. The gearbox of the 2 litre suffered from wear of the output shaft [...] "nose" [...] that mates with the input shaft. It was under engineered from the first and frequently wore through the hardened surface necessitating a rebuild with metal spraying and resurfacing. Nowadays it is possible to buy 'Heavy-duty' <b>mainshafts</b> for the overdrive gearboxes with a bigger 18mm diameter tip and a much stronger needle roller bearing. This upgrade is based on the re-designed 4-speed gearbox for later TR7 and Dolomite 1850 models, which are basically the same gearbox. The differentials were never up to the power of even the 2 litre and would not stand regular 0-60 blasts without either crown wheel tooth loss or shearing of half shafts. The idiosyncratic threaded front suspension setup is also an area where incorrect maintenance (grease instead of gear oil or no regular lubrication) leads to dramatic failures.|$|R
50|$|In many {{transmissions}} {{the input}} and output components of the <b>mainshaft</b> can be locked {{together to create a}} 1:1 gear ratio, causing the power flow to bypass the countershaft. The <b>mainshaft</b> then behaves like a single, solid shaft: a situation referred to as direct drive.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mainshaft</b> extends {{outside the}} case in both {{directions:}} the input shaft towards the engine, and the output shaft towards the rear axle (on rear wheel drive cars. Front wheel drives generally have the engine and transmission mounted transversely, the differential {{being part of the}} transmission assembly.) The shaft is suspended by the main bearings, and is split towards the input end. At the point of the split, a pilot bearing holds the shafts together. The gears and clutches ride on the <b>mainshaft,</b> the gears being free to turn relative to the <b>mainshaft</b> except when engaged by the clutches.|$|E

50|$|In a rear-wheel-drive transmission, {{the input}} and output shaft lie along the same line, and {{may in fact be}} {{combined}} into a single shaft within the transmission. This single shaft is called a <b>mainshaft.</b> The {{input and output}} ends of this combined shaft rotate independently, at different speeds, which is possible because one piece slides into a hollow bore in the other piece, where it is supported by a bearing. Sometimes the term <b>mainshaft</b> refers to just the input shaft or just the output shaft, rather than the entire assembly.|$|E
50|$|Many {{transmissions}} and {{gears used}} in automotive and truck applications {{are contained in}} a cast iron case, though more frequently aluminium is used for lower weight especially in cars. There are usually three shafts: a <b>mainshaft,</b> a countershaft, and an idler shaft.|$|E
50|$|Today, on {{most modern}} {{aircraft}} the swashplate {{is above the}} transmission and the pushrods are visible outside the fuselage, but a few early designs, notably light helicopters built by Enstrom Helicopter, placed it underneath the transmission and enclosed the rotating pushrods inside the <b>mainshaft.</b> This reduces rotor hub drag {{since there are no}} exposed linkages.|$|E
5000|$|On some Wankel engines the sump oil remains {{uncontaminated}} by {{the combustion}} process, so no oil changes are required. The {{oil in the}} <b>mainshaft</b> is totally sealed from the combustion process. The oil for Apex seals and crankcase lubrication is separate. In piston engines the crankcase oil is contaminated by combustion blow-by through the piston rings.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{indication}} for archery in Europe {{comes from}} Stellmoor in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg, Germany. They {{were associated with}} artifacts of the late Paleolithic (11,000-9,000BP). The arrows were made of pine and consisted of a <b>mainshaft</b> and a 15-20 centimetre (6-8 inches) long foreshaft with a flint point. They had shallow grooves on the base, indicating that they were shot from a bow.|$|E
50|$|To {{control the}} {{collective}} {{pitch of the}} main rotor blades, the entire swashplate must be moved up or down along its axis without changing {{the orientation of the}} cyclic controls. Conventionally, the entire swashplate is moved along the <b>mainshaft</b> by a separate actuator. However, some newer model helicopters remove this mechanically complex separation of functionalities by using three interdependent actuators that can each move the entire swashplate. This is called cyclic/collective pitch mixing.|$|E
50|$|The {{distribution}} of the shifters is also a matter of design; it need {{not be the case}} that all of the free-rotating gears with selectors are on one shaft, and the permanently splined gears on the other. For instance a five-speed transmission might have the first-to-second selectors on the countershaft, but the third-to-fourth selector and the fifth selector on the <b>mainshaft,</b> which is the configuration in the 1998 Honda Civic. This means that when the car is stopped and idling in neutral with the clutch engaged and the input shaft spinning, the third, fourth and fifth gear pairs do not rotate.|$|E
50|$|The MT75 {{has five}} speeds and reverse. This {{was the first}} Ford {{production}} gearbox to have a synchromesh on reverse (so reverse can be selected whilst in slight forward motion).The internal gear assembly in order {{from front to back}} as installed on the <b>mainshaft</b> is as follows: 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, Reverse with 5th gear situated at the rear towards the output (propshaft flange), all gears are of a helical cut with the exception of reverse which is straight cut. Refined over time with slight improvement made to the synchro's phasing out single part synchromesh's on 1st & 2nd gear in favour of three part syncro's.|$|E
50|$|The mill {{was built}} on Lytham marshes around 1805 on land leased by the local {{landowner}} and squire to miller Richard Cookson. Some of the mill's machinery, including a 150-year-old <b>mainshaft</b> of Baltic oak, was salvaged from other local mills. The plinth which now surrounds the mill was added later for safety reasons. The original smoky drying kiln, once adjacent to the mill, was moved to Kiln Street after pressure from well-to-do local residents in the growing town. The surrounding land was later levelled and grassed to form a ribbon green between the houses and the sea, {{in the middle of}} which stands the mill.|$|E
5000|$|... 491 {{pieces of}} worked wood and reed were recovered. Most of the {{finished}} artifacts {{were related to the}} hunt, while the digging sticks represented the gathering aspect of the economy. A small variety of gaming pieces could infer leisure time or perhaps a nonsecular side of the culture. Fragments of atlatl darts and throwing boards represented the use of atlatl. There was no firm evidence for feathering of mainshafts of the darts, which consisted of a shallow cup in the proximal end to engage the pointed spur on the distal end. The <b>mainshaft</b> specimens collected were too fragmentary to estimate the length. the throwing boards were also too fragmentary to establish a good estimate of their size or form. The arrows collected were represented by a compound type with a reed <b>mainshaft</b> and a wooden foreshaft. Dalley concluded that the compound arrow was the most common type found in the cave. A striking change from using atlatl to bow and arrow could be seen when comparing the strata. From strata 1 through 8 there were only atlatl and dart items, whereas strata 12 to 16 contained only bow and arrow items. Strata 9 and 10 contained a mixture of both weapons and there were no occurrences of either type in strata 11. However, Dalley identified two weaknesses in the interpretation. First, a stratum rather than an artifact was dated and secondly, the inferences were based on few and fragmentary artifacts which some of them had a lack of distinctive characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} Honda CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had {{horizontally}} split crankcases, the Trident engine {{was essentially a}} vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360° crankshaft, this new triple had crankpins offset 120° and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet multiplate clutch, this triple had a dry single-plate clutch in a housing between the primary chaincase and the gearbox. Mounted {{on the end of}} the gearbox <b>mainshaft</b> (where the clutch would be expected) was a large transmission shock-absorber.|$|E
50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the <b>mainshaft,</b> since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the <b>mainshaft</b> is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the output shaft, and to engage a gear to the shaft, the collar slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|E
50|$|The car {{features}} a supercharged 6.2L LSA engine with 1.9L supercharger @ 7psi SAE-rated at 580 horsepower (426.59 kW) and 556 lb.-ft. of torque (754 Nm) - {{making it the}} most-powerful production Camaro ever. Power is delivered to the rear wheels by either a six-speed manual TR-6060 or the 6L90 automatic transmission. The manual has a stronger output shaft, a more robust rear housing, and an additional <b>mainshaft</b> roller bearing to provide 30-percent more torque capacity than the automatic transmission used in the Camaro SS. To improve shift quality, there are triple synchros in some gears and a revised linkage. A new dual-mass flywheel is bolted to a high-capacity twin-disc clutch. The automatic has additional clutch plates, a strengthened output shaft, and is programmed with three operating modes (Drive/Sport/Manual).|$|E
5000|$|The 1280 kg {{car would}} have a 200 kg, 20 kWh {{lithium-ion}} battery pack, powering a [...] / 150 Nm electric motor.

It would be mounted with the <b>mainshaft</b> vertical under the car's boot (trunk) via three mounting points (eliminating vertical vibration), and in the prototype testing showed the rotary engine was over 5dBa quieter at the same revs than an equivalent gasoline or diesel reciprocating piston engine. In the 1970s, Mazda had developed a single rotor engine, called the 3A {{to be used in}} the Mazda Chantez, displacing 360cc per chamber, but it was never placed into production.|$|E
5000|$|The bow {{and arrow}} {{seems to have been}} invented in the later Paleolithic or early Mesolithic periods. The oldest signs of its use in Europe come from the [...] in the [...] north of Hamburg, Germany and dates from the late Paleolithic, about 10,000-9000 BC. The arrows were made of pine and {{consisted}} of a <b>mainshaft</b> and a 15 - 20 cm long fore shaft with a flint point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are known, but may have been launched by spear-throwers rather than bows. The oldest bows known so far come from the Holmegård swamp in Denmark. Bows eventually replaced the spear-thrower as the predominant means for launching shafted projectiles, on every continent except Australasia, though spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the Inuit.|$|E
50|$|The Watermill {{is built}} from red Norfolk brick over three storeys in six bays {{to the west}} elevation. Four of the six bays are {{recessed}} within giant enclosing arches. The arches are semicircular headed with raised ashlars and a Keystone. In {{the center of the}} west elevation of the mill there is a timber lucam (covered sack hoist) of shiplap construction. In front of the west elevation there is a bridge with a three centered arch through which the mill race flows. The bridge has a parapet wall. The rear east elevation is constructed with weatherboard cladding with a continuous first floor outshoot which houses machinery of the mill. Below this there are sluice gates beneath a three centered archway. The ground and first floor of the mill still contains the Mill wheel and the machinery all which are now listed. The surviving machinery includes a 13 ft wheel driving pit-wheel and wallower. There is a horizontal <b>mainshaft</b> that once drove 6 pairs of stones, although there are only five that now survive.The mill race still flows through under the building.|$|E
50|$|In 1937 {{bodies were}} the same except for drip moldings running {{from the bottom of}} the front pillar up and over the doors and rear quarter window, new fenders and bumpers, {{headlights}} rigidly attached (adjusted by moving reflector), wheel discs incorporated a hubcap, and a built-in trunk was incorporated on most bodies. A die-cast eggcrate grille was used, but the hood louver treatment differed from that used in Fisher bodied cars. Chrome die cast strips were used at the rear of the hood side panels. A seven-passenger Fisher-bodied Special touring sedan, without a division window was offered on the 138.0 in wheelbase. These two body styles had the eggcrate hood louvers typical of all Fisher bodied Cadillacs for 1937. The Business car line included eight-passenger versions of these Special sedans plus eight-passenger versions of Fleetwood body styles. The eighth passenger was seated with two others on auxiliary seats. A commercial chassis on a 156.0 in wheelbase was offered. Engine changes included a lighter flywheel, a generator relocated in the vee, an oil filter, a new carburetor with full automatic electric choke, an oil bath cleaner, and a relocated distributor. A new transmission design featured pin-type synchronizers, shifter rails relocated to the side of the case, a cover on the bottom of the case, and an extension integral with the transmission <b>mainshaft.</b> Sales totaled 4,332.|$|E
5000|$|A Toploader {{transmission}} is a manually shifted {{three and four}} speed gearbox introduced in 1963 by the Ford Motor Company to replace the BorgWarner T-10. It was used in most Fords and Mercurys from 1964 until 1973 {{as well as some}} foreign models. Officially designated the 3.03 three speed or Ford design four speed. The 3.03 is the centerline distance between counter shaft and <b>mainshaft.</b> The Toploader got its name {{from the fact that the}} access plate to the inner workings was located on the top of the main case as opposed to the side, a convention used on most gearboxes such as the Ford Dagenham or GM's Saginaw or Muncie. This feature increased the rigidity of the case significantly. Distinguishing the three speed from the four is as simple as counting the fasteners on the top plate. The four speed has ten; the three, nine. Both the three and four speed top loader gearboxes were designed to function in constant mesh, due to synchronizer sleeves being used instead of sliding gears, and be fully synchronized, with the exception of reverse. Forward gears are helical-type while reverse gear including the exterior of the first and second synchronizers sleeve are spur-type gears. This {{transmission is}} also known as the Tremec T-170, HEH, or RUG depending on the year(s) of production. [...] At some point in the early 70's production was moved to Mexico and the name was changed to Tremec.|$|E

Test bearing was a 125 mm bore split inner ring, outer race riding {{angular contact ball bearing}} under a 3280 lb. thrust load. One lubricant, a type 2 ester, performed extremely well. The <b>mainshaft</b> seal limited the performance. Numerous design improvements for this seal were indicated...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} and system study {{was performed to}} provide design information regarding lubricant and coolant flow rates and flow paths for effective utilization of the lubricant and coolant in a once-through oil-mist (microfog) and coolant air system. A system was designed, manufactured, coupled with an existing rig and evaluation tests were performed using 46 mm bore split-inner angular-contact ball bearings under 1779 N (400 lb.) thrust load. An emergency lubrication aspirator system was also manufactured and tested under lost lubricant conditions. The testing demonstrated the feasibility of using a mist oil and cooling air system to lubricate and cool a high speed helicopter engine <b>mainshaft</b> bearing. The testing also demonstrated the feasibility of using an emergency aspirator lubrication system as a viable survivability concept for helicopter <b>mainshaft</b> engine bearing for periods as long as 30 minutes...|$|E

40|$|Material {{selection}} for <b>mainshaft</b> face and ring seals, labyrinth seals, accessory gearbox face seals, and lip seals {{are discussed in}} light of tribology requirements and a given seal application. Carbon graphite {{has been found to}} be one of the best sealing materials and it is widely used in current gas turbine <b>mainshaft</b> and accessory gearbox seals. Its popularity is due to its unique combination of properties which consists of dimensional stability, corrosion resistance, low friction, good self lubricating characteristics, high thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion, the latter two properties combining to provide good thermal shock resistance. A brief description of the seals and the requirements they must meet are discussed to provide insight into the limitations and advantages of the seals in containing the lubricant. A forecast is made of the operational requirements of main shaft and gearbox seals for advanced engines and candidate materials and coatings that may satisfy these advanced engine requirements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the aero-engine <b>mainshaft</b> {{roller bearing}} D 1842926 under typical {{operating}} conditions {{is taken as}} a case study, a new integrated numerical algorithm of quasi-dynamics and thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) is put forward, which can complete the bearing lubricated analysis from global dynamic performance to local TEHL state and {{break out of the}} traditional analysis way carried out independently in their own field. The 3 -D film thickness distributions with different cases are given through integrated numerical algorithm, meanwhile the minimum film thickness of quasi-dynamic analysis, integrated numerical algorithm and testing are compared, which show that integrated numerical results have good agreements with the testing data, so the algorithm is demonstrated available and can judge the lubrication state more accurately. The parameter effects of operating and structure on pv value, cage sliding rate, TEHL film pressure, thickness and temperature are researched, which will provide an important theoretical basis for the structure design and optimization of aero-engine <b>mainshaft</b> roller bearing...|$|E
40|$|This poster {{describes}} the NREL/Alstom Wind testing and model verification of the Alstom 3 -MW wind turbine located at NREL's National Wind Technology Center. NREL,in collaboration with ALSTOM Wind, {{is studying a}} 3 -MW wind turbine installed at the National Wind Technology Center(NWTC). The project analyzes the turbine design using a state-of-the-art simulation code validated with detailed test data. This poster {{describes the}} testing and the model validation effort, and provides conclusions about {{the performance of the}} unique drive train configuration used in this wind turbine. The 3 -MW machine has been operating at the NWTC since March 2011, and drive train measurements will be collected through the spring of 2012. The NWTC testing site has particularly turbulent wind patterns that allow for the measurement of large transient loads and the resulting turbine response. This poster describes the 3 -MW turbine test project, the instrumentation installed, and the load cases captured. The design of a reliable wind turbine drive train increasingly relies on the use of advanced simulation to predict structural responses in a varying wind field. This poster presents a fully coupled, aero-elastic and dynamic model of the wind turbine. It also shows the methodology used to validate the model, including the use of measured tower modes, model-to-model comparisons of the power curve, and <b>mainshaft</b> bending predictions for various load cases. The drivetrain is designed to only transmit torque to the gearbox, eliminating non-torque moments that are known to cause gear misalignment. Preliminary results show that the drivetrain is able to divert bending loads in extreme loading cases, and that a significantly smaller bending moment is induced on the <b>mainshaft</b> compared to a three-point mounting design...|$|E
40|$|Two used {{turbopump}} <b>mainshaft</b> {{support bearings}} were examined to determine steps {{needed to achieve}} turbopump lifetimes of 27, 000 seconds. The two bearings, which had been run in a high pressure oxygen turbopump, are angular contact ball bearings, applied as a preloaded pair, locked to the shaft, inner race rotating, with the outer races unrestrained axially. Examination showed that both bearings had been subjected to overloads, leading to fatigue spalling on the races and balls and advanced retainer wear. This is clear evidence of unintended high internal loads in the high pressure oxygen pump which would lead to complete bearing failure and extensive secondary pump damage. Action {{must be taken to}} reduce the applied bearing loads or to incorporate bearings of sufficient size to withstand the high loads...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{evaluation of}} <b>mainshaft</b> seals for small gas turbine engines {{was conducted with}} shaft speeds to 213 m/s (700 ft/sec), air pressures to 148 Newtons per square centimeter abs.

In addition, three conventional carbon seal types (face, circumferential segmented, and rotating ring) were run for comparison. Test {{results indicated that the}} conventional seals used in this evaluation may not be satisfactory in future advanced engines because of excessive air leakage. On the other hand, the self-acting face seal was shown to have the potential capability of limiting leakages to one-half that of the conventional face seals and one-fifth that of conventional ring seals. A 150 -hour endurance test of the self-acting face seal was conducted...|$|E
