5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal reform {{is hard to}} find but his reign saw a major programme of legal change. Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of <b>Mortmain,</b> Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1550 {{the city}} {{purchased}} the former chantry chapel and college of St John the Evangelist beside the cathedral {{for the use}} of the grammar school out of the £200 each year at their disposal in a licence in <b>mortmain</b> to purchase and add to the revenues of the Great Hospital. Founded in 1316 by John Salmon, Bishop of Norwich, the chapel, in addition to its role as a chantry dedicated to the souls of Salmon's parents and the predecessors and successors of the Bishops of Norwich had also been used as a charnel house and contained the Wodehouse chantry, founded by Henry V at the request of John Wodehous, a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt. The school moved to the site in the summer of 1551, where it has remained ever since. The chapel was used as the main schoolroom while the other buildings were used to provide a library and accommodation for the master and boarding pupils. The arrangement continued until the 19th century, and today the building is used as the school chapel.|$|E
5|$|The 1290 {{statute of}} Quo warranto {{was only one}} part of a wider {{legislative}} effort, {{which was one of the}} most important contributions of EdwardI's reign. This era of legislative action had started already at the time of the baronial reform movement; the Statute of Marlborough (1267) contained elements both of the Provisions of Oxford and the Dictum of Kenilworth. The compilation of the Hundred Rolls was followed shortly after by the issue of Westminster I (1275), which asserted the royal prerogative and outlined restrictions on liberties. In the <b>Mortmain</b> (1279), the issue was grants of land to the church. The first clause of WestminsterII (1285), known as De donis conditionalibus, dealt with family settlement of land, and entails. Merchants (1285) established firm rules for the recovery of debts, while Winchester (1285) dealt with peacekeeping on a local level. Quia emptores (1290)issued along with Quo warrantoset out to remedy land ownership disputes resulting from alienation of land by subinfeudation. The age of the great statutes largely ended with the death of Robert Burnell in 1292.|$|E
25|$|Several cases {{recorded}} {{where the}} King specifically forbade the tenant from alienating {{a church or}} land held in perpetuity by the Crown, and presumably the equivalent of <b>mortmain.</b> These cases are dated 1164, 1221 and 1227. After 1217, there was a forfeiture of land to the great lord in cases of unauthorized alienation in <b>mortmain.</b> Henry III granted conspicuous favor to the Church and left the proclamations of 1215-1217 largely unenforced. The proscription was reintroduced and made more forcible by Henry III’s son, Edward I in the Statute of <b>Mortmain</b> in 1279.|$|E

25|$|His son, Edward I of England, was {{interested}} in re-establishing the precedent set in the Magna Carta and the Great Charter of 1217. The Statutes of <b>Mortmain</b> provided that no estate should be granted to a corporation without royal assent. The problem of Church lands persisted with the practice of cestui que use. It was finally brought to a close when Henry VIII of England disbanded the monasteries and confiscated Church lands.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the land}} {{came into the}} control of the Church, it could never be relinquished. Since the Church never died, the land could never be {{inherited}} or escheated to the lord. This {{came to be known as}} the “death hand” (<b>mortmain).</b> Either the Church was the death hand, or the hand of the dead still controlled land by willing it to the Church. The actions of people who had died generations before still controlled the land. This was also the “death hand”.|$|E
25|$|War {{with the}} Armagnac party in France {{was a serious}} threat when Burley began to {{establish}} a chantry {{for himself and his}} wife Juliana. On 1 December 1414, using the rector of Upton Magna and vicar of Wrockwardine as his feoffees, and for a fine of £20, he received a licence to alienate in <b>mortmain</b> substantial property to Shrewsbury Abbey, where his associate Prestbury was still abbot. These were holdings at Alveley and included two messuages, seven tofts, 2½ virgates and 21 acres of land, 8 acres of meadow, 12 acres of woodland, 57s. 1d. in rents and a third share in a weir. In return the abbey promised to find a chaplain from within the monastic chapter to celebrate mass daily for Burley and Juliana in the chapel of St Katharine.|$|E
25|$|Edward imposed his {{authority}} on the Church with the Statutes of <b>Mortmain</b> that prohibited the donation of land to the Church, asserted {{the rights of the}} Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. He also emphasised the role of Parliament and the common law through significant legislation, a survey of local government and the codification of laws originating from Magna Carta with the Statute of Westminster 1275. Edward also enacted economic reforms on wool exports to take customs, which amounted to nearly £10,000 a year, and imposed licence fees on gifts of land to the Church. Feudal jurisdiction was regulated by the Statute of Gloucester and Quo Warranto. The Statute of Winchester enforced Plantagenet policing authority. The Statute of Westminster 1285 kept estates within families: tenants only held property for life and were unable to sell the property. Quia Emptores stopped sub-infeudation where tenants subcontracted their properties and related feudal services.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Richard II, the priory was granted a licence in <b>mortmain</b> to hold lands valued at 26s 8d which {{returned}} 60s 8d annually. In 1523, the priory was proposed by Cardinal Wolsey to be dissolved as one of 40 priories and monasteries sold to provide fund {{for the establishment of}} Christ Church, Oxford. At that time, the priory was assessed as being worth £48 13s 4d. The dissolution happened on 8 February 1525. Wolsey was to provide a free grammar school for 40 pupils in exchange for the closure of the priory. The townsfolk of Tonbridge were against this plan, wanting to retain the priory. At a meeting in Maidstone, held in June 1525, only 16 people attended, of whom 13 were in favour of keeping the priory. The issue was still undecided at Wolsey's death in 1530. The priory then passed to the Crown and was granted to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor. It was not until 1553 that Andrew Judde established Tonbridge Free Grammar School.|$|E
2500|$|The Statutes of <b>Mortmain</b> {{were two}} enactments, in 1279 and 1290, by Edward I of England aimed at {{preserving}} the kingdom's revenues by preventing land from passing into {{the possession of}} the Church. Possession of property by a corporation such as the church was known as <b>mortmain.</b> <b>Mortmain</b> literally means [...] "the dead hand." [...] In Medieval England, feudal estates generated taxes (in the form of incidents) upon the inheritance or granting of the estate.|$|E

2500|$|The Statute of Marlborough {{had been}} the nominal {{endpoint}} of the Second Barons' War. The omission of restrictions on the Church can be directly traced to Henry III and his sympathy to the clergy, according to Plucknett. In 1279 the Statute De Viris Religiosis referred to the Provisions of Westminster {{as if they had}} been settled law, added a check on alienations made in <b>mortmain.</b>|$|E

2500|$|It was not effective. Land {{could be}} still {{be left to}} the Church by the {{mechanism}} of cestui que use. Henry VII of England expended much energy in the courts trying to break the legal grip of [...] "uses" [...] by Church corporations. The Statute of Uses three centuries after the Statutes of <b>Mortmain</b> would attempt, with only partial success to end the practice of cestui que use. Henry VIII of England would resolve the problem once and for all by disbanding the monasteries and confiscating all church land.|$|E
2500|$|If {{an estate}} {{was owned by}} a {{religious}} corporation that never died, attained majority, or became attainted for treason, these taxes were never paid. The Statutes of <b>Mortmain</b> were meant to re-establish the prohibition against donating land to the Church for purposes of avoiding feudal services which had been hinted at in the Magna Carta in 1215 and specifically defined in the Great Charter of 1217. John of England died shortly after the Magna Carta was signed. Henry III of England, the son of John, did not enforce these proscriptions. He showed great deference to the Church.|$|E
2500|$|No {{religious}} {{persons were}} to acquire land. If they did, {{the land was}} forfeited to the lord, {{and he had a}} brief term given for him {{to take advantage of the}} forfeiture. If he failed to do so, the lord next above him in the feudal scale had a similar opportunity. This continued up to the king. The statute did not merely condemn frankalmoin; the religious are not to acquire more land, even though they are willing to pay a full rent for it. If the lord was willing, the land could be granted to the religious body by his inaction. Licenses to acquire land in <b>mortmain</b> were easily obtained in those years. King Henry III was sympathetic to religious bodies during his long reign.|$|E
2500|$|The abbey's {{lands and}} other income sources were found all over Shropshire, {{although}} sparse in the south-west, where Earl Roger had less power and influence. As well as landed estates, {{there were a}} number of lucrative churches, salt pans and fisheries. After the first spate of donations there was a tendency for endowments to become more scattered, with grants in Lancashire, Staffordshire, Cheshire and even Cambridgeshire. It was impossible to dispose legally of <b>mortmain</b> properties, as they were inherently inalienable: [...] Church property could be lost only if there was doubt about its status. Billingsley was given up to Sées Abbey in exchange for recognition of Shrewsbury's rights in Lancashire. Part of Betton was surrendered to Hamo Lestrange, and is still known as Betton Strange. In 1286 Edward I ordered the surrender of lands at Mere in Staffordshire, a royal grant to the abbey, which Abbot Drayton had given away to William de Merton.|$|E
2500|$|The two manors existed. Ash (Esche, 7th century; Asshe, Assche, 14th century) {{shares with}} the other a {{prominent}} social history starting with at least the Norman period of the Domesday book whose commissioners wrote [...] "Azor granted [...] for his soul to Chertsey {{in the time of}} King William. [...] Later a 1279 chartulary of Chertsey Abbey records the prohibition of any perpetual title of institutions (as the Abbey states, vulgarly called the prohibition of <b>mortmain)</b> as led here to 11 acres in Ash with sufficient common pasture for his flocks and herds being held by Robert de Zathe, while Geoffrey de Bacsete (Bagshot) and his brother William had 28 acres. The Atwaters of West Clandon also held land in Ash. [...] Nonetheless, from the church's freehold, overall control passed from 1537 in the Dissolution of the Monasteries to Winchester College. [...] Henley, also seen as Henle, (14th century) and Suth henle and Henle on the Heth usually to distinguish Henley on Thames has hosted a long list of prominent figures. [...] The de Henley, de Molyns , the crown as owner from Edward I to Charles I, Arthur Squib whose daughter married its next owner John Glynne, occupied briefly by the Duke of Roxburgh then via Glynne's granddaughter's husband, Sir Richard Child, created Earl of Tylney it then passed to ambassador and diplomat Solomon Dayrolles, upon whose death John Halsey bought it, whose family owned it from the 18th to 20th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|In 1392 Cokayne was {{party to}} an {{important}} donation intended to fund a chantry at St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. On 18 March he, together with John Kniveton, Roger Bradbourne and Richard Cokayne, granted rents worth 100 shillings {{a year from the}} manor of Mercaston to William Hyde, the church's chaplain. In this, they were acting as feoffees for Nicholas Kniveton and the purpose of the chantry was to pray for the souls of the Kniveton family, who were probably relatives of the Cokaynes. Cokayne was involved in the process over some time, as he had witnessed the transfer by feoffees of the Mercaston estate to Johanna, the widow of Nicholas Kniveton, in June 1391. As was customary, the souls of others concerned in the grant were included, and in this case John, Duke of Aquitaine and Lancaster was named, as the manor was held of him, together with John Sheppey, the Dean of Lincoln, who confirmed the grant. Hyde paid £20 for the licence to accept the alienation in <b>mortmain</b> of the rents, a costly privilege because the property passed thereby outside the land market and beyond most royal taxation. With reference to a later donation to set up a chantry at Ashbourne for the Bradbourne family, the local historian Susan Wright comments on the peculiar [...] "intensity of relations, including much intermarriage, among those families with manors between the Dove valley and Derby in the Peak foothills" [...] which was both celebrated and created through such rituals.|$|E

6000|$|Guy was in {{the north}} of Ireland, cock-shooting. So Ralph <b>Mortmain</b> told me, and also that the match between Mary Brandagee and Guy had been broken off by Flora Billingsgate.

60|$|Edward gave liberally to the Church, {{especially}} {{to the order of}} Dominican, or Preaching Friars; but it was found that in some instances the clergy had worked on men's consciences to obtain from them the bequest of lands to the injury of their heirs, and a statute was therefore passed to prevent such legacies from being valid unless they received the sanction of the Crown. This was called the Statute of <b>Mortmain,</b> or Dead Hands, because the framers of the act considered the hands of the monastic orders as dead and unprofitable.|$|E
60|$|A {{settlement}} in <b>mortmain</b> is in Scotland termed a mortification, {{and in one}} great borough (Aberdeen, if I remember rightly) there is a municipal officer {{who takes care of}} these public endowments, and is thence called the Master of Mortifications. One would almost presume that the term had its origin in the effect which such settlements usually produce upon the kinsmen of those by whom they are executed. Heavy at least was the mortification which befell the audience who, in the late Mrs. Margaret Bertram's parlour, had listened to this unexpected destination of the lands of Singleside. There was a profound silence after the deed had been read over.|$|E
60|$|The {{coastguard}} {{said the}} man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his teeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications later on, in the Admiralty Court, for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is {{the right of the}} first civilian entering on a derelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the statues of <b>mortmain,</b> since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a dead hand.|$|E
6000|$|... [304] [...] "As to the <b>Mortmain</b> Acts, {{the matter}} is clearly charitable, and unless in the conveyances and leases to Booth, or to the {{trustees}} (if any) named by him, all {{the provisions of the}} Acts have been complied with, and the deeds have been enrolled under the Acts, they would be void. It is probable, however, that every conveyance and lease has been taken without disclosing any charitable trust, for the purpose of preventing it from being void on the face of it. It is to be noted that the deed is a mere deed poll by Booth himself, without any other party to it, who, as a contracting party, would have a right to enforce it.|$|E
6000|$|To {{smooth the}} way for the return of Popery in Queen Mary's time, the grantees were {{confirmed}} by the Pope in the possession of the abbey lands. But the Bishop tells us, that [...] "this confirmation was fraudulent and invalid" [...] I shall believe it to be so, though I happen to read in his Lordship's history: But he adds, that although the confirmation had been good, the priests would have got their land again by these two methods; [...] "first,[30] the Statute of <b>Mortmain</b> was repealed for 20 years, in which time no doubt they reckoned they would recover the best part of what they had lost; besides that, engaging the clergy to renew no leases, was a thing entirely in their own power, and this in forty years time would raise their revenues to be about ten times their present value." [...] These two expedients for increasing the revenues of the Church, he represents as pernicious designs, fit only to be practised in times of Popery, and such as the laity ought never to consent to: Whence, and from what he said before about tithes, his Lordship has freely declared his opinion, that the clergy are rich enough, and that the least addition to their subsistence would be a step toward Popery. Now it happens, that the two only methods, which could be thought on, with any probability of success, toward some reasonable augmentation of ecclesiastical revenues, are here rejected by a Bishop, as a means for introducing Popery, and the nation publicly warned against them. The continuance of the Statute of <b>Mortmain</b> in full force, after the Church had been so terribly stripped, appeared to Her Majesty and the kingdom a very unnecessary hardship; upon which account it was at several times relaxed by the legislature. Now as the relaxation of that statute is manifestly one of the reasons which gives the Bishop those terrible apprehensions of Popery coming on us; so I conceive another ground of his fears, is the remission of the first-fruits and tenths. But where the inclination to Popery lay, whether in Her Majesty who proposed this benefaction, the parliament which confirmed, or the clergy who accepted it, his Lordship hath not thought fit to determine.|$|E
6000|$|On the 18th of June, 1803, {{his first}} child, John, was born, {{and on the}} 14th of August {{of the same year}} he set out with his sister on a foot journey into Scotland Coleridge was their {{companion}} during a part of this excursion, of which Miss Wordsworth kept a full diary. In Scotland he made the acquaintance of Scott, who recited to him a part of the [...] "Lay of the Last Minstrel," [...] then in manuscript. The travellers returned to Grasmere on the 25th of September. It was during this year that Wordsworth's intimacy with the excellent Sir George Beaumont began. Sir George was an amateur painter of considerable merit, and his friendship was undoubtedly of service to Wordsworth in making him familiar with the laws of a sister art and thus contributing to enlarge the sympathies of his criticism, the tendency of which was toward too great exclusiveness. Sir George Beaumont, dying in 1827, did not forego his regard for the poet, but contrived to hold his affection in <b>mortmain</b> by the legacy of an annuity of £100, to defray the charges of a yearly journey.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} Hadley bells were rung again; {{but they were}} not rung loudly. It seemed to Bertram that no one noticed that {{anything}} more than usually sad was going on. He could hardly realise it to himself {{that he was going to}} put under the ground almost his nearest relative. The bells rang out a dirge, but they did it hardly above their breath. There were but three boys gathered at the little gate before the door to see the body of the rich man carried to his last home. George stood with his back to the empty dining-room fireplace: on one side stood Mr. Pritchett, and on the other the Barnet doctor. Very few words passed between them, {{but they were not}} in their nature peculiarly lugubrious. And then there was a scuffling heard on the stairs--a subdued, decent undertaker's scuffling--as some hour or two before had been heard the muffled click of a hammer. Feet scuffled down the stairs, outside the dining-room door, and along the passage. And then the door was opened, and in low, decent undertaker's voice, red-nosed, sombre, well-fed Mr. <b>Mortmain</b> told them that they were ready.|$|E
60|$|Then again, in {{an unhappy}} hour, they {{discovered}} that the easiest way of getting rich was by persuading sinners, and weak persons, to secure {{the safety of their}} souls by leaving land to the Church, in return for the prayers and masses of monks; and that shameful mine of wealth was worked by them for centuries, in spite of statutes of <b>mortmain,</b> and other checks which the civil power laid on them, very often by most detestable means. One is shocked to find good men lending themselves to such base tricks: but we must recollect, that there has always been among men a public and a private conscience, and that these two, alas! have generally been very different. It is an old saying, that 'committees have no consciences;' and it is too true. A body of men acting in concert for a public purpose will do things which they would shrink from with disgust, if the same trick would merely put money into their private purses; and this is too often the case when the public object is a good one. Then the end seems to sanctify the means, to almost any amount of chicanery.|$|E
60|$|She was there, {{sitting quietly}} before a large, round, shining centre-table, whose sterile {{emptiness}} was relieved {{only by a}} shaded lamp and a large black and gilt open volume. A single picture on the opposite wall--the portrait of an elderly gentleman stiffened over a corresponding volume, which he held in invincible <b>mortmain</b> in his rigid hand, and apparently defied posterity to take from him--seemed to offer a not uncongenial companionship. Yet the greenish light of the shade fell upon a young and pretty face, despite the color it extracted from it, and the hand that supported her low white forehead over which her full hair was simply parted, like a brown curtain, was slim and gentle-womanly. In spite of her plain lustreless silk dress, {{in spite of the}} formal frame of sombre heavy horsehair and mahogany furniture that seemed to set her off, she diffused an atmosphere of cleanly grace and prim refinement through the apartment. The priestess of this ascetic temple, the femininity of her closely covered arms, her pink ears, and a little serviceable morocco house-shoe that was visible lower down, resting on the carved lion's paw that upheld the centre-table, appeared to be only the more accented. And the precisely rounded but softly heaving bosom, that was pressed upon the edges of the open book of sermons before her, seemed to assert itself triumphantly over the rigors of the volume.|$|E
60|$|And {{if it is}} not too sudden a transition, {{it seems}} most {{convenient}} in a Socialist State to leave religious worship entirely to the care of private people; to let them subscribe among themselves, subject, of course, to a reasonable statute of <b>mortmain,</b> to lease land, and build and endow and maintain churches and chapels, altars and holy places and meeting-houses, priests and devout ceremonies. This will be the more easily done since the heavy social burthens that oppress religious bodies at the present time will be altogether lifted from them; they will have no poor to support, no schools, no hospitals, no nursing sisters, the advance of civilization will have taken over these duties of education and humanity that Christianity first taught us to realize. So, too, there seems no objection and no obstacle in Socialism to religious houses, to nunneries, monasteries and the like, so far as these institutions are compatible with personal freedom and the public health, but of course factory laws and building laws will run through all these places, and the common laws and limitations of contract override their vows, if their devotees repent. So that you see Socialism will touch nothing living of religion, and if you are a religious minister, you will be very much as you are at the present time, but with lightened parochial duties. If you are an earnest woman and want to nurse the sick and comfort the afflicted, you will need only, in addition to your religious profession, to qualify as a nurse or medical practitioner. There will still be ample need of you. Socialism will not make an end of human trouble, either of the body or of the soul, albeit it will put these things into such comfort and safety as it may.|$|E
