40|$|This work {{investigated}} the purification of phosphoric acid using a suitable organic solvent, followed by re-extraction of the acid from the solvent using water. The work consisted of practical batch and continuous {{studies and the}} economics and design of a full scale plant, based on the experimental data. A comprehensive literature survey on the purification of wet process phosphoric acid by organic solvents is presented and the literature describing the design and operation of mixer-settlers has also been reviewed. In batch studies, the equilibrium and distribution curves for the systems water-phosphoric acid-solvent for Benzaldehyde, Cyclohexanol and Methylisobutylketone (MIBK) were determined together with hydrodynamic characteristics for both pure and impure systems. The settling time increased with acid concentration, but power input had no effect. Drop size was found to reduce with acid concentration and power input. For the continuous studies a novel horizontal mixer~settler cascade was designed, constructed and operated using pure and impure acid with MIBK as the solvent. The cascade incorporates three air turbine agitated, cylindrical 900 ml mixers, and three cylindrical 200 ml settlers with air-lift solvent interstage transfer. Mean drop size in the fully baffled mixer was correlated. Drop size distributions were log-normal and size decreased with acid concentration and power input and increased with dispersed phase hold-up. Phase inversion studies showed that {{the width of the}} ambivalent region depended upon rotor speed, hold-up and acid concentration. Settler characteristics were investigated by <b>measuring</b> <b>wedge</b> length. Distribution coefficients of impurities and acid were also investigated. The following optimum extraction conditions were found: initial acid concentration 63 %, phase ratio of solvent to acid 1 : 1 (v/v), impeller speed recommended 900 r. p. m. In the washing step the maximum phase ratio of solvent to water was 8 : 1 (v/v). Work on phosphoric acid concentration involved constructing distillation equipment consisting of a 10 & spherical still. A 100 T/d scale detailed process design including capital cost, operating cost and profitability was also completed. A profit model for phosphoric acid extraction was developed and maximised. Recommendations are made for both the application of the results to a practical design and for extensions of the study...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays,  considerable {{developments}}  in  the field  of  radiotherapy have  been  achieved.   They  include  the  advances  made  in  the  equipments  and  treatment  planning  techniques  which  require  {{highly complex}} calculations. Such achievements {{have made it}} possible to treat cancer patients not only  with  higher  radiation  dose  but  also  with  higher  precision  and  consequently  increasing  the  chance  of  curing the cancer. However, the conventional techniques requiring physical wedge are still being used  but with a lesser frequency. One of the wedge parameters needed to be <b>measured</b> is the <b>wedge</b> angle. It is  the angle that the horizontal line creates with the tilted isodose curve at a specific depth and for a certain  field size.   In this study, the variation of wedge angle for different field sizes was evaluated using dosimetric and  mathematical method.   Material and Methods: For the wedge fields with a dimension of 6 × 6 to 20 × 20 cm 2, the wedge angle  for  two  photon  energies  of   6  and   18  MV  was  measured  by  the  dosimetric  method.  For  these  measurements, the conventional wedges having the nominal wedge angle of 15, 30, 45 & 60 were used.   The theoretical method suggested by Saw et al. is also used to indirectly calculate the slope of isodose  curve  by  the  dose  profile  and  percent  depth  dose  data.  The  dose  profile,  percentage  depth  dose  and  isodose curves were drawn for all the field sizes and the tilt of isodose curve at 10 cm depth, according to  international definition, is considered as the wedge angle. The data were obtained using the theoretical  equation of wedge angle and it was compared to the dosimetric data.   Results: The result obtained in this work shows that the wedge angle increases with the field size. For a  6 × 6 cm 2 field size, the calculated wedge angle has the highest difference in comparison to the nominal  wedge angle. The difference is equal to 14. 7 degree for a 45 ° wedge and a 6 MV photon. The highest  difference for a 45 ° wedge angle, a field size of 10 × 10 cm 2 and a 6 MV photon is 9. 2 degree. Comparing  the calculated and <b>measured</b> <b>wedge</b> angles shows a maximum difference of 4 degree for 6 and 18 MV  photon beams.   Discussion  and  Conclusion:  The  wedge  angle  varies  with  field  size.  In  order  to  get  a  better  dose  distribution in the conventional radiotherapy, it is necessary to use the appropriate wedge angle which  generates the desired slope for the isodose line and for the specific field size...|$|R

Literature described the same principle in Rat-tail model. Human spine and its deformity i. e. scoliosis has also same kind of pattern during the growth period which causes wedging in disc or vertebral body. Methods This cross sectional study in 150 patients of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was done to evaluate vertebral body and disc wedging in scoliosis and to compare the extent of differential wedging of body and disc, in thoracic and lumbar area. We <b>measured</b> <b>wedging</b> of vertebral bodies and discs, along with two adjacent vertebrae and disc, {{above and below the}} apex and evaluated them according to severity of curve (curve 30 °) to find the relationship of vertebral body or disc wedging with scoliosis in thoracic and lumbar spine. We also compared the wedging and rotations of vertebrae. Results In both thoracic and lumbar curves, we found that greater the degree of scoliosis, greater the wedging in both disc and body and the degree of wedging was more at apex supporting the theory of growth retardation in stress concentration area. However, the degree of wedging in vertebral body is more than the disc in thoracic spine while the wedging was more in disc than body in lumbar spine. On comparing the wedging with the rotation, we did not find any significant relationship suggesting that it has no relation with rotation. Conclusion From our study, we can conclude that wedging in disc and body are increasing with progression on scoliosis and maximum at apex; however there is differential wedging of body and disc, in thoracic and lumbar area, that is vertebral body wedging is more profound in thoracic area while disc wedging is more profound in lumbar area which possibly form 'vicious cycle' by asymmetric loading to spine for the progression of curve. </p...|$|R

The study shows that the potential gains in terms of aggregate total factor productivity of equalizing marginal productivities of factor inputs across firms in narrowly defined industries is between 50 % and 55 % in relatively normal years, slightly above the 43 % found by HK for the US.

40|$|The cutting {{capacity}} of a cutting instrument is normally defined as its sharpness, which defines {{the ability of the}} cutting edge to cut the target material. Many factors therefore affect the ability of a blade to cut, including the target material, the manufacturing process, and the cutting forces associated with cutting technique employed (Kalder S., 1997). In this study of techniques for measurement of the cutting edge profile various methods were used to measure blade profiles and found that no one method of measurement was capable of quantifying all the geometric parameters of the cutting edge of the blade. SUB 3 (Sharpness of Unserrated Blades for Biomaterials and Biocomposites) is a research project focusing on the specification of sharpness measurement for surgical blades. A component of the work of the SUB 3 project is the design and build of a prototype device for blade profile measurement. This project contributes a device capable of measuring the profile and wedge angle of the cutting flanks of a surgical osteotome. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the measurement of sharpness with particular relevance to non-contact measurement of the geometric parameters of the surfaces of the cutting instrument.

40|$|Tight-skin (TSK) mice are {{commonly}} used as an animal model to study the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome (MFS), but little is known of their skeletal phenotype and in particular {{of the development of}} the spinal deformities, common in MFS. Here we examined growth of the axial skeletons of TSK and wild-type(B 6) mice during their period of rapid growth. The whole bodies of mice, 4 - 12 weeks of age, were scanned after sacrifice, by micro-computed tomography (microCT). We reconstructed three-dimensional models of the spine and ribs, and measured vertebral body heights and rib lengths using the Mac-based image-processing software "OsiriX". Although the TSK mice were smaller than the B 6 mice at 4 weeks, they experienced an early growth spurt and by 8 weeks the height, but not the width, of the vertebral body was significantly greater in the TSK mice than the B 6 mice. Measurement of the angles of scoliotic and kyphotic curves post-mortem in the mice was problematic, hence we measured changes that develop in skeletal elements in these disorders. As a marker of kyphosis, we <b>measured</b> anterior <b>wedging</b> of the vertebral bodies; as a marker for scoliosis we measured asymmetries in rib length. We found, unlike in the B 6 mice where the pattern was diffuse, wedging in TSK mice was directly related to spinal level and peaked steeply at the thoracolumbar junction. There was also significant asymmetry in length of the ribs in the TSK mice, but not in the B 6 mice. The TSK mice thus appear to exhibit spinal deformities seen in MFS and could be a useful model for gaining understanding of the mechanisms of development of scoliosis and kyphosis in this disorder...|$|R

Even {{a small percentage of}} the total treatment dose might cause injury in such cases. The sources of peripheral dose are leakage from the treatment unit, scatter from the secondary collimators and beam modifiers such as wedges and blocks, and internal scatter originating in the patient. AimTo determine the peripheral dose (PD) for multileaf collimator (MLC) based linear accelerator in water equivalent slab phantom for open and wedged fields. Materials/MethodsPD measurements were carried out for 6 and 15 MV photons using a 0. 4 cc parallel plate chamber in the slab phantom. Measurements were performed for different field sizes at different depths (Dmax, 5 cm and 10 cm) and up to a maximum distance of 30 cm beyond the field edges. PD was <b>measured</b> using <b>wedge</b> filters also. PD was further computed using a three-dimensional treatment planning system (3 D TPS). ResultsFor 6 MV photon beams, the maximum PD for open beams at 5 cm distance from the field edge was 3. 42 % and the minimum PD at 20 cm distance was 0. 11 %. For 15 MV, the maximum PD for open beam at 5 cm distance was 3. 07 % and the minimum PD was 0. 14 %. For wedge filters, the maximum PD measured at 5 cm distance for 6 and 15 MV photons were 5. 56 % (60 ° Wedge) and 5. 03 % (45 ° wedge). The TPS PD values showed minimal variation from the measured values.

40|$|We analyze {{retail prices}} and at-the-dock (import) prices of {{specific}} {{items in the}} Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) CPI and IPP databases, using both databases simultaneously to identify items that are identical in description at the dock and when sold at retail. This identification allows us to <b>measure</b> the distribution <b>wedge</b> associated with bringing traded goods {{from the point of}} entry into the United States to their retail outlet. We find that overall U. S. distribution wedges are 50 - 70 %, around 10 to 20 percentage points higher than that reported in the literature. We discuss the implications of this for measuring the size of the "pure" tradeables sector, exchange rate pass-through, and real exchange rate determination. We find that distribution wedges are very stable over time but there is considerable variation across items. There is some variation across the country of origin for the imported item, for our major trading partners, {{but not as much as}} the cross-item variation. We also investigate the determinants of distribution wedges, finding that wedges do not vary systematically with exchange rates, but are related to other features of the micro data.

40|$|To {{compare the}} level of {{agreement}} of quantitative morphometry of the vertebrae on lateral views of the spine using conventional X-ray and using a dual X-ray absorptiometry device (DXA) in determining the degree of wedging of vertebrae in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Thirty patients with AS underwent DXA to acquire single-energy morphometric X-ray absorptiometry (MXA) scans and conventional lateral radiography (MRX) of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Vertebral anterior and posterior heights were measured and the anterior/posterior (AP) -ratio was calculated. We analysed {{the level of}} agreement for vertebral wedging between MRX and MXA on the patient level and on the vertebral level, using average AP-ratios per patient, and per vertebra, as well as dichotomized AP-ratios (above or below cut-off levels that are commonly used to identify fractures). Per-patient analysis showed good agreement between both methods in the whole spine [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0. 64], {{as well as in}} the thoracic (ICC = 0. 66) and lumbar spine (ICC = 0. 62) separately. Analysis on individual vertebrae showed differences in agreement dependent on which part of the spine was measured. The ICC on all vertebrae was 0. 71, 0. 76 in the lumbar and 0. 43 in the thoracic vertebrae. If AP-ratios were translated into fractures (yes vs no) using different cut off levels for a fracture (AP-ratios 0. 75, 0. 80 or 0. 85) between-method agreement became fair to good (kappa 0. 26 - 0. 35 in the thoracic and 0. 47 - 0. 80 in the lumbar vertebrae). Differences in classifications were in both directions and in all vertebral fractures according to the Genant definition. In this study with a prevalence of 5 % of vertebral fractures, the positive predicted value (PPV) was 39 % and the negative predicted value (NPV) was 97 %. Although the agreement between MRX and MXA in <b>measuring</b> global vertebral <b>wedging,</b> expressed as (mean) AP-ratio, was good, the reliability of both <b>measures</b> to assess <b>wedging</b> at the vertebral level was highly variable, ranging from fair to very good agreement, dependent on the level. If fracture studies are performed with either of both the methods, the results of wedging at the individual vertebral level cannot be generalized to the other method, except for wedging < 0. 75 at the lumbar spine. However, as the NPV was high, DXA could be of clinical value to select patients for further evaluation by X-ray to assess vertebral fractures as a sign of bone failur...|$|R
40|$|Background. Orthotopic lung {{transplantation}} is {{now widely}} performed {{in patients with}} advanced lung disease. Patients with moderate or severe ventricular systolic dysfunction are typically excluded from lung transplantation; however, there is a paucity of data regarding the prognostic significance of abnormal left ventricular diastolic function and elevated pretransplant pulmonary pressures. Methods. We reviewed the characteristics of 111 patients who underwent bilateral and unilateral lung transplants from 200 to 2009 in order to evaluate the prognostic significance of preoperative markers of diastolic function, including invasively <b>measured</b> pulmonary capillary <b>wedge</b> pressure (PCWP) and echocardiographic variables of diastolic dysfunction including mitral A>E and A′>E′. Results. Out of 111 patients, 62 were male (56 %) and average age was 54. 0 ± 10. 5 years. Traditional echocardiographic Doppler variables of abnormal diastolic function, including A′>E′ and A>E, did not predict adverse events (P= 0. 49). Mildly elevated pretransplant PCWP (16 – 20 [*]mmHg) and moderately/severely elevated PCWP (> 20 [*]mmHg) were not associated with adverse clinical events after transplant (P= 0. 30). Additionally, all clinical endpoints did not show any statistical significance between the two groups. Conclusions. Pre-lung transplant invasive and echocardiographic findings of elevated pulmonary pressures and abnormal left ventricular diastolic function are not predictive of adverse posttransplant clinical events...|$|R
40|$|Background. Endurance {{athletes have}} a high {{incidence}} of orthostatic intolerance. We hypothesized that this is related to an abnormally large decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and stroke volume (SV) for any given decrease in filling pressure. Methods and Results. We <b>measured</b> pulmonary capillary <b>wedge</b> (PCW) pressure (Swan-Ganz catheter), LVEDV (two-dimensional echocardiography), and cardiac output (C 2 H 2 rebreathing) during lower body negative pressure (LBNP,- 15 and- 30 mm Hg) and rapid saline infusion (15 and 30 ml/kg) in seven athletes and six controls (Vo 2 max, 68 ± 7 and 41 ± 4 ml/kg/min). Orthostatic tolerance was determined by progressive LBNP to presyncope. Athletes had steeper slopes of their SV/PCW pressure curves than nonathletes (5. 5 + 2. 7 versus 2. 7 + 1. 5 mI/mm Hg, p< 0. 05). The slope of the steep, linear portion of this curve correlated significantly with the duration ofLBNP tolerance (r= 0. 58, p= 0. 04). The athletes also had reduced chamber stiffness (increased chamber compliance) expressed as the slope (k) of the dP/dV versus P relation (chamber stiffness, k= 0. 008 ± 0. 004 versus 0. 031 ± 0. 004, p< 0. 005; chamber compliance, l/k= 449. 8 + 283. 8 versus 35. 3 +± 4. 3). This resulted in larger absolute and relative changes in end-diastolic volume over an equivalent range of filling pressures...|$|R
