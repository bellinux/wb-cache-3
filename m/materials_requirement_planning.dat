The manufacturer's optimal MPS policy is often inefficient for the vendor, resulting in total costs significantly greater than the optimal system policy.

40|$|<b>Materials</b> <b>Requirement</b> <b>Planning</b> (MRP) {{technique}} is widely employed by most manufacturing companies, even though field applications point out some weaknesses, including ignored production capacity constraints and fixed lead-times. These weaknesses {{often lead to}} infeasible production schedules, which trigger fluctuating workloads over time, significant adjustment effort and eventually unpredictably long lead times. This paper introduces a capacity-oriented MRP procedure that combines the traditional MRP procedure with an approach based on linear programming: in this way, requirement of lead times pre-determined a priori outside the MRP procedure is overcome. The new procedure is then applied to a real-life company and results highlight that feasible plans of orders are generated without requiring lead-times as input and without relevant computational burden...|$|E

Since the first implementations of MRP, a wide range of problems related to MRP have been reported by both practitioners and academicians.

As a help in the diagnosis phase a rule is developed for identifying products that probably have too many items in stock. In two production units of an organization using MRP the method of evaluation and diagnosis was tested and it was found to perform very well.

The framework has been applied in a case situation for planned order releasing from a manufacturer’s <b>materials</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>planning</b> (MRP) system. The proposed framework incorporates a negotiation protocol that can effectively coordinate the negotiation process between a buyer agent and several supply agents, which may represent the manufacturer and its suppliers respectively. These agents negotiate according to their preferred strategies which aim to conclude a deal that achieves their own objectives. The implementation of the negotiation process involves considerations of the price of the materials required, past delivery performance, and the quality of materials supplied in the past. Simulation is used to explore the effectiveness of the proposed framework using an agent-based negotiation model, and the results indicate that the proposed framework can be used to improve the overall efficiency of the purchasing process. A case example is also presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework...|$|E

40|$|In assemble-to-order manufacturing, often product {{families}} with many options and features are {{offered to the}} market. Demand for an individual option or feature can be quite low and uncertain. The efficient checking of materials availability during customer order acceptance, and the <b>materials</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>planning</b> are crucial for effective control {{in this type of}} industry. Traditionally, modular bills of materials are used for this purpose. If interdependencies exist between features and options in the product family, modular bills are inadequate; instead generic bills of material can be used to model the production options available in a product family. In this paper we develop a variant of the modular bill of material, called the hierarchical pseudoitem Bill of Material, which is the mirror image of the choice tree in the generic bill of materials, and which can be used for checking materials availability, for allocating materials to customer orders, and for materials replenishment. Furthermore, we propose a model to optimize the master production schedule levels for options and features that drive the material replenishments process. The optimization aims at balancing the stock keeping costs of specific parts for options, with the revenues that result from selling products variants with those options...|$|E

This dissertation consists of a literature review and a case study. The literature review gives a background on principles that can be implemented to improve on the efficiency and effectiveness of a projects department. The effective design of projects {{and the importance of}} establishing specifications have been reviewed. Tools such as business process reengineering can be used to rethink and redesign processes in a projects department to improve its current way of working. <b>Materials</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>planning</b> is another tool {{that can be used in}} a projects department to calculate how many types of a specific product are required at any specific time. Just-in-time planning and control is a philosophy that can be implemented in a projects department to meet demands immediately, thus improving their effectiveness. Quality management tools and techniques can be implemented in a projects department. Total quality management, leadership and teamwork will help to convey good practises, generate interest, ideas and awareness in the department. The literature also explains the importance of ergonomics. Ergonomics in workplaces has an affect on the performance, fatigue and physical strain of the staff. Assessing the projects department and applying ergonomics to it will help the staff of the department to be more efficient and effective in their work. The literature further explains the stages involved in the risk management process. Developing an initial risk management plan is an effective and efficient way to identify and prevent risks at an early stage.
