40|$|Abstract Background In {{observational}} studies, matched case-control {{designs are}} routinely conducted to improve study precision. How to select covariates for <b>match</b> or <b>adjustment,</b> however, {{is still a}} great challenge for estimating causal effect between the exposure E and outcome D. Methods From the perspective of causal diagrams, 9 scenarios of causal relationships among exposure (E), outcome (D) and their related covariates (C) were investigated. Further various simulation strategies were performed to explore whether <b>match</b> or <b>adjustment</b> should be adopted. The “do calculus” and “back-door criterion” were {{used to calculate the}} true causal effect (β) of E on D on the log-odds ratio scale. 1 : 1 matching method was used to create matched case-control data, and the conditional or unconditional logistic regression was utilized to get the estimators (β ⌢ β) of causal effect. The bias (β ⌢ ‐ β β-β) and standard error (S E β ⌢ SE(β)) were used to evaluate their performances. Results When C is exactly a confounder for E and D, matching on it did not illustrate distinct improvement in the precision; the benefit of match was to greatly reduce the bias for β though failed to completely remove the bias; further adjustment for C in matched case-control designs is still essential. When C is associated with E or D, but not a confounder, including an independent cause of D, a cause of E but has no direct causal effect on D, a collider of E and D, an effect of exposure E, a mediator of causal path from E to D, arbitrary <b>match</b> or <b>adjustment</b> of this kind of plausible confounders C will create unexpected bias. When C is not a confounder but an effect of D, <b>match</b> or <b>adjustment</b> is unnecessary. Specifically, when C is an instrumental variable, <b>match</b> or <b>adjustment</b> could not reduce the bias due to existence of unobserved confounders U. Conclusions Arbitrary <b>match</b> or <b>adjustment</b> of the plausible confounder C is very dangerous before figuring out the possible causal relationships among E, D and their related covariates...|$|R

BACKGROUND The vascular access site may play a central role among procedure-related risk factors for AKI after PCI. Transradial access is associated with reduced vascular complications and major bleeding which, in turn, is an emerging risk factor for post-procedural AKI. METHODS Results of six observational studies, three out of six providing propensity <b>matching</b> <b>adjustment,</b> of patients undergoing PCI from the radial and the femoral access were pooled, including overall 26, 185 patients. The endpoint was the incidence of study-defined AKI. A meta-regression analysis was performed to further assess the role of study-level covariates. Random-effects models were privileged.

40|$|Background— The {{impact of}} early surgery on {{mortality}} {{in patients with}} native valve endocarditis (NVE) is unresolved. This study sought to evaluate valve surgery compared with medical therapy for NVE and to identify characteristics of patients {{who are most likely}} to benefit from early surgery. Methods and Results— Using a prospective, multinational cohort of patients with definite NVE, the effect of early surgery on in-hospital mortality was assessed by propensity-based <b>matching</b> <b>adjustment</b> for survivor bias and by instrumental variable analysis. Patients were stratified by propensity quintile, paravalvular complications, valve perforation, systemic embolization, stroke, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and congestive heart failure. Of the 1552 patients with NVE, 720 (46 %) underwent early surgery and 832 (54 %) were treated with medical therapy. Compared with medical therapy, early surgery was associated with a significant reduction in mortality in the overall cohort (12. 1 % [87 / 720] versus 20. 7 % [172 / 832]) and after propensity-based matching and adjustment for survivor bias (absolute risk reduction [ARR] − 5. 9 %, P< 0. 001). With a combined instrument, the instrumental-variable–adjusted ARR in mortality associated with early surgery was − 11. 2 % (P< 0. 001). In subgroup analysis, surgery was found to confer a survival benefit compared with medical therapy among patients with a higher propensity for surgery (ARR − 10. 9 % for quintiles 4 and 5, P= 0. 002) and those with paravalvular complications (ARR − 17. 3 %, P< 0. 001), systemic embolization (ARR − 12. 9 %, P= 0. 002), S aureus NVE (ARR − 20. 1 %, P< 0. 001), and stroke (ARR − 13 %, P= 0. 02) but not those with valve perforation or congestive heart failure.

40|$|This {{class is}} an {{introduction}} to statistical <b>adjustment</b> using <b>matching</b> and propensity scores in the style pioneered by Rubin and Rosenbaum and currently in rapid development by many other methodologists across the social science and statistical disciplines. An important motivation for matching is to approxi-mate an experimental design. And, since such a motivation arises from a desire to make transparent and defensible statements about causal relations, we will introduce the counterfactual conception of causal inference and the potential outcome formalization of these ideas. We will also spend some time on statistical inference (hypothesis testing, confidence interval creation) after {{the creation of a}} matched design. Finally, we will grapple with some of the questions that are current research topics in this area: When and how one can claim to have adjusted “enough”? How can we engage with concerns about unobserved confounds even if we have adjusted for what we observe? Since methods of matching are rapidly developing in the methodology literature, we will here focus on the simplest and oldest form: post-stratification. The general concepts and work-flow should be transportable to more sophisticated methods of <b>matched</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Goals and Expectations This course aims to help you think about statistical adjustment using stratification and matching a...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{calculate}} the incremental cost of nosocomial bacteremia {{caused by the}} most common organisms, classified by their antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: We selected patients who developed nosocomial bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These microorganisms were analyzed because of their high prevalence and they frequently present multidrug resistance. A control group consisted of patients classified within the same all-patient refined-diagnosis related group without bacteremia. Our hospital has an established cost accounting system (full-costing) that uses activity-based criteria to analyze cost distribution. A logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the probability of developing bacteremia for each admission (propensity score) and was used for propensity score <b>matching</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Subsequently, the propensity score was included in an econometric model to adjust the incremental cost of patients who developed bacteremia, as well as differences in this cost, {{depending on whether the}} microorganism was multidrug-resistant or multidrug-sensitive. RESULTS: A total of 571 admissions with bacteremia matched the inclusion criteria and 82, 022 were included in the control group. The mean cost was € 25, 891 for admissions with bacteremia and € 6, 750 for those without bacteremia. The mean incremental cost was estimated at € 15, 151 (CI, € 11, 570 to € 18, 733). Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa bacteremia had the highest mean incremental cost, € 44, 709 (CI, € 34, 559 to € 54, 859). Antimicrobial-susceptible E. coli nosocomial bacteremia had the lowest mean incremental cost, € 10, 481 (CI, € 8, 752 to € 12, 210). Despite their lower cost, episodes of antimicrobial-susceptible E. coli nosocomial bacteremia had a major impact due to their high frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Adjustment of hospital cost according to the organism causing bacteremia and antibiotic sensitivity could improve prevention strategies and allow their prioritization according to their overall impact and costs.

40|$|We {{are looking}} for a PhD student who will {{investigate}} the design of fast and precise 3 D data manipulation techniques for proton therapy patient placement in cancer treatment. Based on modern touch-based interaction techniques, we aim to reduce the time needed for X-Ray imaging matching. The goal of this technique is to achieve a manual registration between radiologic 2 D orthogonal images of the patient to digitally reconstructed 2 D radiographs that result from 3 D CTs. The challenge in this project is that this manual match needs to satisfy a precision of 1. 5 mm for all spatial directions and 1. 5 ° for all rotation axes. Currently, the match is done using a traditional, mouse-based interface in which at most two spatial dimensions are manipulated at any given time. Consequently, this process requires several iterations of <b>matching</b> <b>adjustment</b> and subsequent verification, each of which requires a new X-ray of the patient. With novel interaction techniques we are confident not only to be able to reduce the time needed per patient, but thus also to be able to treat more cancer patients in the same time. We want to achieve this progress using touch-based interfaces that allow users to control 4 – 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) simultaneously, as opposed to 2 DOF for mouse input. Touch input thus facilitates a much more integrated 3 D data matching. Moreover, the simultaneous control of 4 or more DOF will likely result in a better matching. The investigations in this project will be based on previous work by the PhD supervisors as well as other recent advances in interactive 3 D data visualization. The PhD student will examine existing methods, design new techniques, an...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between two components of our healthcare system: physicians, representing all providers of direct care, and hos-pital executives, referring to those with administrative responsibilities, regulatory obligations, and resource control. Currently, {{there is a wide}} gulf, or gap, represent-ing an adversarial interaction. Over the past 50 years, there have been dramatic, frankly, revolutionary, changes in the practice of medicine without corresponding or <b>matching</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the healthcare system. As a result, both physicians and healthcare executives are frustrated. The present adversarial tone between health-care executives and physicians adversely impacts healthcare outcomes. We discuss data showing differences between physicians and healthcare executives in education, background, work experience, and culture. However, the two share common core values: altruism, service, and love of a challenge. They also have common concerns about the future. We conclude that the real enemy is not the so-called other—physicians or healthcare executives—but our dysfunctional healthcare system. The common values and concerns shared by physicians and healthcare executives could provide the framework for successful communication leading to a bridge across the gap and a collaborative rather than confrontational relationship. Physicians could teach healthcare executives about clinical priorities, useful new technologies, and scientific methodology, including evidence-based decision making. Healthcare executives could educate physicians about management tools and techniques for planning, implementation, and assessment, especially systems thinking. To-gether as partners, healthcare executives and physicians could address many of the currently insoluble problems in healthcare...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{head-to-head}} trials {{is a common}} challenge in comparative effectiveness research and health technology assessment. Indirect cross-trial treatment comparisons are possible, but can be biased by cross-trial differences in patient characteristics. Using only published aggregate data, adjustment for such biases may be impossible. Although individual patient data (IPD) would permit adjustment, they are rarely available for all trials. However, many researchers {{have the opportunity to}} access IPD for trials of one treatment, a new drug for example, but only aggregate data for trials of comparator treatments. We propose a method that leverages all available data in this setting by adjusting average patient characteristics in trials with IPD to match those reported for trials without IPD. Treatment outcomes, including continuous, categorical and censored time-to-event outcomes, can then be compared across balanced trial populations. The proposed method is illustrated by a comparison of adalimumab and etanercept for the treatment of psoriasis. IPD from trials of adalimumab versus placebo (n[*]-[*] 1025) were re-weighted to match the average baseline characteristics reported for a trial of etanercept versus placebo (n[*]-[*] 330). Re-weighting was based on the estimated propensity of enrolment in the adalimumab versus etanercept trials. Before matching, patients in the adalimumab trials had lower mean age, greater prevalence of psoriatic arthritis, less prior use of systemic treatment or phototherapy, and a smaller mean percentage of body surface area affected than patients in the etanercept trial. After matching, these and all other available baseline characteristics were well balanced across trials. Symptom improvements of ≥ 75 % and ≥ 90 % (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score at week 12) were experienced by an additional 17. 2 % and 14. 8 % of adalimumab-treated patients compared with the matched etanercept-treated patients (respectively, both p < 0. 001). Mean percentage PASI score improvements from baseline were also greater for adalimumab than for etanercept at weeks 4, 8 and 12 (all p < 0. 05). <b>Matching</b> <b>adjustment</b> ensured that this indirect comparison was not biased by differences in mean baseline characteristics across trials, supporting the conclusion that adalimumab was associated with significantly greater symptom reduction than etanercept for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.

40|$|International audienceProprioceptive {{signals are}} of prime {{importance}} in kinesthesia. However, in conditions of visuo-proprioceptive conflicts, strong visual-evoked biases can be observed. In three experiments, we parsed {{the interaction between}} visual and proprioceptive afferents using the 'mirror box' paradigm. Participants' left arm, the image of which was reflected in a mirror, was passively moved into flexion/extension or remained static. In Experiment 1 proprioceptive afferents of the unseen static right arm were masked with diffuse arm vibration. In Experiments 2 and 3, afferent signals were enhanced by muscle vibration of biceps or triceps stretch receptors. Illusory arm movements were evaluated with subjective reports and <b>matching</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Results revealed that participants did not experience kinesthetic illusions when the mirror reflected {{the image of a}} static arm while proprioceptive afferents conveyed signals of a moving arm (Experiment 2). In this specific case, vision apparently contributed much more strongly to the final percept than proprioceptive signals. However, in most circumstances, the percept reflected integration of both afferent signals (Experiments 1 - 3). For instance, when both sensory channels conveyed signals of arm displacement but in the opposite direction, kinesthetic illusions occurred but were either proprioceptively (vibration illusion) or visually driven (mirror illusion), according to individual sensorial preferences (Experiments 2 and 3). These results indicate that kinesthesia is the product of cooperative integration processes in which the final percept strongly depends on the experimental conditions as well as sensorial preferences. The observed changes in the relative contribution of each input across experimental conditions likely reflect reliability-dependent weights...|$|R

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Recent {{publications}} suggest {{potential benefits}} from statins as a preventive or adjuvant therapy in sepsis. Whether ongoing statin therapy should be continued or discontinued in patients admitted {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU) for sepsis is open to question. METHODS: We retrospectively compared patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in whom statin therapy had been discontinued or continued. The primary endpoint was the number of organ failure-free days at day 14. Secondary end-points included hospital mortality and safety. The association of statin continuation with outcome was evaluated for crude analysis and after propensity score <b>matching</b> and <b>adjustment.</b> We also measured plasma atorvastatin concentrations in a separate set of ICU septic patients continuing the drug. RESULTS: Patients in whom statin therapy had been continued in the ICU (n = 44) had significantly more organ failure-free days (11 67891011121314 vs. 6 [0 - 12], mean difference of 2. 34, 95 %CI from 0. 47 to 5. 21, P = 0. 03) as compared to others (n = 32). However, there were important imbalances between groups, with more hospital-acquired infections, more need for surgery before ICU admission, and a trend towards more septic shock at ICU admission in the discontinuation group. The significant association of statin continuation with organ failure free days found in the crude analysis did not persist after propensity-matching or multivariable adjustment: beta coefficients [95 % CI] of 2. 37 [- 0. 96 to 5. 70] (P = 0. 20) and 2. 24 [- 0. 43 to 4. 91] (P = 0. 11) respectively. We found particularly high pre-dose and post-dose atorvastatin concentrations in ICU septic patients continuing the drug.
