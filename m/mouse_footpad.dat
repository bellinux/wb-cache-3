40|$|Because it {{appeared}} {{likely that the}} disease process that follows inoculation of footpads of mice with Mycobacterium marinum might serve as a useful model of <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> infection with M. leprae for immunological studies. {{an attempt was made}} to establish an analogy between the two processes. As a second objective, the adequacy of measurements of <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> thickness as an index {{of the total number of}} M. marinum and of the number of viable M. marinum was determined. The evolution of M. marinum disease in the footpads of BALB/c mice was observed, and the influences of mouse age and sex and of inoculum size were measured. Mice were challenged with M. marinum in one footpad at several intervals after inoculation of the contralateral hind footpad with the same organism. In all of these experiments, <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> thickness was noted to parallel multiplication of M. marinum during the phase of increasing footpad swelling. Cessation of bacterial multiplication was noted to occur just before maximal swelling had been achieved, and was followed by rapid loss of viable M. marinum. The total number of organisms and <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> thickness decreased only slowly and incompletely. Analogy between M. marinum disease and M. leprae infection of the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> was established by the self-limited nature of both processes, and by similar patterns of protection against homologous and heterologous challenge conferred by the two processes...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{previously}} untreated {{patients with}} lepromatous leprosy {{were treated with}} 200 mg of sparfloxacin daily for 12 weeks to determine whether this drug is bactericidal for Mycobacterium leprae in humans. The efficacy of therapy was monitored both clinically and by measuring changes in morphological index, <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> infectivity, and the radiorespirometric activity of M. leprae organisms obtained from serial biopsy specimens and also by determining titers of phenolic glycolipid-I in serum. Most patients showed clinical improvement within 2 weeks of treatment; this was accompanied by significant reductions in the morphological index, <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> infectivity, and bacillary radiorespirometric activity. After 4 weeks of treatment, all patients had a morphological index of zero and specimens from most patients were noninfectious for mice, while the median decrease in radiorespirometric activity was > 99 %. Overall results by the rapid radiorespirometric assay paralleled those of the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> and morphological index assays. Sparfloxacin given at 200 mg once daily appears to be rapidly bactericidal in humans, with activity similar to that observed in a previous clinical trial with 400 mg of ofloxacin...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the antileprosy {{potential of a}} set of original compounds with antimycobac-terial activity. Methods: We developed a facile synthesis of 2 -chloro- 3 -cyano- 5 -nitropyridine and synthesized a series of 3 -cyano- 2 -dialkyldithiocarbamoyl- 5 -nitropyridine derivatives. In vivo therapeutic efficacy against Mycobacterium leprae was assessed in the infected <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> model. Results: The compounds were active in vitro against Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium aurum, Mycobacterium vaccae and Mycobacterium fortuitum, with MICs generally in the range of 0. 4 – 6. 25 mg/L. Reduction of the bacterial load in vivo in the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> and toxic side effects were dependent on the individual structure of the compounds and on the doses applied. Compounds 2 a, 3 a and 3 b reduced the number of M. leprae by two orders of magnitude, comparable to the effect of dapsone.

40|$|Edema toxin (ET), {{which is}} {{composed}} of a potent adenylate cyclase (AC), edema factor (EF), and protective antigen (PA), {{is one of the}} major toxicity factors of Bacillus anthracis. In this study, we introduced mutations in full-length EF to generate alanine EF(H 351 A) and arginine EF(H 351 R) variants. In vitro activity analysis displayed that the adenylyl cyclase activity of both the mutants was significantly diminished compared with the wild-type EF. When the native and mutant toxins were administered subcutaneously in a <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> edema model, severe acute swelling was evoked by wild-type ET, while the symptoms induced by mutant toxins were very minor. Systemic administration of these EF variants caused non-lethal hepatotoxicity. In addition, EF(H 351 R) exhibited slightly higher activity in causing more severe edema than EF(H 351 A). Our findings demonstrate that the toxicity of ET is not abolished by substitution of EF residue His 351 by alanine or arginine. These results also indicate the potential of the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> edema model as a sensitive method for evaluating both ET toxicity and the efficacy of candidate therapeutic agents...|$|E

40|$|In general, the {{majority}} of bacteria are pre-inflammatory when injected in experimental animals. However, Mycobacterium leprae has no inflammatory effect when injected into <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad,</b> but using the delipidated mycobacteria we observed a mild significant increase in footpad oedema. Other mycobacteria, Mycobacterium bovis-BCG or M. tuberculosis induce a strong paw oedema. Furthermore, M. leprae reduced locally the BCG-induced inflammatory reaction in <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad,</b> whereas delipidated M. leprae did not influence this reaction. Both M. leprae and M. leprae cell wall lipids blocked immune phagocytosis in vivo by inflammatory macrophages (from an induced focus). In contrast delipidated M. leprae stimulated the phagocytosis reaction. Neither intact M. leprae. delipidated M. leprae, nor its lipids had any toxic effect on macrophages or on cell migration. Although M. leprae did not interfere on cell influx and cell type in an induced-inflammatory site, this mycobacterium led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct cell population in vivo. The hypothesis is that M. leprae would transform macrophages in epithelioid cells, suggested by morphology analysis of cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and observed under optic microscopy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although leprosy is {{efficiently}} {{treated by}} multidrug therapy, resistance to first-line (dapsone, rifampin) and to second-line drugs (fluoroquinolones) was described worldwide. Since Mycobacterium leprae is not growing in vitro, phenotypic susceptibility testing requires a one year {{experiment in the}} mouse model and this is rarely performed. Genetics on antibiotic resistance {{provide the basis for}} molecular tests able to detect for antibiotic resistance in leprosy. Methodology/Principal Findings: A reverse hybridization DNA strip test was developed as the GenoType LepraeDR test. It includes DNA probes for the wild-type sequence of regions of rpoB, gyrA and folP genes and probes for the prevalent mutations involved in acquired resistance to rifampin, fluoroquinolones and dapsone, respectively. The performances of the GenoType LepraeDR test were evaluated by comparing its results on 120 M. leprae strains, previously studied for resistance by the reference drug in vivo susceptibility method in the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> and for mutations in the gene regions described above by PCR-sequencing.

40|$|The {{ability of}} cachectin/tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNFα) to induce acute dermal and subcutaneous inflammation was examined in a murine model. A {{number of other}} proteins, and diluent alone were examined as controls. After subcutaneous injection into the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad,</b> recombinant human TNFα(rHuTNFα) induced acute inflammation with an initial marked dermal and subcutaneous neutrophil infiltrate by approximately 3 h, with a peak between 4 and 24 h and resolution by 79 h. Recombinant interleukin- 2, cytochrome c, and heat-inactivated rHuTNFα induced negligible inflammation. Recombinant human lymphotoxin (TNFβ), another control protein, also induced acute inflammation in our system. Because and TNFα and TNFβ are partially homologous, they may be acting through a similar mechanism. This pro-inflammatory effect of TNFα may result from chemotactic activity {{as well as by}} induction of secondary mediators. Inflammation induced by TNFα was partially suppressed by indomethacin treatment, suggesting that products of the cyclo-oxyganase pathway may mediate a portion of the inflammation involved. Five daily injections of rHuTNFα into the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> resulted in a predominantly mononuclear infiltrate and focal fibrosis. These results suggest that TNFα may be an important mediator of acute inflammation in vivo and might provide a signal for the production of collagen...|$|E

40|$|Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} (DTH) is {{an immune}} reaction induced by antigen.

Analysis of the inflammatory reaction induced by both the DTH and the anti-CII MoAb injection, here named as DTH arthritis, revealed the following: (1) DTH arthritis is elicited in an antigen-specific manner; and (2) the development of DTH arthritis is mediated by antigen-specific T cells, especially CD 4 + T cells...|$|R

BALB/c mice were inoculated in the right hind footpad with 5 × 103 organisms and sacrificed in pairs at 86 to 173 days after inoculation. Tissue samples were prepared for electron microscopy by standard techniques. During the early growth phase of M. leprae in the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad,</b> few organisms can be detected.

40|$|Forty-three female C 57 /BL and C 3 H mice were inoculated with 2. 7 X 10 (6) Mycobacterium lepraemurium {{into each}} hind footpad. The foot {{thickness}} {{and the number}} of acid-fast bacilli in the footpad and popliteal and inquinal lymph nodes were recorded. In addition the morphological index and the mean bacillary length were determined in the footpad and in the popliteal lymph node. The bacilli multiplied in both strains during the first 4 weeks after inoculation. After that time no further increase in acid-fast bacilli was observed in the C 57 /BL strain; the bacilli became elongated and the morphological index decreased. These changes were preceded by a local swelling of the footpad due to the onset of an immune reaction. Thus, under the present conditions, C 57 /BL mice were able to resist experimental infection with M. lepraemurium by developing an immune response. In C 3 H mice no indication of an immune reaction was detected, and the bacilli continued to multiply throughout the observation period. The <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> model seems to provide an excellent basis for the use of experimental murine leprosy to study immunity to mycobacterial infections.

At present, only dapsone, rifampin, and clofa-zimine are available to treat patients with leprosy. Because (i) Mycobacterium leprae resistance to dapsone and rifampin is encountered and is of considerable concern (18), (ii) toxicities and unacceptable side effects from each of these agents are not uncommon, and (iii) there is general consen-sus that lepromatous patients require multidrug therapy (25) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} effect of aureobasidin A, an {{inhibitor}} of inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase, on Leishmania growth and infectivity.

Results: Aureobasidin A (20 mM) inhibited 90 % of Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis promastigote growth in axenic culture, but the parasites remained viable, i. e. growth curves returned to normal after aureobasidin A was removed from culture medium. The aureobasidin A IC 50 was determined by MTT assay as 4. 1 mM for L. (L.) amazonensis promastigotes, 12. 6 mM for Leishmania (Leishmania) major and 13. 7 mM for Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. There was a significant delay in infection when L.

40|$|Mouse {{models of}} {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 (HSV- 1) {{infection}} provide significant insights into viral and host genes that regulate disease pathogenesis, but conventional methods to determine {{the full extent of}} viral spread and replication typically require the sacrifice of infected animals. To develop a noninvasive method for detecting HSV- 1 in living mice, we used a strain KOS HSV- 1 recombinant that expresses firefly (Photinus pyralis) and Renilla (Renilla reniformis) luciferase reporter proteins and monitored infection with a cooled charge-coupled device camera. Viral infection in <b>mouse</b> <b>footpads,</b> peritoneal cavity, brain, and eyes could be detected by bioluminescence imaging of firefly luciferase. The activity of Renilla luciferase could be imaged after direct administration of substrate to infected eyes but not following the systemic delivery of substrate. The magnitude of bioluminescence from firefly luciferase measured in vivo correlated directly with input titers of recombinant virus used for infection. Treatment of infected mice with valacyclovir, a potent inhibitor of HSV- 1 replication, produced dose-dependent decreases in firefly luciferase activity that correlated with changes in viral titers. These data demonstrate that bioluminescence imaging can be used for noninvasive, real-time monitoring of HSV- 1 infection and therapy in living mice...|$|R
40|$|We have {{characterized}} the in vitro and in vivo toxic properties of cell sonic extracts from 22 animal and human clinical isolates of Escherichia coli that caused both necrosis in the rabbit skin and multinucleation in tissue cultures, two toxic properties previously reported as being specific for E. coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF). Two distinct toxic phenotypes were observed. Type 1, which was displayed by originally described CNF strains, {{was characterized by}} extensive multinucleation and rounding of cells in HeLa cell culture assays, moderate necrosis in the rabbit skin test, and absence of necrosis in the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> test. Type 2, which has recently {{been shown to be}} associated with E. coli Vir plasmid, was characterized by moderate multinucleation, by polymorphism and elongation of HeLa cells, and by an intense necrotic response in both the rabbit skin test and the <b>mouse</b> <b>footpad</b> test. The distinction between the two cytotoxins accounting for these effects (CNF 1 and CNF 2), together with their partial relatedness, was confirmed by seroneutralization studies of both cytopathic effects and necrosis in the rabbit skin test. In addition, type 2 extracts were more lethal in the mouse intraperitoneal test and induced a moderate, although not totally repetitive, fluid accumulation in the ileal loop test. The original toxic properties of these recently recognized categories of E. coli strains, together with their association with enteritis and septicemia, suggest that these strains may {{play a significant role in}} pathology...|$|E

40|$|Metal allergy is {{categorized}} as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, and {{is characterized by}} the recruitment of lymphocytes into sites of allergic inflammation. Because of the unavailability of suitable animal models for metal allergy, the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of metal allergy has not been explored. Thus, we developed a novel mouse model for metal allergy associated with infiltration of T cells by multiple injections of palladium (Pd) plus lipopolysaccharide into the footpad. Using this model, we characterized footpad-infiltrating T cells in terms of phenotypic markers, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires and cytokine expression. CD 3 + CD 4 + T cells accumulated in the allergic footpads 7 days after Pd challenge. The expression levels of CD 25, interleukin- 2, interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor, but not interleukin- 4 and interleukin- 5, increased in the footpads after challenge, suggesting CD 4 + T helper 1 (Th 1) cells locally expanded in response to Pd.

Here, we further investigate their leishmanicidal activities against cutaneous Leishmania species. One of the flavonoid dimers (compound 39) has marked antipromastigote (50 % inhibitory concentrations [IC 50 s], 0. 19 to 0. 69 μM) and antiamastigote (IC 50 s, 0. 17 to 2. 2 μM) activities toward {{different species of}} Leishmania that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis, including Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania tropica, and Leishmania major.

In the mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis induced by subcutaneous inoculation of L. amazonensis in <b>mouse</b> <b>footpads,</b> intralesional administration of 2. 5 mg/kg of body weight of compound 39.

Six months after the initiation of treatment, disease in 15 % of the patients who received dapsone monotherapy but none of the patients who received combined treatment were clinically progressive. After another 1 to 9 months of treatment the disease in all patients was stable or regressive. There was no difference in the type or frequency of reactions. Only after the end of the scheduled observation phase three relapses were reported. All three treatment regimens well tolerated. Dapsone monotherapy is highly effective in the treatment of multibacillary leprosy under the conditions of well-controlled treatment. Combination regimens seem only to accelerate the regression of the active disease when they are compared with monotherapy with dapsone.

40|$|Buruli ulcer (BU) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium ulcerans is a devastating skin disease, {{occurring}} mainly in remote West African communities with poor {{access to health}} care. Early case detection and subsequent antibiotic treatment are essential to counteract the progression of the characteristic chronic ulcerative lesions. Since the accuracy of clinical BU diagnosis is limited, laboratory reconfirmation is crucial. However, currently available diagnostic techniques with sufficient sensitivity and specificity require infrastructure and resources only accessible at a few reference centres in the African endemic countries. Hence, {{the development of a}} simple, rapid, sensitive and specific point-of-care diagnostic tool {{is one of the major}} research priorities for BU. In this study, we have identified a previously unknown M. ulcerans protein, MUL_ 3720, as a promising target for antigen capture-based detection assays. We show that MUL_ 3720 is highly expressed by M. ulcerans and has no orthologs in other prevalent pathogenic mycobacteria. We generated a panel of anti-MUL_ 3720 antibodies and used them to confirm a cell wall location for MUL_ 3720. These antibodies could also specifically detect M. ulcerans in infected human tissue samples as well as in lysates of infected <b>mouse</b> <b>footpads.</b> A bacterial 2 -hybrid screen suggested a potential role for MUL_ 3720 in cell wall biosynthesis pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that a combination of MUL_ 3720 specific antibody reagents in a sandwich-ELISA format has sufficient sensitivity to make them suitable for the development of antigen capture-based diagnostic tests for BU...|$|R
40|$|Although Mycobacterium ulcerans elicits {{extensive}} necrosis {{of human}} skin and subcutaneous tissue, the specific {{cause of the}} necrosis has never been elucidated. In an attempt to define a toxic substance, 18 strains of M. ulcerans were inoculated into mice, and the progress of each infection was observed and compared with infections of other mycobacteria, including M. cheloni, M. marinum, and M. bovis. Culture filtrates and viable organisms {{of each of these}} mycobacteria were inoculated onto tissue culture cells. Inoculation of <b>mouse</b> <b>footpads</b> with M. ulcerans resulted in progressive infections, leading to ulceration and eventual death. Strains of M. cheloni, M. marinum, and M. bovis did not produce progressive infections in the mice. Culture filtrates of M. ulcerans produced severe cytopathogenic effects on tissue cells, but washed, viable organisms of the same strains had no cytopathogenic effect. Culture filtrates and viable organisms of M. cheloni, M. marinum, and M. bovis did not produce a cytopathogenic effect on the tissue cells. Viable organisms of selected strains of M. ulcerans and the culture filtrates of the same strains were inoculated into guinea pig skin. The culture filtrates and the viable organisms both caused focal necrosis and focal inflammation, changes that resemble those in the naturally occurring infection in man. Preliminary purification of the culture filtrate by ultrafiltration indicates that the toxic fraction has a molecular weight of approximately 100, 000, and temperature studies indicate that the toxic fraction is heat labile...|$|R
40|$|The {{polymorphism}} of TTC repeats in Mycobacterium leprae {{was examined}} using the bacilli obtained from residents in villages at North Maluku where M. leprae infections are highly endemic (as {{well as from}} patients at North Sulawesi of Indonesia) to elucidate the possible mode of leprosy transmission. TTC genotypes are stable for several generations of passages in nude <b>mice</b> <b>footpads</b> and, hence, are feasible for the genotyping of isolates and epidemiological analysis of leprosy transmission. It was found that bacilli with different TTC genotypes were distributed among residents at the same dwelling in villages in which leprosy is endemic and that some household contacts harbored bacilli with a different genotype from that harbored by the patient. Investigations of a father-and-son pair of patients indicated that infections of bacilli with 10 and 18 copies, respectively, had occurred. Genotypes of TTC repeats were found to differ between a son under treatment and two brothers. These results reveal the possibility {{that in addition to}} exposure via the presence of a leprosy patient with a multibacillary infection who was living with family members, there might have been some infectious sources to which the residents had been commonly exposed outside the dwellings. A limited discriminative capacity of the TTC polymorphism in the epidemiological analysis implies the need of searching other useful polymorphic loci for detailed subdivision of clinical isolates. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobac...|$|R
