25|$|Especially in Britain, men {{and women}} were usually segregated, so nobody of the {{opposite}} sex <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> sight of them in their bathing suits, which (although extremely modest by modern standards) were not considered proper clothing in which to be seen.|$|E
25|$|Writing in 1934 the {{architect}} Isoya Yoshida encouraged architects to {{design in the}} sukiya-style using modern materials. He {{said that it was}} important to display the natural characteristics of the wood although it would be a mistake to use anything that <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> the eye as this was not in the spirit of the style.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} carrier aircraft {{were designed}} as fighters, scouts and gunfire observers. Torpedo bombers {{were developed to}} slow enemy ships so friendly battleships <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> and sink them. Dive bombing tactics were developed as aircraft strength improved through the 1930s, but limited aircraft capacity encouraged production of dual-purpose fighter-bombers or scout-bombers rather than dedicated dive bombers. Japanese and American fleet carriers usually carried fighter squadrons, torpedo bomber squadrons, and dive bomber squadrons through World War II; but British fleet carriers {{were less likely to}} include a dive bomber squadron. The fleet carriers' longer range bombers were often used for the scouting role.|$|E

25|$|Subramanian {{also points}} out the {{limitation}} of book to explain the recent economic development in China and India. Under an authoritarian regime (theoretically extractive political institutions), China has achieved rapid economic development while democratic India (theoretically inclusive political institutions) has lagged much behind. According to Surbramanian, one can say that China and India are outliers or {{that it is still}} too early to decide (that is, China might collapse and India <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> up according to the book's prediction). However, it is still unsatisfying that the theory is unable to explain the situation of 1/3 of the world's population, and it is unlikely that China or India will change drastically in the near future, according to the prediction.|$|E
2500|$|Cattle {{diseases}} were in {{the center}} of attention in the 1980s and 1990s when the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease, was of concern.

2500|$|Smith {{said he saw}} {{a pillar}} of light {{brighter}} than the noonday sun that slowly descended on him, growing in brightness as it descended and lighting the entire area for some distance. As the light reached the tree tops, Smith feared the trees <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> fire. But when it reached the ground and enveloped him, it produced a [...] "peculiar sensation." [...] "is mind was caught away from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forward!" [...] he cried. A {{murmur of}} {{voices from the}} others was all the answer that he received. [...] "Forward!" [...] cried the young man again, [...] "the boy and those with him are not so far away but that we <b>might</b> yet <b>catch</b> up with them." ...|$|R
60|$|So Martin and Adrian {{went down}} {{to the end of the}} little gravelly tongue and {{crouched}} among the tall meadow-sweet and grasses, while the others, working furiously, rolled the two barrels to the water-edge and shipped them, throwing rushes over them that they <b>might</b> not <b>catch</b> the eye of the Spaniards.|$|R
60|$|She had {{scarcely}} stirred {{for nearly}} an hour, and I told myself, wearily, that I, too, <b>might</b> perhaps <b>catch</b> a little rest. The day had been a perpetual strain.

2500|$|Nedda is {{frightened by}} Canio's vehemence (Qual fiamma avea nel guardo), but the birdsong comforts her (Stridono lassù). Tonio returns and confesses {{his love for}} her, but she laughs. Enraged, Tonio grabs Nedda, but she takes a whip, strikes him and drives him off. Silvio, who is Nedda's lover, comes from the tavern, where he has left Canio and Beppe drinking. He asks Nedda to elope with him after the {{performance}} and, though she is afraid, she agrees. Tonio, who has been eavesdropping, leaves to inform Canio so that he <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> Silvio and Nedda together. Canio and Tonio return and, as Silvio escapes, Nedda calls after him, [...] "I will always be yours!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 August, German air {{reconnaissance}} saw British columns marching towards Villers-Cotterêts (Villers) and the 1st Army headquarters assumed that {{troops in the}} Oise valley were British and those retreating towards Soissons were French. Kluck concluded {{that it would be}} impossible to trap the British but a pursuit towards Soissons <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> up with the French. The II Cavalry Corps was ordered to advance southwards, as it was assumed that the British had reached Villers-Cotterêts. During the afternoon another {{air reconnaissance}} reported that many troops were seen at the village and that some might be captured. Kluck ordered the 1st Army to advance southwards with unlimited objectives. The 6th Division of the III Corps, crossed the Aisne at Vic on 1 September and engaged the 3rd Cavalry Brigade at Taillefontaine, about [...] north-west of Villers and drove it slowly back towards the village.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{intended}} to be called The Fighting Tigers, Dad's Army was based partly on co-writer and creator Jimmy Perry's experiences in the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV, later known as the Home Guard). Perry was only 17 {{years old when he}} joined the 10th Hertfordshire Battalion. His mother did not like him being out at night, and feared he <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> cold; he partly resembled the character of Private Pike. An elderly lance corporal in the 10th Hertfordshire often referred to fighting under Kitchener against the [...] "Fuzzy Wuzzies" [...] (Hadendoa) and was the model for Corporal Jones. Other influences included the work of comedians such as Will Hay whose film Oh, Mr Porter! featured a pompous ass, an old man and a young man which gave him Mainwaring, Godfrey and Pike. Another influence was the Lancastrian comedian Robb Wilton, who portrayed a work-shy husband who joined the Home Guard in numerous comic sketches during WW2.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Shut the gates,' I shouted, {{thinking}} that we <b>might</b> perhaps <b>catch</b> Sorais so, and not being troubled {{with the idea of}} committing sacrilege.

"For that matter, Primrose," [...] {{rejoined the}} student, [...] "I <b>might</b> {{possibly}} <b>catch</b> Pegasus, and get upon his back, too, {{as well as}} a dozen other fellows that I know of.

2500|$|Scruggs was {{involved}} in a solo plane crash in October 1975. He was flying his 1974 Cessna Skyhawk II aircraft home to Nashville around midnight from a performance of the Earl Scruggs Revue in Murray, Kentucky. On his landing approach he was enveloped in dense fog and overshot the runway at Cornelia Fort Airpark in Nashville and the plane flipped over. The automatic crash alert system in the plane did not function, and Scruggs remained without help for five hours. He crawled about 150 feet from the wreckage with a broken ankle, broken nose, and facial lacerations, afraid that the plane <b>might</b> <b>catch</b> fire. His family was driving home from the same concert and was unaware of the crash, but his niece became worried when he did not arrive. She called police at about 4 AM, and they went to the airport, where they heard Scrugg's cries for help from a field near the runway. [...] He recovered uneventfully, but was in a wheelchair for a few weeks, including for the premiere of the Scruggs documentary Banjoman at the Kennedy Center.|$|E

60|$|Just {{below my}} camp, one summer, was a trout pool. Below the trout pool was a shaded minnow basin, {{a kind of}} {{storehouse}} for the pool above, where the trout foraged in the early and late twilight, and where, if you hooked a red-fin delicately on a fine leader and dropped it in from the crotch of an overhanging tree, you <b>might</b> sometimes <b>catch</b> a big one.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{physicist}} Dr. Alan Nathan {{calculated that}} if the weather had been 77 °F rather than 76°, the ball would have traveled two inches farther than it did, and The <b>Catch</b> <b>might</b> not have been completed.|$|R

60|$|The {{excitement}} {{continued for}} fully half an hour. By {{that time it}} was ascertained that every one had gotten off of the ice or out of the water in safety. Those who had gone down were rushed to shelter, so that they <b>might</b> not <b>catch</b> cold. Gradually the crowd dispersed, and then Professor Brice had danger signs placed at various points on the ice, so that there should not be a repetition of the accident.|$|R

50|$|Inherent in {{the idea}} of a cure is the {{permanent}} end to the specific instance of the disease. When a person has the common cold, and then recovers from it, the person is said to be cured, even though the person <b>might</b> someday <b>catch</b> another cold. Conversely, a person that has successfully managed a disease, such as diabetes mellitus, so that it produces no undesirable symptoms for the moment, but without actually permanently ending it, is not cured.|$|R

50|$|Fledglings of the Philippine bulbul were {{recorded}} on Mindanao in late April, but the breeding season {{seems to be}} prolonged as females with ripe ovarian follicles were still found in April and May. Territorial songs are heard at lower altitudes as late as May, while further upslope the birds are silent {{at that time of}} year and presumably engaged in breeding activity. The besra (Accipiter virgatus) has been recorded as a predator of young Philippine bulbuls, and this or other goshawks <b>might</b> also <b>catch</b> adult birds.|$|R
