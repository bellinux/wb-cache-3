50|$|In 1971, Dr John MG Davies was {{recruited}} from Cambridge University {{to head a}} new Pathology Branch at IOM, and to continue his research into asbestos-related diseases. An extensive programme {{of research on the}} toxicology of fibres has shown that persistence of some asbestos fibres in the lung {{as a result of their}} insolubility was an important determinant of carcinogenicity and fibrogenicity, and that fibre length was also critically important in determining toxicity. This research expanded to consider fibres and other materials introduced as substitutes for asbestos, such as calcium silicate and aramid fibres. From 1990, the Colt Foundation, relevant industries and the Health and Safety Executive supported a programme of laboratory research into the health effects of <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> that helped to clarify the quantitative relationships between health risks and fibre dimensions and biopersistence.

A programme ensued on the measurement of fibrous aerosols such as asbestos, raising important issues in comparability of counts by different laboratories, and leading to the establishment of quality control schemes for asbestos.

Airborne fibre levels occurring during the manufacture of both RCF and calcium magnesium silicate wools (CMS) were compared using measurements of genuine workplace exposure from a routine monitoring operation on the same plant.

40|$|Abstract—In {{parallel}} inhalation and {{intraperitoneal injection}} (i. p.) experiments with rats, the glass fibre JM 104, Tempstran 475, exemplifying {{a very thin}} and durable <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> (MMMF), was compared with crocidolite (South Africa) and chrysotile (California, Calidria RG 144). Aerosol concentrations were 2. 2 - 6 mg m~ 3. Exposures lasted 1 yr. No significant tumour rate {{was found in the}} inhalation test nor from an exposure combination of 100 ppm SO 2 and glass fibres. In 74 % of the animals exposed to crocidolite bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia was detected. Intraperitoneal injection of 0. 5 mg of the three different fibre types showed a tumour rate of 17 % for glass fibre JM 104, 55 % for crocidolite and only 6 % for Calidria chrysotile. Calidria chrysotile seems to be much less persistent than other chrysotile samples. The long persistence of JM 104 / 475 in the lung (half-time of lung clearance about 600 days) and the carcinogenic effects of these fibres after intraperitoneal injection indicate that after inhalation of thin (< 1 /im), long and durable M M M F the suspicion of a carcinogenic potency of these fibres is still well-founded...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{method has}} been {{developed}} for measuring the binding capacity of asbestos and other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> for environmental carcinogens.

40|$|The {{group of}} <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> or {{vitreous}} <b>fibres</b> (MMMFs or MMVFs) includes glass wool, rock wool, slag wool, glass filaments and microfibres, and refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs). Experimental observations have provided evidence that {{some types of}} MMVF are bioactive under certain conditions. The critical role of size parameters has been demonstrated in cellular and animal experiments, when intact fibres are {{in direct contact with}} the target cells. It is, however, difficult to extrapolate the results from these studies to humans since they bypass inhalation, deposition, clearance and translocation mechanisms. Inhalation studies are more realistic, but show differences between animal species regarding their sensibility to tumour induction by fibres. Fibre biopersistence is an important factor, as suggested by recent inhalation studies, which demonstrate positive results with RCF for fibrosis, lung tumours and mesothelioma. There is no firm evidence that exposure to glass-, rock- and slag wool is associated with lung fibrosis, pleural lesions, or nonspecific respiratory disease in humans. Exposure to RCF could enhance the effects of smoking in causing airways obstruction. An elevated standard mortality ratio for lung cancer has been demonstrated in cohorts of workers exposed to MMVF, especially in the early technological phase of mineral (rock slag) wool production. During that period, several carcinogenic agents (arsenic, asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) were also present at the workplace and quantitative data about smoking and fibre levels are lacking. It is not possible from these data to determine whether the risk of lung cancer is due to the MMVFs themselves. No increased risk of mesothelioma has been demonstrated in the cohorts of workers exposed to glass-, slag- or rock wool. There are in fact insufficient epidemiological data available concerning neoplastic diseases in RCF production workers because of the small size of the workforce and the relatively recent industrial production.

40|$|The use of direct-reading {{instruments}} {{to measure the}} airborne fibre number concentration is on the increase. The response of two of these instruments (FM- 7400 and Fibrecheck FC- 2) was compared with the conventional method of sampling on filters and counting by phase contrast microscopy. Four types of fibres were studied at different concentrations and relative humidity levels. The FM- 7400 can be calibrated by the manufacturer for two different levels of sensitivity (standard and high). For the tests where it was set to the sensitivity level with which it had been calibrated, {{the ratio of the}} concentration measured by the instrument to the concentration obtained by the conventional method varied in the range 0. 5 – 1 for the different types of fibres studied (chrysotile, glass wool and ceramic fibres). The Fibrecheck FC- 2 is a much less versatile instrument. On the basis of a calibration allowing correct detection of asbestos fibres, it greatly overestimated the concentration of <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> In its normal calibration state a fine chrysotile aerosol was poorly detected.

40|$|Man-made {{vitreous}} fibre (MMVF) is {{a generic}} name {{used to describe}} an inorganic fibrous material manufactured primarily from glass, rock, minerals, slag and processed inorganic oxides. The MMVFs produced are non-crystalline (glassy, vitreous, amorphous). Other names for MMVFs include manufactured vitreous fibres, <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> (MMMF), machine-made mineral fibres and synthetic vitreous fibres. Continuous glass filament is sometimes {{also referred to as}} ‘glass textile fibre’. The term ‘mineral wool ’ has been used in the USA to describe only rock (stone) wool and slag wool. In Europe, ‘mineral wool ’ also includes glass wool. In this monograph, the terms rock (stone) wool, slag wool and glass wool are used rather than mineral wool, whenever possible. Man-made vitreous fibres are manufactured by a variety of processes based on the attenuation of a thin stream of molten inorganic oxides at high temperatures. All commercially important MMVFs are silica-based and contain various amounts of other inorganic oxides. The non-silica components typically include, but are not limited to, oxides of alkaline earths, alkalis, aluminium, boron, iron and zirconium. These additional oxides may be constituents of the raw materials used to make the fibres, or they may be added to enhance the manufacturing process or the product performance. Depending on the process of fibre formation, MMVFs are produced either as wool, which is a mass of tangled, discontinuous fibres of variable lengths and diameters, or as filaments, which are continuous fibres (of indeterminate length) with diameters having ranges that are more uniform and typically thicker than those of wool. (a) Categorization The previous IARC Monographs on <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> (IARC, 1988) grouped fibres into five categories based loosely on raw materials, production process and/or product application.

In the present study, we assessed the external exposure and the absorbed dose of metals in personnel from the aluminium cast house. This was combined with an evaluation of respiratory complaints and the lung function of the personnel. 30 workers from an aluminium casting plant participated and 17 individuals of the packaging and distribution departments were selected as controls. The exposure was assessed by the quantification of total inhalable fume with metal fraction and by the determination of urinary aluminium, chromium, beryllium, manganese and lead concentration. Carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), aldehydes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons and <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> concentration were assessed as well. In order to evaluate their respiratory status each participant filled out a questionnaire and their lung function was tested by forced spirometry. Total inhalable fume exposure was maximum 4. 37 mg m(- 3). Exposure to the combustion gases, <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and metal fume was well below the exposure limits. Beryllium could not be detected in the urine. The values of aluminium, manganese and lead in the urine were all under the respective reference value.
