500|$|Robert Christgau thought {{highly of}} the album, however, writing in The Village Voice at the time: [...] "The {{music is not}} only simple and attractive, with the {{synthesizer}} used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously." [...] He later wrote: [...] "My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you know why? It has soul, that's why – it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a tragic hero {{but as long as}} he's Roger's that doesn't matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Business {{leaders also}} took {{inspiration}} from the event, admiring its risk-taking and creative freedom, {{as well as the}} trust placed in and loyalty inspired from the workers and volunteers. In February 2013 the BBC's Head of Drama Ben Stephenson told an audience of writers, commissioners and producers that he [...] "wanted them to seek {{inspiration from the}} opening ceremony of the London Olympics" [...] which, he said, [...] "had scale and brilliance and, above all, had succeeded not in spite of its Britishness but because of its Britishness, delighting viewers here and around the world by rooting itself in the authentic stories and spirit of these islands." [...] Steve Coogan told Frank Cottrell Boyce that he felt it was [...] "like the emperor's new clothes in reverse ... it made irony and postmodernism feel tired and past its sell-by date", and Russell T Davies told Boyce: [...] "It changed <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the possible." ...|$|E

500|$|Moving to {{the commune}} with Hirsig, Shumway, and their {{children}} Hansi, Howard, and Poupée, Crowley described the scenario as [...] "perfectly happy... <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> heaven." [...] They wore robes, and performed rituals to the sun god Ra at set times during the day, also occasionally performing the Gnostic Mass; {{the rest of the}} day they were left to follow their own interests. Undertaking widespread correspondences, Crowley continued to paint, wrote a commentary on The Book of the Law, and revised the third part of Book 4. He offered a libertine education for the children, allowing them to play all day and witness acts of sex magic. He occasionally travelled to Palermo to visit rent boys and buy supplies, including drugs; his heroin addiction came to dominate his life, and cocaine began to erode his nasal cavity. There was no cleaning rota, and wild dogs and cats wandered throughout the building, which soon became unsanitary. Poupée died in October 1920, and Ninette gave birth to a daughter, Astarte Lulu Panthea, soon afterwards.|$|E
500|$|As the British {{military}} and loyal militia mopped up {{the remnants of}} the rebellion in Wexford and other counties, the atrocities and sectarian violence left a mark on Cornwallis. He wrote that [...] "the life of a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland comes up to <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a perfect misery; but if I can achieve the great object of consolidating the British Empire, I shall be sufficiently repaid." [...] In early July he issued a proclamation offering amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms and took an oath to the crown, and he cracked down on the sometimes arbitrary courts martial held in the field by requiring the review of all sentences in Dublin. [...] However, not all of Ireland received this treatment: areas that were still [...] "disturbed" [...] were exempted from the requirement, Lord Castlereagh, Cornwallis' Chief Secretary, reported that [...] "numbers were tried and executed" [...] without the lord lieutenant's review. One principal stronghold of the rebels was the Wicklow Mountains, through which the army began construction of a road facilitate its operations. [...] The Wicklow Military Road survives today as the R115 road in Wexford and Dublin.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} The Understudy {{was written}} by Andres Heinz; Aronofsky first heard about it while editing his second film Requiem for a Dream (2000) and described it as [...] "All About Eve with a double, set in the off-Broadway world." [...] After making The Fountain (2006), Aronofsky and producer Mike Medavoy had screenwriter John McLaughlin rewrite The Understudy; Aronofsky said McLaughlin [...] "took <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Swan Lake and the ballet and put [...] into the ballet world and changed the title to Black Swan." [...] When Aronofsky proposed a detailed outline of Black Swan to Universal Pictures, the studio decided to fast-track development of the project in January 2007. The project [...] "sort of died, again" [...] according to Aronofsky, until after the making of The Wrestler (2008), when he had Mark Heyman, director of development of Aronofsky's production company Protozoa Pictures, write for Black Swan [...] "and made it something that was workable." [...] By June 2009, Universal had placed the project in turnaround, generating attention from other studios and specialty divisions, particularly with actress Portman attached to star. Black Swan began development under Protozoa Pictures and Overnight Productions, the latter financing the film. In July 2009, Kunis was cast.|$|E

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> {{the duties}} I was to perform were very vague, as were also <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Ireland generally. Hitherto I had passed my time, {{seated at a}} desk, either writing letters myself, or copying into books those which others had written. I had never been called upon to do {{anything}} I was unable or unfitted to do. I now understood that in Ireland I {{was to be a}} deputy-inspector of country post offices, and that among other things to be inspected would be the postmasters' accounts! But as no other person asked a question as to my fitness for this work, it seemed unnecessary for me to do so.|$|R

500|$|Brill {{took off}} for his second mission to Berlin on 27January. The Lancaster he flew {{was said to be}} jinxed, possessed of an engine that lost power in the air but always tested well on the ground, and {{suffering}} oxygen failure that killed its rear gunner on the previous sortie. One of the engines did begin to falter before Brill reached Berlin, forcing him to fly lower than normal. Having released his bombs over target, he felt the plane take several strikes that he assumed were anti-aircraft fire, but were in fact the incendiaries of a Lancaster flying above. His aircraft's nose, rudder controls, and electricals were all severely damaged, and the port wing was on fire. Having warned his crew to prepare to bail out, Brill dived the Lancaster and succeeded in putting out the flames. The crew was able to remain on board and, after a nine-hour flight, the plane landed back at Waddington. Brill's verdict on the mission was, as he later wrote, [...] "not <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an evening's entertainment". He flew a total of eleven operations during the Battle of Berlin, including Bomber Command's costliest raid of the war, against Nuremberg in March. On that occasion, one of his engines failed and another was damaged when he had to fly through a cloud of debris from a Lancaster that was blown to pieces directly in his path.|$|E

In his Daily Mail column on 10 October 2007, he said, in reference to British society in the 1970s: [...] "Though homosexuality wasn't exactly <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a night out, I thought it outrageous that gays were subjected to discrimination {{in areas such as}} employment, housing and pensions".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Taylor's murder newspapers had speculated wildly about possible suspects, and rumors circulated that his death was related to a blackmail attempt. Taylor's neighbor Faith MacLean likely saw the murderer leaving Taylor's bungalow, and said the person she made eye contact with (and who smiled at her) {{may have been a}} woman dressed as a man, in clothes which were [...] "like <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a motion picture burglar".|$|E

2500|$|The {{publication}} of his short story collection The Quantity Theory of Insanity brought him to public attention in 1991. Self was hailed as an original new talent by Salman Rushdie, Doris Lessing, Beryl Bainbridge, A. S. Byatt, and Bill Buford. In 1993 he was nominated by Granta magazine {{as one of the}} 20 [...] "Best Young British Novelists". Conversely, Self's second book, <b>My</b> <b>Idea</b> <b>of</b> Fun, was [...] "mauled" [...] by the critics.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{itself has}} {{for the most part}} ignored such claims. In {{response}} to the allegations, Swan Song Records issued the statement: [...] "Our turntables only play in one direction—forwards." [...] Led Zeppelin audio engineer Eddie Kramer called the allegations [...] "totally and utterly ridiculous. Why would they want to spend so much studio time doing something so dumb?" [...] Robert Plant expressed frustration with the accusations in a 1983 interview in Musician magazine: [...] "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway to Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> making music." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Locus, Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of [...] "Englishness" [...] into Jonathan Strange: [...] "I wanted to explore <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> the fantastic, as well as <b>my</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> England and <b>my</b> attachment to English landscape....Sometimes it feels to me as though we don't have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I was picking up on things like Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) {{of what it was}} to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible {{about the rest of the}} world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|R

2500|$|Private Baldrick {{never got}} to tell the {{audience}} his final [...] "cunning plan" [...] to escape the trenches, as he is sent [...] "over the top" [...] before he can reveal it to Blackadder, George and Captain Darling, though it possibly involved a splinter on the ladder. However, Baldrick stated that Blackadder was correct in the final plan being [...] "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University". Blackadder admits that [...] "whatever it was, {{it was better than}} <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> pretending to be mad. Who'd ever notice another mad man round here?"

2500|$|A {{well-known}} alleged {{message is}} found in rock group Led Zeppelin's 1971 song [...] "Stairway to Heaven". The backwards playing of {{a portion of the}} song purportedly results in words beginning with [...] "Here's to my sweet Satan" [...] (...) [...] Swan Song Records issued a statement to the contrary: [...] "Our turntables only play in one direction—forwards." [...] Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant denied the accusations in an interview: [...] "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> making music."

2500|$|Faith Cole MacLean and her husband, actor Douglas MacLean, were Taylor's neighbors, and Faith {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have seen Taylor's killer. The couple was startled by a loud noise at 8pm. MacLean went to her front door and saw someone emerging {{from the front door}} of Taylor’s home who she said was dressed, [...] "like <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a motion picture burglar". She recalled this person paused for a moment before turning and walking back through the door, as if having forgotten something, then re-emerged and flashed a smile at her before disappearing between the buildings. MacLean decided she had heard a car back-fire. She also told police interviewers this person looked [...] "funny" [...] (like movie actors in makeup) and may have been a woman disguised as a man.|$|E

2500|$|The {{landscape}} of Lewis' native Ireland, in particular Ulster, played {{a large part}} {{in the creation of}} the Narnian landscape. In his essay On Stories, Lewis wrote [...] "I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge". In a letter to his brother, Lewis would later confide [...] "that part of Rostrevor which overlooks Carlingford Lough is <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Narnia". Although in adult life Lewis lived in England, he returned to Northern Ireland often and retained fond memories of the Irish scenery, saying [...] "I yearn to see County Down in the snow; one almost expects to see a march of dwarfs dashing past.

Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not <b>my</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract.
