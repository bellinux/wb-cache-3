Based on studies in cell lines, <b>mizoribine</b> has been postulated to be an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (EC 1. 2. 1. 14), a pivotal enzyme in the formation of guanine ribonucleotides from IMP. To further characterize the mechanism of action of this drug, we studied the effect of <b>mizoribine</b> on human peripheral blood T cells stimulated with alloantigen, anti-CD 3 MAb, or pharmacologic mitogens. <b>Mizoribine</b> (1 - 50 micrograms/ml) was able to inhibit T cell proliferation by 10 - 100 % in a dose-dependent fashion to all stimuli tested. Measurements of purine ribonucleotide pools by HPLC showed that <b>mizoribine</b> led to a decrease in intracellular GTP levels, and that repletion of GTP reversed its antiproliferative effects. We also examined sequential events occurring after T cell stimulation. Early events in T cell activation, as assessed by steady-state mRNA levels of c-myc, IL- 2, c-myb, histone, and cdc 2 kinase, as well as surface IL- 2 receptor expression, were unaffected. However, cell cycle analysis revealed decreased numbers of cells in S, G 2, and M phases, and showed that the G 1 /S block was reversed with GTP repletion.

BackgroundThe use of corticosteroids or cytotoxic/immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, and cyclosporine {{for the treatment of}} frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) is limited because of their adverse effects. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>mizoribine,</b> a relatively new immunosuppressive drug developed in Japan, in children with FRNS. MethodsA double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was carried out in children, from 2 to 19 years old, with FRNS. At relapse, patients were treated with prednisolone. According to a dynamic allocation, <b>mizoribine</b> or a placebo was concurrently administered to each patient. Prednisolone was gradually tapered and discontinued within 12 weeks. The test drug was maintained for 48 weeks. The primary end point was the relapse rate (the total number of relapses/the total treatment days for all patients). Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. ResultsThe primary analysis was conducted on 99 mizoribine- and 98 placebo-treated patients. The relapse rate was lower in the <b>mizoribine</b> group than in the placebo group (0. 0055 vs. 0. 0067; ratio 0. 81, 95 % CI, 0. 61 to 1. 05, P = 0. 12). The hazard ratio of the cumulative remission rate between the two groups was 0. 79 (95 % CI, 0. 57 to 1. 08). In the subgroups consisting of patients 10 years old or younger, the relapse rate ratio between the <b>mizoribine</b> subgroup (54 patients) and the placebo subgroup (57 patients) was 0. 66 (95 % CI, 0. 44 to 0. 94, P = 0. 017). The hazard ratio of the cumulative remission rate between the two subgroups was 0. 56 (95 % CI, 0. 37 to 0. 85, P = 0. 007). Hyperuricemia was the most common adverse event with <b>mizoribine</b> (16 %), but was transient. ConclusionsCompared with the placebo, <b>mizoribine</b> significantly decreased the relapse rate and prolonged the remission period in the subgroup consisting of patients 10 years old or younger.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of long-term use of <b>mizoribine</b> by undertaking a 3 -year post-marketing surveillance study. Methods: Subjects were all lupus nephritis patients newly treated with <b>mizoribine</b> between 1 October 2003 and 30 September 2005 at contracted study sites. Results: <b>Mizoribine</b> was administered to 881 lupus nephritis patients in the safety analysis set consisting of 946 patients recruited from 281 contracted study sites after satisfying the eligibility criteria. There were 301 events of adverse drug reactions that were observed in 196 (20. 7 %) of the 946 subjects. There were 34 events of serious adverse drug reactions in 31 patients (3. 2 %). No deterioration in hematological and biochemical test values was observed, but immunological testing showed significant improvements in C 3, CH 50, and anti-DNA antibody titers.

40|$|Aldosterone-salt {{treatment}} induces {{not only}} hypertension but also extensive inflammation {{that contributes to}} fibrosis in the rat kidney. However, the mechanism underlying aldosterone-salt-induced renal inflammation remains unclear. Pyroptosis has recently {{been identified as a}} new type of cell death that is accompanied by the activation of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that aldosterone-salt treatment could induce inflammation through pyroptosis and that <b>mizoribine,</b> an effective immunosuppressant, would ameliorate the renal inflammation that would otherwise cause renal fibrosis. Ten days after recovery from left uninephrectomy, rats were given drinking water with 1 % sodium chloride. The animals were divided into three groups (n = 7 per group) : (1) vehicle infusion group, (2) aldosterone infusion group, or (3) aldosterone infusion plus oral <b>mizoribine</b> group. Aldosterone-salt treatment increased the expression of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 and caspase- 1, and also increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells. However, the oral administration of <b>mizoribine</b> attenuated these alterations.

40|$|Proteins are {{modified}} {{and folded}} within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When {{the influx of}} proteins exceeds {{the capacity of the}} ER to handle the load, the ER is “stressed ” and protein biogenesis is affected. We have previously shown that the induction of ER stress by ATP depletion in podocytes leads to mislocalization of nephrin and subsequent injury of podocytes. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether ER stress is associated with proteinuria in vivo and whether the immunosuppressant <b>mizoribine</b> may exert its antiproteinuric effect by restoring normal nephrin biogenesis. Induction of nephrotic-range proteinuria with puromycin aminonucleoside in mice increased expression of the ER stress marker GRP 78 in podocytes, and led to the mislocalization of nephrin to the cytoplasm. In vitro, <b>mizoribine,</b> through a mechanism likely dependent on the inhibition of inosine 5 �-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity in podocytes, restored the intracellular energy balance by increasing levels of ATP and corrected the posttranslational processing of nephrin. Therefore, we speculate that <b>mizoribine</b> may induce remission of proteinuria, at least in part, by restoring the biogenesis of slit diaphragm proteins in injured podocytes.

40|$|<b>Mizoribine</b> monophosphate (MZP) is a {{specific}} inhibitor of the cellular inosine- 5 '-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step of de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. MZP is a highly potent antagonistic inhibitor of IMPDH that blocks the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes that use the de novo pathway of guanine nucleotide synthesis almost exclusively. In the present study, we investigated the ability of MZP to directly inhibit the human RNA capping enzyme (HCE), a protein harboring both RNA 5 '-triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase activities. HCE {{is involved in the}} synthesis of the cap structure found at the 5 ' end of eukaryotic mRNAs, which is critical for the splicing of the cap-proximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation of mRNAs. Our biochemical studies provide the first insight that MZP can inhibit the formation of the RNA cap structure catalyzed by HCE. In the presence of MZP, the RNA 5 '-triphosphatase activity appears to be relatively unaffected while the RNA guanylyltransferase activity is inhibited, indicating that the RNA guanylyltransferase activity is the main target of MZP inhibition. Kinetic studies reveal that MZP is a non-competitive inhibitor that likely targets an allosteric site on HCE. <b>Mizoribine</b> also impairs mRNA capping in living cells, which could account for the global mechanism of action of this therapeutic agent.

High-dose corticosteroid therapy is effective in TA, but such therapy alone cannot sustain long-term remission. Immunosuppressants such as MTX and CYC are used in corticosteroid-resistant patients [1]. Recently anti-TNF [1] and anti-IL- 6 receptor [2] antibodies {{have been used for}} refractory TA. However, novel therapies for corticoster-oid-resistant TA have not yet been standardized...|$|E
40|$|CD 59 is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) action that acts by binding to the C 8 and C 9 complements of the assembling MAC, thereby preventing incorporation of the multiple copies of C 9 required for complete formation of the osmolytic pore. Human CD 59 low expression leads to atherosclerosis. Therefore, computational approach methods were implemented herein to design novel activators for CD 59. Crystal structure (PDB ID: 1 CDR) of CD 59 was investigated to locate N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) active site residues (Leu 1, Gln 2, Val 17, Asn 18, Ser 20, Ser 21, Asp 22 and Asp 67). CD 59 {{is known for its}} binding affinity towards NAG and Alpha-L-Fucose, hence, were explored against more than one million entries of Ligand. Info metadatabase to create an in-house library of 708 compounds. Ligand dataset was prepared using LigPrep and filtered based on Lipinski&#x 2019;s rule of five and reactive group constraints. The crystal structure was optimized and energy was minimized applying OPLS force field in Maestro v 9. 2. Sixty four ligands were found to have binding affinity towards CD 59 through virtual screening workflow of Maestro. Two ligands namely <b>mizoribine</b> (- 8. 56 kcal/mol) and gluconolactone (- 8. 39 kcal/mol) with better XPG score compared to NAG (- 8. 02 kcal/mol) were proposed potential CD 59 activators. Analysis of docking complexes for both proposed leads revealed a stable hydrogen bond network, good van der Waal interactions and good agreement with NAG binding orientations. Thus, <b>mizoribine</b> and gluconolactone would be useful for developing potential drug molecules for atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Heterotopic hamster hearts transplanted to unmodified LEW rats {{underwent}} humoral rejection in 3 days. Survival was prolonged to {{a median}} of 4 days with 2 mg/kg/day FK 506. As monotherapy, 15 mg/kg/day cyclophosphamide greatly prolonged graft survival-far more than could be accomplished with RS- 61443, brequinar (BQR), <b>mizoribine,</b> methotrexate, or deoxyspergualin. However, when FK 506 treatment, which was ineffective alone, was combined with a short induction course (14 or 30 days) of subtherapeutic BQR, RS- 61443, or cyclophosphamide, routine survival of heart xenografts was possible {{for as long as}} the daily FK 506 was continued. In addition, a single large dose of 80 mg/kg cyclophosphamide 10 days preoperatively allowed routine cardiac xenograft survival under FK 506. The ability of these antimetabolites to unmask the therapeutic potential of FK 506 correlated, although imperfectly, with the prevention of rises of preformed heterospecific cytotoxic antibodies immediately postoperatively. As an adjunct to FK 506, azathioprine was of marginal value, whereas <b>mizoribine,</b> methotrexate, and deoxyspergualin (DSPG) were of intermediate efficacy. After orthotopic hepatic xenotransplantation, the perioperative survival of the liver with its well-known resistance to antibodies was less dependent than the heart on the antimetabolite component of the combined drug therapy, but the unsatisfactory results with monotherapy of FK 506, BQR, RS- 61443, or cyclophosphamide were changed to routine success by combining continuous FK 506 with a short course of any of the other drugs. Thus, by breaking down the antibody barrier to xenotransplantation with these so-called antiproliferative drugs, it has been possible with FK 506 to transplant heart and liver xenografts with consistent long-term survival of healthy recipients...|$|E
40|$|Immunosuppressive {{drugs are}} agents capable of {{modulating}} {{at least one}} type of immune response in vivo at doses with tolerable side-effects. Classical immunosuppressive drugs include corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cyclosporine. In {{the past two years}} tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were registered as immunosuppressive drugs. Tacrolimus interferes with the calcium-dependent signal transduction of T-lymphocytes. Mycophenolate mofetil is an inhibitor of purine synthesis by inhibition of the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Both tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil have proven efficacy in both prevention and treatment of acute allograft rejection. The new drugs are stronger than the classical ones but do not cause more adverse reactions. The value in clinical medicine of some new, promising immunosuppressive drugs, i. e. sirolimus (rapamycin), <b>mizoribine,</b> brequinar and leflunomide remains to be prove...|$|E

40|$|Caprine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (CpHV- 1) {{infection in}} goats induces genital vesicular-ulcerative lesions that strictly resemble the lesions induced by herpesvirus 2 {{in the human}} host. The immunosuppressive drug <b>Mizoribine</b> (MIZ) was found to increase the antiviral activity of Acyclovir (ACV) against herpesvirus infections, raising interesting perspectives on new combined therapeutic strategies. In this study the anti-CpHV- 1 activity in vitro of ACV alone or in combination with MIZ was characterized. When applied alone at non-toxic concentrations, ACV had a slight effect on CpHV- 1 replication while in combination with MIZ a dose-dependent inhibition of the virus yield was observed with an IC 50 of ACV of 28. 5 [*]µM. These findings suggest that combined therapy of ACV and MIZ is potentially exploitable {{in the treatment of}} genital infection by herpesviruses...|$|E
