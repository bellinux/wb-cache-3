50|$|The outer {{portion of}} the CLEO {{detector}} was divided into independent octants that were primarily dedicated to charged particle identification. No clear consensus was reached on the choice of technology for particle identification, therefore two octants were equipped with dE/dx ionization chambers, two octants were equipped with high pressure gas Cerenkov detectors, and four octants were equipped with low pressure gas Cerenkov detectors. The dE/dx system demonstrated superior particle identification performance and aided in tracking, therefore in September 1981 all eight octants were equipped with dE/dx chambers. The dE/dx chambers measured the ionization of charged particles as they passed through a <b>multiwire</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>chamber</b> (MWPC). Each dE/dx octant was made with 124 separate modules, and each module contained 117 wires. Groups of ten modules were ganged together to minimize the number of readout channels. The first two and last two modules were not instrumented, therefore each octant had twelve cells.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, {{he joined}} the staff of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva. This is where he invented, and developed, the <b>multiwire</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>chamber.</b> The chamber was {{patented}} and that quickly superseded the old bubble chambers, allowing for better data processing. This new creation had been made public during 1968. [...] Charpak was later to become a joint inventor with Nlolc and Policarpo of the scintillation drift chamber during the latter parts of the 1970s. He eventually retired from CERN in 1991. In 1980, Georges Charpak became professor-in-residence at École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles in Paris (ESPCI) and held the Joliot-Curie Chair there in 1984. This is where he developed and demonstrated the powerful applications of the particle detectors he invented, most notably for enabling better health diagnostics. He was the co-founder {{of a number of}} start-up in the biolab arena, including Molecular Engines Laboratories, Biospace Instruments and SuperSonic Imagine - together with Mathias Fink. He was elected to the French Academy of Sciences on 20 May 1985.|$|E
