5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} reasons for these {{regional}} variations in the occurrence of labor disputes. They are (1) the Lewis turning point came to the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region</b> earlier than it did elsewhere, (2) the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region</b> is also where migrant workers are most concentratedc, and (3) since migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse, they are correspondently more likely to initiate actions in defense of their rights. The rise in labor disputes and the uneven geographical distribution of their occurrence both suggest {{that there has been}} a sharp increase both in worker awareness about rights and in the demand for the institutionalization of their protection.|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to examine how}} local migrant labour markets behave differently in regions with varying development levels and local economic characteristics, based on a 2009 migrant sur-vey conducted in four case cities in Fujian province, China. The study reveals that earnings char-acteristics {{and the role of}} earnings determents vary greatly across geographic regions.

50|$|According to the United Nations, during 2005-2050 the net {{number of}} {{international}} migrants to <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> {{is projected to}} be 98 million. Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> by 73 million during 2005-2050, population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration. In 2000-2005, net migration in 28 countries either prevented population decline or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase (births minus deaths) to population growth. These countries include Austria, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Qatar, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|By 2050, {{the bulk}} of the world's {{population}} growth will take place in Africa: of the additional 2.4 billion people projected between 2015 and 2050, 1.3 billion will be added in Africa, 0.9 billion in Asia and only 0.2 billion {{in the rest of the}} world. Africa's share of global population is projected to grow from 16% in 2015 to 25% in 2050 and 39% by 2100, while the share of Asia will fall from 60% in 2015 to 54% in 2050 and 44% in 2100. The strong growth of the African population will happen regardless of the rate of decrease of fertility, because of the exceptional proportion of young people already living today. For example, the UN projects that the population of Nigeria will surpass that of the United States by 2050. The population of the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> is slated to remain mostly unchanged, at 1.2 billion, as international migrations from high-growth regions compensate the fertility deficit of richer countries.|$|E
30|$|In this {{literature}} on promotion incentives in the Chinese government, {{the problem of}} endogeneity has not been addressed seriously or formally analyzed. What is significant in the promotion of government officials if they are sent to a <b>more</b> economically <b>developed</b> <b>region</b> as a result rather than a reason? Some researchers turned to non-economic factors like factional ties. Shih et al. (2012) explores the advancement of Central Committee members in China but fails to find evidence that exceptional economic growth contributes to high ranking in the party hierarchy. Their findings suggest that factional ties with various top leaders boost the chance of climbing into the upper echelons of the CCP.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{transitional}} dynamics in a quality ladder model of endogenous growth in which North-South trade leads to technological diffusion through reverse engineering of intermediate goods. The concept of learning-to-learn is incorporated into both imitative and innovative processes, {{which in turn}} drive domestic technological progress. International trade with imitation leads to feedback effects between Southern imitators and Northern innovators who compete for the world market. Consequently, both regions face transition paths dependent on their relative technologies. Using numerical solutions we see that rates of innovation and imitation are initially high but fall as the technology gap decreases in transition to steady-state. Increased interaction between the two regions leads to higher world growth, demonstrating dynamic benefits to the South of increased trade with a <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>region.</b> Despite faster per capita output growth, transition costs lead to decreased Northern welfare, although this loss is attributable {{to the lack of}} intellectual property rights rather than trade per se. The fall in Northern innovation as the technology gap between the two regions is reduced may explain the slowdown of measured total factor productivity growth in OECD countries over the last 30 years. *I would like to thank Robert Evenson, Xavier Sala-i-Martin, and T.

5000|$|A {{slightly}} different perspective of interracial or transnational marriage is {{from those who}} tend to marry their cousins, sometimes even first cousins. They do so in order keep the family together socially and economically, thus disproving of marriage outside. Recently, this practice has become technically transnational {{due to differences in}} citizenship, even though the people are still family. An example of transnational marriage that kept the family together was among European royalty. Queen Victoria's grandchildren were all over Europe, keeping the royalty together. She was referred to as the [...] "grandmother of Europe." [...] However, some of the resulting alliances brought nations into the Great War (World War I) which otherwise could have retained neutrality. More recent examples are from a mass migration from the less developed regions of the world to the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions,</b> helped by the policies of family reunification. A fairly common practice among South Asian immigrants to the UK or USA is to have arranged marriages to someone back [...] "home," [...] {{in order to keep the}} culture and traditions within their family.|$|E

50|$|The {{themes of}} the allegory show Godoy’s desire to appear as an enlightened and reformist leader and the {{ultimate}} guarantor of economic and scientific progress of Spain, {{in relation to the}} activities of the Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País, which thrived at the time.However, this painting is an indicator of the stale concept that the Spain of that time could develop its industry, but the image itself is far from representing the Industrial Revolution which was occurring in the <b>more</b> <b>developed</b> <b>regions</b> of Europe. The image departs from the model of the Ancien Régime (see Las Hilanderas by Velázquez), but it is far from representative of the industrial era, as there is no {{increase in the number of}} spinners to reflect the mass production of industry and the work itself is being done on simple machines, instead of the more advanced devices used in the more developed countries. Furthermore, the clothes the women are wearing are not typical of the industrial working class. The low necklines, white blouses and melancholy and distracted attitudes more accurately belong to upper women than those who would work in a factory. The robustness of their bodies also isn’t the best way to imagine the regular conditions of nutrition of the industrial working class. It is a traditional and very flat representation in its symbolism and in its own way it shows the conceptual gap between what the wealthy thought of the industrial revolution should be and what it was actually like.|$|E
