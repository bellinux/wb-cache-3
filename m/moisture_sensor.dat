40|$|Problem statement: In {{irrigation}} water management, {{irrigation water}} use represents a&# 13; substantial opportunity for agriculture water savings. Automation of irrigation systems, based on Soil&# 13; <b>Moisture</b> <b>Sensors</b> Systems (SMSS) {{has the potential}} to provide maximum water use efficiency by&# 13; maintaining soil moisture at optimum levels. Approach: The objective of this research was to evaluate&# 13; the performance of soil <b>moisture</b> <b>sensors</b> under field conditions during growing season in two different&# 13; irrigated. This evaluation to be conducted with regard to accuracy; precision; quickness of the response&# 13; to moisture variation. Moreover to quantify the easiness of use, this encompasses installing and&# 13; operating the instrument as well as interpreting the readings. Results: The Watermark resulted in&# 13; higher tension readings than the tensiometers. While Watermark showed a consistent and increasingly&# 13; drier estimate of water content compared to tensiometers. However, the trend of soil water tension&# 13; curves that resulted from both treatments was very similar. The linear relationships of the Soil&# 13; Moisture Content (SMC) obtained from all sensors and gravimetric measurement were observed to be&# 13; best fit. The correlations (R 2) are ranging from 0. 96 - 0. 98 and from 0. 91 - 0. 95 for tensiometers and&# 13; watermarks successively. The statistical analyses indicate that changeability existed between soil water&# 13; contents by the sensors and the gravimetric method. Conclusion: Soil <b>Moisture</b> <b>Sensors</b> Systems&# 13; (SMSS) can be used: To monitor soil <b>moisture</b> <b>sensors</b> under wheat crop cultivation practices using&# 13; intelligent irrigation system. The tensiometers and Watermarks were less responsive to the soil drying&# 13; between irrigations than GM. So, Watermark can operate in a drier range than tensiometers, but with a&# 13; lower resolution at the wet end of soil water tension. Anyhow, watermark remains a good tool for&# 13; automatic irrigation scheduling and be integrated with inelegant irrigation systems even the noted&# 13; drawbacks. </div...|$|R

The main objective of this research is to investigate the development of a low cost soil <b>moisture</b> <b>sensor,</b> which {{can be used in a}} ZigBee mesh network. ZigBee is a new mesh networking standard, which places emphasis on low cost sensor networks and energy conservation. The development focus for ZigBee is remote monitoring and control applications. Manufacturers are still improving their ZigBee devices and ZigBee software stacks. The ZigBee based Texas Instruments CC 2430 microcontroller was selected as the wireless sensor hardware for this research. Micro climate weather station was designed to monitor the vineyard environmental data like temperature, pressure, sunlight, humidity, leaf wetness and {{soil moisture}} and temperature. The wireless soil <b>moisture</b> <b>sensor</b> is one main component of the micro climate weather station. The two probe soil <b>moisture</b> <b>sensor</b> uses the basic principle of a series fed Hartley oscillator frequency shift due to the varying dielectric constant of the soil according to the soil Volumetric Water Content (VWC).
