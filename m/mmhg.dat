5|$|CSF pressure, as {{measured}} by lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 <b>mmHg</b> or 1.1–2 kPa) with the patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 <b>mmHg</b> or 2.1–3.2 kPa) with the patient sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to keep a}} person's {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} below somewhere between 140 and 160 <b>mmHg</b> is generally recommended. Medications to achieve this may include labetalol or nicardipine.|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 <b>mmHg</b> {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 <b>mmHg</b> for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol <b>mmHg)</b> was retained for measuring blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 <b>mmHg.</b> In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four <b>mmHg.</b> It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{sulfuric acid}} has a vapor {{pressure}} of <0.001 <b>mmHg</b> at 25nbsp&°C and 1 <b>mmHg</b> at 145.8nbsp&°C, and 98% sulfuric acid has a <1 <b>mmHg</b> vapor pressure at 40nbsp&°C.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{showed that}} L-arginine reduces blood pressure with pooled estimates of 5.4 <b>mmHg</b> for {{systolic blood pressure}} and 2.7 <b>mmHg</b> for diastolic blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The goal of {{treatment}} of severe hypertension in pregnancy {{is to prevent}} cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications. The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 <b>mmHg</b> systolic and 90–105 <b>mmHg</b> diastolic, although values are variable.|$|E
25|$|Indications {{for surgery}} for chronic MI include signs of left {{ventricular}} dysfunction with ejection fraction less than 60%, severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 50 <b>mmHg</b> at rest or 60 <b>mmHg</b> during activity, and new onset atrial fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} atmosphere (symbol: atm) is {{a unit of}} pressure defined as , equivalent to 760 <b>mmHg</b> (torr), 29.92 inHg and 14.696 psi.|$|E
25|$|Between −91°C and 10.5°C, vapor {{pressure}} p (in <b>mmHg)</b> varies with temperature (T in °C) as lg p = 6.251 – 1115.1/(244.14 + T).|$|E
25|$|Massive PE causing hemodynamic {{instability}} (shock and/or low blood pressure, {{defined as}} a systolic blood pressure <90 <b>mmHg</b> or a pressure drop of 40 <b>mmHg</b> for >15 min if not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia or sepsis) is an indication for thrombolysis, the enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication. In this situation, {{it is the best}} available treatment in those without contraindications and is supported by clinical guidelines. It is also recommended in those in cardiac arrest with a known PE.|$|E
25|$|Presence of a {{carotid pulse}} has been {{estimated}} to indicate a systolic blood pressure of more than 40 <b>mmHg,</b> as given by the 50% percentile.|$|E
25|$|Digital artery pressure: {{pressures}} are {{measured in the}} arteries of the fingers {{before and after the}} hands have been cooled. A decrease of at least 15 <b>mmHg</b> is diagnostic (positive).|$|E
25|$|Studies {{in vitro}} show that {{significant}} {{disruption of the}} pulmonary capillaries occurs at pressures of approximately 80 <b>mmHg.</b> In vivo, significant EIPH occurs above a mean pulmonary artery pressure of around 80–95 <b>mmHg.</b> On {{the basis of this}} theory, any factor or disease that would increase pulmonary vascular pressures (e.g. hypervolaemia) or increase the magnitude of the negative pressures in the lung during inspiration (e.g. dynamic upper airway obstruction) would increase the severity of EIPH; however neither experimentally induced laryngeal hemiplegia nor dorsal displacement of the soft palate increase pulmonary capillary transmural pressure.|$|E
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 <b>mmHg</b> range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 <b>mmHg</b> (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.|$|E
25|$|Roughly, transudates are {{a result}} of {{increased}} pressure in the hepatic portal vein (>8 <b>mmHg,</b> usually around 20 <b>mmHg),</b> e.g. due to cirrhosis, while exudates are actively secreted fluid due to inflammation or malignancy. As a result, exudates are high in protein and lactate dehydrogenase and have a low pH (<7.30), a low glucose level, and more white blood cells. Transudates have low protein (<30 g/L), low LDH, high pH, normal glucose, and fewer than 1 white cell per 1000nbsp&mm³. Clinically, the most useful measure is the difference between ascitic and serum albumin concentrations. A difference of less than 1 g/dl (10 g/L) implies an exudate.|$|E
25|$|High blood {{pressure}} accounts for 35–50% of stroke risk. Blood pressure reduction of 10 <b>mmHg</b> systolic or 5 <b>mmHg</b> diastolic {{reduces the risk}} of stroke by ~40%. Lowering {{blood pressure}} has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. It is equally important in secondary prevention. Even patients older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy. The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs —therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered. The routine use of beta-blockers following a stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits.|$|E
25|$|Egnell in 1956 {{established}} a 220 <b>mmHg</b> safe maximum for automatic cycling pumps. There {{have been reports}} though of sensitive breasts and nipples at much lower pressures. Hartman P, et al. in the 2008 study showed that the maximum comfortable vacuum enhances milk flow and milk yield.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} in an obese population over four years is decreased with orlistat (6.2%) compared to placebo (9.0%). Long-term use of orlistat also leads to a very modest reduction in blood pressure (mean reductions of 2.5 and 1.9 <b>mmHg</b> in systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively).|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} generally presents as a hypertensive emergency, and {{the prime}} consideration of medical management is strict blood pressure control. The target blood pressure should be a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 to 75 <b>mmHg,</b> or the lowest blood pressure tolerated. Initial decreases should be by about 20%.|$|E
25|$|Hypercapnia is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} blood gas carbon dioxide level over 45 <b>mmHg.</b> Since carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with carbonic acid in the blood, hypercapnia can drive serum pH down, resulting in a respiratory acidosis. Clinically, the effect of hypercapnia on pH is estimated using {{the ratio of the}} arterial pressure of carbon dioxide to the concentration of bicarbonate ion, PaCO2/.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, as {{the inaugural}} effort, the theme was simply ‘Awareness of high blood {{pressure}}’. The 2006 theme was ‘Treat to goal’, {{with a focus}} on keeping blood pressure under control. The recommended blood pressures are less than 140/90 <b>mmHg</b> for the general population and for the hypertensive population without any other complications, and less than 130/80 <b>mmHg</b> for those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. These are the cut-off values recommended by international and Canadian guidelines. The 2007 WHD theme was ‘Healthy diet, healthy blood pressure’. Through such specific themes, the WHL intends to raise awareness not only of hypertension, but also of factors contributing to an increase in the incidence of hypertension and on ways to prevent it. In an effort to empower the public, the theme for 2008 was ‘Measure your blood pressure…at home’. Recent reports confirm the ease, accuracy and safety of blood pressure measurements using home monitors.|$|E
25|$|Minimal transvalvular {{pressure}} gradient – Whenever a fluid flows through a restriction, {{such as a}} valve, a {{pressure gradient}} arises over the restriction. This pressure gradient {{is a result of}} the increased resistance to flow through the restriction. Natural heart valves have a low transvalvular pressure gradient as they present little obstruction to the flow through themselves, normally less than 16 <b>mmHg.</b> A desirable characteristic of heart valve prostheses is that their transvalvular pressure gradient is as small as possible.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{and signs}} of early {{hypercapnia}} include flushed skin, full pulse, tachypnea, dyspnea, extrasystoles, muscle twitches, hand flaps, reduced neural activity, and possibly a raised blood pressure. According to other sources, symptoms of mild hypercapnia might include headache, confusion and lethargy. Hypercapnia can induce increased cardiac output, an elevation in arterial blood pressure, and a propensity toward arrhythmias. Hypercapnia may increase pulmonary capillary resistance. In severe hypercapnia (generally PaCO2 greater than 10 kPa or 75 <b>mmHg),</b> symptomatology progresses to disorientation, panic, hyperventilation, convulsions, unconsciousness, and eventually death.|$|E
25|$|Keeping blood {{pressure}} below 140/90 <b>mmHg</b> is recommended. Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Among people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke. Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined {{according to the}} CHA2DS2–VASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{blood flow}} remains {{unchanged}} {{over a wide}} range of arterial pressures (mean arterial pressure of 50–150 <b>mmHg)</b> through a process termed autoregulation of blood flow. Signs and symptoms of hypertensive encephalopathy may include severe headache, nausea and vomiting (often of a projectile nature), focal neurologic signs, and alterations in mental status. Untreated, hypertensive encephalopathy may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, and death within hours. For example, signs of retinopathy that reflect the exudative stage, such as retinal hemorrhage or microaneurysm, may be seen in eyes that do not have features of the sclerotic stage, The exudative signs are nonspecific, since they are seen in diabetes and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Meta-analyses of {{observational}} {{studies have}} concluded that black tea consumption {{does not affect the}} development of oral cancers in Asian or Caucasian populations, esophageal cancer or prostate cancer in Asian populations, or lung cancer. Black tea consumption may be associated with a reduced risk of stroke. A 2013 Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials greater than 3 months duration concluded that long-term consumption of black tea only slightly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressures (about 1-2 <b>mmHg).</b> A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that long-term black tea consumption lowers the blood concentration of LDL cholesterol by 0.43mmol/L (or 7.74mg/dL), but overall this research remains inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular malformations (typically {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, {{and some}} other left-sided cardiac malformations) and hypertension predispose to aortic dilatation and dissection in the general population. Indeed, these same risk factors are found in more than 90% of patients with Turner syndrome who develop aortic dilatation. Only {{a small number of}} patients (around 10%) have no apparent predisposing risk factors. The risk of hypertension is increased three-fold in patients with Turner syndrome. Because of its relation to aortic dissection, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and hypertension should be treated aggressively with an aim to keep blood pressure below 140/80 <b>mmHg.</b> As with the other cardiovascular malformations, complications of aortic dilatation is commonly associated with 45,X karyotype.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory is that high transmural pressures lead to pulmonary capillary stress failure. There may be contributions from the bronchial circulation. Pulmonary capillary transmural pressure is determined by pulmonary capillary pressure and airway pressure. The horse has very high pulmonary vascular pressures during intense exercise, exceeding 100 <b>mmHg</b> in the pulmonary artery during intense exercise. During expiration the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are opposed by high positive airway pressures pushing back and this does not place undue stress on the thin blood vessel walls. During inspiration, the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are met by negative pressures distending the blood vessel and placing increased stress on the walls.|$|E
25|$|Since {{cardiovascular}} {{disease is a}} serious complication associated with diabetes, some have recommended blood pressure levels below 130/80mmHg. However, evidence supports {{less than or equal}} to somewhere between 140/90mmHg to 160/100mmHg; the only additional benefit found for blood pressure targets beneath this range was an isolated decrease in stroke risk, and this was accompanied by an increased risk of other serious adverse events. A 2016 review found potential harm to treating lower than 140 <b>mmHg.</b> Among medications that lower blood pressure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve outcomes in those with DM while the similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not. Aspirin is also recommended for people with cardiovascular problems, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.|$|E
500|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} {{is a form}} of sleep disordered breathing. Two subtypes are recognized, depending on the nature of disordered breathing detected on further investigations. The first is OHS in the context of obstructive sleep apnea; this is confirmed by the occurrence of 5 or more episodes of apnea, hypopnea or respiratory-related arousals per hour (high apnea-hypopnea index) during sleep. The second is OHS primarily due to [...] "sleep hypoventilation syndrome"; this requires a rise of CO2 levels by 10 <b>mmHg</b> (1.3 kPa) after sleep compared to awake measurements and overnight drops in oxygen levels without simultaneous apnea or hypopnea. Overall, 90% of all people with OHS fall into the first category, and 10% in the second.|$|E
500|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} has {{a higher}} diffusion coefficient compared to oxygen and the only enzyme {{in the human body}} that produces carbon monoxide is heme oxygenase which is located in all cells and breaks down heme. Under normal conditions carbon monoxide levels in the plasma are approximately 0 <b>mmHg</b> because it {{has a higher}} diffusion coefficient and the body easily gets rid of any CO made. [...] When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.|$|E
