And then, the spores from the Conchocelis-phase were fixed to the collectors (bomboo twigs) in vessels, in which the lime stones with Conchocelis-filament were placed at the bottom, and the collectors were swung with the motor. Results were summarized as follows: 1) On the surface of lime stone, the germling of the carpospores penetrates into the inner layer and grows up to Conchocelis-filament as like as the case in oyster shell. 2) The penetrating germling develops fundamentally into radiate filaments as in shell, but the filaments are more irregular in shape and they penetrate shallow erly than in shell. 3) The spore-formation and its liberation are also almost similar {{to the case of}} shell. Thus, the spores from the Conchocelis-phase were fixed artificially to the collectors and the number of buds of Porphyra were counted under <b>microscope</b> (<b>Table</b> 1).

40|$|This study {{compared}} the mandibular displacement from three methods of centric relation record using an anterior jig associated with (A) chin point guidance, (B) swallowing (control group) and (C) bimanual manipulation. Ten patients aged 25 - 39 years were selected if they met the following inclusion criteria: complete dentition (up {{to the second}} molars), Angle class I and absence of {{signs and symptoms of}} temporomandibular disorders and diagnostic casts showing stability in the maximum intercuspation (MI) position. Impressions of maxillary and mandibular arches were made with an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material. Master casts of each patient were obtained, mounted on a <b>microscope</b> <b>table</b> in MI as a reference position and 5 records of each method were made per patient. The mandibular casts were then repositioned with records interposed and new measurements were obtained. The difference between the two readings allowed measuring the displacement of the mandible in the anteroposterior and lateral axes. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5 % significance level. There was no statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) among the three methods for measuring lateral displacement (A= 0. 38 ± 0. 26, B= 0. 32 ± 0. 25 and C= 0. 32 ± 0. 23). For the anteroposterior displacement (A= 2. 76 ± 1. 43, B= 2. 46 ± 1. 48 and C= 2. 97 ± 1. 51), the swallowing method (B) differed significantly from the others (p 0. 05) was found between chin point guidance (A) and bimanual manipulation (C). In conclusion, the swallowing method produced smaller mandibular posterior displacement than the other methods. Este estudo comparou o deslocamento mandibular a partir de 3 métodos de registro da relação cêntrica usando um jig anterior associado com: (A) guia da ponta do mento; (B) deglutição grupo controle (C) manipulação bimanual. As moldagens dos arcos maxilares e mandibulares foram feitas com hidrocolóide irreversível. Os modelos de estudo de cada paciente foram obtidos e montados em máxima intercuspidação como uma posição de referência no microscópio. Foram obtidos 5 registros de cada método em 10 pacientes. Os modelos mandibulares foram reposicionados com os registros interpostos e novas medidas foram obtidas. A diferença entre as duas leituras permitiu a medida do deslocamento mandibular nos eixos ântero-posterior e laterais. ANOVA não demonstrou diferença estatisticamente significativa entre os 3 métodos em relação ao registro do deslocamento lateral (A = 0, 38 ± 0, 26, B = 0, 32 ± 0, 25 e C = 0, 32 ± 0, 23). Quanto ao deslocamento anteroposterior, ANOVA e o teste de Tukey (a= 0, 05) indicaram diferença estatisticamente significante entre os três métodos (A= 2, 76 ± 1, 43, B= 2, 46 ± 1, 48 e C= 2, 97 ± 1, 51).

M. 160 S. : 64 Abbn., 24 Tab., 3 gezeichnete Tafeln, 4 mikroskopische Tafeln Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin Institut für Biologie AG Ökologie Die Untersuchungen konzentrierten sich auf das Plankton von Söllen der Jungmorä nenlandschaft Nordostdeutschlands. Ziel war es, die {{qualitative}} und quantitative Phyto- und Zooplanktonstruktur verschiedener Sölle unter dem Gesichtspunkt der nterschiedlichen Landnutzung, des Wasserhaushaltes und des Stoffeintrages in zwei Untersuchungsgebieten zu erfassen, mit einem weitgehend ursprünglichen Forstsoll zu vergleichen und daraus Schlußfolgerungen für den Erhalt und den Schutz dieser Kleingewässer abzuleiten. Es wurden sieben repräsentative Sölle monatlich über drei Vegetationsperioden (1994 - 1997) untersucht. Neben dem Artenspektrum und dem Abun danzwechsel des Phyto- und Zooplanktons erfolgte eine Erfassung des Chlorophyll a -Gehaltes der Mikroalgenzellen, der hydrochemischen und physikalischen Grundparameter und der Pegelstände des Sollwassers. Trotz der großen Individualität der Untersuchungsgewässer konnten aus den Erg ebnissen die Sölle in drei Gruppen statistisch signifikant zusammengefaßt werden. Für deren Abgrenzung sind die Nährstoffverhältnisse (N oder P-Überschüsse, Nitrifikationsgrad), die Sauerstoffsättigungswerte und das Artenspektrum des Phyto- und Zooplanktons bedeutsam. Hohe Leitfähigkeit des Wassers besonders in den Söllen des Gebietes um Lietzen-Döbberin wird durch hohe Sulfat- und Chloridgehalte bedingt. Im Vergleich zu den Seen sind die Chlorophyll a -Konzentrationen als Biomasseäquivalent für die Mikroalgen in Relation zu den Phosphatgehalten auffallend gering. Aus den Ergebnissen lassen sich Maßnahmen zur Erhaltung und dem Schutz der Sölle ableiten. Es wird die konsequente Verminderung der externen Nährstoffeinträge durch die Schaffung und/ oder Pflege von Pufferzonen sowie gegebenenfalls die Umwidmung des Einzugsgebietes in Dauergrünland empfohlen. Weitere Maßnahmen, die auf die Reduzierung der internen Nährstoffreserven zielen, sind erst nach zusätzlichen Untersuchungen insbesondere zum Phosphorbindungsvermögen der Sedimente für die Sölle ableitbar. Limnological {{characterization of}} selected ponded depressions {{of the north}} German young moraine site {{as a basis for}} conservation* *) sponsored by the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt and the FAZIT-Stiftung, Frankfurt a. M. 160 S. : 64 Abbn., 24 Tab., 3 graphic <b>Tables,</b> 4 <b>microscope</b> <b>tables</b> Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin Institut für Biologie AG Ökologie The main geographical feature of the ground and terminal moraines of northern Germany are the numerous small depressions, many of which are water-filled. They represent a typical geographical element of this region and in the German language are usually referred to as "Sölle" (Singular = "Soll"). These small bodies of water were created either glacially through the melting of dead-ice pieces (natural depressions or dead-ice depressions) or later (circa 12 th or 13 th century) {{in the course of the}} clearing of large tracts of forested land through the partial and permanent damming of depressions (pseudo depressions). The study concentrated on the plankton levels of ponded depressions in the recent moraines of northern Germany. The goal of the study was to record the qualitative and quantitative phytoplankton and zooplankton make-up of several different ponded depressions with consideration of the various land uses, management of water, and introduction of nutrients in two research areas and to compare these findings with a mostly unaltered forested ponded depression (ponded depression in a forested area) for the purpose of deriving conclusions about the preservation and protection of these small water ways. Seven representative ponded depressions were examined monthly over the span of three vegetation periods (1994 - 1997). In addition to the variety of vegetational species and the variation in amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton, data about the amount of chlorophyll a in the micro algae cells, the hydro-chemical and physical ground parameters, and the water level of the ponds was recorded. In spite of the considerable uniqueness of each of the ponds under examination, the results of the study allowed for the classification of the ponded depressions into three statistically significant groupings. The proportions of nutrients (a surplus of N or P or the level of nitrification), the oxygen saturation values, and the vegetational spectrum of phytoplankton and zooplankton proved meaningful for the differentiation of the groupings. High conductivity of the water, especially in the ponds in the area around Lietzen-Döbberin, is caused by high levels of sulfate and chloride. In comparison to lakes, the concen trations of Chlorophyll a as a biomass equivalent for the micro algae are noticeably smaller in relation to the phosphate levels. The results of the research suggest measures for the preservation and protection of the ponded depressions. The intentional reduction of external nutrients through the creation of and/or care for buffer zones and, if necessary, the redesignation of areas zoned for development into permanent nature conservation zones is recommended. Further preservation measures, aimed at reducing the reserves of internal nutrients, will only be deduced after further study of the ponded depressions, especially in relation to the ability of the sediment to absorb phosphors...|$|R

This innovation is expected to benefit current applications of aluminium/ammonia heat pipes in space and terrestrial projects {{as well as many}} new HP applications. The project was jointly sponsored by the Northumbria University and Thermacore, a world leading heat pipe manufacturing company in the UK, and formed the feasibility stage of a much larger program in Thermacore aiming to develop the next generation of HPs for space applications. In this project, sinter-style aluminium SLM HPs have been produced and tested to prove their functionality and to provide an overall image of the new production process with regard to the major involved parameters. During the project several properties of the new heat pipes e. g. wick porosity, permeability and pore size; wall density, hardness, vibration resistance and optimum SLM build parameters have also been determined by the existing or especially developed rigs in Thermacore or Northumbria University laboratories including scanning electronic <b>microscope</b> (SEM), vibration <b>table,</b> permeability measurement rig, etc. Converting the SLM products into functional heat pipes involves many other steps which have also been completed and explained.

A numerical design tool is now available to evaluate SLM produced heat pipes and major challenges of this new HP production process including the density of the solid structures and possible contamination of the materials have been identified. Also a reasonably good overall image of this new HP production process and the new HPs has been provided in this project through the conducted measurements and experiments.

40|$|Image-based {{lighting}} (IBL) is {{the process}} ofilluminating scenes and objects (real or syn-thetic) with images {{of light from the}} real world. It evolved from the reflection-mapping technique 1, 2 in which we use panoramic images as texture maps on computer graphics models to show shiny objects reflect-ing real and synthetic environments. IBL is analogous to image-based modeling, in which we derive a 3 D scene’s geometric structure from images, and to image-based render-ing, in which we produce the ren-dered appearance of a scene from its appearance in images. When used effectively, IBL can produce realistic rendered appearances of objects and can be an effective tool for inte-grating computer graphics objects into real scenes. The basic steps in IBL are 1. capturing real-world illumination as an omnidirec-tional, high dynamic range image; 2. mapping the illumination onto a representation of the environment; 3. placing the 3 D object inside the environment; and 4. simulating the light from the environment illumi-nating the computer graphics object. Figure 1 shows an example of an object illuminated entirely using IBL. Gary Butcher created the models in 3 D Studio Max, and the renderer used was the Arnold global illumination system written by Marcos Fajardo. I captured the light in a kitchen so it includes light from a ceiling fixture; the blue sky from the windows; and the indirect light from the room’s walls, ceiling, and cabinets. Gary mapped the light from this room onto a large sphere and placed the model of the <b>microscope</b> on the <b>table</b> {{in the middle of the}} sphere. Then, he used Arnold to simulate the object’s appearance as illumi-nated by the light coming from the sphere of incident illumination. In theory, the image in Figure 1 should look about how a real microscope would appear in that environ-ment. It simulates not just the direct illumination from the ceiling light and windows but also the indirect illu-mination from the rest of the room’s surfaces. The reflec-tions in the smooth curved bottles reveal the kitchen’s appearance, and the shadows on the table reveal the colors and spread of the area light sources. The objects also successfully reflect each other, owing to the ray-tracing-based global-illumination techniques we used. This tutorial gives a basic IBL example using the freely available Radiance global illumination renderer to illu-minate a simple scene with several different lighting environments...|$|R

[EN] Hardly could {{those around}} us admit {{that young people}} from our High Schools {{would be able to}} do top level {{scientific}} research. This book demonstrates that, in fact, it is possible. Inside, there are ten papers that summarize the work developed by ten scientific teams with professional researchers and secondary school students at the Estación Experimental del Zaidín (EEZ-CSIC). Once again, our students have had the opportunity of learning about the latest techniques in molecular biology like DNA and protein extraction, DNA amplification using PCR, electrophoresis, gene sequencing, and knowing the most advanced instruments to watch the inner structures of life, as optical and electron microscopes. This is a challenge in which young people can go ahead of their own teachers at their high schools. But PIIISA projects have other advantages as well. These pages include the Proceedings of the III PIIISA-EEZ Congress. Then, our students will have carried out one of the most important features of science: to expose their results to everybody. They are going to learn that science is something meaningless if it cannot be transmited to the society. And moreover, this volume will become their first published paper thanks to the EEZ. And for all of these reasons we, as their teachers, have to thank the EEZ researchers for the important work performed with our students. Because they have been able to accept the challenge of becoming teachers of teenagers, of teaching complex concepts and techniques. And the most important fact: they have succeeded. And in relation to our educative system we can discover new perspectives. At least, in its compulsory levels, it offers a basic formation that lets our students get on in our modern world. But we usually forget that in our hands we also have the scientists of the future, young people who, thanks to projects like PIIISA, are at the forefront and who are going to have a clear view of scientific research much greater that youngsters with the same age. We don’t know if they will study in the future a scientific degree related to the research they have carried out now, but they know that after these experiences, their vision of science will be different, the won’t see science with the same eyes as months ago when they came into the EEZ. But we should not stop here; PIIISA spirit must spread to the rest of the society. PIIISA must be a way that leads to a change in the perception of science in society, a way that definitely launches our country to Science. And this way begins just now, with our students, with researchers, with us, their teachers, with their partners in the classroom, and even though, their families. Without science there is no progress; without progress there is no future. PIIISA shows that all of these objectives are possible. These pages demonstrate it. [ES] Difícilmente aquellos que nos rodean llegarían a pensar que jóvenes de nuestros institutos pudieran ser capaces de llevar a cabo una investigación científica de alto nivel. Este libro demuestra, que de hecho, sí que es posible. Contiene diez artículos científicos que resumen el trabajo llevado a cabo por diez equipos constituidos por investigadores profesionales y por estudiantes de secundaria y bachillerato de institutos granadinos en la Estación Experimental del Zaidín (EEZ-CSIC). Una vez más, nuestros estudiantes han tenido la oportunidad de aprender las últimas técnicas en biología molecular, entre ellas, la extracción de ADN y proteínas, la amplificación de ADN mediante la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa, la secuenciación de genes, o de conocer aquellos otros instrumentos que permiten ver las estructuras más íntimas de la materia viva, como los microscopios ópticos y electrónicos. Es este un reto en el que los jóvenes llegar a ir incluso por delante de nosotros, sus profesores de los centros educativos. Pero PIIISA muestra además otras ventajas. Estas páginas son las Actas del III Congreso PIIISA-EEZ. En ese momento, nuestros estudiantes también habrán llevado a cabo otra de las funciones más importantes de la ciencia, la de exponer los resultados obtenidos. Ellos también aprenderán que la ciencia es algo sin sentido sino se transmite al resto de la sociedad. Y más aún, este volumen contendrá su primer artículo publicado, también gracias a la EEZ. Es por todo ello por lo que, como profesores de estos jóvenes, hemos de reconocer a los investigadores de la Estación Experimental del Zaidín el importante trabajo llevado a cabo con nuestros estudiantes, ya que han sido capaces de aceptar el desafío de convertirse en profesores de adolescentes, de transmitirles técnicas y conceptos complejos. Y lo más importante: han tenido éxito. Y también podemos ver nuevas perspectivas en relación a nuestro sistema educativo. Al menos, en su enseñanza obligatoria, ofrece una formación básica que permite a nuestros alumnado enfrentarse al mundo actual. Pero normalmente olvidamos que también tenemos en nuestras manos a los científicos del futuro, gente joven que, gracias a proyectos como PIIISA, están en la vanguardia y van a tener una visión mucho más clara que otros jóvenes de su edad. Desconocemos si en un futuro ellos estudiarán una carrera relacionada con la investigación que ahora han desarrollado, pero ellos son conscientes de que tras estas experiencias su visión de la ciencia será diferente; no verán la ciencia con los mismos ojos que hace unos meses cuando llegaron a la EEZ. Pero no debemos detenernos aquí. El espíritu PIIISA debe extenderse al resto de la sociedad. PIIISA debe ser un camino que conduzca a un cambio en la percepción de la ciencia en la sociedad, una vía que definitivamente lance a nuestro país hacia la Ciencia. Y este recorrido comienza justo ahora, con nuestros estudiantes, con los investigadores, con nosotros, sus profesores, con sus compañeros de clase y, por supuesto, con sus familias. Sin ciencia no hay progreso; sin progreso no hay futuro. Y PIIISA demuestra que todos estos objetivos son posibles. Estas páginas lo demuestran.
