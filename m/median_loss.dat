40|$|Fraud is {{a growing}} issue that {{organizations}} face. In the 2016 Report to the Nations, the ACFE estimated that organizations typically lose 5 % of revenues each year to fraud. This is an extremely large cut of revenues that most businesses cannot afford to lose. The ACFE reports that 30 % of fraud victims within their study was small businesses with less than 100 employees (2016). While the <b>median</b> <b>loss</b> per fraud case is the same at $ 150, 000 for for-profit organizations of any size, the frequency of fraud at small businesses {{is much higher than}} at large businesses (ACFE, 2016). Though $ 150, 000 may not seem like a big loss for a Fortune 500 company, this amount can be extremely damaging to a small business. A study by Carland et al., attributed the majority of small businesses failures to occupational fraud (2001). Small businesses are even further vulnerable due to several characteristics prevalent within small businesses that make them the most targeted form of business for fraud. The focus of this thesis is on best practices in internal controls to help prevent {{the most common form of}} occupational fraud, which is asset misappropriation. This form of fraud makes up 83 % of all cases reported to the ACFE (ACFE, 2016). While asset misappropriation has the smallest <b>median</b> <b>loss</b> compared that of financial statement fraud or corruption, the ACFE still found that the <b>median</b> <b>loss</b> per case is $ 125, 000.

40|$|AbstractAimTo {{identify}} {{risk factors}} that influence weight loss in patients receiving radiotherapy. BackgroundIt is a well-known fact that cancer patients can be affected by malnutrition {{at the onset of}} the disease and during treatment due to the toxicity. Pretreatment weight loss alone does not predict those who will need nutritional supplementation. Instead, a variety of nutritional and tumor related factors needs to be taken into account. Material and methodsA retrospective study was conducted on 129 patients with different tumor locations. Weight loss was evaluated during radiotherapy and one month after treatment. The impact of age, ECOG, chemotherapy, pretreatment weight loss, tumor location, previous surgery and TNM were analyzed. We aimed to identify a high-risk group of patients before starting treatment. ResultsThe average net weight loss during radiotherapy and one month after treatment for this group of patients was 0. 68 kg and 1. 6 kg, respectively. <b>Median</b> weight <b>loss</b> during radiotherapy was 2. 6 kg for head and neck (HN) patients and 0. 27 kg for other tumor sites (p= 0. 028). <b>Median</b> weight <b>loss</b> one month after radiotherapy was 3. 7 kg for HN patients and 1. 1 kg for the rest of the patients (p= 0. 034). The <b>median</b> weight <b>loss</b> one month after treatment was 3. 2 kg for patients receiving chemotherapy and 0. 5 kg for those patients who did not receive chemotherapy (p< 0. 001). A regression analysis determined that HN tumor location and the use of chemotherapy were independent risk factors. ConclusionsNutritional status must be monitored and managed before, during and after treatment. A variety of nutritional and tumor-related factors must be considered. According to our results, head and neck tumors and the use of chemotherapy are the only two factors considered statistically significant. Because patients continue to lose weight after treatment, we recommend close surveillance after radiotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{determine}} if oral losartan treatment decreases the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death caused by experimental intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in mice. Methods We produced IOP increase in CD 1 mice and performed unilateral optic nerve crush. Mice received oral losartan, spironolactone, enalapril, or no drug to test effects of inhibiting angio-tensin receptors. IOP was monitored by Tonolab, {{and blood pressure}} was monitored by tail cuff device. RGC loss was measured in masked axon counts and RGC bodies by β-tubulin labeling. Scleral changes that could modulate RGC injury were measured including axial length, scleral thickness, and retinal layer thicknesses, pressure-strain behavior in inflation testing, and study of angiotensin receptors and pathways by reverse transcription polymer-ase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Results Losartan treatment prevented significant RGC loss (<b>median</b> <b>loss</b> = 2. 5 %, p = 0. 13), while <b>median</b> <b>loss</b> with water, spironolactone, and enalapril treatments were 26 %, 28 % and 43 %; p < 0. 0001).

As the movement lost support, the <b>median</b> <b>loss</b> fell by one-half its previous value. In Chapter 3, a measure of farmers 2 ̆ 7 cash flow, the farmers 2 ̆ 7 surplus, is calculated for 1884 to 1908 for 77 counties in Nebraska. Using the farmers 2 ̆ 7 surplus measure, it is clear that farmers suffered from a squeeze in their cash flow during the Populist period. After the Populist period, their cash flow increased. In addition, for the same counties and years, the real value of farmers 2 ̆ 7 mortgage payments had there been no deflation is estimated. By comparing the real value of mortgage payments that farmers actually paid to the estimated values had there been no deflation, the cost of deflation to farmers during the Populist era can be evaluated. Deflation had only a small impact on farmers holding nominal interest rate mortgage contracts. In Chapter 4, county level data are used for Kansas and Nebraska to examine the 1892, 1896, and 1900 U.

40|$|Objectives. Patients with {{vestibular}} schwannoma (VS) frequently {{suffer from}} disabling vestibular symptoms. This prospective follow-up study evaluates vestibular and auditory function and impairment {{of quality of}} life due to vertigo, dizziness and imbalance in patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma of different sizes before/ after microsurgical or radiosurgical treatment. Methods. 38 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma were included. 22 received microsurgery, 16 cyberknife radiosurgery. Two follow-ups took place after a median of 50 and 186. 5 days. Patients received a standardized neuro-ophthalmological examination, electronystagmography with bithermal caloric testing, and pure-tone audiometry. Quality of life was evaluated with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Patient data was grouped and analyzed according {{to the size of}} the VS (group 1 : < 20 mm vs group 2 : ≥ 20 mm). Results. In group 1, the <b>median</b> <b>loss</b> of vestibular function was + 10. 5 % as calculated by Jongkees Formula (range – 43;+ 52; group 2 : median + 36 %, range – 56; + 90). The median change of DHI scores was – 9 in group 1 (range – 68; 30) and + 2 in group 2 (– 54;+ 20). <b>Median</b> <b>loss</b> of hearing was 4 dB (- 42; 93) in group 1 and 12 dB in group 2 (5; 42). Conclusions. Loss of vestibular function in vestibular schwannoma clearly correlates with tumor size. However, loss of vestibular function was not strictly associated with a long-term deterioration of quality of life. This may be due to central compensation of vestibular deficits in long-standing large tumors. Loss of hearing before treatment was significantly influenced by the age of the patient but not by tumor size. At follow-up 1 and 2, hearing was significantly worse in those patients with a large VS and after microsurgical treatment...|$|E

To quantify rodent pest impacts and identify trends in rodent pest research impacting on small-holder agriculture in the Afro-Malagasy region we did a systematic review of research outputs from 1910 to 2015, by developing an a priori defined set of criteria to allow for replication of the review process. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We reviewed 162 publications, and while rodent pest research was spatially distributed across Africa (32 countries, including Madagascar), there was a disparity in number of studies per country with research biased towards four countries (Tanzania [25 %], Nigeria [9 %], Ethiopia [9 %], Kenya [8 %]) accounting for 51 % of all rodent pest research in the Afro-Malagasy region.

We present six potentially collusive fraudulent behaviors and show their detection process in an ERP system. We have enhanced our fraud de-tection framework to utilize aggregation of different sources of logs in order to detect communication and have further enhanced it to render it system-agnostic thus achieving portability and making it generally applicable to all ERP systems...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that {{replacing}} the expectation of the loss in statistical decision theory with the median of the loss leads to a viable and useful alternative to conventional risk minimization particularly {{because it can be}} used with heavy tailed distributions. We investigate three possible definitions for such medloss estimators and derive examples of them in several standard settings. We argue that the medloss definition based on the posterior distribution is better than the other two definitions that do not permit optimization over large classes of estimators. We argue that <b>median</b> <b>loss</b> minimizing estimates often yield improved performance, have resistance to outliers as high as the usual robust estimates, and are resistant to the specific loss used to form them. In simulations with the posterior medloss formulation, we show how the estimates can be obtained numerically and that they can have better robustness properties than estimates derived from risk minimization.
