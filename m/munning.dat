5000|$|Ten Mile Tide is an {{independent}} band originating in San Francisco. They describe their sound as [...] "feel-good acoustic rock, foot-stomping folk, and beer-drenched bluegrass." [...] Twin brothers Jason (lead electric guitar and vocals) and Justin (rhythm acoustic guitar and vocals) <b>Munning</b> started the band in 1999 at Stanford University along with Steve Kessler (fiddle), Marc Mazzoni (lead vocals, keyboards), Bryan Jayne (bass, vocals), and Brooks Dubose (drums, vocals). Jeff Clemetson (bass), Kristen Kessler (sound) and Matt Mitchell (keyboard) joined on to form {{the core of the}} band which toured in different formats full-time for over 6 years.|$|E
50|$|The banded {{hare-wallaby}} or <b>munning</b> (Lagostrophus fasciatus) is a marsupial {{that is currently}} found on the Islands of Bernier and Dorre off western Australia. A small population has recently been established on Faure Island and {{it appears to have}} been successful. It has also been reintroduced to Wadderin Sanctuary, near Narembeen in the central wheatbelt, in 2013. Evidence suggested that the mernine was the only living member of the sthenurine subfamily, and a recent osteology-based phylogeny of macropodids found that the {{banded hare-wallaby}} was indeed a bastion of an ancient lineage, agreeing with other (molecular) appraisals of the evolutionary history of L. fasciatus. However, the authors analysis did not support the placement of the mernine within Sthenurinae, but suggest it belongs to a plesiomorphic clade which branched off from other macropodids in the early Miocene and put forward the new subfamily Lagostrophinae. Recent analysis of mtDNA extracted from fossils of the sthenurine Simosthenurus supports this conclusion. This new subfamily includes the banded hare-wallaby and the fossil genus Troposodon.|$|E
