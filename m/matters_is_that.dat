All that <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not even be subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E

The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "he's your feller and you love him" [...] ("What's the Use of Wond'rin'?").

There are four different covers, the standard edition has a red logo, the deluxe edition has a blue logo and two variants to the regular design include yellow or white logos. Angus said the options were not to deliver the message that fans would need to purchase all covers. He said, [...] "We know most people will only purchase the record once, in their colour of choice.

500|$|The High Court was {{convened in}} the Supreme Court Building on 25March 1983. [...] Presiding {{over the case}} were two judges: Justice Thirugnana Sampanthar Sinnathuray, who would deliver {{judgment}} on serial murderer John Martin Scripps 13years later, and Justice Frederick Arthur Chua, {{who was at the}} time the longest serving judge in Singapore. [...] Knight continued to build his case on the evidence gathered by detective work. [...] Photographs of the crime scenes, together with witness testimonies, would help the court to visualise the events that led to the crimes. Other evidencethe blood samples, religious objects, drugs, and the notes with Ng and Ghazali's namesconclusively proved the defendants' involvement. [...] Knight had no eyewitnesses to the murders; his evidence was circumstantial, but he told the court in his opening statement, [...] "What <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] did intentionally suffocate and drown these two innocent children, causing their deaths in circumstances which amount to murder. [...] And this we will prove beyond all reasonable doubt." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1986, Dawkins and {{biologist}} John Maynard Smith {{participated in}} an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." [...] He added that [...] "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English." ...|$|E

And it was this quality that came to define Brian’s oeuvre as he moved beyond and into bigger pop productions that would culminate in Smile." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to New York state law, confessions and confidences {{made to a}} clergyman {{or other}} {{minister}} are privileged and cannot be used as evidence. This privilege {{is not limited to}} communications with a particular kind of priest or congregant, and it is not confined to statements made [...] "under the cloak of confession". What <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the conversations were of a spiritual nature, were confidential enough to indicate that the penitent intended that they be kept secret, and that the penitent did not waive the privilege subsequently.|$|E
2500|$|Bhakti, {{literally}} [...] "devotion to God", is {{the practice}} of devotion and humility. Jivamukti Yoga holds that [...] "God-realization" [...] {{is the goal of}} yoga practice, and that it does not matter to what form of God one's love and devotion is directed; what <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the devotion should be directed to something higher than one's own self or ego. Inter-religious understanding and tolerance are significant corollaries to this practice, and altars in Jivamukti centers are typically adorned with images of multiple religious and moral authorities: Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Ingrid Newkirk intermingle with Jesus, Buddha, and Krishna.|$|E

[...] Similarly, John C. Bean sees the speech as the final stage {{in the process of}} Katherina's change of heart towards Petruchio; [...] "if we can appreciate the liberal element in Kate's last speech – the speech that strikes modern sensibilities as advocating male tyranny – we can perhaps see that Kate is tamed not in the automatic manner of behavioural psychology but in the spontaneous manner of the later romantic comedies where characters lose themselves and emerge, as if from a dream, liberated into the bonds of love." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{several years}} Truffaut had become {{increasingly}} interested in people {{from his life}} who had died, beginning with his mentor and father-figure André Bazin, who had died the day before Truffaut began shooting his first feature, The 400 Blows. Truffaut told a reporter for L'Express: [...] "I'm faithful to the dead, I live with them. I'm forty-five and already beginning {{to be surrounded by}} dead people." [...] In 1977 Truffaut lost two other important father-figures: Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois and Roberto Rossellini, whom Truffaut called [...] "the most intelligent man, with André Bazin" [...] during an interview with Le Matin de Paris. Around this time Truffaut had watched Shoot the Piano Player and noticed that half the actors had since died. In an interview with [...] magazine Truffaut asked [...] "Why not have the same range of feelings for the dead as for the living, the same aggressive or affectionate relationship?" [...] and added that he wanted to film [...] "what {{it would be like to}} show on screen a man who refuses to forget the dead." [...] According to him, The Green Room is not the worshipping of death, but an extension of the love for the people that we have met and who are no longer alive, and the idea that they have a permanency. What <b>matters</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Davenne refuses to forget, and this refusal is important for Truffaut.|$|E
