5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede <b>migratory</b> <b>fish</b> travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E

25|$|The {{perception}} of bay salt marshes as a coastal 'wasteland' has since changed, acknowledging {{that they are}} one of the most biologically productive habitats on earth, rivalling tropical rainforests. Salt marshes are ecologically important providing habitats for native <b>migratory</b> <b>fish</b> and acting as sheltered feeding and nursery grounds. They are now protected by legislation in many countries to look after these ecologically important habitats. In the United States and Europe, they are now accorded to a high level of protection by the Clean Water Act and the Habitats Directive respectively. With the impacts of this habitat and its importance now realised, a growing interest in restoring salt marshes, through managed retreat or the reclamation of land has been established. However, many Asian countries such as China are still to recognise the value of marshlands. With their ever-growing populations and intense development along the coast, the value of salt marshes tends to be ignored and the land continues to be reclaimed.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{its great}} height, Shoshone Falls {{is a total}} barrier to the {{upstream}} movement of fish. Anadromous fish (which live in the ocean as adults, but return to fresh water to lay eggs) such as salmon and steelhead/rainbow trout, and other <b>migratory</b> <b>fish</b> such as sturgeon, cannot pass the falls. Prior {{to the construction of}} many dams on the Snake River below Shoshone Falls, spawning fish would congregate in great numbers {{at the base of the}} falls, where they were a major food source for local Native Americans. Yellowstone cutthroat trout lived above the falls in the same ecological niche as rainbow trout below it, although their range has decreased since the 19th century due to river diversions and competition from introduced species such as lake trout. Due to this marked difference, the World Wide Fund for Nature uses Shoshone Falls as the boundary between the Upper Snake and the Columbia Unglaciated freshwater ecoregions. The Snake River above Shoshone Falls shares only 35percent of its fish species with those of the lower Snake River below the falls. Fourteen fish species found in the upper Snake are also found in the Bonneville freshwater ecoregion (which covers the Great Basin portion of Utah), but not the lower Snake or Columbia rivers. The upper Snake River is also high in freshwater mollusk endemism (such as snails and clams).|$|E

500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} bignose shark as Data Deficient overall, due to {{inadequate}} population and fishery monitoring. The species {{is considered to}} be of concern, however, given it is slow-reproducing and faces widespread heavy fishing pressure. There is evidence that its numbers have recently declined in the Maldives. Furthermore, most bignose shark bycatch occurs in international waters, where a single stock may be affected by multiple fisheries. It is listed as a [...] "highly migratory species" [...] under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly <b>Migratory</b> <b>Fish</b> Stocks, but thus far this has not led to significant conservation measures. Regionally, the IUCN has assessed the bignose shark as Near Threatened in the northwestern Atlantic. Though specific data are lacking, it is suspected to have declined there because it is commonly misidentified as the sandbar shark, thus the known decline in sandbar shark numbers resulting from US longline fishing may represent a decline in bignose shark numbers, as well. This species has been assessed as Least Concern in Australian waters, where it faces no significant threats.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeologists {{studying}} aerial {{photographs of}} the coast have discovered a large 'V'-shaped fish trap in the sea off the Poppit coast. Some 280 yards long, and comprising a wall 3 feet wide, it now lies totally submerged (under some 12 feet of water), even at low tide. Estimated to be some 1000 years old, in those days it would have appeared at low tide, acting as a shallow rock pool, trapping fish behind the walls as the tide flowed out. At that time the sea level was lower and {{the entrance to the}} Teifi Estuary lay further towards the Poppit side. [...] Additionally, at its north-westerly point is a gap where fisherman would have placed nets to catch fish as the tide receded. It is believed {{to be one of the}} biggest fish-traps of its kind, but the structure’s orientation is such that it precludes the possibility that it was designed to catch <b>migratory</b> <b>fish,</b> such as salmon and sea trout, going up the river Teifi.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1950s {{dams and}} {{thousands}} of kilometres of dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation and for the control of diseases vectors such as blood flukes that caused Schistosomiasis. More than a hundred lakes were thus {{cut off from the}} main river. There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction. Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, Baidang Lake shrunk from [...] in the 1950s to [...] in 2005. Zhangdu Lake dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of <b>migratory</b> <b>fish</b> was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of carp who thrived in eutrophic water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage. In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution. The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable [...] "iron barrier" [...] that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the Baiji Dolphin, finless porpoise and the Yangtze Alligator. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1700 the [...] "admiral" [...] system {{provided}} the government. The first captain arriving {{in a particular}} bay {{was in charge of}} allocating suitable shoreline sites for curing fish. The system faded away after 1700. Fishing-boat captains competed to arrive first from Europe in an attempt to become the admiral; soon merchants left crewmen behind at the prime shoreline locations to lay claim to the sites. This led to [...] "bye-boat" [...] fishing: local, small-boat crews fished certain areas in the summer, claimed a strip of land as their own, and sold their catches to the <b>migratory</b> fishers. Bye-boat <b>fishing</b> thus became dominant, giving the island a semi-permanent population, and proved more profitable than <b>migratory</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|R

25|$|The species often forms {{schools of}} {{variable}} sizes {{ranging from a}} few individuals to several hundred. The species is also highly migratory, and biochemical studies on the species {{have shown that the}} muscles contain unusually high levels of a fatty acid called DHA. The reason for this is probably that the muscle is also low in lipids due to accumulation of these in other organs. Other <b>migratory</b> <b>fishes</b> such as tuna also have this adaptation, suggesting it is a convergent trait.|$|R
60|$|The {{sturgeon}} {{is another}} {{more or less}} <b>migratory</b> <b>fish,</b> originally (like the salmon) of freshwater habits, but now partially marine, which ascends its parent stream for spawning during the summer season. Incredible quantities are caught for caviare in the great Russian rivers. At one point on the Volga, a hundred thousand people collect in spring for the fishery, and work by relays, day and night continuously, {{as long as the}} sturgeons are going up stream. On some of the tributaries, when fishing is intermitted for a single day, the sturgeons have been known to completely fill a river 360 feet wide, so that the backs of the uppermost fish were pushed out of the water. (I take this statement, not from the 'Arabian Nights,' as the scoffer might imagine, but from that most respectable authority, Professor Seeley.) Still, in spite of the enormous quantity killed, there is no danger of any falling off in the supply for the future, for every fish lays from two to three million eggs, each of which, as caviare eaters well know, is quite big enough to be distinctly seen with the naked eye in the finished product. The best caviare is simply bottled exactly as found, with the addition merely of a little salt. No man of taste can pretend to like the nasty sun-dried sort, in which the individual eggs are reduced to a kind of black pulp, and pressed hard with the feet into doubtful barrels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Tributaries to the Great Lakes {{are highly}} {{fragmented}} by dams and road crossings {{that act as}} potential barriers to <b>migratory</b> <b>fishes,</b> restricting their access to historical riverine spawning grounds. There is growing investment in removing or modifying barriers to restore native fish migrations and ecosystem function, but these efforts may also increase available habitat for invasive sea lamprey. The restoration community lacks a systematic method for comparing these costs and benefits to assess which barrier removal projects would offer the greatest return on investment. To address this problem, we developed a basin-scale mathematical optimization model to prioritize barriers for removal {{on the basis of}} upstream breeding habitat for both native and invasive fishes. We parameterized the model using an extensive database of dams and road crossings; economic models of projected barrier removal and lampricide application costs; and historical data describing distributions of native and invasive species. We describe trade-offs resulting from increased habitat access for native <b>migratory</b> <b>fishes</b> and sea lamprey that would accompany different barrier removal scenarios. We further discuss the sensitivity of the model to uncertainty in estimates of tributary suitability for native and invasive species and investigate the benefit of simultaneously planning barrier removal and lamprey management actions...|$|R
