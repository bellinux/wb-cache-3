5|$|On May 22, villagers {{returned}} to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, {{which had been}} largely destroyed. Expecting another attack, reinforcements from the Carmeli Brigade took up positions in the two villages. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> of the battles were sent to Tiberias to rest and recuperate, and the units that lost soldiers were reorganized.|$|E
5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted {{that many of the}} organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, {{and he wanted to}} see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community {{in the weeks and months}} after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E

It refers to a police raid on November 18, 1901, during <b>the</b> government <b>of</b> Porfirio Díaz, on a private home, situated in the calle de la Paz (nowadays calle Ezequiel Montes), where at that moment a group of 41 men, 22 dressed as men, and 19 as women, were celebrating a ball.

25|$|A reenactment of the serum run {{was held}} in 1975, which took 6 days longer than the 1925 serum run, or {{more than twice the}} total time. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> were {{descendants}} of the original 20.

25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> {{consisted}} of ex-patients of mental institutions who {{felt the need}} to challenge the system's treatment of the mentally ill. Initially, this movement targeted issues surrounding involuntary commitment, use of electroconvulsive therapy, anti-psychotic medication, and coercive psychiatry. Many of these advocacy groups were successful in the judiciary system. In 1975, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled in favour of the Mental Patient's Liberation Front of Rogers v. Okin, establishing the right of a patient to refuse treatment.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday, June 27, 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation {{organized}} a march from Washington Square Park ("Bughouse Square") to the Water Tower {{at the intersection}} of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> extemporaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza. The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers. Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|By the 1920s Winter Carnaval {{celebrations}} were abandoned, and Summer Carnaval {{remained the}} only Carnaval in Santiago de Cuba. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays {{during the month}} of June, everyone in Cuba knew one could go to Santiago to party. The major patrons of these summer festivities were local industries: Polar, La Cristal and Hatuey beers; Bacardi rum; and Eden tobacco. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> in Summer Carnaval were the newly unemployed sugar and coffee workers, who were quite willing to remain in Santiago after the harvest and work for their commercial patrons in the jobs that the festival season created. This combination- the unemployed and the commercial sponsor- contributed to the popularity of Summer Carnaval. During the 1940s and early 50s, Carnaval in both Santiago de Cuba and Havana became more commercialized.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match that aired, Raw's Edge, Randy Orton, and Jeff Hardy Smackdown!'s King Booker (with Queen Sharmell), Mr. Kennedy, Matt Hardy and Dave Finlay and ECW's CM Punk {{competed in the}} third annual Money in the Bank ladder match. The match {{featured}} many notable spots, including points where Edge performed the Spear on all the other opponents, followed by Randy Orton doing the same by leveling <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> with his RKO later in the match. Mr. Kennedy missed a Kenton Bomb and landed on a ladder {{on the back of}} his neck. He instead received a Swanton Bomb from Jeff Hardy. Several dangerous ladder spots were also featured, including Orton performing an RKO on CM Punk whilst standing on the ladder, and King Booker performing his Book End to Orton from the top of the ladder as well. Midway through the match, Jeff Hardy climbed a fifteen-foot-high ladder inside the ring and on his brother, Matt Hardy's urging, he performed a leg drop off of that ladder onto Edge, who was lying prone on another ladder outside the ring, set-up on the ring apron and the barricade. Due to the impact, the ladder on which Edge was placed, broke in half and he, along with Jeff, were severely injured. They were carried off on stretchers by the paramedics. Later, when Booker was about to retrieve the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy held Booker's wife, Queen Sharmell as a hostage, threatening to perform his Twist of Fate on her. Booker went to her aid and received the Twist of Fate from Matt. Finlay fought Matt for sometime in the ring, and also performed his Celtic Cross to Matt onto a ladder. Finlay's associate Hornswoggle emerged from under the ring and attempted to retrieve the briefcase for Finlay. He was stopped by Kennedy, who performed his Green Bay Plunge on Hornswoggle. Kennedy went on to win the match, only after knocking CM Punk off a ladder by hitting him with another ladder.|$|E

500|$|... "Wah-Wah" [...] was {{the first}} song Harrison played live as a solo artist when he {{performed}} it as his opener for the Western-music portion of the Concert for Bangladesh, in August 1971.

At the Concert for George in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] was performed by an all-star band that included Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Starr and McCartney.

50|$|Coworking is {{distinct}} from business accelerators, incubators and executive suites.
