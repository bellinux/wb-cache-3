40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the diversity of}} the primary sequences of 16 S rRNA genes among Neisseria meningitidis strains (Men) and evaluated the use of this approach as a molecular subtyping tool. We aligned and compared a 1, 417 -bp fragment of the 16 S rRNA gene from 264 Men strains of serogroups A, B, C, and Y (MenA, MenB, MenC, and MenY, respectively) isolated throughout the world over a 30 -year period. Thirty-one positions of difference were found among 49 16 S types: differences between types ranged from 1 to 14 positions (0. 07 to 0. 95 %). 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> and serogroups were highly associated; only 3 out 49 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> were shared by two or more serogroups. We have identified 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> that are exclusively associated with strains of certain hypervirulent clones: 16 <b>S</b> <b>type</b> 5 with MenA subgroup III, 16 <b>S</b> <b>type</b> 4 with the MenB electrophoretic type 5 (ET- 5) complex, and 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> 12 and 13 with MenC of the ET- 37 complex. For MenC strains, 16 S sequencing provided the highest sensitivity and specificity and the best overall association with the outbreak-related versus sporadic isolates when compared with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and multilocus sequence typing. We demonstrated for the first time an unexpected diversity among 16 S rRNA genes of Men strains, identified 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> associated with well-defined hypervirulent clones, and showed the potential of this approach to rapidly identify virulent strains associated with outbreaks and/or an increased incidence of sporadic disease...|$|R

40|$|A {{molecular}} typing method {{based on the}} 16 S rRNA sequence diversity was developed for Haemophilus influenzae isolates. A total of 330 H. influenzae isolates were analyzed, representing a diverse collection of U. S. isolates. We found {{a high level of}} 16 S rRNA sequence heterogeneity (up to 2. 73 %) and observed an exclusive correlation between 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> and serotypes (a to f); no 16 <b>S</b> <b>type</b> was found in more than one serotype. Similarly, no multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type (ST) was found in more than one serotype. Our 16 <b>S</b> <b>typing</b> and MLST results are in agreement with those of previous studies showing that serotypable H. influenzae isolates behave as highly clonal populations and emphasize the lack of clonality of nontypable (NT) H. influenzae isolates. There was not a 1 : 1 correlation between 16 <b>S</b> <b>types</b> and STs, but all H. influenzae serotypable isolates clustered similarly. This correlation was not observed for NT H. influenzae; the two methods clustered NT H. influenzae isolates differently. 16 S rRNA gene sequencing alone provides a level of discrimination similar to that obtained with the analysis of seven genes for MLST. We demonstrated that 16 <b>S</b> <b>typing</b> is an additional and complementary approach to MLST, particularly for NT H. influenzae isolates, and is potentially useful for outbreak investigation...|$|R
40|$|Basophils in {{peripheral}} blood and bone marrow in 25 cases with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were counted and morphologically classified by our improved method; basophilis were classified into Ⅰ to Ⅴ types. The Ⅲ and Ⅳ types were subclassified to <b>S</b> <b>type</b> with sharply defined granules and diffuse N type. This classification was adapted for basophilograms. The basophilogram in healthy controls showed a left type {{and that in}} CML generally a right type. It shifted to the left approaching to the normal type in the cases with remission by chemotherapy. In relapsing patients with CML, the basophilogram clearly shifted to the right. The basophilogram seen in 2 cases with the pre-stage of blastic crisis of CML indicated a definite right type. It was shown that an increase of <b>S</b> <b>type</b> occurred in the relapsing stage. Therefore, appearance of <b>S</b> <b>type</b> {{as well as a}} right type in basophilogram would be a useful clue to follow CML patients clinically. A basophils of <b>S</b> <b>type</b> was considered to be immature. The bone marrow basophilogram was shown to be more shifted to the right than that of {{peripheral blood}}, and this tendency became more remarkable in relapse. Presence of a right type in basophilogram and appearance of <b>S</b> <b>type</b> are significant to observe the clinical course in CML patients, especially for judging acute exacerbation...|$|R

In the case where these bacteria are cultured in the plain agar medium for 18 hours, the complete oxidation of glucose below pyruvate in the case of <b>S</b> <b>type</b> seems to be less smoothly carried out than in the case of R type, and it tends to be more or less anaerobic. 2. Even in the case of still standing culture in fluid medium (bouillon) the complete oxidation below pyruvate in the case of <b>S</b> <b>type</b> likewise is less smoothly carried oat than in the case of R type. 3. As for the pathway between glucose to pyruvate in any method of culture, there is no difference between <b>S</b> <b>type</b> and R type; and it seems that the pathway from glucose to pyruvate is mainly through Embden-Meyerhof pathway...|$|R

40|$|Using <b>S</b> <b>type</b> and R type of Sh. sonnei, those {{standard}} strains stocked in our aboratory as test bacteria, {{the author}} studied influenes of N and C sources and various vitamins on cell growth {{and made a}} comparative study of glucese exidation during the cell growth; and obtained the following results. 1. When glucose is used as C source to which nicotinamide is added and then using aspartate, glutamate, alanine, or glycine separately as N source, {{it has been found}} that <b>S</b> <b>type</b> and R type of Sh. sonnei grow well in such media, and aspartate proves to be a specially good N source. 2. When aspartate is used as N source without addition of C source, neither of the two types can grow. However, glucose, gluconate, lactate, pyruvate, or succinate {{can be used as a}} suitable C source, but ribose does not serve as C source. 3. Nicotinamide proves to be necessary for promoting the growth of these two types of bacteria, but vitamin B(6) is not necessary. 4. In the still standing culture with fluid medium <b>S</b> <b>type</b> grows better than R type, whereas in the roller tube culture R type grows better than <b>S</b> <b>type.</b> 5. When the accumulated amount of pyruvate, lactate or acetate is compared with the amount of glucose consumed in the still standing culture with fluid medium using pepton as the N source and glucose as the C source, it has been found that the accumulation of these substances in the case of <b>S</b> <b>type</b> is greater than in the case of R type, indicating that the complete oxidaton of pyruvate is not carried out smoothly...|$|R
