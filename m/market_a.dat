5|$|Although {{the company}} had {{permission}} to construct the railway, it still had to raise the capital for the construction works. The CCE was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors – the Baker Street & Waterloo Railway (BS), the Waterloo & City Railway (W) and the Great Northern & City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that put forward bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which had received assent in 1891). Only the W, which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed dividend, was able to raise its funds without difficulty. For the CCE and the rest, much of {{the remainder of the}} decade saw a struggle to find investors in an uninterested <b>market.</b> <b>A</b> share offer in April 1894 had been unsuccessful and in December 1899 only 451 out of the company's 177,600 £10 shares had been part sold to eight investors.|$|E

After the game's release, an Ultimania guide to the game was also released, containing concept and character artwork, interviews with staff members, and guides to the game's enemies, continent layouts and times for events. A book set between XIII-2 and Lightning Returns, Chronicle of Chaotic Era, was originally scheduled to be released alongside the game in Japan, but was eventually cancelled due to the author falling ill. After the game's release, a three-part novella set after Lightning Returns ending was released through Famitsu Weekly magazine, titled Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories.
