40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} has shown the oxidizing properties and <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacies</b> of chlorine dioxide (ClO 2). Its clinical efficacies on oral malodor have been evaluated and reported only in short duration trials, moreover, no clinical studies have investigated its <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacies</b> on periodontal and malodorous bacteria. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess the inhibitory effects of a mouthwash containing ClO 2 used for 7 days on morning oral malodor and on salivary periodontal and malodorous bacteria. Methods/Design A randomized, double blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 15 healthy male volunteers, who were divided into 2 groups. Subjects were instructed to rinse with the experimental mouthwash containing ClO 2 or the placebo mouthwash, without ClO 2, twice per day for 7 days. After a one week washout period, each group then used the opposite mouthwash for 7 days. At baseline and after 7 days, oral malodor was evaluated with Organoleptic measurement (OM), and analyzed the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), methyl mercaptan (CH 3 SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH 3) 2 S), the main VSCs of human oral malodor, were assessed by gas chromatography (GC). Clinical outcome variables included plaque and gingival indices, and tongue coating index. The samples of saliva were microbiologically investigated. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-Invader method. Results and Discussion The baseline oral condition in healthy subjects in the 2 groups did not differ significantly. After rinsing with the mouthwash containing ClO 2 for 7 days, morning bad breath decreased as measured by the OM and reduced the concentrations of H 2 S, CH 3 SH and (CH 3) 2 S measured by GC, were found. Moreover ClO 2 mouthwash used over a 7 -day period appeared effective in reducing plaque, tongue coating accumulation and the counts of Fusobacterium nucleatum in saliva. Future research is needed to examine long-term effects, as well as effects on periodontal diseases and plaque accumulation in a well-defined sample of halitosis patients and broader population samples.

A total of 40 men and 29 women (mean age, 53 years; age range, 18 to 92 years) {{were enrolled in the}} piperacillin-tazobactam group and 40 men and 25 women (mean age, 54 years; age range, 16 to 91 years) were enrolled in the imipenem-cilastatin group. The patients received either piperacillin (4 g) and tazobactam (500 mg) every 8 h or imipenem and cilastatin (500 mg each) every 8 h. Both regimens were given by intravenous infusion. A total of 113 patients were clinically evaluable. Of 55 patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam, 50 were clinically cured, while 40 of 58 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group were clinically cured. The differences were significant (Wilcoxon test; P = 0. 005). There were 4 failures or relapses in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 18 failures or relapses in the imipenem-cilastatin group. The microorganisms isolated were eradicated in similar proportions in the two patient groups. Adverse reactions, mainly gastrointestinal disturbances and nausea, were noted in 13 patients who received piperacillin-tazobactam and in 14 patients who received imipenem-cilastatin.

40|$|Abstract Background In 1982 Smith and Huggins {{showed that}} bacteriophages {{could be at}} least as {{effective}} as antibiotics in preventing mortality from experimental infections with a capsulated E. coli (K 1) in mice. Phages that required the K 1 capsule for infection were more effective than phages that did not require this capsule, but the efficacies of phages and antibiotics in preventing mortality both declined with time between infection and treatment, becoming virtually ineffective within 16 hours. Results We develop quantitative microbiological procedures that (1) explore the in vivo processes responsible for the efficacy of phage and antibiotic treatment protocols in experimental infections (the Resistance Competition Assay, or RCA), and (2) survey the therapeutic potential of phages in vitro (the Phage Replication Assay or PRA). We illustrate the application and utility of these methods in a repetition of Smith and Huggins' experiments, using the E. coli K 1 mouse thigh infection model, and applying treatments of phages or streptomycin. Conclusions 1) The Smith and Huggins phage and antibiotic therapy results are quantitatively and qualitatively robust. (2) Our RCA values reflect the <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacies</b> of the different phages and of streptomycin in preventing mortality, and reflect the decline in their efficacy with a delay in treatment. These results show specifically that bacteria become refractory to treatment over the term of infection. (3) The K 1 -specific and non-specific phages had similar replication rates on bacteria grown in broth (based on the PRA), but the K 1 -specific phage had markedly greater replication rates in mouse serum. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Nitrofurantoin’s use has {{increased}} exponentially since recent guidelines repositioned it as first-line therapy for uncomplicated lower {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess nitrofurantoin’s efficacy and toxicity {{in the treatment of}} lower UTI. Methods: We performed a systematic review of all human controlled clinical trials published from 1946 to 2014 and assessing short-term (≤ 14 days) nitrofurantoin for lower UTI. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on randomized trials. Results: Twenty-seven controlled trials including 4807 patients fulfilled entry criteria; most were conducted between the 1970 s and 1990 s and were at increased risk for various biases. Nitrofurantoin appears to have good clinical and <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacy</b> for UTI caused by common uropathogens, with clinical cure rates vary-ing between 79 % and 92 %. The most methodologically robust studies surveyed indicate overall equivalence between nitrofurantoin when given for 5 or 7 days and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and amoxi-cillin. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials confirmed equivalence in clinical cure, but indicated a slight advantage to comparator drugs in <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacy</b> (risk ratio 0. 93, 95 % CI 0. 89 – 0. 97).

One hundred twelve women, all of whom had documented infections with bacteria sensitive to both antibiotics, were included. Fifty-eight women received fosfomycin trometamol, and 54 women received cephalexin. The two groups did not differ in age, severity, or duration of current urinary tract infection, menstrual status, sexual activity, or use of contraceptives. Ninety percent of pathogens in the fosfomycin trometamol group and 81 % in the cephalexin group were Escherichia coli (the difference is not significant [NS]). A clinical evaluation at the 5 -day follow-up showed that 91 % of the women in each group were free of symptoms, while five women in each group were considered therapy failures and were treated by another antibiotic course. A microbiological evaluation at the 5 -day follow-up showed a 91 % eradication rate in the fosfomycin trometamol group and an 83 % eradication rate in the cephalexin group (NS). At the 1 -month follow-up, a clinical evaluation demonstrated prolonged resolution in 86 and 78 %, respectively, of the participating women (NS). A microbiological evaluation at 1 month demonstrated prolonged eradication in 47 (81 %) women treated with fosfomycin trometamol and in 37 (68 %) women treated with cephalexin (NS). Three and six women, respectively, had relapsed. No adverse reactions were reported by the fosfomycin trometamol-treated women, while three women treated with cephalexin reported mild adverse reactions but completed the study period. Fosfomycin trometamol in a single 3 -g dose is as effective as a 5 -day regimen of cephalexin for the treatment of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{research}} has shown the oxidizing properties and <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacies</b> of chlorine dioxide (ClO 2), however, its clinical efficacies on oral malodor have been evaluated only with organoleptic measurements (OM) or sulphide monitors. No clinical studies have investigated the inhibitory effects of ClO 2 on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) using gas chromatography (GC). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the inhibitory effects of a mouthwash containing ClO 2 on morning oral malodor using OM and GC. Methods A randomized, double blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among 15 healthy male volunteers, who were divided into 2 groups. In the first test phase, the group 1 subjects (N = 8) were instructed to rinse with the experimental mouthwash containing ClO 2, and those in group 2 (N = 7) to rinse with the placebo mouthwash without ClO 2. In the second test, phase after a one week washout period, each group used the opposite mouthwash. Oral malodor was evaluated before rinsing, right after rinsing and every 30 minutes up to 4 hours with OM, and concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), methyl mercaptan (CH 3 SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH 3) 2 S), the main VSCs of human oral malodor, were evaluated with GC. Results The baseline oral condition in the subjects in the 2 groups did not differ significantly. The mouthwash containing ClO 2 improved morning bad breath according to OM and reduced concentrations of H 2 S, CH 3 SH and (CH 3) 2 S according to GC up to 4 hours after rinsing. OM scores with ClO 2 were significantly lower than those without ClO 2 at all examination times. Significant reductions in the concentrations of the three kinds of VSCs measured by GC were also evident at all examination times. The concentrations of the three gases with ClO 2 were significantly lower than those without ClO 2 at most examination times. Conclusion In this explorative study, ClO 2 mouthwash was effective at reducing morning malodor for 4 hours when used by healthy subjects.

Of 209 patients eligible for per-protocol analysis of efficacy, favorable clinical responses were achieved in 76 of 108 (70 %) patients treated with cefepime and 75 of 101 (74 %) patients treated with imipenem-cilastatin. The 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the difference between these response rates (- 16 to 8 %) failed to exclude the predefined lower limit for noninferiority of - 15 %. In addition, therapy of pneumonia caused by an organism producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) failed in 4 of 13 patients in the cefepime group but in none of 10 patients in the imipenem group. However, the clinical efficacies of both treatments appeared to be similar in a secondary intent-to-treat analysis (95 % CI for difference, - 9 to 14 %) and a multivariate analysis (95 % CI for odds ratio, 0. 47 to 1. 75). Furthermore, the all-cause 30 -day mortality rates were 28 of 108 (26 %) patients in the cefepime group and 19 of 101 (19 %) patients in the imipenem group (P = 0. 25). Rates of documented or presumed microbiological eradication of the causative organism were similar with cefepime (61 %) and imipenem-cilastatin (54 %) (95 % CI, - 23 to 8 %). Primary or secondary resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in 19 % of the patients treated with cefepime and 44 % of the patients treated with imipenem-cilastatin (P = 0. 05). Adverse events were reported in 71 of 138 (51 %) and 62 of 141 (44 %) patients eligible for safety analysis in the cefepime and imipenem groups, respectively (P = 0. 23). Although the primary end point for this study does not exclude the possibility that cefepime was inferior to imipenem, some secondary analyses showed that the two regimens had comparable clinical and <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacies.</b> Cefepime appeared to be less active against organisms producing an ESBL, but primary and secondary resistance to imipenem was more common for P. aeruginosa.

40|$|Background: Serious infections {{caused by}} Gram-positive bacteria, {{particularly}} multi-drug resistant, {{are an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in patients admitted to intensive care units. Thus, new antibiotics covering these pathogens are urgently needed. Objective: To review characteristics of telavancin, a novel antibiotic intended to use for treating infections caused by difficult Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to meticillin or vancomycin, multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Methods: The studies on <b>microbiological</b> activity, clinical <b>efficacy</b> and safety of telavancin were reviewed. Results/conclusion: Telavancin is a lipoglycopeptide administered intravenously once-daily and excreted with urine. It proved to be microbiologically active against numerous Gram-positive pathogens including drug-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and pneumococci. Large randomized Phase II and III clinical trials on efficacy and safety of telavancin in treating complicated skin and skin structure infections reported telavancin to be non-inferior to standard treatment (mostly vancomycin). Preliminary data on telavancin in hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, documented that telavancin was efficacious for this indication. Overall incidence of adverse events was similar for telavancin and the comparator arms. Mild and transient disgeusia, nausea and vomiting resulted to be more frequent in telavancin group.

40|$|<b>Microbiological</b> <b>efficacy</b> of {{lomefloxacin}} {{and other}} drugs regarding microorganisms isolated from the human conjunctiva Purpose: To evaluate and compare the in vitro susceptibility of human conjunctival bacterial isolates to various antimicrobial agents, including lomefloxacin, other fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, and amicacin), and cephalosporin (cephalothin). Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility tests conducted {{over a period of}} 27 months with 613 bacterial isolates from the conjunctiva were retrospectively analyzed. Results: In relation to the total number of positive isolates, the fluoroquinolones showed greater in vitro effectiveness than the other analyzed antibiotics. All bacterial isolates showed significantly higher susceptibility to cipro-floxacin than to lomefloxacin. Conclusion: The fluoroquinolones are not only equally effective against all conjunctival bacterial isolates, but they also show superior antimicrobial activity in comparison to amino-glycosides and cephalothin. These results suggest that fluoroquinolones, such as lomefloxacin, can be beneficially prescribed for conjunctival infections and also as prophylaxis in ocular surgery.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} the <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacy</b> of a down-draught necropsy table ventilation system (which surrounds the cadaver with a "curtain" of air under continuous extraction) during post mortem procedures. METHODS [...] Air sampling {{was carried out}} both in the presence and absence of staff and cadaver and during a full post mortem procedure, with functioning and non-functioning table air extraction. The penetration of the air "curtain" was also examined during {{the use of an}} oscillating bone saw by means of a tracer organism, Bacillus subtilis var niger, painted on to the skull. RESULTS [...] There was little difference between bacterial counts obtained in the presence of staff only, staff plus cadaver, or during a post mortem examination. With all counts obtained, however, there was a two to three-fold reduction when the ventilation was in operation compared with when the extract duct was occluded. Using the tracer organism, a two to three log reduction in counts was shown when the "curtain" was in operation during the use of the oscillating bone saw. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that the system provides potential protection for post mortem room staff against airborne infections...|$|E
40|$|Exposure-response {{analyses}} were performed for the <b>microbiological</b> and clinical <b>efficacy</b> of tigecycline {{in the treatment of}} complicated skin and skin-structure infections, where Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci are the predominant pathogens. A prospective method was developed to create homogeneous patient populations for PK-PD analyses. Evaluable patients from three clinical trials were pooled for analysis. Patients received a tigecycline 100 -mg loading dose/ 50 mg every 12 h or a 50 -mg loading dose/ 25 mg every 12 h. At the test-of-cure visit, microbiologic and clinical responses were evaluated. Patients were prospectively evaluated and classified into cohorts based on baseline pathogens: S. aureus only (cohort 1), monomicrobial S. aureus or streptococci (cohort 2), two gram-positive pathogens (cohort 3), polymicrobial (cohort 4), or other monomicrobial infections (cohort 5). A prospective procedure for combining cohorts was used to increase the sample size. Logistic regression evaluated steady-state 24 -h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 24) /MIC ratio as a predictor of response, and classification and regression tree (CART) {{analyses were}} utilized to determine AUC/MIC breakpoints. Analysis began with pooled cohorts 2 and 3, the focus of these analyses, and included 35 patients with 40 S. aureus and/or streptococcal pathogens. CART analyses identified a significant AUC/MIC breakpoint of 17. 9 (P = 0. 0001 for microbiological response and P = 0. 0376 for clinical response). The continuous AUC/MIC ratio was predictive of microbiological response based on sample size (P = 0. 0563). Analysis of all pathogens combined decreased the ability to detect exposure-response relationships. The prospective approach of creating homogeneous populations based on S. aureus and streptococci pathogens was critical for identifying exposure-response relationships...|$|R
40|$|Background: Second {{generation}} cephalosporins (CFPs) {{are more}} active {{in the treatment of}} acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy but their cost is considerably higher than their predecessors. Cefuroxime, a second generation CFP with oral and parenteral presentations, might offer significant advantages and become a first choice antimicrobial in this setting. Aim: To compare the efficacy, safety and cost of cefuroxime and cephradine in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy. Patients and methods: Hospitalized women with 12 to 34 weeks of pregnancy, with clinical and bacteriological diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, were randomly assigned to receive cefuroxime (Curocef (r), GlaxoWellcome) 750 mg t. i. d, i. v or cephradine 1 g q. i. d., i. v. If the isolated organism was resistant to the assigned drug the patient was excluded. Once patients were afebrile, they were switched to an oral form of the same antimicrobial. They were discharged according to the clinical status and treated for a total of 14 days. Laboratory tests, including urine culture were requested during controls {{and at the end of}} follow-up at 28 days. Results: One hundred and one patients were randomized: 49 to receive cephradine and 52 to receive cefuroxime. Patients in the cefuroxime group had fewer febrile days (mean 1. 7 vs 2. 2, p< 0. 05), faster clinical recovery (mean 2. 7 vs 3. 1 days, p< 0. 05), a higher rate of bacteriological cure at 28 days (78. 8 % and 59. 2 %, p< 0. 05) and lower rate of failure (21. 2 % vs 40. 8 % p< 0. 05). The rate of resistance of isolated uropathogens was l 4 % to cephradine and 1 % to cefuroxime. Conclusions: Cefuroxime can be considered as a first choice option in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy due to its tolerance, <b>microbiological</b> activity and <b>efficacy.</b> (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 749 - 57) ...|$|R
40|$|Exposure-response {{analyses}} were performed to test the <b>microbiological</b> and clinical <b>efficacies</b> of tigecycline in complicated intra-abdominal infections where Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis are the predominant pathogens. Data from evaluable patients enrolled in three clinical trials were pooled. Patients received intravenous tigecycline (100 -mg loading dose followed by 50 mg every 12 h or 50 -mg loading dose followed by 25 mg every 12 h). At the test-of-cure visit, microbiological and clinical responses were evaluated. Patients were prospectively classified into cohorts based on infection with a baseline pathogen(s) : E. coli only (cohort 1), other mono- or polymicrobial Enterobacteriaceae (cohort 2), at least one Enterobacteriaceae pathogen plus an anaerobe(s) (cohort 3), at least one Enterobacteriaceae pathogen plus a gram-positive pathogen(s) (cohort 4), and all other pathogens (cohort 5). The cohorts were prospectively combined to increase sample size. Logistic regression {{was used to evaluate}} ratio of steady-state 24 -hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to MIC as a response predictor, and classification-and-regression-tree (CART) {{analyses were}} utilized to determine AUC/MIC breakpoints. Analysis began with cohorts 1, 2, and 3 pooled, which included 71 patients, with 106 pathogens. The small sample size precluded evaluation of cohorts 1 (34 patients, 35 E. coli pathogens) and 2 (16 patients, 24 Enterobacteriaceae). CART analyses identified a significant AUC/MIC breakpoint of 6. 96 for microbiological and clinical responses (P values of 0. 0004 and 0. 399, respectively). The continuous AUC/MIC ratio was also borderline predictive of microbiological response (P = 0. 0568). Cohort 4 (21 patients, 50 pathogens) was evaluated separately; however, an exposure-response relationship was not detected; cohort 5 (31 patients, 60 pathogens) was not evaluated.

40|$|The study {{outlined}} {{to estimate}} the clinical, laboratory and <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacy</b> of Dental Air Force home dental cleaning system of adult chronic periodontitis patients. Material and Method: 50 adult chronic periodontitis subjects were recruited volunteers for this study. Clinical (plaque index, gingival index and clinical attachment loss), Laboratory (C-reactive protein levels and Glycated Hemoglobin) and Microbiological parameters were measured prior to phase- 1 therapy; at 3 rd and 6 th month post phase 1 therapy. Comparative assessment was done among all the patients that {{were divided into two}} groups with student paired ‘t’ test and ANOVA. Results: The results of this study showed that there was significant decrease in clinical, laboratory and microbiological parameters from baseline to 6 months in both the groups (p< 0. 01). The subjects under groups using Dental Air Force home dental cleaning system showed a highly significant reduction to all the parameters as compared to subjects under groups using a toothbrush.

40|$|Use of only {{clinical}} criteria for enrolling patients {{in clinical trials}} leads to inclusion of many patients who have no pulmonary infection, which can make the evaluation of new treatment modalities difficult. Quantitative cultures of specimens obtained using bronchoscopic or nonbronchoscopic techniques, such as bronchoalveolar lavage and/or protected specimen brush, are much more specific and could improve identification of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Microscopic examination of distal respiratory secretions with use of Gram staining permits randomizing only patients with a high probability of ventilator-associated pneumonia and, thus, avoids the potential bias that can result from secondary exclusions. Invasive techniques also offer a sensitive and specific approach for identifying the responsible microorganisms, which is particularly im-portant when evaluating antimicrobial agents for which bactericidal activity can be highly variable from one pathogen to another. Follow-up evaluation of the infected site with use of the same techniques permits determination of the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic parameters of the new agents and their <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacy,</b> compared with current antibiotics.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{multicentre study}} of Italian children with acute pharyngotonsillitis {{was carried out}} to determine the incidence of beta-haemolytic streptococcal infection and its epidemiological characteristics and {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a recently marketed macrolide, miocamycin. From February 1988 to March 1989, 865 children (aged 5 months to 14 years) were enrolled in 11 paediatric departments. Of these 31. 9 % had a positive throat culture for beta-haemolytic streptococci (26. 6 % group A streptococci, 5. 3 % group B, C, D or F). In 68. 1 % of the patients the throat culture did not yield any pathogen and the disease was considered to be probably viral. No epidemiological (age, season of occurrence, sex) or clinical characteristics (fever, pharyngeal hyperaemia, exudate etc.) could differentiate children with streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis from those with a probably viral one. Breese's score correctly identified only 19. 1 % of the cases with group A streptococcal infection. Miocamycin was given 50 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 10 days in 225 children with streptococcal pharyngitis.

40|$|Background: Genital Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) {{infection}} {{may lead}} to pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, preterm labour, low birthweight, preterm rupture of membranes, increased perinatal mortality, postpartum endometritis, chlamydial conjunctivitis and C. trachomatis pneumonia. This review supersedes a previous review on this topic. Objectives: To establish the most efficacious and best-tolerated therapy for treatment of genital chlamydial infection in preventing maternal infection and adverse neonatal outcomes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group"s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials. gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (26 June 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) as well as studies published in abstract form assessing interventions for treating genital C. trachomatis infection in pregnancy. Cluster-RCTs were also eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi-randomised trials and trials using cross-over design {{are not eligible for}} inclusion in this review. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data using the agreed form. Data were checked for accuracy. Evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included 15 trials (involving 1754 women) although our meta-analyses were based on fewer numbers of studies/women. All of the included studies were undertaken in North America from 1982 to 2001. Two studies were low risk of bias in all domains, all other studies had varying risk of bias. Four other studies were excluded and one study is ongoing. Eight comparisons were included in this review; three compared antibiotic (erythromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin) versus placebo; five compared an antibiotic versus another antibiotic (erythromycin, clindamycin, amoxicillin, azithromycin). No study reported different antibiotic regimens. Microbiological cure (primary outcome) Antibiotics versus placebo: Erythromycin (average risk ratio (RR) 2. 64, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 60 to 4. 38; two trials, 495 women; I 2 = 68 %; moderate-certainty evidence), and clindamycin (RR 4. 08, 95 % CI 2. 35 to 7. 08; one trial, 85 women;low-certainty evidence) were associated with improved microbiological cure compared to a placebo control. In one very small trial comparing amoxicillin and placebo, the results were unclear, but the evidence was graded very low (RR 2. 00, 95 % CI 0. 59 to 6. 79; 15 women). One antibiotic versus another antibiotic: Amoxicillin made little or no difference in microbiological cure in comparison to erythromycin (RR 0. 97, 95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 01; four trials, 466 women; high-certainty evidence), probably no difference compared to clindamycin (RR 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 89 to 1. 04; one trial, 101 women; moderate-quality evidence), and evidence is very low certainty when compared to azithromycin so the effect is not certain (RR 0. 89, 95 % CI 0. 71 to 1. 12; two trials, 144 women; very low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus erythromycin (average RR 1. 11, 95 % CI 1. 00 to 1. 23; six trials, 374 women; I 2 = 53 %; moderate-certainty evidence) probably have similar efficacy though results appear to favour azithromycin. Clindamycin versus erythromycin (RR 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 1. 15; two trials, 173 women; low-certainty evidence) may have similar numbers of women with a microbiological cure between groups. Evidence was downgraded for design limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision in effect estimates. Side effects of the treatment (maternal) (secondary outcome) Antibiotics versus placebo: side effects including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, were reported in two studies (495 women) but there was no clear evidence whether erythromycin was associated with more side effects than placebo and a high level of heterogeneity (I 2 = 78 %) was observed (average RR 2. 93, 95 % CI 0. 36 to 23. 76). There was no clear difference in the number of women experiencing side effects when clindamycin was compared to placebo in one small study (5 / 41 versus 1 / 44) (RR 6. 35, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 107. 45, 62 women). The side effects reported were mostly gastrointestinal and also included resolving skin rashes. One antibiotic versus another antibiotic: There was no clear difference in incidence of side effects (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain) when amoxicillin was compared to azithromycin based on data from one small study (36 women) (RR 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 24 to 1. 31). However, amoxicillin was associated with fewer side effects compared to erythromycin with data from four trials (513 women) (RR 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 21 to 0. 46; I 2 = 27 %). Side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, rash, and allergic reaction. Both azithromycin (RR 0. 24, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 34; six trials, 374 women) and clindamycin (RR 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 22 to 0. 87; two trials, 183 women) were associated with a lower incidence of side effects compared to erythromycin. These side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramping. One small study (101 women) reported there was no clear difference in the number of women with side effects when amoxicillin was compared with clindamycin (RR 0. 57, 95 % CI 0. 14 to 2. 26; 107 women). The side effects reported included rash and gastrointestinal complaints. Other secondary outcomes Single trials reported data on repeated infections, preterm birth, preterm rupture of membranes, perinatal mortality and low birthweight and found no clear differences between treatments. Many of this review's secondary outcomes were not reported in the included studies. Authors' conclusions: Treatment with antibacterial agents achieves microbiological cure from C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy. There was no apparent difference between assessed agents (amoxicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, azithromycin) in terms of <b>efficacy</b> (<b>microbiological</b> cure and repeat infection) and pregnancy complications (preterm birth, preterm rupture of membranes, low birthweight). Azithromycin and clindamycin appear to result in fewer side effects than erythromycin. All of the studies in this review were conducted in North America, which may limit the generalisability of the results. In addition, study populations may differ in low-resource settings and these results are therefore only applicable to well-resourced settings. Furthermore, the trials in this review mainly took place in the nineties and early 2000 's and antibiotic resistance may have changed since then. Further well-designed studies, with appropriate sample sizes and set in a variety of settings, are required to further evaluate interventions for treating C. trachomatis infection in pregnancy and determine which agents achieve the best microbiological cure with the least side effects. Such studies could report on the outcomes listed in this review...|$|R
40|$|Optimizing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic {{indices of}} {{antibiotics}} to obtain clinical and <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacy</b> is essential, but dosing regimens {{must also be}} tailored {{to minimize the risk}} for emergence of resistance. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether certain concentrations of benzylpenicillin are critical for the selection of resistant subpopulations. A mixed culture of Streptococcus pneumoniae containing ca. 90 % susceptible (MIC = 0. 031 mg/liter), 9 % intermediate (MIC = 0. 25 mg/liter), and 1 % resistant (MIC = 8 mg/liter) was studied in an in vitro kinetic model. The time that concentrations exceeded the MIC (T>MIC) for the three strains in the culture was varied by different initial concentrations of benzylpenicillin. Samples for viable counts were withdrawn at different times during 24 h and seeded on blood agar plates and on selective antibiotic-containing plates. The T>MIC varied from 46 to 100 % for the susceptible strain, from 6 to 100 % for the intermediate strain, and from 0 to 48 % for the resistant strain. Our study, which may mimic the clinical situation with carriage of a mixed population of S. pneumoniae with different antibiotic susceptibilities, has shown that selection of resistant bacteria may easily occur if dosing regimens are only targeted toward fully susceptible strains...|$|E
40|$|Background. Bedaquiline {{is a new}} {{antibiotic}} {{that was}} approved {{for the treatment of}} multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis. We aimed to evaluate the short-term <b>microbiological</b> <b>efficacy</b> and the tolerability profile of bedaquiline. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with MDR tuberculosis receiving bedaquiline for compassionate use between January 2010 and July 2013 and evaluated at 6 months of bedaquiline treatment. Results. A total of 35 patients with MDR tuberculosis were included in the study. Nineteen (54 %) had extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, and 14 (40 %) had isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones (Fqs) or second-line inject-ables. Bedaquiline was associated with a median of 4 (range, 2 – 5) other drugs, including linezolid in 33 (94 %) cases. At 6 months of bedaquiline treatment, culture conversion was achieved in 28 of 29 (97 %) cases with culture-positive pulmo-nary tuberculosis at bedaquiline initiation.
