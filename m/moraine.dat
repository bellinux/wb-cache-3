5|$|The {{first and}} largest glacier was the Sherwin or Pre-Tahoe glacier, which eroded the upper Merced {{watershed}} {{to an extent}} close to its present form. Three stages followed during the Wisconsinian glaciation; these were the Tahoe, Tenaya and Tioga stages, of which the Tioga was the smallest. The Tioga glacier left {{at the mouth of}} Yosemite Valley a rocky <b>moraine.</b> This <b>moraine</b> was actually one of several moraines deposited by the four glaciations, which include Medial <b>Moraine</b> and Bridalveil <b>Moraine.</b> After the Tioga Glacier retreated this <b>moraine</b> formed a lake that flooded nearly the entire valley. Gradual sedimentation filled Lake Yosemite, creating a broad and flat valley floor. Sediments of glacial origin continued to travel down the Merced River following then, helping to form the flat floor of the Central Valley.|$|E

5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a <b>moraine</b> consisting of clay, sand, and gravel that initially formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E
5|$|Suillus bovinus {{is found}} in conifer woods and {{plantations}} across Europe, including subalpine regions in the Alps, up to altitudes of 800m (2500ft). It is common in Lithuania, where it associates with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), the only naturally occurring pine in that country. Preferred soils of S.bovinus are often acidic, sand-based, or sometimes calcareous (chalky) and <b>moraine.</b> In Asia, it has been recorded in Taiwan, and in Japan, where it associates with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora). In China, it has been recorded from provinces Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang.|$|E

50|$|During {{the last}} ice age, glaciers filled the canyons leading to Long Valley, but the valley floor was clear of ice. Excellent {{examples}} of terminal <b>moraines</b> {{can be seen at}} Long Valley: these <b>moraines</b> are the debris left from glacial sculpting.

50|$|The landform {{occurs in}} {{groups that are}} often closely and {{regularly}} spaced. They consist of glacial drift, with till being the most common constituent. The individual <b>moraines</b> are large, wavy ridges orientated transverse to ice flow. Drumlins are often found in close proximity of Rogen <b>moraines,</b> and are often interpreted to be formed {{at the same time}} as the Rogen <b>moraines.</b> Although Rogen <b>moraines</b> can span a large range of sizes, the most common distribution seems to be 10-30 metres high, 150-300 metres wide and 300-1,200 metres long.|$|R
5|$|Mount Elbert {{is part of}} the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which {{separated}} from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral <b>moraine.</b> Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam.|$|E
5|$|Tenaya, Yosemite, Bridalveil and Pigeon Creeks {{join the}} Merced before it {{breaches}} the glacial <b>moraine</b> at the valley's end. From there the river picks up Cascade Creek and turns south near El Portal, flowing through Merced River Canyon. State Route 140 follows the river {{out of the}} west entrance to the national park, a few miles before the South Fork Merced River, the largest tributary, joins from the left. The river arcs northwest to receive the North Fork, and a few miles after it enters Lake McClure, formed by New Exchequer Dam. Below New Exchequer, the river flows west through a heavily irrigated region of the Central Valley, passing through McSwain and Crocker-Huffman Dams and the cities of Hopeton, Delhi and Livingston. It joins the San Joaquin River at Hills Ferry, a few miles south of Turlock.|$|E
5|$|The {{advancing}} and retreating {{characteristics of}} the glaciers in the Glacier Bay are explained in simple terms as a steady state of snow getting converted into ice on the hills. Ice, as a lens {{of water on the}} base of bedrock, slides by gravity downwards. The good <b>moraine</b> of rock and rubble insulates it from water erosion. As a result, during freezing temperatures that exists all the year, the glacier advances. When the insulation and erosion effect of the hills gets reduced erosion sets in and along with rising temperatures the glaciers start retreating. Another unpredictable phenomenon that is observed in many glaciers in the Glacier Bay is that of calving. Calving is a process in which blocks of ice get detached or break off from the glacier, irrespective of weather conditions, all the year round, and crash into the sea with thundering noise creating a boiling like turbulence.|$|E
50|$|Lateral <b>moraines</b> are {{parallel}} ridges of debris deposited {{along the sides}} of a glacier. The unconsolidated debris can be deposited on top of the glacier by frost shattering of the valley walls and/or from tributary streams flowing into the valley. The till is carried along the glacial margin until the glacier melts. Because lateral <b>moraines</b> are deposited on top of the glacier, they do not experience the postglacial erosion of the valley floor and therefore, as the glacier melts, lateral <b>moraines</b> are usually preserved as high ridges.Lateral <b>moraines</b> stand high because they protect the ice under them from the elements, causing it to melt or sublime less than the uncovered parts of the glacier. Multiple lateral <b>moraines</b> may develop as the glacier advances and retreats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Moraines</b> and eskers: Glacial {{activity}} may leave ridges {{in the form}} of <b>moraines</b> and eskers. An arête is a thin ridge of rock that is formed by glacial erosion.|$|R
50|$|Large {{amounts of}} rock debris are carried on, in, {{and beneath the}} ice as the glaciers move downslope. Lateral <b>moraines</b> are created as debris accumulates as low ridges of till that ride {{along the edge of}} the moving glaciers. When lateral <b>moraines</b> {{adjacent}} to each other join, they create medial <b>moraines,</b> which are also carried down on the surface of the moving ice.|$|R
5|$|The main {{settlement}} {{on the island}} today is Biggings, which overlooks Housa Voe and is surrounded by in-bye land {{to the east of}} the hill dyke (which runs south from West Voe). To the west the island is bisected by a belt of glacial <b>moraine</b> about one and a half kilometres in length. Much {{of the rest of the}} area consists of a shallow stony soil that may be derived from glacial till. There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile. The lack of peat led to 'turf scalping' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior.|$|E
5|$|From September 1939 a more easterly Main Defence Line (MDL) was constructed. This second main {{defensive}} position had {{a northern}} part {{formed by the}} Grebbelinie (Grebbe line), located at {{the foothills of the}} Utrechtse Heuvelrug, an Ice Age <b>moraine</b> between Lake IJssel and the Lower Rhine. It was dug on instigation of the commander of the Field Army Lieutenant-General Jan Joseph Godfried baron van Voorst tot Voorst. This line was extended by a southern part: the Peel-Raamstelling (Peel-Raam Position), located between the river Maas and the Belgian border along the Peel Marshes and the Raam rivulet, as ordered by the Dutch Commander in Chief, General Izaak H. Reijnders. In the south the intention was to delay the Germans as much as possible to cover a French advance. Fourth and Second Army Corps were positioned at the Grebbe Line; Third Army Corps were stationed at the Peel-Raam Position with the Light Division behind it to cover its southern flank. Brigade A and B were positioned between the Lower Rhine and the Maas. First Army Corps was a strategic reserve in the Fortress Holland, the southern perimeter of which was manned by another ten battalions and the eastern by six battalions. All these lines were reinforced by pillboxes.|$|E
5|$|During the Tauca phase, {{water levels}} in Laguna Miscanti {{were higher than}} today; shorelines formed from an event in Ch'iyar Quta lake; saline lakes formed in the Lipez area, and water levels rose in the Guayatayoc-Salinas Grandes basin and lakes at Uturuncu and Lazufre. Some Atacama Altiplano lake levels {{increased}} by , and evidence exists at the Quebrada Mani archeological site for a higher water supply 16,400–13,700 years ago. During the Tauca, greater flow occurred in rivers in the Atacama region; more precipitation fell in the Rio Salado valley; the excavation of the Colca Canyon may have been aided by an increased water supply, and glaciers advanced in the Cordillera de Cochabamba. A <b>moraine</b> formed at Hualca Hualca; the Choqueyapu II glacier in the Eastern Cordillera advanced; moraines formed from glacial advances in Argentina (including the Sierra de Santa Victoria); basal sliding glaciers formed at Sajama; landslide activity in northwestern Argentina decreased; the climate grew wetter over the southern Amazon; flooding in the Río Paraguay-Parana basin and precipitation and forest cover in Pampa del Tamarugal increased; erosion occurred along the Pilcomayo, {{and an increase in}} Pacific plankton was probably linked to increased runoff (and an increased nutrient supply) from the Andes. A glacial advance in central Chile around 15,000 years ago, also associated with increased precipitation and the Lake Tauca period, was probably triggered by tropical circulation changes.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the formation and significance of <b>moraines</b> produced c. 11, 000 - 10, 000 yrs. B. P. by the glaciers of the Loch Lomond Advance. The <b>moraines</b> have a variety of forms but they have previously been divided into two groups; fluted and hummocky <b>moraines.</b> Fluted <b>moraines</b> have been shown by previous work to be subglacial landforms produced by active ice whereas the majority of hummocky <b>moraines</b> have been attributed to deposition from the surface of stagnant ice. The methods employed include field mapping and morphological interpretation but the most important data are derived from measuring the particle-size distribution, rock-type composition and other characteristics of the till. Groups of samples are taken from several groups of fluted <b>moraines.</b> Changes in the properties of the till at different parts of the ridge, between members of a group of ridges, and between ridges and underlying or adjacent till are discussed. The features studied have a variety of sizes but they are generally on a scale that has rarely been described in previous literature, being intermediate between large-scale and small-scale features. Associations between fluted <b>moraines</b> and hummocky <b>moraines</b> in the field area raised the suspicion that some of the latter may have been formed subglacially. Detailed sampling revealed that all the hummocky <b>moraines</b> studied contain a large proportion of material that was picked up from the valley floors and carried only a short distance during the Loch Lomond Advance. These findings together with other evidence lead to the firm conclusion that the hummocky <b>moraines</b> studied were produced by active ice. This conclusion is accompanied by discussion of the mechanisms by and conditions under which the <b>moraines</b> could have been formed and could have survived. It is suggested that the material was, at least in part, pushed up by the advancing ice front and subsequently passed over by the ice which reworked it to varying degrees. Acknowledgment...|$|R

Subsequently, the deglaciation was characterized by the ef-fects of great glaciofluvial activity. Along the border between Finland and Norway, W of the Reisa valley, the meltwater drainage was ice-directed eastwards more or less transversely to the northerly directed ice movements.
