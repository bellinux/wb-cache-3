40|$|In {{previous}} studies {{we have shown}} down-regulation of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in {{a significant proportion of}} primary cervical carcinomas, which was found to be strongly correlated with loss of expression of the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). By contrast, class II MHC expression was frequently up-regulated on neoplastic keratinocytes in these malignancies. In order to investigate whether these changes are associated with biological behaviour of the tumours, 20 cervical carcinomas were analyzed for MHC (HLA-A, HLA-B/C, HLA-DR) and TAP- 1 expression in the primary tumours and in lymph node metastases by immunohistochemistry. The results showed {{a significant increase in the}} prevalence of HLA-A and HLA-B/C down-regulation in <b>metastasised</b> neoplastic <b>cells</b> as compared with the primary tumour (P = 0. 01). In all cases this was accompanied by loss of TAP- 1 expression. Up-regulated HLA-DR expression was found exclusively in primary tumours and was absent in the corresponding metastases (P = 0. 002). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that loss of TAP- 1 and the consequent down-regulation of class I MHC expression provides a selective advantage for neoplastic cervical cells during metastasis. Furthermore, the lack of class II MHC expression in <b>metastasised</b> <b>cells</b> either reflects a different local lymphokine production or indicates that these cells may have escaped CD 4 + cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) -mediated killing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMetastasis of diseased {{cells is}} the basic event leading to death in {{individuals}} with cancer. Establishment of metastasis requires that tumour cells migrate {{from the site of}} the primary tumour into the circulation system, escape from the vasculature and form secondary tumours at novel sites. These processes depend to a large degree on cytoskeletal remodeling. We show here that multiple copies of the short actin-binding module CLIK 23 from human or Caenorhabditis elegans calponin proteins effectively inhibit cell motility on two dimensional matrices and suppress soft agar colony formation of metastatic melanoma and adenocarcinoma cells of murine and human origin. Ectopic expression of CLIK 23 modules for 30 days results in the formation of multinucleated cells. The repeat displays true modular behaviour, resulting in increased cytoskeletal effects in direct correlation with the increase in number of modules. Our results demonstrate that the role of calponin in the signature profile of <b>metastasising</b> <b>cells</b> is that of a mechanical stabiliser of the actin cytoskeleton, which interferes with actin turnover by binding at a unique interface along the actin filament...|$|R

40|$|Metastases are {{the main}} cause of death for {{patients}} with colorectal cancer and the liver is the primary host organ. However, macrometastases constitute the final step of a complicated and poorly-defined multistage process, named invasion- metastasis cascade. Before they <b>metastasise,</b> malignant <b>cells</b> undergo partial or complete transformation and acquire new properties. They present intensive growth, provoke neoangiogenesis, invade the surrounding extracellular matrix, detach from their primary site and intravasate. Some succeed in surviving in the systemic circulation, adhere to hepatic sinusoids and extravasate. Eventually, by evading the hepatic immune system, few cancer cells colonise the liver and form metastases. While a vast number of cells leave the primary tumour and intravasate, only a small minority reaches the liver blood network. Thus, the possibility of metastases formation is very low. The entrapment of colorectal cancer cells in the sinusoids and their interactions with the resident cells are considered very important initial steps in the liver invasion. Sinusoidal endothelial cells, pit cells, stellate cells and Kupffer cells all mediate the metastatic process in complex ways, through a variety of biological compounds and intercellular actions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepatic natural killer (NK) cells, {{the most}} {{cytotoxic}} {{cells of the}} natural occurring NK cells, {{are located in the}} liver sinusoids and are thus in a strategic position to kill arriving <b>metastasising</b> tumour <b>cells,</b> like colon carcinoma cells. It is known that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I on tumour cells negatively regulates NK cell-mediated cytolysis, but this is found using blood- or spleen-derived NK cells. Therefore, using isolated rat hepatic NK cells and the syngeneic colon carcinoma cell line CC 531 s, we investigated whether this protective role of MHC class I is also operative in hepatic NK cells, and addressed the mechanism of MHC class I protection. RESULTS: When MHC class I on CC 531 s cells was masked by preincubation with monoclonal antibody OX 18, hepatic NK cell-mediated cytolysis (51 Cr release) as well as apoptosis (DNA fragmentation, nucleus condensation and fragmentation) increased. When hepatic NK cells were preincubated with the granzyme inhibitor 3, 4 -dichloroisocoumarin, or when extracellular Ca 2 + was chelated by ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N, N-tetraacetic acid, the enhanced cytolysis and apoptosis were completely inhibited. The involvement of the perforin/granzyme pathway was confirmed by showing that the enhanced cytolysis was caspase-independent. CONCLUSIONS: MHC class I expression protects CC 531 s colon carcinoma cells from hepatic NK cell-mediated apoptosis and cytolysis, by blocking the perforin/granzyme pathway.

METHODS [...] In a pilot study original histological sections of mediastinal lymph node metastases from NSCLC obtained by lymph node dissection (n = 82) or by mediastinoscopy (n = 62) were examined and classified independently by three pathologists as extranodal, intranodal, or indefinite. After clear criteria for these growth patterns had been defined sections were re-examined and recategorised one year later. Interobserver agreement was examined for both investigations. RESULTS [...] In the dissected lymph nodes the kappa value improved significantly from 0. 52 (moderate agreement) at the first investigation to 0. 72 (good agreement) at the second. In the mediastinoscopic lymph node biopsy specimens an increase in kappa value from 0. 50 at the first to 0. 67 at the second examination was found, although this improvement was not significant. In mediastinoscopic biopsy specimens a very high proportion of tissue samples showed indefinite tumour extension.

Fluorescently labelled Neuroblastoma cell lines were cultivated under atmospheric (‘normoxic’) or hypoxic conditions for 3 days before implantation upon the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryos and observed in-vivo for tumour formation and metastasis.

40|$|Cancer {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{disorders}} with increasing rates of morbidity and mortality. Recent drug discovery of anti cancer drug has identified several molecular targets and tried to achieve a goal of therapeutic effecative and safe molecule. Amongst these, system xc- antiporter is a novel promising target to control cancer progression. This antiporter is found to be over expressed in majority of cancer cells and functions by transporting amino acids, cystine and glutamate, in opposite directions. System xc- antiporter uptakes one molecule of cystine with the release of one molecule of glutamate in extracellular space. As already known cystine is precursor for the synthesis of glutathione, an in vivo antioxidant which is utilized by cancer cells to combat oxidative stress. At the other side the released glutamate (an excitatory neurotransmitter), when released in higher concentration, may over excite neurones (specifically and brain tumour) causing <b>cell</b> death to <b>metastasise</b> cancer <b>cells.</b> Therefore, through inhibition of system xc- antiporter, it is possible to kill cancer cells by disturbing their redox status along with through prevention of excitotoxcity by glutamate. In context to this, several researches have reported diverse molecules having system xc- antiporter inhibition potential. Amongst these molecules, erastin and its analogues are most potent system xc- antiporter inhibitors but it lacks preclinical data. Moreover, sulfasalazine, a FDA approved drug also showed good inhibition potential against this antiporter and therefore in our study we have attempted to construct pharmacophore model using this series to aid in the discovery of potent inhibitors with desirable safety. Results of this study exhibited successful development of pharmacophore model with phase survival score. Additionally, fit scores of sulfasalazine analogues were also in acceptable range. Hence, the developed pharmacophore model may be used for design of potent System xc- antiporter inhibitors...|$|R

The latter data were compared between six <b>metastasised</b> tongue squamous <b>cell</b> carcinomas, vs. four non-metastasised. In comparison to the standard immunohistochemical protocol with anti-CD 34 antibodies, CARD amplification resulted in both more intensely stained and larger numbers of vessels.

The percentage vessels with diameter < 5 μm was significantly higher in the non-metastasised tongue carcinomas (p = 0. 02).

40|$|AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of energy homeostasis in cells. It has been implicated as a therapeutic target for various metabolic diseases like type II diabetes and obesity. However, its role in cancer is context-dependent and therefore warrants further studies to explore its possible use as a therapeutic target. AMPK can either promote or retard the growth of cancer cells depending on other cues and stresses in the milieu of the cancer cells. This study aims to understand AMPK signalling in response to extracellular cues of matrix deprivation and matrix stiffness that are important determinants of metastasis. 1) Calcium-Oxidant Signalling Network Regulates AMPK Activation upon Matrix Deprivation. Recent work from our lab, as well as others, has identified a novel role for the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase in epithelial cancer cell survival under matrix deprivation. However, the molecular mechanisms that activate AMPK upon matrix-detachment remain unexplored. In this study, we show that AMPK activation is a rapid and sustained phenomenon upon matrix deprivation, while re-attachment to the matrix leads to its dephosphorylating and inactivation. Since matrix-detachment leads to loss of integrin signalling, we investigate whether integrin signalling negatively regulates AMPK activation. However, modulation of FAK or Src, the major downstream components of integrin signalling, fails to cause a corresponding change in AMPK signalling. Further investigations reveal that the upstream AMPK kinases, LKB 1 and CaMKKβ, contribute to AMPK activation upon detachment. Additionally, we show LKB 1 phosphorylation and cytosolic translocation upon matrix deprivation, which might also contribute to AMPK activation. In LKB 1 -deficient cells, we find AMPK activation to be predominantly dependent on Caskβ. We observe no change in ATP levels under detached conditions at early time points suggesting that rapid AMPK activation upon detachment is not triggered by energy stress. We demonstrate that matrix deprivation leads to a spike in intracellular calcium as well as oxidant signalling and both these intracellular messengers contribute to rapid AMPK activation upon detachment. We further show that ER calcium release induced store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) contributes to intracellular calcium increase, leading to ROS production, and AMPK activation. We additionally show that the LKB 1 /CaMKK-AMPK axis and intracellular calcium levels {{play a critical role}} in anchorage-independent cancer sphere formation. We find a significant increase in LKB 1 as well as pACC levels in breast tumour tissues in comparison to normal tissues. Further, we observe a significant correlation between LKB 1 and pACC levels in breast tumour tissues suggesting that LKB 1 -AMPK signaling pathway is active in vivo in breast cancers. Thus, the Ca 2 +/ROS triggered LKB 1 /CaMKK-AMPK signalling cascade may provide a quick, adaptable switch to promote survival of <b>metastasising</b> cancer <b>cells.</b> 2) Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Regulates Stemless through AMPK. Cancer cells experience changes in extracellular matrix stiffness during cancer progression. However, the signalling pathways utilised in sensing matrix stiffness are poorly understood. In this study, we identify AMPK pathway as a possible mechanosensory pathway in response to matrix stiffness. AMPK activity, as measured by downstream target phosphorylation, is found to be higher in soft matrix conditions. We additionally show that compared to stiff matrices, soft matrices increase stemless properties, as evidenced by the increased expression of stemless markers, which is dependent on AMPK activity. Thus, we elucidate a novel mechanotransduction pathway triggered by matrix stiffness that contributes to stemness of cancer cells by regulating AMPK activity. Taken together, our study identifies a novel calcium-oxidant signaling network in the rapid modulation of AMPK signaling in the context of matrix detachment. This pathway is especially relevant in the context of <b>metastasising</b> cancer <b>cells</b> that may not face energy stress in the blood stream but are matrix-deprived. Inhibition of AMPK might compromise the viability of these circulating cells thereby reducing the metastatic spread of cancer. Our study further suggests that varying stiffnesses experienced by cancer cells can modulate AMPK activity and this, in turn, regulates stem-like properties. Thus our study provides novel insights into various extracellular cues that regulate this kinase and contribute to cell survival and metastasis. This knowledge can be utilised in the stage-specific use of AMPK inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer patients...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} day Stem Cells are {{increasingly}} becoming popularized as the potential “ultimate” cure for the most challenging maladies… the “Daddy of medical intervention”. Forefront SC research on human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) and other sub-disciplines, is quickly revolutionizing healthcare towards “Regenerative Medicine”, as beautifully exemplified by the use of iPSCs in treating and possibly curing osteoarthritis, discussed {{at the end of this}} publication. This review documents and reflects on the most topical discoveries in SC research, and the challenges researchers in this field nowadays face. Major Findings: 1) In 2006 Yamanaka et al. generated the first iPSCs from mouse fibroblasts, using retroviral transmission of c-Myc, Oct 3 / 4, Klf 4 and SOX 2 transcription factors. Later, they successfully generated iPSCs from human fibroblasts (2007). 2) Contemporary cultivation methods carry high risks of iPSC genome disruption, possibly leading to tumorigenesis, teratoma formation and reducing iPSC induction efficacy. 3) Many studies on preserving genome integrity and decreasing malignancy in iPSCs, suggest using valiproic acid and protecting tumour suppressor genes. 4) In many malignant tumours only a small minority of cells, called Cancer Stem <b>Cells,</b> <b>metastasise</b> and hyper-proliferate. 5) Not all mature cell sources yield the same [undifferentiated iPSCs: lineage-committed] ratio as others. Feb 2014 : Obokata et al. claimed to have generated iPSCs by exposing mature cells to a 25 min, pH 5. 7 bath. These iPSCs were termed “Stimulus-triggered Acquisition Pluripotency Cells” (STAP). However by July 2014 this study had been revoked, as the results could not be replicated. Conclusion: Stem cells have enormous potential to offer, especially iPSCs. Although currently not a viable treatment option on their own, for many daunting diseases they will definitely be at the core of multi-disciplined therapies within the near-future, including multi-factorial diseases like osteoarthritis. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the most common cancer killer worldwide. One of the major reasons for failing to cure this {{malignancy}} is the high rate of metastasis. Hence, understanding the mechanisms by which these <b>cells</b> <b>metastasise</b> is required to improve patients’ survival. Using the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A 549 we optimised a 3 D Invasion assay to enable a robotised high-throughput siRNA screen of large gene libraries. Despite thorough optimisation a pilot screen for the Phosphatome highlighted multiple issues with our set-up. Further optimisation work was conducted to improve the resolving power of the assay. However, as no clear explanation for the poor reproducibility could be uncovered, work began on a potential modulator of cell motility identified during a previous motility screen of the kinome. Microtubule affinity regulating kinases 4 (MARK 4) is one of four members of the MARK family. A previously performed kinome siRNA screen for modulators of cell migration revealed that depletion of MARK 4 reduced A 549 cell migration. We validated this observation and additionally found that MARK 4 silencing inhibited cell invasion through 3 D collagen matrices. MARK 4 depletion markedly changed cell structure, as exemplified by an increase tubulin network area. Follow-on experiments revealed an altered speed of microtubule polymerisation in MARK 4 -silenced cells. We observed that MARK 4 downregulation promoted resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents Paciltaxel and Cisplatin, an effect potentially linked to a reduced proliferation in MARK 4 -silenced cells. MARK 4 overexpression in NSCLC cells increased cell motility but did not impact the cell area or resistance to chemotherapy. A targeted siRNA cell motility screen of a selection of proposed MARK 4 interacting proteins enabled us to connect MARK 4 with Protein Phosphatase 2 A and GSK 3. Although further investigation is required into the signalling pathways upstream and downstream of MARK 4, this work identified novel functions for this kinase and highlighted potential mechanisms underlying its effects.

40|$|Through {{genetic and}} {{epigenetic}} instabilities and phenotypic drift tumour cells alter their expression of surface molecules. Amongst other factors, these changes can give tumour cells {{the ability to}} escape from the primary tumour and invade and proliferate at other tissue sites to form metastases. Metastasis formation is directly connected with a poor clinical outcome for cancer patients. By characterising metastasis-associated cell surface molecules and understanding how they facilitate tumour progression one could perhaps later develop therapeutic approaches to inhibit their action. In this thesis I have used subtractive immunisation to immunologically select differences in expression of surface molecules between rat non-metastatic and metastatic tumours. Using cell lines derived from the BSp 73 rat pancreatic tumour system four monoclonal antibodies were obtained by subtractive immunisation. The antibodies recognise a group of proteins termed the 10 - 1 antigen which are dramatically up-regulated on the <b>metastasising</b> 10 AS <b>cell</b> line. I have characterised the properties of the 10 - 1 antigen and amongst other things demonstrate that it is actively secreted from the 10 AS cell line in response to changes in growth conditions. This secretion partly explains the observation that the 10 - 1 antibodies did not inhibit tumour growth and metastasis in spontaneous metastasis assays. The 10 - 1 antigen is also expressed on a number of other rat tumour cell lines. Purification and microsequencing of the N-terminus of the 10 - 1 antigen, revealed an amino acid sequence that shares its identity with #alpha#-casein proteins found in goat, sheep and bovine species. These data suggest that the protein(s) bearing the 10 - 1 antigen could be a new rat #alpha#-casein protein or casein-like protein. Altered expression of these proteins in rat pancreatic tumour progression and their presence in other neoplasims may be connected to the development of enhanced tumour cell invasion. (orig.)
