5000|$|The OP {{overlooked}} {{part of the}} Fulda Gap {{from atop}} a 411-metre hill, lying in the centre of that section of the NATO defence line. The [...] "Fulda Gap" [...] was considered a strategic location by NATO for a Warsaw Pact invasion as it allowed the easiest access to Soviet tanks to the area around Frankfurt {{and then to the}} Rhine. The name OP Alpha dates to its being the first such point; geography also allowed monitoring Communist radio traffic. The use of the AN/PPS-5 ground surveillance radar set in the observation tower allowed 24-hour <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> on the roads leading into Geisa (tanks could be detected as far away as 10 kilometres). At the first sign of an invasion the OP Alpha crew would have withdrawn, as the actual planned battlefields to meet a Warsaw Pact invasion lay a couple of kilometres to the west. The OP also served as a place to show the Inner German Border to visiting dignitaries, both from the U.S. and from Germany. Several American cabinet members, including in 1978 Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance made it a stop on their itineraries when in Germany. Under normal circumstances, approximately 40 soldiers were stationed for four to six weeks at OP Alpha. A typical manning of a border OP was one platoon of armored cavalry, with up to 10 armored vehicles. In crisis situations the garrison strength rose to 200 men.|$|E

40|$|Two of {{the main}} aspects that broiler farmers use during daily visual {{checking}} {{of the performance of}} the flock are the activity and distribution patterns that chickens show during their farm visit. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies allow to monitor such flock behaviour indicators in a continuous and automated way in the house and this 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The aim {{of this study is to}} show how the <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and distribution of the flock can be used to check the welfare status of the flock. In a commercial broiler house we used four top view cameras to generate a visualization of the floor area.

The <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and distribution indexes through successive light periods for different cycles was linked to the welfare quality assessment scores by human experts, showing that the activity and distribution relate to broiler welfare scores. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{explicit}} time representation in workflow environments has been recently identified. Although {{the concept of}} time is an intrinsic part of a workflow application, time management has been treated as an issue of ordering the constructs of the workflow specification. This traditional approach aids mainly in the <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> deadlines. There is limited support for modelling and representation of time constraints associated with the processes and their activities or cases. This paper presents a temporal formalism for representing indeterminacy to workflow specifications. We further argue that integrating workflows with temporal databases can further enhance the workflow specification. Finally we utilise agents {{as part of a}} temporal workflow environment. Particular attention is paid in the allocation of agents to workflow activities with reference to the properties of conflict resolution and moving hierarchies...|$|E
40|$|Today {{the risk}} factors related to the use of Video Display Terminals (VDT) are {{assessed}} by investigating the actual activities at the VDT through subjective questionnaires and/or quantitative measurements. Questionnaire outcomes are quite imprecise and seldom objective. Quantitative measurements (EMG recordings, electrogoniometers, motion analysis systems) mostly prevent subjects from moving freely while working at the VDT. The paper presents an automatic tool for the <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> at VDTs, using a quantitative, objective approach. The suitability of the proposed tool was fully tested in the laboratory, both in terms of functionalities, accuracy of the tool, and acceptance by the subjects involved. The outcomes show that the tool allows for a detailed analysis of VDT activities and may be used to improve VDT-related risk analysis with high accuracy and good acceptance by workers.

40|$|A recent {{model of}} Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) habitat erred in {{arbitrarily}} creating buffers around radio locations collected during daylight {{hours on the}} assumption that study animals were only at rest during these times. The buffers generated by this method likely cause an overestimation of the amounts and kinds of habitats that are used by the panther. This, and other errors, could lead to the impression that unfragmented forest cover is unimportant to panther conservation, and could encourage inaccurate characterizations of panther habitat. Previous 24 -hour <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and activity readings made during routine telemetry flights indicate that high levels of activity occur in the early morning hours. Literature on the behavior of the species does not support the creation of large buffers around telemetry locations to compensate for the lack of nighttime telemetry data.

40|$|International audienceAs elderly care {{is getting}} more and more important, <b>monitoring</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of daily living (ADL) has become an active {{research}} topic. Both robotic and pervasive computing domains, through smart homes, are creating opportunities to move forward in ADL field. Multiple techniques were proposed to identify activities, each with their features, advantages and limits. However, it is a very challenging issue and none of the existing methods provides robust results, in particular in real daily living scenarios. This is particularly true for vision-based approaches used by robots. In this paper, we propose to refine a robot's visual activity recognition process by relying on smart home sensors. We assert that the consideration of further sensors and the knowledge about the target user together with the semantic by means of an ontology and a reasoning layer in the recognition process, has improved the existing works results. We experimented through multiple activity recognition scenarios with and without refinement to assess the relevance of such a combination. Although our tests reveal positive results, they also point out limits and challenges that we discuss in this pape...|$|E
