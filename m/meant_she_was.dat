5|$|In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as {{the first}} person to become a U.S.-dollar billionaire by writing books, the second-richest female {{entertainer}} and the 1,062nd richest person in the world. Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire. The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £600million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160 million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no longer a billionaire. In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav monitor Sava was a Temes-class river monitor {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy as SMS Bodrog. She fired the first shots of World War I {{on the night of}} 28 July 1914, when she and two other {{monitors}} shelled Serbian defences near Belgrade. She was part of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian and Romanian armies from Belgrade to the mouth of the Danube. In the closing stages of the war, she was the last monitor to withdraw towards Budapest, but was captured by the Serbs when she grounded on a sandbank downstream from Belgrade. After the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Sava. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not always in full commission.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav monitor Vardar was a Sava-class river monitor {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy as SMS Bosna, but was renamed SMS Temes (II) before she went into service. During World War I she was the {{flagship}} of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian Army, the Romanian Navy and Army, and the French Army. She reverted to the name Bosna in May 1917, after the original SMS Temes was raised and returned to service. After brief service with the Hungarian People's Republic {{at the end of}} the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Vardar. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not always in full commission.|$|E
50|$|Sandrine Pinna {{was born}} on 10 April 1987 to a French father and a Taiwanese mother. Her father was a lawyer. Her parents {{divorced}} when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a child, and it <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> unable to converse in French. After her father returned to France, Pinna was raised by her mother. Her father died in May 2011.|$|R

25|$|At the 1986 Asian Games the 21-year-old Isozaki {{was entered}} to defend all her titles. She ran her {{individual}} finals faster {{than she had}} done four years earlier, but the standard of women's sprinting in Asia had improved and this <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fifth in the 200m and third in the 400m. P. T. Usha succeeded Isozaki in both disciplines with another Indian, Shiny Abraham, finishing ahead of the Japanese sprinter in the 400m. The Japanese short relay team fell to fifth in the rankings but the national long relay team remained competitive as Isozaki anchored home a quartet including Keiko Honda, Koshimoto and Ayako Arai to the silver medal behind the Indian women.|$|E
25|$|In January 2008, aged 20, Urquhart was {{appointed}} captain of Scotland for the 2008 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa. However, at the tournament itself, a finger injury <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{only able to}} appear in the matches against Ireland and Zimbabwe, with Kari Anderson taking over as skipper in the remaining games. In the Women's County Championship, where Scotland debuted later in the year, Anderson and Urquhart rotated the captaincy duties. However, Anderson {{was appointed}} sole captain for the 2009 season, and Urquhart has only since captained the team in her absence. During the 2009 County Championship, Urquhart put in some of her best bowling performances, taking 4/19 against Worcestershire and 3/30 against Staffordshire. A few years later, in 2012, she scored her maiden County Championship half-century, making 50 runs exactly against Northamptonshire.|$|E
500|$|SMS Körös (...) was {{the name}} ship of the Körös-class river {{monitors}} built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Completed in 1892, the ship {{was part of the}} Danube Flotilla, and fought various Allied forces from Belgrade down the Danube to the Black Sea during World War I. After brief service with the Hungarian People's Republic {{at the end of the}} war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Morava. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not always in full commission.|$|E

500|$|Yorktowns {{partially}} depleted air {{group was}} rebuilt using whatever planes and pilots could be found. Scouting Five (VS-5) {{was replaced with}} Bombing Three (VB-3) from [...] Torpedo Five (VT-5) was also replaced by Torpedo Three (VT-3.) Also Fighting Three (VF-3) was reconstituted to replace VF-42 with sixteen pilots from VF-42 and eleven pilots from VF-3 with Lieutenant Commander John S. [...] "Jimmy" [...] Thach in command. Some of the aircrew were inexperienced, which {{may have contributed to}} an accident in which Thach's executive officer Lt Cmndr Donald Lovelace was killed. Despite efforts to get Saratoga (which had been undergoing repairs on the American West Coast) ready for the coming engagement, the need to resupply and assemble sufficient escorts <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not able to reach Midway until after the battle.|$|E
500|$|After {{enduring}} {{three years}} of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I feel your spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see – the side that can laugh at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E
500|$|Sophie Blanchard {{was born}} Marie Madeleine-Sophie Armant to Protestant parents at Trois-Canons, near La Rochelle. Little {{is known of}} her life before her {{marriage}} to Jean-Pierre Blanchard, the world's first professional balloonist. The date of her marriage is unclear; sources quote dates as early as 1794 [...] or 1797, but most state 1804, the year of her first ascent. Blanchard had abandoned his first wife, Victoire Lebrun, and their four children to travel round Europe pursuing his ballooning career, and she later died in poverty. Variously described as Blanchard's [...] "small, ugly, nervous wife", [...] "small with sharp bird-like features" [...] and later as [...] "small and beautiful", Sophie was more {{at home in the}} sky than on the ground, where her nervous disposition <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> easily startled. She was terrified of loud noises and of riding in carriages, but was fearless in the air. She and her husband were in an accident on a joint flight in 1807 (her 11th ascent, possibly his 61st), in which they crashed and he sustained a head injury. The shock apparently left her mute for a while.|$|E

60|$|Vane {{wondered}} whether <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{surprised that he}} had not come of his own accord. He felt mildly flattered. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> interesting, and knew how to listen sympathetically, as well as how to talk, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> also a lady of station in the western city.|$|R
500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{has said}} {{that when she was}} cast as Dot, she was given a list of {{illnesses}} the character had. She added, [...] "It <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a [...] because she had nobody to care about her. She was quite a selfish woman [...]" [...] Dot has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as a [...] "born victim." [...] She adds that [...] "with each blow that life delivers [...] bobs back up again, almost asking for more trouble, more pain, more suffering." [...] Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac, her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible. She has been described by Rupert Smith, author of 20 Years in Albert Square, as [...] "God-bothering" [...] and self-righteous. According to Kingsley, [...] "nothing shakes Dot's view that the world is good because the creator made it so. Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals." [...] The character once expressed {{part of the reason for}} her faith on-screen in 2000, commenting to a vicar, [...] "I couldn't manage without my faith, not with the life I've had"; former executive producer of EastEnders, John Yorke, has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders' entire existence. Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot's religious beliefs have given her solace, but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours, and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son. He described her as a [...] "simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate".|$|E

5000|$|Tanya stated {{during the}} {{interrogation}} game when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> questioned about the tube {{that it had}} not been [...] "exposed". This <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> knew what <b>was</b> coming, and therefore, was the mole.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2003, {{during the}} U.S.-led {{occupation}} of Iraq, Karpinski was given {{command of the}} 800th Military Police Brigade, which <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the 15 detention facilities in southern and central Iraq run by Coalition forces. [...] Karpinski was also given command of the National Guard and Army reserve units in the Iraqi city of Mosul. [...] In January 2004, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez formally suspended Karpinski and 16 other soldiers with undisclosed reprimands. An investigation was started into the abuse at Abu Ghraib, and Karpinski left Iraq for reasons that were explained {{at the time as}} part of [...] "routine troop rotations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elisheva Goldberg, {{writing in}} the Daily Beast in July 2012, {{rejected}} Dershowitz's argument that Walker's refusal to allow the Hebrew translation <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> anti-Semitic. Noting that Walker had been married to a Jew and had a half-Jewish daughter, and that The Color Purple was adapted as a film directed by Jewish filmmaker Steven Spielberg, Goldberg said: [...] "Alice Walker is not boycotting Jews. She is not even boycotting Israelis. She is boycotting the government of Israel. She is boycotting what she sees as state-subsidized symbols of racism that remind her of Apartheid South Africa." [...] To call Walker an anti-Semite, Goldberg said, was to [...] "devalue" [...] her own grandfather's suffering at Treblinka concentration camp.|$|E
2500|$|Such a {{lifestyle}} <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not greatly {{interested in seeing}} her poetry published, but others thought that her work deserved a larger audience. She {{is said to have}} had poems published in the Sheffield Free Press. [...] Also, a volume of poetry, due to be published by the Common Ground Printing Co-operative, was reportedly removed prior to publication after the printer sought to censor the content. She was first published in 1986, according to a later reviewer, through [...] "a series of home-made, distributed hand to hand, photographed-manuscript feuilles volantes". In 1988 two of her poems were published under the title La Facciata as issue number 5 of Poetical Histories, with a cover design by the author.|$|E
6000|$|Quite. [...] "She {{is quite}} charming." [...] If it <b>is</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> entirely charming this is right, but usually the meaning {{intended}} to be conveyed is less than that--that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> rather, or somewhat, charming.|$|R

2500|$|Sawyers' {{bobsleigh}} {{training at}} the start of the year <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ill-prepared for heptathlon in the summer of 2012. She opted to focus on the long jump instead, as this combined well with the explosive strength training she had undertaken for the winter sport. This proved to be a successful switch as she set a personal best of [...] to place third at the UK Athletics Championships and also set the world-leading junior mark. Sawyers was the bronze medallist at the 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics – her distance of [...] was beaten only by the wind-assisted jumps of British rival Katerina Johnson-Thompson and Germany's Lena Malkus. Her performance was the second best wind-legal jump by a junior woman that year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{argument}} then, across {{the research is}} that Stella Browne had the most trouble getting her two beliefs to coexist appropriately. [...] Jones says that Browne constantly needed {{to be on the}} offensive around her ideals on eugenics around her socialist friends and Rowbotham comments on Browne’s “continuing double struggle” to maintain both of these ideals finding connections between the two, which others in her two separate streams of struggle may not have agreed with fully. Browne was a hardworking woman who believed in her work so much so that she was even considered to have a “personal intransigence [...] <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> as often at odds with her allies as with this her enemies.” [...] One from the literature on Browne can conclude that she has value to the study of women’s sexuality and sexual reform that historians who have studied her believe should continue to be explored and brought to the public’s attention.|$|E
2500|$|Although Mayer {{generally}} had a {{good relationship}} with her guarantor, Muriel Chadwick, they were not particularly close and in 1940 she was enrolled at a boarding school in Swanage. Here her native language <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> wrongly perceived to be German and she was then teased by the other pupils. By 1942 the school was in decline and Mayer left to become a boarder at the Stoatley Rough School in Haslemere, Surrey where she was much happier, describing it as [...] "heavenly". This co-educational, non-denominational school had been founded in 1934 by German émigré Dr Hilde Lion and Quaker activist Bertha Bracey, to provide an education for mainly Jewish refugee children from Nazi Europe. Three of Mayer's favourite teachers there, Dr Lion (head teacher), Dr Emmy Wolff (German language and literature) and Dr. Luise Leven (music) are celebrated in her poem [...] "A Lion, a Wolf and a Fox". Mayer finished her schooling at Stoatley Rough in 1944 aged seventeen and joined her guarantor, who by then was living at Stratford-upon-Avon.|$|E
