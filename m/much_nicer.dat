He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully, but comes to improve his nasty {{behaviour}} when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while. His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been, and he soon becomes a better person so Aslan changes him back into a boy. In the later books, Eustace {{comes across as a}} <b>much</b> <b>nicer</b> person, although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative. Nonetheless, he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch. He appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.|$|E

500|$|In her writing, Frank {{examined}} her {{relationships with the}} members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, [...] "I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did." [...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, [...] "Margot's <b>much</b> <b>nicer...</b> She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count." ...|$|E
500|$|In June of the 1907 season, Lajoie's [...]296 average, [...] "an average {{even now}} that scores of players {{would be glad}} to accept," [...] put him at risk for hitting below [...]300 {{for the first time in}} his career. He also missed 15 games due to a {{recurrence}} of sepsis which he contracted during the 1905 season. Lajoie and Naps first baseman George Stovall got into an argument in a hotel lobby and Stovall broke a chair over Lajoie's head. [...] "George didn't mean anything by it", Lajoie said, and the two maintained a working relationship. He finished the season with an average of [...]299. Naps owner Charles Somers received a trade offer from the Detroit Tigers for the Naps' Elmer Flick and Tigers' Ty Cobb. Tigers manager Hughie Jennings called Somers and told him he was offering the trade because Cobb was not getting along with several teammates. Somers decided to retain Flick, saying, [...] "We'll keep Flick. Maybe he isn't as good a batter as Cobb, but he's <b>much</b> <b>nicer</b> to have on the team." [...] The Naps finished the regular season in second place to the Tigers with a 9064 record, a half-game behind the Tigers (who finished 9063 and were not forced to make-up a rained out game in accordance with league rules). Lajoie was partly blamed for the Naps' second-place finish. Author Fred McMane described an instance during the season between Naps catcher Nig Clarke and Lajoie.|$|E

500|$|Peggy and Archie's {{wedding was}} filmed on {{location}} in North London in January 2009 and was screened on 2 April 2009 that year in an hour-long special. To promote the storyline, EastEnders screened a trailer showing Peggy being assembled in her wedding outfit by a robot, which symbolised Archie's control of her. Realising {{the extent to which}} Archie had been controlling and trying to change her throughout their engagement, Peggy gave him an ultimatum at the altar: he either accept the real her, or call the wedding off. Archie chose to marry her, though Tim Teeman for The Times commented: [...] "'he real Peggy' is a hazy concept: thereâ€™s Peggy the big-hearted East End landlady and Peggy the crone famous for rasping 'Get ahht my pub' to anyone who crosses her path. For someone into evil mind control, Archie has brilliant taste. The wedding outfit he had chosen for Peggy was <b>much</b> <b>nicer</b> than the tatty net curtains that even Miss Havisham would have rejected that the 'real Peggy' chose to marry in." [...] Peggy and Archie's wedding was watched by 10.6 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 48% audience share. A further 1.2 million viewers watched the episode's repeat on BBC Three at 10pm. However, the marriage lasts only as long as the reception; when Peggy realises Archie has been manipulating other members of his family, Peggy throws him out and a feud ignites between Archie and the Mitchell clan.|$|E
2500|$|Dramatically {{illustrating}} the disparate {{conditions in the}} schools were fire insurance valuations prepared by the State of Delaware in 1941, which featured photographs of all Delaware public schools {{as well as their}} assessed value. [...] For example, the [...] "colored" [...] school in Hockessin was valued at only $6,250.00, while the whites-only Hockessin school was valued almost seven times higher.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is unruly, even slightly anarchic. Harry's classmate Hermione 'had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules,' writes Rowling near the end of Philosopher's Stone, 'and she was <b>much</b> <b>nicer</b> for it.' There's more than a touch of anarchy when all the students sing to their own tune. In her books, the kids are the central agents of their own lives. They make choices. Weigh judgments.

The sixth reviewer, Theron Martin, agreed that [...] "formulaic and generic" [...] wouldn't be wrong ways to describe the story and he also praised Stella's underlying motivations. Martin concluded that while the series has potential, it needs to find [...] "fresher angles" [...] to stand out from other similar storylines. Silverman reviewed the anime's future episodes; she called the final episode [...] "a triumphant one in terms of Ikki's battle against his own insecurities, his place at school, and his relationship with Stella", and would later go {{on to say that}} she was [...] "pretty happy with this ending and [...] wouldn't be sad if another season materialized somewhere along the way." ...|$|E

30|$|The BHCP is {{strictly}} difficult to solve since, in general, the solution {{does not always}} exist. Furthermore, even if the solution does exist, {{it would not be}} continuously dependent on the data. As a result, {{there are a number of}} difficulties in doing numerical calculations. BHCP is a very famous problem and has been considered by many authors by different methods [3 â€“ 19]. For the BHCP with a constant coefficient, there is <b>much</b> <b>nice</b> literature that can be listed. Trong and Tuan in [12] used the method of integral equation to regularize backward heat conduction problem and get some error estimates. In [16], Hao et al. gave a very nice approximation for this problem by using a non-local boundary value problem method. Later on, Hao and Duc [17] used the Tikhonov regularization method to give an approximation for this problem in Banach space. Tautenhahn in [10] established an optimal error estimate for a backward heat equation with constant coefficient. Fu et al. [7] applied a wavelet dual least squares method to investigate a BHCP with constant coefficient.|$|R
