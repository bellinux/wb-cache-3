We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions {{with respect to the}} quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E

Morrow told the state adjutant general [...] "Do as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{have to do to}} keep that negro {{in the hands of the}} law. If he falls into the hands of the mob I do not expect to see you alive." [...] Lockett had already confessed, without the benefit of a lawyer, to the murder. His trial took only thirty minutes as he pleaded guilty but asked for a life sentence instead of death. Despite his plea, he was sentenced to die in the electric chair.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Lansbury's {{performance}} were overwhelmingly positive. In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: [...] "Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not {{a singer}} or dancer who also acts... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth {{and a very}} taking [...]" [...] The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a [...] "superstar", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that [...] "Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys it as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do. And it lasts {{as long as you}} are on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his triumph, Napoleon imposed {{the first}} {{elements}} of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806. The Continental System, which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain, was widely violated throughout his reign. In the next few months, Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and {{was involved in the}} bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807. After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides, the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive. On 14 June, however, Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland, wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle. The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: [...] "I hate the English as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do".|$|E
500|$|In Buddhist texts {{further details}} {{are given in}} what way {{and to what extent}} a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual {{attitude}} of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given. If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a [...] (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order. If the giver is motivated by greed or other defilements of the mind, the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions. Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually [...] "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around. Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit. Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose. The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard {{to the size of the}} gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size. It is therefore recommended to give as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can afford, no more and no less. Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (...)

2500|$|The school motto Quantum Potes Tantum Aude ("Dare All You Can, for God and Man") was {{introduced}} by the rector-headmaster, Fr Thomas Gartlan SJ, in 1906. Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is now formally translated from Latin as [...] "As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can do, so much dare to do", seen to best reflect the Latin, replacing the former [...] "Dare to do your Best". The motto is taken from a song of Saint Thomas Aquinas (12271274) entitled Lauda Sion Salvatorem ('Praise, O Sion, Praise Thy Saviour'). The next line after Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is Quia Maior Omni Laude, which, together, translates to [...] "As <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can do, so much dare to do, because He is above all praise".|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his career}} he also began to act in various films. In 1963, {{director}} Otto Preminger asked if he would portray a Boston prelate in The Cardinal, and, writes author Philip Kemp, he [...] "virtually stole the picture." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role. He had a little participation (as did many others) in 1967's Casino Royale as actor and director. He acted in Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974) as the film's master villain, and as Teddy Roosevelt's secretary of state John Hay in The Wind and the Lion. Huston enjoyed acting and denied that he took it all that seriously.

2500|$|As it was, Twain {{was glad}} to welcome Kipling and had a two-hour {{conversation}} with him on trends in Anglo-American literature and about what Twain was going to write in a sequel to Tom Sawyer, with Twain assuring Kipling that a sequel was coming; {{but he had not}} decided upon the ending: either Sawyer would be elected to Congress or would be hanged. Twain also passed along the literary advice that an author should: [...] "Get your facts first and then you can distort 'em as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> please." [...] Twain, who rather liked Kipling, later wrote about their meeting: [...] "Between us, we cover all knowledge; he covers all that can be known and I cover the rest". Kipling then crossed the Atlantic and reached Liverpool in October 1889. He soon made his début in the London literary world—to great acclaim.|$|E
