A new method to embed a robust watermark in the JPEG 2000 compressed encrypted images by means of three different existing watermarking schemes was proposed.

It also safeguards the conﬁdentiality of content as the embedding is completed on encrypted information. The homomorphic properties of the cryptosystem are demoralized, which allows us to notice the watermark subsequent to decryption and manage the image excellence as well. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{conventional}} two-dimensional (2 -D) {{wavelet transform}} used in existing image coders is usually performed through one-dimensional (1 -D) filtering in the {{vertical and horizontal}} directions, which cannot efficiently represent edges and lines in images. The curved wavelet transform {{presented in this paper}} is carried out by applying 1 -D filters along curves, rather than being restricted to vertical and horizontal straight lines. The curves are determined based on image content and are usually parallel to edges and lines in the image to be coded. The pixels along these curves can be well represented by a small number of wavelet coefficients. The curved wavelet transform is used to construct a new image coder. The code-stream syntax of the new coder is {{the same as that of}} JPEG 2000, except that a new <b>marker</b> <b>segment</b> is added to the tile headers. The new coder therefore retains all the features and functionalities of JPEG 2000. Results of image coding and subjective quality assessment show that the new coder performs better than or as well as JPEG 2000. The new coder is particularly efficient for images that contain sharp edges and can provide a PSNR gain of up to 1. 6 dB for natural images compared with JPEG 2000. coding.

40|$|To {{properly}} mitigate road impacts {{for wildlife}} and increase motorist safety, transportation departments {{need to be}} able to identify where particular individuals, or species are susceptible to high road-kill rates along roads. Researchers have relied on a variety of statistical methods to determine the specific explanatory factors associated with wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC). Of particular importance in these analyses is the underlying spatial data used to describe the locations of WVCs. In this study we investigate the importance of the same WVC factors on two different datasets: one with highly accurate location data (< 3 m error) representing an ideal situation and another dataset with high spatial error (+ 0. 5 mile or 800 m), which is likely more characteristic of the average transportation agency dataset where collision locations are recorded to the closest mile marker. We used spatially accurate locations of ungulate vehicle collisions (UVC) in the Central Canadian Rocky Mountains from 1999 to 2004 to create a low accuracy dataset by shifting each location to the nearest hypothetical mile-marker on the road. We measured the same attribute at each spatially ac¬curate UVC location and at each mile-marker location along five highways in the study area. We categorized each mile <b>marker</b> <b>segment</b> and its corresponding kills as a “high-kill” or “low-kill” zone by comparing the total number of UVCs associated with a single mile-marker segment to the average number of UVCs per mile for the same stretch of road. We measured three types of spatial variables for each high and low kill location: field measured point-specific and GIS generated proximity and proportional variables. We used univariate tests and logistic regression analyses to identify which of the attributes best predicted the likelihood of UVC occurrence for both datasets. Within the spatially accurate dataset, six of the point specific habitat and terrain variables were significant while only two of the field variables (road width and terrain) were significant for the mile-marker dataset. No proximity and one proportional measurement was significant for the mile-marker dataset. The spatially accurate regression model was significant and had more predictive ability than the low accuracy data since the majority of the variables measured were site-specific. This analysis demonstrates that WVC data collection accuracy will determine the scale and type of variables which should be measured. The application of models generated from low accuracy data is limited to a coarse landscape scale while spatially accurate models are needed to determine the fine-scale factors associated with WVCs. The particular objectives of these predictive analyses i. e. pinpointing exact locations for mitigation structures, will ultimately determine whether an agency should invest in collecting spatially accurate data as opposed to opportunistically collecting low accuracy data...|$|E
