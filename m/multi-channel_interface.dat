40|$|We {{consider}} the Coulomb blockade on a superconductive quantum dot strongly coupled to a lead through a tunnelling barrier and/or normal diffusive metal. Andreev transport of the correlated pairs leads to quantum fluctuations {{of the charge}} on the dot. These fluctuations result in exponential renormalization of the effective charging energy. We employ two complimentary ways to approach the problem, leading to the coinciding results: the instanton and the functional RG treatment of the non-linear sigma model.

40|$|Abstract—In {{wireless}} mesh networks, each node can {{be equipped}} with multiple network interface cards tuned to different channels. In this paper, we study the problem of collision-free multicast in multi-interface multi-channel wireless mesh networks. The concept of interface redundancy is proposed as a new criterion for the multicast/broadcast redundancy in wireless mesh networks, and we prove that building a multicast/broadcast tree with the minimum interface redundancy is NP-hard. We also prove that the minimum-latency multicasting problem in multi-channel wireless mesh networks is NP-hard. We present two heuristic-based algorithms which jointly reduce the interface redundancy and the multicast latency. Since broadcast {{can be considered as}} a special case of multicast, an approximate algorithm for low-redundancy broadcast tree construction is also proposed, which has a constant approximation ratio. Finally, the simulation results prove the effectiveness of our approach.

As a consequence, computer design has seen a relatively recent trend toward serialized, asynchronous architectures, and the existing bus standards (eg, PCI) has evolved toward serialized versions (eg, PCI Express).

The effect of cathode modification by CHBPEK or SHBPES for conventional PSCs based on different active-layer materials is systematically investigated. Compared with traditional LiF/Al, Ca/Al, and PFN/Al devices, significant improvement in short circuit current and fill factors are achieved by employing CHBPEK or SHBPES. In particular, the device with SHBPES as cathode interlayer can be achieved with a highest PCE of 9. 12 %, which are among the high performance reported for single-junction PSCs modified with hyperbranched interlayers. Importantly, {{the influence of the}} hyperbranched polymer interlayer modification on the cathode interface is also discussed and found to be the formation of the stable <b>multi-channel</b> <b>interface</b> dipole based on quasi-immovable counterions in these polymers.

In turn, sensor fusion has increased the required accuracy of synchronisation between sensors. Using commercial off-the-shelf components may compromise quality and accuracy due to several challenges, such as dealing with the combined data rate from multiple sensors; unknown offset and rate discrepancies between independent hardware clocks; the absence of trigger inputs or -outputs in the hardware; as well as the different methods for time-stamping the recorded data. To achieve accurate synchronisation, we centralise the synchronisation task by recording all trigger- or timestamp signals with a <b>multi-channel</b> audio <b>interface.</b> For sensors that don't have an external trigger signal, we let the computer that captures the sensor data periodically generate timestamp signals from its serial port output.

40|$|Vehicular {{communication}} systems represent {{one of the}} most desirable technologies when the safety, efficiency and comfort of everyday road travel need to be improved. The main advantage is the absence of an infrastructure, typical of centralized networks, that makes them adequate for highly-variable network topologies. On the other hand, communication protocols become very complex and, sometimes, signaling overhead may waste bandwidth availability. Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) are able to provide a wireless networking capability in situations where no fixed infrastructure exists: communication performance and Quality of Service (QoS) strongly depend on how the routing takes place in the network, on how protocol overhead affects the available bandwidth and on how different channels are selected in order to minimize interference levels. Attention is focused on the routing level of VANET and we propose an interference aware routing scheme for multi-radio vehicular networks, wherein each node is equipped with a <b>multi-channel</b> radio <b>interface.</b> In order to relieve the effects of the co-channel interference perceived by mobile nodes, transmission channels are switched {{on the basis of a}} periodical Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) evaluation.

50|$|Sound Tools debuted on January 20, 1989 at NAMM (National Association of Music Merchandisers). At {{this stage}} Sound Tools {{was a simple}} {{computer-based}} stereo audio editor. Although the software had the possibility to do far more, it was limited by the hard drive technology, which was used to stream audio and allow for the non-destructive editing that Sound Tools offered. The first version of Pro Tools was launched in 1991, offering four tracks and selling for $6,000 USD. The core engine technology {{and much of the}} user interface was designed by and licensed from a small San Francisco company called OSC, known at the time for creating the first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called DECK, in 1990. That software, manufactured by OSC but distributed by Digidesign, formed the platform upon which Pro Tools version 1 was built. The OSC designers and engineers responsible for that technology, Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton, split from Digidesign in 1993 in order to focus on releasing lower-cost ($399) multi-track software that would run on computers with no additional hardware. The software was known circa mid-1990s as Session (for stereo-only audio cards) and Session 8 (for <b>multi-channel</b> audio <b>interfaces).</b> Although the original design remained largely the same, Digidesign continued to improve Pro Tools software and hardware, adding a visual MIDI sequencer and more tracks, with the system offering 16-bit, 44.1 kHz audio recording. In 1997, Pro Tools reached 24-bit, 48 tracks. It was at this point that the migration from more conventional analog studio technology to the Pro Tools platform took place within the industry.|$|R

Many researchers {{have tried to}} increase network throughput by using <b>multi-channel</b> and multi-radio <b>interfaces.</b> A multi-radio <b>multi-channel</b> WMN requires channel assignment algorithm to decide the number of channels needed for each link.

40|$|Abstract Superconducting digital {{technology}} based on Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) logic offers a 50 times faster clock rate and 100 times less on chip power consumption than today's mainstream semiconductor electronics. This technology is attractive for many applications {{and in particular}} for Digital Signal Processing (DSP). The applications of the RSFQ DSPs are numerous and include multi-user detection in spread spectrum system, channel equalization for Multi-in, Multi-out (MIMO) systems, and blind detection and signal tracking for signal intelligence. At Chalmers we are developing a hybrid DSP with target performance of 30 giga operations per second. It consists of an RSFQ Multiply Accumulate unit (MAC), RSFQ fast cache memory, and an external semiconductor memory. The development of the complex high speed cryogenic digital system requires interface, packaging and testing solutions. The main difficulties are due to the 4 K operational temperature, the high magnetic field sensitivity of the RSFQ circuits, the <b>multi-channel</b> high bandwidth <b>interface</b> required in the hybrid architecture, and the high speed RSFQ digital core. The key steps towards addressing each of these problems {{are the subject of}} this thesis. The main emphasis is put on the experimental testing and interfacing of superconductor electronics. A large part of the work is connected to the experimental verification of DSP components and their incremental improvement towards functionality. The RSFQ circuits tested were fabricated using the four-metal layer VLSI processes available from NGST (8 kA/cm^ 2 Josephson junction critical current) and HYPRES (both 1 kA/cm^ 2 and HYPRES 4. 5 kA/cm^ 2. The main results of the work are demonstrations of the RSFQ cache memory with more than 2, 000 Josephson junctions, 33. 5 GHz operation of the digital clock controller, and 20. 48 GHz operation of the autocorrelator. In addition, various experiments have been done for investigation of parasitic effects in RSFQ circuits such as flux trapping and influence of the high current bias lines. At the final stage of the work, a unique high bandwidth 4 K cryocooler based experimental setup has been developed. The system, developed in close cooperation with Hypres Inc.

40|$|With the industry's recent {{paradigm}} shift from PC-centred applications to services delivered through ubiquitous computing {{in a more}} human centred manner, multimodal human-computer interfaces (MHCI) became an emerging research topic. As an important but often neglected aspect, the lack of appropriate system integration tools hinders the development of MHCI systems. Therefore, the work presented in this thesis aims at delivering hardware / software infrastructure to facilitate the full development cycle of MHCI systems. Specifically, we first built a hardware platform for synchronised, multimodal-data capturing to support and facilitate automatic human behaviour understanding from multiple audiovisual sensors. Then we developed a software framework, called the HCI^ 2 Framework, to facilitate the modular development and rapid prototyping of readily-applicable MHCI systems. As a proof of concept, we also present an affect-sensitive game with humanoid robot NAO developed using the HCI^ 2 Framework. Studies on automatic human behaviour understanding require high-bandwidth recording from multiple cameras, {{as well as from}} other sensors such as microphones and eye-gaze trackers. In addition, sensor fusion should be realised with high accuracy as to achieve tight synchronisation between sensors and, in turn, enable studies of correlation between various behavioural signals. Using commercial off-the-shelf components may compromise quality and accuracy due to several issues including handling the combined data rate from multiple sensors, unknown offset and rate discrepancies between independent hardware clocks, the absence of trigger inputs or -outputs in the hardware, as well as the existence of different methods for time-stamping the recorded data. To achieve accurate synchronisation, we centralise the synchronisation task by recording all trigger or timestamp signals with a <b>multi-channel</b> audio <b>interface.</b> For sensors not having an external trigger signal, we let the computer that captures the sensor data periodically generate timestamp signals from its serial port output. These signals can also be used as a common time base to synchronise multiple asynchronous audio interfaces. The resulted data recording platform, which is built upon two consumer-grade PCs, is capable of capturing 8 -bit video data with 1024 × 1024 spatial- and 59. 1 Hz temporal resolution, from at least 14 cameras, together with 8 channels of 24 -bit audio at 96 kHz and eye-gaze tracking result sampled at a frequency of 60 or 120 Hz. The attained synchronisation accuracy is unprecedented up to date. To facilitate rapid development of readily-applicable MHCI systems using algorithms designed to detect and track behavioural signals (e. g. face detector, facial fiducially points tracker, expression recogniser, etc.), a software integration framework is required. The proposed software framework, which is called the HCI^ 2 Framework, is built upon publish / subscribe (P/S) architecture. It implements a shared-memory-based data transport protocol for message delivery and a TCP-based system management protocol. The latter ensures that the integrity of system structure is maintained at runtime. With the inclusion of ‘bridging modules’, the HCI^ 2 Framework is interoperable with other software frameworks including Psyclone and ActiveMQ. In addition to the core communication middleware, we also present the integrated development environment (IDE) of the HCI^ 2 Framework. It provides a complete graphical environment to support every step in a typical MHCI system development process, including module development, debugging, packaging, and management, as well as the whole system management and testing. The quantitative evaluation indicates that our framework outperforms other similar tools in terms of average message latency and maximum data throughput under a typical single PC scenario. To demonstrate HCI^ 2 Framework’s capabilities in integrating heterogeneous modules, we present several example modules working with a variety of hardware and software. We also present two use cases of the HCI^ 2 Framework: a computer game, called CamGame, based on hand-held marker(s) and low-cost camera(s) and the human affective signal analysis component of the Fun Robotic Outdoor Guide (FROG) project ([URL] Using the HCI^ 2 Framework, we further developed the Mimic-Me Game, which consists of an interactive game played with the NAO humanoid robot. The game involves the robot ‘mimicking’ the player’s facial expression using a combination of body gestures and audio cues. A multimodal dialogue model has been designed and implemented to enable the robot to interact with the human player in a naturalistic way using only natural language, head movement and facial expressions.
