5|$|After re-establishing his {{authority}} in England, John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou by drawing the French from Paris while another army (under Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor) attacked from the north. However, his allies were defeated at the Battle of Bouvines {{in one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> battles in French history. John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown, with John agreeing to a five-year truce. Philip's victory was crucial to the political order in England and France, and the battle was instrumental in establishing absolute monarchy in France.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{endorsed}} Humphrey at the convention, to {{the dismay}} of some anti-war figures who considered it a betrayal. Humphrey went on to lose the general election to Richard Nixon. McGovern returned to his Senate reelection race, facing Republican former Governor Archie M. Gubbrud. While South Dakota voters sympathized with McGovern over his daughter's arrest, he initially suffered a substantial drop in popularity over the events in Chicago. However, McGovern conducted an energetic campaign that focused on his service to the state, while Gubbrud ran a lackluster effort. In November, McGovern won 57percent of the vote in what he would consider the easiest and <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> victory of his career.|$|E

Offensive operations are {{the means by which}} a military force seizes and holds the initiative while maintaining freedom of action and achieving decisive results. This is fundamentally true across all levels of war.|$|R
5|$|Thomas {{failed in}} spite of his qualities and the {{widespread}} support he had gained, which brought him control of most of the empire. Lemerle holds that several factors played a role in his defeat: the Asian themes he did not subdue supplied reinforcements to Michael; Thomas's fleet performed badly; and the Bulgarian offensive diverted him away from the capital and weakened his army. But the <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> obstacles were the impregnable walls of Constantinople, which ensured that an emperor who controlled Constantinople could only be overthrown from within the city.|$|E
5|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel Tel Aviv, who have 15, including two unmatched runs of {{three in a row}} (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every time they have reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August, the Battle of Yarmouk was fought, {{it lasted}} for 6 days {{and ended in}} a devastating defeat for the Byzantines. The Battle of Yarmouk is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> battles of history. It was a historic defeat that sealed the fate of Byzantium in the Levant, the magnitude of the defeat was so intense that Byzantine forces were unable to recover from it for some time. It left the whole of the Byzantine Empire vulnerable to the Muslim Arab armies. The battle was the greatest battle ever fought on Syrian soil up to that point, and is believed to be the tactical marvel of Khalid.|$|E

This means that the patientrsquos preference is one of the <b>most</b> important <b>decisive</b> factors in choosing one triptan over another. A good migraine therapy requires a balance between patient satisfaction and drug efficacy and safety. All the marked triptans show a good benefit-risk ratio, and comorbidity should be considered when choosing between different triptans...|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Yarmouk {{was a major}} {{battle between}} {{the army of the}} Byzantine Empire and the Muslim Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. The battle {{consisted}} of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636, near the Yarmouk River, along what today are the borders of Syria–Jordan and Syria–Israel, east of the Sea of Galilee. The result of the battle was a complete Muslim victory which ended Byzantine rule in Syria. The Battle of Yarmouk is {{regarded as one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> battles in military history, and it marked the first great wave of early Muslim conquests after the death of Prophet Muhammad, heralding the rapid advance of Islam into the then Christian Levant.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle has}} been {{described}} as one of the <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> of the ancient world. The forces of Athens and Thebes were destroyed, and continued resistance was impossible; the war therefore came to an abrupt end. Philip was able to impose a settlement upon Greece, which all states accepted, with the exception of Sparta. The League of Corinth, formed as a result, made all participants allies of Macedon and each other, with Philip as the guarantor of the peace. In turn, Philip was voted as strategos (general) for a pan-Hellenic war against the Persian Empire, which he had long planned. However, before he was able to take charge of the campaign, Philip was assassinated, and the kingdom of Macedon and responsibility for the war with Persia passed instead to his son Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Xiphias is next {{mentioned}} in the Battle of Kleidion in 1014, when Basil II was attempting to force the pass known as Kleidion or Kiava Longos, which the Bulgarians under their ruler Samuil had strongly fortified. Xiphias, still strategos of Philippopolis, suggested to the Emperor to bypass the Bulgarian positions and strike them from the rear. After Basil agreed, Xiphias led a picked infantry detachment over Mount Belasica, and on 29 July 1014, led his troops on a charge on the unsuspecting Bulgarians, who panicked and broke before the unexpected attack. For this feat, which resulted {{in one of the}} <b>most</b> <b>decisive</b> victories in the long Bulgarian war, he was rewarded with promotion to the rank of patrikios. In early 1015, Xiphias, along with Constantine Diogenes, subdued the region of Moglena, which had rebelled against imperial rule. Towards the end of the same year he campaigned from Mosynopolis to the region of Triaditza (Sofia), razing its environs and capturing the fort of Boyana. Finally, {{in the last year of}} the Bulgarian war, in 1018, starting from Kastoria he subdued the remaining Bulgarian strongholds in the region of Servia.|$|E

50|$|Still, {{battleship}}s {{played a}} part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theatres. In the Atlantic, the Germans experimented with taking the battleship beyond conventional fleet action, using their pocket battleships as independent commerce raiders.

50|$|Perhaps the <b>most</b> {{strategically}} <b>decisive,</b> best known, {{and first}} wartime use of specialized cratering anti-runway weapons was by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. The dibber bombs {{played a major}} part in the near complete destruction of the large Egyptian Air Force, mostly on the ground, in a preemptive strike on the first morning of the war by {{the commitment of the}} whole of the far smaller Israeli Air Force to the strike. The surprising elimination of the Egyptian air force and resulting Israeli air supremacy contributed significantly to the outcome of the war on all fronts. The IMI 'Runway Piercing Bomb' was a prototype Israeli-French anti-runway weapon. It used rocket braking over the target and a second rocket burst to plunge through the runway surface and explode.|$|R
50|$|Oxyhydrogen {{is often}} {{mentioned}} {{in conjunction with}} vehicles that claim to use water as a fuel. The <b>most</b> common and <b>decisive</b> counter-argument against producing this gas on board {{to use as a}} fuel or fuel additive is that more energy is needed to split water molecules than is recouped by burning the resulting gas. Additionally, the volume of gas that can be produced for on-demand consumption through electrolysis is very small in comparison to the volume consumed by an internal combustion engine.|$|R
