5|$|The {{ship was}} {{deployed}} in the North West Pacific for JIMEX 2012 (Japan-India Maritime Exercise) with the four ship group, and took part in India's first bi-lateral maritime exercise with Japan. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF) was represented by two destroyers, one <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> and a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|While {{the attack}} on Kaafjord was being conducted, the {{commander}} of the German submarines in the Norwegian sea ordered Group Trutz to take up new positions to the south-east of Jan Mayen and intercept the British ships as they returned to Scapa Flow. The Admiralty had anticipated this redeployment, and <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> from No. 18 Group RAF were directed to sweep the Home Fleet's route back to its base.|$|E
5|$|Although sales {{never fully}} recovered, the {{improved}} Comet2 and the prototype Comet3 {{culminated in the}} redesigned Comet4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30years. The Comet was adapted {{for a variety of}} military roles such as VIP, medical and passenger transport, as well as surveillance. The most extensive modification resulted in a specialised <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> variant, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Nimrod remained in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) until June 2011, over 60 years after the Comet's first flight.|$|E

5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{considered}} options {{to replace the}} aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne {{was too small to}} operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged that the cost of a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed-wing aircraft in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The ADF was {{subsequently}} {{involved in the}} reconstruction of Iraq. From 2003 until 2005 this was mainly limited to a Security Detachment which protected the Australia embassy, the attachment of officers to multi-national headquarters, small numbers of transport and <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and teams of air traffic controllers and medical personnel. From 2005 until 2008 a battalion-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the Al Muthanna Task Group, and later Overwatch Battle Group (West)) was stationed in southern Iraq. In addition, teams of ADF personnel were deployed to train Iraqi military units. In line with a promise made at the 2007 election, the Rudd Government withdrew combat-related forces from Iraq in mid-2008, {{and most of the}} remaining Australian units left the country the next year.|$|E

5|$|The AW101 is {{equipped}} with the Blue Kestrel search and detection radar which is capable of 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles. As part of the Royal Navy's Merlin HM2 upgrade program, Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar, notably allowing it to track 40 {{times the number of}} targets previously capable. Danish EH101s are fitted with the RDR-1600 search and weather radar. Royal Navy Merlins are equipped with the AQS901 anti-submarine system for processing sonographic data from sonobuoys to detect and target submerged submarines. The AQS901 was derived from the system on the earlier Hawker Siddeley Nimrod <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E
5|$|The only Allied {{military}} forces at Tulagi were 24 commandos from the Australian Army's 2/1st Independent Company, under Captain A. L. Goode, and about 25 personnel from 11 Squadron RAAF, under F/O R. B. Peagam, operating a seaplane base on nearby Gavutu-Tanambogo with four PBY Catalina <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Three Allied coastwatchers were also located nearby, on Guadalcanal island. The {{task of the}} coastwatchers was to report on any enemy movements, or suspicious activity, that they observed {{in the vicinity of}} their stations. In the belief that it might prevent them being executed for espionage, all of the coastwatchers were commissioned as Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve officers, and they were directed by Lieutenant Commander Eric Feldt, who was located at Townsville in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{decision}} to replace Melbourne with HMS Invincible, the postponed refit was cancelled outright. The Australian carrier was prepared for disposal, and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 30 June 1982. She was towed to the mooring dolphins near Bradley's Head, where she remained until 1985. Melbourne was capable of being reactivated as a helicopter-equipped anti-submarine warfare carrier within 26 weeks, but was never required to do so. A Sydney-based group proposed in 1984 to purchase Melbourne and operate her as a floating casino moored in international waters off Eden, New South Wales, but nothing came of this. Melbournes air wing was disbanded at HMAS Albatross on 2 July 1982, with the transfer of 805 Squadron's Skyhawks to 724 Squadron and 816 Squadron being absorbed into 851 Squadron. The Skyhawks remained in service as fleet support aircraft until 30 June 1984, while the Trackers were withdrawn from service on 31 August 1984 after being used as land-based <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales for the type. British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> market.|$|E
5|$|The lead ship of the class, INS Shivalik, was {{deployed}} in the North West Pacific for JIMEX 2012 (Japan-India Maritime Exercise) with four other ships which included , a Rajput-class guided missile destroyer, , a Deepak-class fleet tanker, and , a Kora-class corvette, and took part in India's first bi-lateral maritime exercise with Japan. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force (JMSDF) was represented by two destroyers, one <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> and a helicopter. After the deployment in the north Pacific, the battle group was {{deployed in}} the South China Sea. As part of India's Look East policy, the ships visited the Shanghai port on 13 June 2012, for a five-day goodwill tour. INS Shakti served as the fuel and logistics tanker to the three destroyers. The ships left the port on 17 June 2012. Before leaving the port, the ships conducted a routine passage exercise with the People's Liberation Army Navy.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} to purchase another twelve C-130s {{was announced in}} November 1964. At this time the C-130As were being used to supply the Australian forces engaged in the Vietnam War. This task demonstrated that the RAAF had insufficient long-ranged transport aircraft to simultaneously support overseas deployments and meet the force's domestic requirements in Australia. As a result, the Government decided to order twelve C-130E Hercules {{as part of a}} package of acquisitions for the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) that also included ten Lockheed P-3 Orion and fourteen Grumman S-2 Tracker <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft,</b> as well as twelve Hawker Siddeley HS 748 transports. The 14.7-million-pound contract for the new C-130s was signed on 9 February 1965. In contrast to the concerns raised by the government over the cost of purchasing the C-130As, this expansion of the Hercules force gained ready agreement, due in no small part to the benefits for the armed services, particularly the Australian Army, demonstrated by the first twelve aircraft. The long-serving C-130As were replaced by new Hercules in the late 1970s; twelve C-130Hs were ordered in June 1976 for a cost of $A86 million, and deliveries took place between July and October 1978.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} Australia {{continued}} to retain forces in Malaysia {{as part of}} the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack, with this commitment initially including significant air, ground and naval forces. However, these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973, and the two Mirage fighter squadrons in 1988. Since then a detachment of Orion <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft,</b> support personnel, and an infantry company known as Rifle Company Butterworth have been maintained, as well as occasional deployments of F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft. Australian submarines reportedly undertook a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War. Airforce and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region. Since then the Orions have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway, conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean, Strait of Malacca and South China Sea. They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force {{maintains}} several air bases, {{including three}} which are only occasionally activated. The RAAF's operational headquarters, Air Command, {{is located at}} RAAF Base Glenbrook near Sydney. The Air Force's combat aircraft are based at RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, Queensland, RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory and RAAF Base Williamtown near Newcastle, New South Wales. The RAAF's <b>maritime</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>aircraft</b> are based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide {{and most of its}} transport aircraft are based at RAAF Base Richmond in Sydney. RAAF Base Edinburgh is also home to the control centre for the Jindalee Operational Radar Network. Most of the RAAF's training aircraft are based at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth with the remaining aircraft located at RAAF Base East Sale near Sale, Victoria and RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF also maintains a network of bases in northern Australia to support operations to Australia's north. These bases include RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Townsville and three 'bare bases' in Queensland and Western Australia. Of the RAAF's operational bases, only Tindal is located near an area in which the service's aircraft might feasibly see combat. While this protects the majority of the RAAF's assets from air attack, most air bases are poorly defended and aircraft are generally hangared in un-hardened shelters.|$|E

40|$|The Airborne Mission System in {{military}} aircraft {{is a complex}} real time system consisting of a mission control computer, sensors, displays, controls, and data buses that provide interfaces between sub-systems. The complexity and real time requirements of Airborne Mission Systems represent major challenges to the Australian Defence Force during acquisition, upgrades, and maintenance. This has motivated research into the application of formal techniques to model the mission system architecture, and to investigate and predict the effects of avionics upgrades on the behaviour and performance of the integrated mission system. We are currently using Coloured Petri Nets to model and analyse Airborne Mission Systems. This paper presents two aspects of our ongoing research using Coloured Petri Nets. Firstly we present some analysis for a generic Airborne Mission system based on previously published model. Then we describe an initial application of our modelling framework to the AP- 3 C Orion <b>Maritime</b> <b>Patrol</b> <b>Aircraft's</b> Airborne Mission System. 1...|$|R
