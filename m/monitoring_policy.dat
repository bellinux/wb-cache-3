40|$|Purpose – The {{subject of}} cyber‐slacking has {{prompted}} many organizations to respond by enforcing or implementing policies that restrict internet access. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to empirically examine the impact of four internet <b>monitoring</b> <b>policies</b> on cyber‐slacking and work satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach – Employees working in medium‐size organizations in Lebanon were surveyed. Chi‐square tests, correlation, ANOVA, and regression analysis were used to test the hypothesis. Findings – Results indicated that having a free internet access had a positive relation with cyber‐slacking, leading to an increase in work satisfaction. The survey also indicated relationship with demographic factors. Research limitations/implications – Although the research provides useful insight on cyber‐slacking and <b>monitoring</b> <b>policies,</b> it is nevertheless restricted to Lebanese companies. Originality/value – This paper adds to the literature on cyber‐slacking by empirically testing the effect of different <b>monitoring</b> <b>policies.</b> PublishedN/...|$|R

50|$|<b>Monitoring</b> <b>policy</b> {{development}} and implementation is an integral component of the policy cycle and can be applied in sectors including agriculture, health, education, and finance. Policy monitoring can improve policy information, collaboration among stakeholders, {{and the use of}} evaluation techniques to provide feedback to reframe and revise policies.Waterman and Wood derived policy monitoring from agency theory, describing a process where policymakers monitor the actions of their bureaucratic agents who implement and enforce policies. This monitoring allows policymakers to compensate for their agents’ greater knowledge of the policy process, and enables them to be well-informed decision makers. Thus policy monitoring allows policymakers and interested actors to systematically examine the process of creating a policy, implementing it, and evaluating its effects.Policy monitoring activities can be used to collect and analyze data related to the {{development and}} implementation of specific policies. It can also help link policies to specific outcomes and help identify and evaluate policy impacts. Policy impacts can include specific changes in behavior (e.g., increased number of people wearing seatbelts), finances (e.g., increased tax revenue), health status or epidemiology (e.g., reduced number of new HIV infections) or other social indicators (e.g., reduced crime rates, reduced levels of pollution). Data from policy monitoring can be used to support advocacy efforts and guide the development of new, timely, and relevant policies. Policy monitoring should also include the identification of operational policy barriers that can be addressed through policy and program reform, and findings can support improved implementation of existing policies.|$|E
