5|$|The Australian Army {{generally}} had {{a long-standing}} policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States {{and some other}} countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN, which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period. The result was that when war came in 1939, the Army's equipment was of World War I vintage, and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms. Most equipment was obsolescent {{and had to be}} replaced, and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons, equipment and <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Some 2,860 <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division, but since a division's war establishment was around 3,000, this was only enough for training.

The aims of this research are 1) mapping <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery data as the distribution map and identifying <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot base on distrbution map; and 2) studying the correlation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with physical environment phenomena, i. e. land use type and settlement pattern. The research method consists of two parts; they are <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cluster analysis and the relation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery and physical environment analysis. <b>Motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cluster analysis is using distribution data, which analyzes the distribution into <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with nearest neighbor tehnique. Contingency coefficient and frequency distribution analysis is {{used to analyze the}} correlation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot and physical environment. Contingency coefficient is used to study the relation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot polygon with physical environment condition, whereas frequency distribution is used to study the distribution of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery in the hot spot with physical environment condition. Physical environment which consists of land use type, housing density, house regularity pattern, and the average of building size, are obtained from interpretation of black and white panchromatic aerial photograph year 2000, in the scale 1 : 20. 000. the most <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot is found on the settlement area, 68, 3 % from 378 <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cases in the hot spot. The seond level is found on the education area (16. 4 %). The most <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> hot spot in the settlement is found on the hight density and irregular settlement, which have big size buildings. The calculation of contingency coefficient shows that there was a significant correlation between <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with land use type and settlement pattern, but it has low correlation value. It means that land use type and settlement pattern have weak influence to the hot spot existence...|$|R

Color and/or texture of the real image at {{the position of the}} virtual image component is determined. Color and/or texture of the virtual image component is selected based on the color and/or texture of the real image at the position of the virtual image component. The virtual image component is compared with a part of the real image to an augmented reality image (ARB). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for manufacturing a technical component of a <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> or a <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> component (2) a device for manufacturing a technical component of a <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> or a <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> component.
