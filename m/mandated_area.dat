500|$|On 25 April 1920, the San Remo conference – an {{outgrowth}} of the Paris Peace Conference attended by the prime ministers of Britain, France and Italy, the , and the United States Ambassador to Italy – established the basic terms for three League of Nations mandates: a French mandate for Syria, and British mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine. With respect to Palestine, the resolution stated that the British were responsible for putting into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration. At the request of France, it was agreed that an undertaking was to be inserted in the mandate's procès-verbal that this would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The boundaries of Palestine were left unspecified, to [...] "be determined by the Principal Allied Powers." [...] Three months later, in July 1920, the French defeat of Faisal's Arab Kingdom of Syria precipitated the British need to know [...] "what is the 'Syria' for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?" [...] and [...] "does it include Transjordania?" [...] – it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating Transjordan with the <b>mandated</b> <b>area</b> of Palestine without adding it to the area of the Jewish National Home.|$|E

More so, ICRISAT WCA wishes to exemplify the importance and growing vulnerability of its <b>mandated</b> <b>area</b> [...] - the SAT which {{is home to a}} substantial majority of the truly poor people where population growth rates remain very high and the vulnerability of agriculture to the vagaries of weather and the potential of further climate change is high. Additionally, it wishes to articulate more clearly its alignment with the MDGs, CGIAR strategic directions and the new CGIAR System priorities. These are seen to be the necessary basis for future medium term planning (following the Governing Board’s advice in September 2005). These are viewed presently as suitable frameworks on which a robust research strategy can be formulated to account for changes in the likely external environment for the foreseeable future. Likewise, some refinement in earlier thinking is appropriate and timely in response to increasing globalization of markets, greater environmental insecurity, lower prices for agricultural commodities and higher fuel prices, new intellectual property right regimes, the growing importance biotechnology, and research partnerships health, ICT/KM and private sectors and finally the emergence of the Alliance for CGIAR centers (including associated centers such as AVRDC, IFDC) as a major driver in concerted research actions...|$|E

40|$|The phase I of the Consortium for Improving Agriculturebased Livelihoods in Central Africa (CIALCA) project, {{initiated}} in 2006, succeeded in (i) characterizing the target areas, (ii) developing and evaluating technologies for improved productivity of banana- and legume-based systems, (iii) promoting improved nutrition and farmer-market linkages, (iv) building capacity, mainly of national system scientists (18 students trained at M. Sc. or Ph. D. level) and farmer groups (130 farmer groups trained), and (v) initiating partnerships to reach scale. CIALCA-I also broke new ground by establishing effective partnerships between institutes {{of the three}} target countries, which resulted in successful collaboration, sharing of resources, experiences, and ideas.

2500|$|Because of the {{dependence}} of the region on Bow River irrigation water, in the early 21st century all three irrigation districts began to make major changes {{in order to continue}} to serve their large <b>mandated</b> <b>areas.</b> In 2006, {{as a part of the}} [...] "Water for Life Initiative", the Alberta government placed a moratorium on any new licenses for water use from the Bow, Oldman, and South Saskatchewan River basins.

40|$|This thesis {{chronicles the}} process of the {{desegregation}} of public recreation spaces in Baltimore from 1935 - 1956. The struggle against segregated public parks in Baltimore shows how actions by everyday people often set the agenda for the actions of institutional organizations like the NAACP, and how such efforts create social change in spaces outside of <b>mandated</b> <b>areas</b> of societal interactions. Without the general public supporting integration for themselves, places like parks would remain effectively segregated, even after discriminatory policies were removed. While a significant portion of this project relates to legal cases, these cases were brought forth only after protest actions by individuals and community-based organizations. The fight culminated in the official desegregation of public park facilities in 1955. Newspaper reports and the official minutes of the Baltimore Bureau of Recreation and Parks uncover the events of these protests; oral histories to bring to light the individual motivations which propelled such actions. Finally, local newspaper reports, oral histories, and published accounts of the events also create a broader picture of how the various communities in Baltimore viewed the fight to desegregate the public parks...|$|R
