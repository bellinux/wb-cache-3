25|$|Elsewhere in Europe the {{motorized}} bicycle {{continued to}} be popular, particularly in France and Italy. An Italian manufacturer, Vincenti Piatti, designed a 50cc engine for driving portable lathes and this was also used to power a bicycle frame {{in the form of}} the Mini Motore. Piatti later licensed the design to Trojan for production in Britain as the Trojan Minimotor. In West Germany, a compression-ignition (diesel) engine kit using an 18cc variable head engine made by Lohmann was produced during the 1950s. In France, where postwar reconstruction, taxes, and fuel shortages limited automobile access, motorized bicycle kits and complete models were produced by a variety of smaller manufacturers, often using a two-stroke gasoline engine mounted above the front wheel. In 1946, production of the very successful French VELOSOLEX commenced, continuing until 1988. The VéloSoleX was a mass-produced motorized bicycle that used a tire roller (friction drive) to the front wheel. After French production ceased, the VELOSOLEX {{continued to be}} produced in China and Hungary. An in-wheel gasoline engine was used on the Honda P50 moped, which ceased production in 1968. The velomoteur and <b>motor</b> <b>scooter</b> enjoyed a second renaissance in the 1960s and 1970s as a new generation of youth discovered they could ride a motorized vehicle without need of a driver's license. Other countries had relaxed licensing requirements, e.g. lower age limits for motorized bicycles, which increased their popularity.|$|E

[...] The company offices were on Kensington High Street, and Low spent much of his time trying to bring his inventions to fruition. [...] As usual though he was easily distracted by gadgets that he devised, taking his attention away from the more important work. [...] One of the better gadgets was a <b>motor</b> <b>scooter</b> that Low invented and manufactured in conjunction with Sir Henry Norman. Despite his best efforts, business wasn't his strong point. [...] An example of this is the magazine he started up with his friend Lord Brabazon and others. [...] It was entitled Armchair Science, Low helped edit it, and at one point the sales figures were 80,000 a month, yet it never seemed to make a profit and was sold off. [...] Another of Low's delights was speed, especially racing cars or motorbikes. [...] He was a regular attendee at Brooklands and at one point invented a rocket propelled bike and numerous other gadgets and improvements for the internal combustion engine. [...] An example of Low's prescience is that he was worried about the number of road traffic accidents that were occurring and believed speed in cities should be restricted to 25mph using modern radio methods to enforce it. [...] One of Low's peeves was excess noise, to this end he invented an audiometer to measure and record noise in a visual form. [...] He conducted experiments on the London Underground and achieved some success in pinpointing trouble spots and reducing their impact by use of shields over the wheels and padding of the interior panels. In 1938 Low had lunch with a gentleman called William Joyce. [...] Joyce wanted Low to contribute an article to a paper he helped run.

This guideline, however, offers the possibility of introducing a separate driving licence for light motorcycles for persons 16 years of age and older.
