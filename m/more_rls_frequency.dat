40|$|International audienceSeeding {{light from}} a laser into the cavity of a second one is a simple {{experiment}} largely encountered in optical domain (Stover, H. L., Steier, W. H. : Appl. Phys.

With an unidirectional coupling, optical injection is a basic tool to study synchronization process between oscillators. The dynamics induced in this experiment have been extensively described, theoretically and experimentally (Simpson, T. B. et al. : Quant.

In this paper, we describe the synchronization on an undamped relaxation regime. In order to study the degree of correlation between the two synchronized lasers (TL and RL), we use a cascade of two optical injections (Guignard, C. : Conference on Lasers and Electro Optics—the Europeen Quant. Electronics Conference (CLEO-EQEC), Munich (Germany), EC 1 M (2003)) thus three lasers: Master-transmitter laser (TL) -receiver laser (RL). The seeding by a field showing undamped relaxations can be directly compared with the optical injection by a CW signal, especially when the injected power and the detuning between the TL and <b>RL</b> <b>frequencies</b> are varied. Synchronization on undamped relaxation are shown to occur at values of the optical injected power and detuning, for which the RL is in the locked or wave-mixing regime when it is seeded by a CW. However, additional tongues of synchronization also exist at detuning equal to the relaxation oscillation frequency (ROF) ...|$|R

The Ni architectures, with {{lengths of}} about 20 &# 956;m and widths of 4 - 6 &# 956;m, were assembled from tens of Ni nanorods with the averaged diameter of about 200 nm. The Ni nanorods were coated by oxide shells. The saturation magnetization of the Ni architectures {{was found to}} be 66. 2 emu/g. The magnetic loss in the Ni architectures was mainly caused by the natural resonance, while the dielectric relaxation loss was originated from the interfacial relaxation between the oxide shells and the Ni nanorods in addition to the size distribution and morphology of the Ni architectures. Absorbers with a thickness of 2. 1 mm exhibited an optimal reflection loss (RL) value of - 38. 9 dB at 12. 8 GHz. RL values exceeding - 20 dB in the 8. 0 - 17. 8 GHz range were obtained by choosing absorber thicknesses between 1. 5 and 3. 2 mm.

The space vector modulation for the conventional voltage source inverter is modified so that the additional shoot-through states are inserted within the zero states. So zero voltage time period is diminished for generating a shoot-through time, and active states are unchanged. The shoot-through states are evenly distributed to each phase within zero state. The shoot-through time is used for controlling the dc link voltage boost and hence the output voltage boost of the inverter. This new method provides a high voltage gain at higher modulation index.

40|$|Substance {{dependent}} individuals (SDI) often exhibit decision-making deficits; however, {{it remains}} unclear whether {{the nature of the}} underlying decision-making processes is the same in users of different classes of drugs and whether these deficits persist after discontinuation of drug use. We used computational modeling to address these questions in a unique sample of relatively pure amphetamine-dependent (N= 38) and heroin-dependent individuals (N= 43) who were currently in protracted abstinence, and in 48 healthy controls. A Bayesian model comparison technique, a simulation method, and parameter recovery tests were used to compare three cognitive models: (1) Prospect Valence Learning with decay reinforcement learning rule (PVL-DecayRI), (2) PVL with delta learning rule (PVL-Delta), and (3) Value-Plus-Perseverance (VPP) models based on Win-Stay-Lose-Switch (WSLS) strategy. The model comparison results indicated that the VPP model, a hybrid model of reinforcement learning (RL) and a heuristic strategy of perseverance had the best post hoc model fit, but the two PVL models showed better simulation performance. Computational modeling results suggested that overall all three groups relied <b>more</b> on <b>RL</b> than on a WSLS strategy. Heroin users displayed reduced loss aversion relative to healthy controls across all three models, which suggests that their decision-making deficits are longstanding (or pre-existing) and may be driven by reduced sensitivity to loss. In contrast, amphetamine users showed comparable cognitive functions to healthy controls with the VPP model, whereas the second best-fitting model with relatively good simulation performance (PVL-DecayRI) revealed increased reward sensitivity relative to healthy controls. These results suggest that some decision-making deficits persist in protracted abstinence and may be mediated by different mechanisms in opiate and stimulant users...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep <b>RL</b> <b>more</b> reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.

40|$|The rolled (rl) gene of Drosophila encodes a {{homologue}} of vertebrate mitogen-activated protein kinases. Genetic analyses {{have shown}} that the gain-of-function mutation rolledSevenmaker (rlSem) is sufficient to activate developmental pathways controlled by distinct receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Sevenless, Torso, and the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor homologue. Here we show that mutant RlSem protein, immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected COS cells, exhibits a moderate increase in kinase activity compared with wild-type Rl protein. Time course studies revealed that RlSem is <b>more</b> active than <b>Rl</b> following short term as well as prolonged treatment with epidermal growth factor. Interestingly, a more pronounced difference in kinase activity is observed when the proteins are immunoprecipitated from extracts of Drosophila rl and rlSem larvae. In fact, the kinase activity of RlSem from larvae extracts is comparable to the kinase activity of larvae expressing either an activated Sevenless receptor or an activated Raf kinase. We also demonstrate that Dsor 1, which has been placed upstream of rl genetically, is able to phosphorylate and activate Rl in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement learning, {{function}} approximation, normalised radial basis function network, eligibility trace, mountain-car, cart-pole, pendulum. Despite {{the impressive}} achievements of reinforcement learning (RL) in playing Backgammon {{already in the}} beginning of the 90 ’s, relatively few successful real-world applications of RL have been reported since then. This could be due to the tendency of RL research to focus on discrete Markov Decision Processes that make it difficult to handle tasks with continuous-valued features. Another reason could be a tendency to develop continuously <b>more</b> complex mathematical <b>RL</b> models that are difficult to implement and operate. Both of these issues are addressed in this paper by using the gradient-descent Sarsa(λ) method together with a Normalised Radial Basis Function neural net. The experimental results on three typical benchmark control tasks show that these methods outperform most previously reported results on these tasks, while remaining computationally feasible to implement even as embedded software. Therefore the presented results can serve as a reference both regarding learning performance and computational applicability of RL for real-life applications. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} dependence of pulmonary compliance and resistance {{was investigated in}} 27 patients with obstructive lung disease. Compliance and resistance were determined either by the conventional zero crossing (Cdyn) and isovolume (RL) technique or by a modified Fourier analysis following a smoothing procedure (auto- and cross-correlation function) yielding an effective compliance and resistance, CL and RL. The latter technique was used to calculate CL and RL from the fundamental and third and fourth harmonics present in the flow and transpulmonary pressure signals. Three breathing frequencies were investigated: 0. 5, 1, and 2 Hz. Both Cdyn and CL, calculated from the fundamental component, decreased progressively with frequency. However, Cdyn showed less {{frequency dependence}} than CL. CL calculated from the harmonics was significantly smaller than CL from the fundamental at the same breathing <b>frequency.</b> <b>RL,</b> as well as RL calculated from the fundamental, tended to increase with frequency. A decline of resistance with frequency became apparent, however, when RL from the fundamental was compared with RL obtained from the corresponding higher order harmonics. These {{results suggest that the}} frequency dependence of resistance can be masked by the usual procedure of breathing at several frequencies. Instead the measurements should be performed at a single frequency, for instance spontaneous breathing, by computing resistance from the higher order harmonics present in the breathing signals. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) {{can be used}} {{to restore}} {{function}} in people living with paralysis. Current BMIs require extensive calibration that increase the set-up times and external inputs for decoder training that may be difficult to produce in paralyzed individuals. Both these factors have presented challenges in transitioning the technology from research environments to activities of daily living (ADL). For BMIs to be seamlessly used in ADL, these issues should be handled with minimal external input thus reducing the need for a technician/caregiver to calibrate the system. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based BMIs are a good tool to be used when there is no external training signal and can provide an adaptive modality to train BMI decoders. However, RL based BMIs are sensitive to the feedback provided to adapt the BMI. In actor-critic BMIs, this feedback is provided by the critic and the overall system performance is limited by the critic accuracy. In this work, we developed an adaptive BMI that could handle inaccuracies in the critic feedback in an effort to produce <b>more</b> accurate <b>RL</b> based BMIs. We developed a confidence measure, which indicated how appropriate the feedback is for updating the decoding parameters of the actor. The results show that with the new update formulation, the critic accuracy is no longer a limiting factor for the overall performance. We tested and validated the system on three different data sets: synthetic data generated by an Izhikevich neural spiking model, synthetic data with a Gaussian noise distribution, and data collected from a non-human primate engaged in a reaching task. All results indicated that the system with the critic confidence built in always outperformed the system without the critic confidence. Results of this study suggest the potential application of the technique in developing an autonomous BMI that does not need an external signal for training or extensive calibration...|$|R
30|$|Channel state {{information}} {{is one of}} the most important enablers for the application of the multibeam joint processing techniques. A specific part of the existing literature addresses the importance of CSI in MIMO systems, such as [21, 46 – 49]. In the context of SatComs, channel knowledge can be acquired at the end-user ground stations for the FL and then fed back to the gateway station (GS) for the <b>RL.</b> <b>More</b> specifically, CSI should be available at the GS so that multiuser precoding can be performed for the FL and joint decoding at the RL. Current standards are using pilot sequences, either available within the standard as an optional feature (i.e., for DVB-S 2) or defined within the specified requirements for the transmission burst structure of the Multi-Frequency Time Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA) return channel (i.e., for the DVB-RCS NG). A recent study for the effect of CSI in the satellite context can be found in [50], where the satellite link performance with and without CSI is compared and a technique for estimating CSI is proposed. Subsequently, the current state of the art reference transmission standards are well suited for the adaptation of the proposed multibeam satellite systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Motivated {{learning}} (ML) {{is a new}} biologically inspired {{machine learning}} method. It is {{the combination of a}} reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm and a system that creates hierarchy of goals. The goal creation system is concerned with creating new internal goals, building a hierarchy of them, and controlling the agent’s behavior according to this constituted hierarchy of goals. As in case of reinforcement learning method, a motivated learning agent is learning through interaction with the environment. The comparisons of both methods in special type test environment show that the motivated learning method is more efficient in learning complex relations between available resources (concepts). ML has better performance than RL, especially in dynamically changing environments. In the presented experiments we have shown that ML based agent, which has the ability to set its internal goals autonomously, is able to fulfill the designer’s goals <b>more</b> effectively than <b>RL</b> based agent. In addition, because the observed concepts are not predefined but emerge during the learning process, this method also addresses problem of merging connectionist and symbolic approaches for intelligent autonomous systems.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the variability in}} the occurrence of energetic storm particle (ESP) events associated with shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The interplanetary shocks were detected during the pe-riod from 1996 to 2006. First we analyze the CME properties near the Sun. The CMEs with an ESP-producing shock are faster (〈VCME 〉 = 1088 km/s) than those driving shocks without an ESP event (〈VCME 〉 = 771 km/s) and have a larger fraction of halo CMEs (67 % vs. 38 %). The Alfvénic Mach numbers of shocks with an ESP event are on average 1. 6 times {{higher than those of}} shocks without. We also contrast the ESP event properties and fre-quency in shocks with and without a type II radio burst by dividing the shocks into radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) shocks, respectively. The shocks seem to be organized into a decreasing sequence by the energy content of the CMEs: RL shocks with an ESP event are driven by the most energetic CMEs, followed by RL shocks without an ESP event, then RQ shocks with and with-out an ESP event. The ESP events occur <b>more</b> often in <b>RL</b> shocks than i...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis was to investigate a shallow coastal region to compile a detailed environmental picture of its sediment composition and water characteristics and from this model MCM sonar performance at the FBE-H exercise location {{as a means to}} determine what parameters exerted the greatest effect on performance. Seven parameters were intercompared to assess their sensitivity in detecting mines: bottom type, SSP, water depth/sonar depth, mine depth, frequency, sonars and models. Performance was assessed using several measures of effectiveness including the signal to noise ratio and initial detection range. Variations in these measures were analyzed by investigating how TL and RL responded to changing parameters. No one single parameter was identified that affected sonar performance significantly above all others. Of the environmental parameters considered, variations in bottom type exerted the most influence on TL and RL and ultimately on sonar performance. IL was clearly a significant factor when the bottom type is comprised of absorptive, fine- grained material. Of the sonar parameters, frequency exerted a significant impact on performance with TL the most sensitive term in this comparison. A higher TL associated with higher frequency reduced the signal level and consequently the bottom <b>RL.</b> The higher <b>frequency</b> displayed a stronger SNR than the lower frequency over short ranges, however the higher frequency was limited by TL at greater ranges with the lower frequency achieving greater initial detection ranges[URL] Royal Australian Nav...|$|R
40|$|The reverse {{logistics}} (RL) of aircrafts pose {{a big challenge}} to its owners due {{to the complexity of}} its RL network, and the inherit problems of realizing a reliable system for efficiently monitoring and tracking the numerous parts of end-of-life (EOL) aircrafts in the <b>RL</b> network. Radio <b>frequency</b> identification (RFID) technology, through its automatic and wireless data capture capability, offers great potential for counteracting this problem. Although widespread and cost-effective, traditional barcode system, unlike RFID technology, requires manual scanning and line-of-sight for its use. In this research, thorough review of literature was conducted to identify the technological and economical impacts of RFID technology in both forward and RL network, and the knowledge acquired was employed to develop a scenario based approach for determining suitable RFID solutions for use in different sections of the EOL aircraft RL network. Process maps for case-level barcode tagging, item-level RFID tagging, case-level RFID tagging and pallet-level RFID tagging in EOL aircraft RL were developed and simulated in Arena simulation software in order to comparatively analyze the Return-On-Investment (ROI) of the different RFID technology levels. The results of our research, focusing on passive RFID technology, demonstrate that use of RFID technology in EOL aircraft RL network offers great potential compared to barcode system; however, the high initial investment cost of RFID technology deployment may necessitate proper planning, such as business process re-engineering (BPR), tag reuse and phased implementation, to achieve more positive ROI. ...|$|R
