2500|$|When {{television}} came to Australia in 1956, many radio figures {{sought and}} achieved {{employment in the}} new medium. Pearce was no exception, moving to HSV Channel 7 in Melbourne working as a newsreader and quiz show host. Pearce provided the first TV news report for that channel on 4 November 1956. The Argus reviewer F. Keith Manzie described Melbourne's first TV broadcast [...] "I liked Eric Pearce as a compere. His easy-mannered, genial personality came right through the viewing screen in the quiz show, I've Got a Secret ... reading of the news was illustrated with appropriate newsreel shots". In 1956 he was also co-host of the series Eric and Mary, and in 1957 he was host of Be <b>My</b> <b>Guest.</b> Pearce resigned from HSV-7 in the late 1950s. He believed that newsreaders required credibility and that doing anything other than news for a job was ill-advised. When GTV Channel 9 offered him employment as chief news reader without him having to do any other shows, he took it. In 1961, he appeared in Let Me Read to You, {{in which he would}} read from popular works.|$|E

40|$|This final project {{report was}} written {{based on my}} {{internship}} experience at Great Tour and Travel Yogyakarta. The objectives were to practice the activities as a tour guide, {{to find out the}} problems and solutions as a tour guide The first step in job training, I escorted the senior tour guide. I could know the activities of tour guide in a tour. It was used as a reference for guiding the guests. In guiding process, there were three steps i. e. (1) Preparation: I saw the schedule of the tour for the day after. The schedule was written on the whiteboard by receptionist. After I knew my tour for tomorrow, I prepared the list of the guests and their hotel names,(2) Method of the tour:I picked up the guests at their hotel one by one. After all the guests were already in the car, I introduced myself and my driver. After that, I explained about the schedule, regulation, and interesting object. Then, when we arrived in the tourism destinations, I gave explanation about the general information, entrance fee and meeting point of the tourism destination, and (3) Closing: I thanked and said goodbye to all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> who joined Great Tour and Travel tour. There were three problems in my internship experience as a tour guide in Great Tour and Travel. The first problem was that not all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> could speak English. To overcome this problem, I communicated with them using body language. The second problem was neither I nor all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> was not a native speaker so we had restrictiveness about English vocabulary. To solve the problem, I used an online dictionary in my smartphone. The third problem was <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> felt uncomfortable with my driver who drove too fast. In this situation, I tried to convince all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> that they would be okay...|$|R
