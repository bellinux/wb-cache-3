5|$|Flux-cored welding {{machines}} are most popular at the hobbyist level, as the machines are slightly simpler but <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> they avoid {{the cost of}} providing shield gas, either through a rented cylinder or with {{the high cost of}} disposable cylinders.|$|E
5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to be controversial after his fighting career was over, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of the vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} consists {{largely of}} salt marsh plants. In June the area colors <b>mainly</b> purple <b>because</b> of the Sea-lavender. In October it is <b>mainly</b> red <b>because</b> of the Common glasswort. Sea-buckthorn also grows here.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} fossil sharks, Xenacanthus is <b>mainly</b> known <b>because</b> of fossilised teeth and spines.|$|R
50|$|Phoma glomerata is {{a fungus}} {{pathogen}} with several hosts. It spoils <b>mainly</b> wool <b>because</b> it badly alters the fibers.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{silicon carbide}} was studied in several {{research}} programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The components {{were intended to}} replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or nozzle vanes. However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{visited the}} University of Florida, Florida State University, the University of Miami, and Michigan State University before he {{committed}} to the University of California, Los Angeles to play football for the Bruins. He chose {{to play on the}} West Coast <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of the opportunities presented for his career after football.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Union of Postal Workers {{objected to}} the {{automated}} sorting system <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> the wages of those who ran the new automated machines were much lower {{than those who had}} hand-sorted mail.|$|E
50|$|Carbonyl substituents are <b>mainly</b> {{destabilizing}} <b>because</b> of {{the highly}} partially positive carbonyl carbon beside the vinyl cation and no p donation.|$|R
50|$|In April 2014, Landmark Media Investments {{announced}} 55 - 60 {{job cuts}}. The job cuts were <b>mainly</b> caused <b>because</b> of efficiencies {{due to the}} centralisation of activities in Cork.|$|R
50|$|The {{party is}} <b>mainly</b> {{significant}} <b>because</b> key members Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak {{would go on}} to lead the right-wing coup of 1970 against Sihanouk and his Sangkum regime.|$|R
5|$|Two rows of {{alternating}} plates. By {{the early}} 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> some S. stenops fossils {{in which the}} plates are still partially articulated show this arrangement. This arrangement is chiral and so demands that a specimen be distinguished from its distinct, hypothetical mirror-image form.|$|E
5|$|Vesta, the next-most-massive {{body in the}} {{asteroid}} belt after Ceres, is roughly spherical, deviating <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of massive impacts that formed Rheasilvia and Veneneia crater after it solidified. Furthermore, its triaxial dimensions are not consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|According to the church, its {{membership}} as of 2016 was 63,392, which represented approximately 60 percent of Tonga's population. The church also reported 166 congregations, one mission, and one temple. However, {{according to the}} 2011 Tongan census, 18,554 people self-identify as Mormon, making it the second-largest religion in the country, ahead of Catholicism and behind Methodism. LDS Church membership statistics are different from self-reported statistics, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> the LDS Church does not remove an individual's name from {{its membership}} rolls based on disengagement from the church.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of its river {{contacts}} and extensive trade with the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade with the South came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E
5|$|Between 2004 and 2005, the aqueduct's {{surviving}} arches were {{restored and}} a lighting system was installed, {{at a total}} cost of Lm 140,000. Some of the arches {{are in need of}} restoration once again, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of pollution since a major road now runs alongside the aqueduct. A section of the aqueduct was extensively damaged in December 2013 due to a car crash, but the damage has since been repaired.|$|E

50|$|His poetry has absurdist, conceptualist and lyrical {{elements}} {{and seems to}} {{have little to do}} with his public stunts that, some argue, are <b>mainly</b> there <b>because</b> of his contempt for the Dutch world of literature, a feature he shares with Dutch poet Gerrit Komrij.|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} were attracted to Banagher, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. As {{with the majority of}} towns and cities in Ireland, Banagher has seen an influx of foreign nationals, mostly of Eastern European origin, in recent years and these now make up just over 10% of the population.|$|E
5|$|In October 1588 the Diet {{proposed}} {{to declare the}} sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania. He did not accept the offer, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> {{he did not want}} to expel his confessor, Alfonso Carillo. The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not to resist the Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.|$|E
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are beneficial to health <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E
50|$|A Degree of Murder (Mord und Totschlag, Vivre à tout prix) is a 1967 West German film, {{starring}} Anita Pallenberg {{and directed}} by Volker Schlöndorff.

5|$|Nor, {{unlike their}} European counterparts, did American generals and admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> in the frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, {{there was no}} requirement to do so. This began to change after the Spanish-American War, when American military forces started to be deployed overseas in the Pacific, Asia and the Caribbean for extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|On the 1895 Mazamas expedition, {{the first}} {{heliography}} between {{several of the}} peaks of the Cascades was attempted with some success. A party on Mount Hood was able to communicate {{back and forth with}} the party on Mount Adams, but the parties on Rainier, Baker, Jefferson, and Diamond Peak were not successful, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of dense smoke and logistical problems.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, <b>mainly</b> <b>because</b> of {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been {{nearly impossible to}} strike. Nevertheless, its colourful bark and leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
50|$|The place kick, usually {{associated}} with rugby league, rugby union and gridiron was used in Aussie Rules for many years, particularly for kicking out after a behind had been scored. It was <b>mainly</b> favoured <b>because</b> of the distance the ball would travel after being place kicked. It was rarely used after the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The {{cold spot}} is <b>mainly</b> {{anomalous}} <b>because</b> it stands out {{compared to the}} relatively hot ring around it; {{it is not unusual}} if one only considers the size and coldness of the spot itself. More technically, its detection and significance depends on using a compensated filter like a Mexican hat wavelet to find it.|$|R
50|$|The {{railway station}} {{was built in}} the late 19th century and got its name after the {{historical}} Gömör county. It was <b>mainly</b> important <b>because</b> it connected the mines and metal factories of Gömör to the city. The railway lines between Miskolc and the towns of Bánréve and Fülek (today: Fiľakovo) were constructed in the 1870s.|$|R
