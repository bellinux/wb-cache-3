50|$|The fully {{interlocking}} McKenzie and Holland 20-lever {{mechanical signal}} frame in the signal cabin at the Charters Towers Railway Station {{is a rare}} surviving example of an operational mechanical safety system for <b>managing</b> <b>railway</b> traffic. The levers on the signal frame work an underfloor interlocking mechanism which is linked to points (tapering rails, used to transfer the train from one set of tracks to another), points indicators, crossing lights and signals around the railway station.

50|$|The Sentul station as a {{building}} has existed since Sentul {{was used as}} a central workshop and depot for Federated Malay States Railway trains, but was not demolished and replaced during the 1989-1995 Klang Valley electrification and double-tracking project. Rather, the building was retained and retrofitted to support access to KTM Komuter services, with the addition of faregates and the upgrading of the ticket office. The station is also one of a few remaining stations designated in the Komuter system to be constructed of wood. Although located along more than three railway tracks and located beside a major depot, the station is fashioned as a modestly sized station, with room for only a waiting area and two-room office space. The station was, nevertheless, in charge of <b>managing</b> <b>railway</b> switches and supports a small railway staff.|$|E
40|$|AbstractControl of {{railway noise}} is very {{significant}} part of the urban traffic policy. An increase of railway noise could significantly reduce {{the quality of life of}} citizens. This paper analyzes and suggests necessary measures for <b>managing</b> <b>railway</b> noise and traffic safety by rail inspection and grinding. It considers and suggests inspection methods for early detection of head checking (HC) rail defects. Otherwise, HC defects could lead to rail cracks and breakages that might endanger the traffic safety. In addition, this paper examines the real limits of non-destructive methods for detecting HC defects in track in service. Combining several non-destructive inspection methods and rail grinding are recommended for efficient railway noise control in the urban area...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{construction}} of railways in China has posed tremendous challenges for <b>managing</b> <b>railway</b> construction projects, especially their progress. Frequently changed schedule, complicated contents, and error-prone data have practically hampered {{the efforts to}} automatically generate progress reports on railway construction projects within the country. In this paper, {{we set out to}} explore the linkages among current data from Chinese railway construction units on inspection lots, construction drawings, and construction schedules, which are used to establish an engineering quantity computation model and automatic project progress report model. An automatic progress report generation system for railway construction projects was developed to generate a wide range of standard progress reports. Practical applications showed that the proposed system offers an alternative to hardware-based methods of progress report generation and can significantly improve the accuracy of data and the quality of management regarding project progress...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of a labor union in a company has very important roles, especially in this reformation era. It also {{takes place in a}} state company <b>managing</b> <b>railway</b> transportation services. Started by common awareness among the big family of PT. Kereta Api (Persero), a thought to make an institution for accommodating employees' aspirations has developed, which is officially established on November 13, 1999, named Serikat Pekerja Kereta Api (SPKA), resulting in the First National Discussion in Bandung. With a change in the status of the company, many problems relating to the change in employees' status occurred with consequences in salary and other prosperity problems. Therefore, the roles of a labor union are urgently required to assist employees in solving their prosperity problems. Hopefully, through the labor union activities, employees' prosperity increases. The objective of this research is to find out the influences of the labor union activities on employees' prosperity rate; while the benefits are to increase writer's knowledge and insight, as well as to help the company in improving the programs of its labor union, and finally, to be a reference to others. The type used in this research is explanatory research explaining the relationship between two or more variables. Samples are collected using simple random sampling technique to 211 population, resulting in 68 samples. Data collection techniques used are interviews, questionnaire, and bibliographical study. The collected data had gone through qualitative and quantitative analysis using cross table, validity and reliability tests, simple coefficient, determined coefficient, and hypothesis tests with t-test test using SPSS program as analyzing instruments. The result of the research state that, from the labor union activities of PT. Kereta Api (Persero) Daop IV Semarang, the obtained regressive equation is: y = 10, 221 + 0, 206 x, which means, there are significant and positive influences of the variable of the labor union activities on the employees' prosperity rate. PT. Kereta Api (Persero) Daop IV Semarang should be able to increase employees' prosperity through the addition of type and amount of allowances given to them...|$|E
