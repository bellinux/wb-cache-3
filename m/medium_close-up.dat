5000|$|Umboh, {{as usual}} for him, used mainly <b>medium</b> and <b>close-up</b> shots; Noer {{considered}} the effect overdone, and {{wrote that the}} film could have been improved with longer-range shots. The film is interspersed with songs, both traditional and modern.|$|R
5000|$|Most early filmmakers—such as Thomas Edison, Auguste and Louis Lumière and Georges Méliès—tended {{not to use}} close-ups and {{preferred}} to frame their subjects in long shots, similar to the stage. Film historians disagree as to which filmmaker first used a close-up. One of the best claims is for George Albert Smith in Hove, who used <b>medium</b> <b>close-ups</b> in films as early as 1898 and by 1900 was incorporating extreme close-ups in films such as As Seen Through a Telescope and Grandma's Reading Glass. In 1901, James Williamson, also working in Hove, made perhaps the most extreme close-up of all in The Big Swallow, when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. D. W. Griffith, who pioneered screen cinematographic techniques and narrative format, is associated with popularizing the close up {{with the success of}} his films. For example, one of Griffith's short films, The Lonedale Operator (1911), makes significant use of a close-up of a wrench that a character pretends is a gun. Lillian Gish remarked on Griffith's pioneering use of the close-up: ...|$|R
50|$|All {{sorts of}} camera shots {{are used in}} the film. Some of which include extreme long shots, medium long shots, {{full-body}} shots, close-ups, <b>medium</b> <b>close-up,</b> and so on.

By this, would emphasize pure happiness and freedom that he had not felt in a long time.|$|E

However, he preferred shooting films with a social message; he considered Pengemis dan Tukang Becak his favourite film. When shooting, Umboh minimised his use of master shots, instead preferring to use <b>medium</b> and <b>close-up</b> shots; his obituary in Kompas notes that around 80per cent of any given Umboh film used these latter two shots.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{scene where}} Faith in Buffy's body tries to seduce Riley, the camera [...] "cuts to a <b>medium</b> <b>close-up</b> shot of her leather-clad backside", ostensibly Riley's point-of-view shot. Jason Middleton notes {{that this is a}} rare case where the audience's gaze is [...] "positioned in a highly fetishistic {{relation}} towards Buffy's body". However, Middleton notes, the show disavows this viewing position by reminding the audience that it is Faith's positioning the body, connoting its [...] "look-at-me-ness"; Buffy herself is disconnected from this image of her body. Riley, with whom the viewer is identified, disavows the shot by appearing confused and taken aback rather than sexually predatory. Middleton concludes this covertly allows [...] "a scopophilic position ... for the viewer, even as the show disavows this position".|$|E
5000|$|The Old Maid's Valentine is a 1900 British short silent comedy film, {{directed}} by George Albert Smith, which features the titular Miss Pimple receiving an unpleasant surprise on 14 February. The film, according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, [...] "is essentially a facial - a <b>medium</b> <b>close-up</b> {{shot of a}} single performer whose changing expression constitutes virtually all the film's dramatic action." [...] David Fisher points out that, [...] "the flapping of the {{sheet of paper and}} the movement of the calendar betray the open-air set," [...] which, [...] "makes it difficult to read the message: Just like Mama," [...] whilst, [...] "the remarkably well-behaved cat," [...] which, [...] "sits patently licking its paws," [...] "suggests that Smith may have already learned the trick of smearing the cat's fur with food." ...|$|E
500|$|Captain America: Civil War was {{the first}} film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in {{partnership}} with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having [...] "incredible scale to it" [...] and referred to by the directors as the [...] "splash panel", were shot with the cameras. Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close {{it was to the}} start of shooting as well as the idea being [...] "such a large-scale undertaking", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Aleax 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use <b>medium</b> <b>close-ups</b> instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, [...] "maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to take it all in." ...|$|R
500|$|An authoritarian {{director}} who strove for perfection, Umboh {{was known for}} experimenting with different technologies and, according to fellow director Teguh Karya, memorised the entire dialogue of his films during shooting. He preferred <b>medium</b> and <b>close-up</b> shots. Umboh influenced numerous Indonesian directors, including Karya, Slamet Rahardjo, Garin Nugroho, and Arifin C. Noer, and his work launched the careers of several Indonesian stars, including Sophan Sophiaan and Roy Marten. Among his most famous works are [...] (Teenage Bride; 1971), Mama (1972), and [...] (The Beggar and the Pedicab Driver; 1978), the last of which was Umboh's personal favourite.|$|R

50|$|Designers of zoom lenses {{with large}} zoom ratios often trade {{one or more}} aberrations for higher image sharpness. For example, {{a greater degree of}} barrel and pincushion {{distortion}} is tolerated in lenses that span the focal length range from wide angle to telephoto with a focal ratio of 10× or more than would be acceptable in a fixed focal length lens or a zoom lens with a lower ratio. Although modern design methods have been continually reducing this problem, barrel distortion of greater than one percent is common in these large-ratio lenses. Another price paid is that at the extreme telephoto setting of the lens the effective focal length changes significantly while the lens is focused on closer objects. The apparent focal length can more than halve while the lens is focused from infinity to <b>medium</b> <b>close-up.</b> To a lesser degree, this effect is also seen in fixed focal length lenses that move internal lens elements, rather than the entire lens, to effect changes in magnification.|$|E

In this work we investigate four different inherent characteristics of single shots which contain indirect information about scene depth, without the need to recover the 3 D structure of the scene as a prior step. Specifically, 2 D scene geometric composition, frame colour properties, shot motion distribution and content are considered for classifying shots into three main categories.

On this basis, we here investigate the use of camera distance in famous movie scenes, highlighting the relations between the employed shot types and the affective responses by a large audience. Results obtained by using statistical classifiers suggest that patterns of shot types constitute a key element in inducing affective reactions in the audience, with strong evidences especially on the arousal dimension. Findings are applicable to support systems for media affective analysis, and to better define emotional models for video content understanding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} the design project {{of a camera}} support structure for a Virtual Studio (VS). A brief description of VS is presented regarding both the equipment needed and the {{issues related to the}} correct matching of real foreground with virtual background. Given this scenario, an important role is covered by the camera supporting structure that allows a more correct execution of the standard filmmaking shots such as: <b>medium</b> shot, <b>close-up,</b> low/high angle shot and tracking shot. The work shows how the structure design has been carried through the Axiomatic Design focusing on how a coupled and a redundant design have been identified and solved. The approach has led to a significantly different design from classic camera support structures such as Cranes and Jibs and advanced Motion Control Rigs used in cinematography. The complexity reduction compared to Motion Control Rigs makes the designed structure suitable for a low budget VS set up...|$|R
