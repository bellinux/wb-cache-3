A developed concept of fourth generation low temperature district heating with supply temperature just above the required end user conditions allows for heat loss reduction, increases the plant room efficiency and enables the integration of alternative energy source for heat production. Due to the lowered temperature approach the cost of the in-house substation increases. This paper presents analysis of the cost increase of the in-house heat substation to enable the cost-benefit analysis of next generation district heating systems while considering new and refurbished systems.

40|$|Deterioration of freeway {{traffic flow}} {{condition}} due to bottlenecks can be ameliorated with ramp metering. A challenge in ramp metering {{is that it}} is not possible to process data in real-time and use the output in a control algorithm. This is due to the fact that by the time processing is completed and a control measure applied, the traffic state will have changed. A solution to this problem is to forecast the traffic state and implement a control measure based on the forecast. A dual-state Kalman filter was used to forecast traffic data at two locations on a freeway (I- 84). A Kalman filter is an optimal recursive data processing algorithm; predictions are based on only the previous time-step’s prediction and all previous data do not need to be stored and reprocessed with new measurements. A coordinated feedback ramp metering control logic was implemented. The closed-loop system seeks to control the traffic density on the mainline while minimizing on-ramp queues through weighting functions. The integration of the Kalman filter with the ramp <b>meter</b> <b>control</b> logic accomplishes the ramp meter algorithmic scheme in which is proactive to changes in freeway conditions by controlling a forecasted state. In this closed-loop framework, real-time forecasts are produced with a continuously updated prediction that minimizes errors and recursively improves with each successive measurement.

Non-lethal methods of control are desired to meet changing management objectives for the black-tailed prairie dog. The use of naturally occurring buffer strips as vegetative barriers may be effective in limiting prairie dog town expansion. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate effective width of vegetative barriers in limiting prairie dog towns expansion in western South Dakota; and 2) to document effect native vegetation height on expansion of prairie dog towns in western South Dakota. Five study sites were established in western South Dakota on rangelands containing prairie dog towns of adequate size. Electric fences were constructed {{for the purpose of}} excluding cattle and creating buffer strips of native grasses and shrubs. Prairie dogs were poisoned to create a prairie dog free buffer zone adjacent to active prairie dog towns. Grazing was allowed {{on both sides of the}} buffer strip.

40|$|Abstract: The {{steadily}} increasing numbers and lengths of traffic jams on freeways {{have led to}} the application of Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) measures all over the world. Ramp <b>metering</b> <b>control</b> has proven {{to be one of the}} most efficient means to reduce freeway congestion. Currently, it is expected that integrated and coordinated application of DTM measures will further improve its impact. This paper studies a coordinated ramp <b>metering</b> <b>control</b> algorithm called HERO/RWS. This algorithm has been developed for the current Dutch ramp metering systems and it will be applied on the Amsterdam A 10 freeway network in the near future. The aim of this algorithm is to postpone congestion on freeways by effectively using ramp storage space from upstream on-ramps. VISSIM-based microscopic simulation results show that the HERO/RWS coordinated control outperforms non-coordinated ramp <b>metering</b> <b>control.</b> Parameter settings have been optimized for the specific A 10 -west network through a robustness study.
