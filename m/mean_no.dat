It was vital that the soldiers were well trained for these conditions. If a man was left behind in the inhospitable Sinai, he might die in the burning desert sun during the day, or bitter cold at night. If a water bottle was accidentally tipped up or leaked, it could <b>mean</b> <b>no</b> water for its owner, for perhaps 24 hours in extreme temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group <b>mean</b> <b>no</b> harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|Vorster and the SACA {{followed}} D'Oliveira's form closely {{throughout the}} tour of West Indies and into the 1968 season. D'Oliveira's lack of success prompted press speculation that he might lose his England place for entirely non-political reasons, but Vorster {{was convinced that the}} MCC were committed to selecting him under any circumstances. He therefore conceived a two-pronged plan to prevent D'Oliveira's selection for the 1968–69 tour. He and the SACA would attempt to bribe D'Oliveira to make himself unavailable, while simultaneously persuading the English selectors—or more specifically the MCC, who Vorster believed would determine selection policy—not to choose him. The latter part of the plan depended on the MCC realising that picking D'Oliveira would <b>mean</b> <b>no</b> tour, but in making such attempts the South Africans risked public discovery, which would cause the tour to be cancelled anyway.|$|E

25|$|Most dry {{materials}} in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, {{can have a}} coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would <b>mean</b> <b>no</b> friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that µ is always < 1, {{but this is not}} true. While in most relevant applications µ < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the normal force of the surface on the object. For example, silicone rubber or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.|$|E

500|$|Many {{outside the}} {{community}} were critical of Brook Farm, {{especially in the}} press.

Critic Edgar Allan Poe expressed his opinions on the community in an article titled [...] "Brook Farm" [...] in the December 13, 1845, issue of the Broadway Journal. He wrote that he had [...] "sincere respect" [...] for the group and that its journal, The Harbinger, was [...] "conducted by an assemblage of well-read persons who <b>mean</b> <b>no</b> harm—and who, perhaps, can do no less".

500|$|Turn Based - Much like in Dungeons and Dragons {{this method}} of {{conflict}} resolution is taken in turns. This combat format is the primary system used in Theater-style LARPs. How turns work {{and what can be}} done during each turn is determined by the creator's of the game. Generally, who goes first is determined by some form of indicator and in the case of LARPs it is usually who acts first, this begins the engagement, essentially giving them an opportunity attack. Movement during a turn is determined by that character's movement speed, while actions are can be either consistent and unchanged rules or character specific. Each individual in the conflict has certain actions they can take on their turn. Chess is an example of a turn based game where who goes first is determined by the color of the pieces. That player now gets to make their movement, which in this case movement is synonymous to action. After their action resolves the other player's turn begins. This differs from the 'No-Touch' System, because a Turn Based LARP does not also <b>mean</b> <b>no</b> touching, although it can. An action from one character could end with their hand on the other character's shoulder. An example of a LARP that utilizes this system is the Otakon convention which also has its [...]|$|E
