25|$|Fly ash {{material}} solidifies while {{suspended in}} the exhaust gases and is collected by electrostatic precipitators or filter bags. Since the particles solidify rapidly while {{suspended in the}} exhaust gases, fly ash particles are generally spherical in shape and {{range in size from}} 0.5 µm to 300µm. The major consequence of the rapid cooling is that few minerals have time to crystallize, and that mainly amorphous, quenched glass remains. Nevertheless, some refractory phases in the pulverized coal do not melt (entirely), and remain crystalline. In consequence, fly ash is a heterogeneous material. SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3 and occasionally CaO are the main chemical components present in fly ashes. The mineralogy of fly ashes is very diverse. The main phases encountered are a glass phase, together with quartz, <b>mullite</b> and the iron oxides hematite, magnetite and/or maghemite. Other phases often identified are cristobalite, anhydrite, free lime, periclase, calcite, sylvite, halite, portlandite, rutile and anatase. The Ca-bearing minerals anorthite, gehlenite, akermanite and various calcium silicates and calcium aluminates identical to those found in Portland cement can be identified in Ca-rich fly ashes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mullite</b> or porcelainite {{is a rare}} {{silicate}} mineral of post-clay genesis. It {{can form}} two stoichiometric forms 3Al2O32SiO2 or 2Al2O3 SiO2. Unusually, <b>mullite</b> has no charge balancing cations present. As a result, there are three different aluminium sites: two distorted tetrahedral and one octahedral.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mullite</b> {{morphology}} is {{also important}} for its application. In this case, there are two common morphologies for <b>mullite.</b> One is a platelet shape with low aspect ratio {{and the second is}} a needle shape with high aspect ratio. If the needle shape <b>mullite</b> can form in a ceramic body during sintering, it has an effect on both the mechanical and physical properties by increasing the mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance. The most important condition relates to ceramic chemical composition. If the silica and alumina ratio with low basic materials such as sodium and calcium is adjusted, the needle shape <b>mullite</b> forms at about 1400 °C and the needles will interlock. This mechanical interlocking contributes to the high mechanical strength of porcelain.|$|E

50|$|The overall {{shape of}} the sample {{assembly}} is a cube (typically around 6mm), this shape allows {{for each of the}} 6 anvils to make contact with each face of the sample assembly. The outer portion of the sample assembly is the pressure medium, which is commonly either boron epoxy (BE) or <b>mullite.</b> The choice of pressure medium used in the sample assembly depends on the ultimate goal of the experiment. Boron epoxy is a self gasketing material in the D-DIA, which means it can produce a seal between all the anvils during deformation, but it has been shown to impart a significant amount of water to the sample during the experiment. This added water to the sample makes it impossible to conduct rheology experiments under anhydrous conditions. The other pressure medium material, <b>mullite,</b> leaves the sample very dry, but does not have the ability to self-gasket in the D-DIA. For this reason, when <b>mullite</b> is used as a pressure medium it needs to be used in combination with a gasket material. Typically the gasket material used is pyrophyllite, and the <b>mullite</b> will be machined into a sphere which sits in pyrophyllite “seats”, forming a cube.|$|E

5000|$|A Hessian {{crucible}} {{is a type}} {{of ceramic}} crucible that was manufactured in the Hesse region of Germany from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance period. They were renowned for their ability to withstand very high temperatures, rapid changes in temperature, and strong reagents. These crucibles were widely used for alchemy and early metallurgy. Millions of the vessels were exported throughout Europe, Scandinavia, and the colonies in the Americas. The crucibles were made by firing kaolinitic clay at temperatures greater than 1100℃, forming <b>mullite.</b> <b>Mullite</b> is an aluminum silicate only described in the 20th century and is responsible for the excellent properties of the Hessian crucible.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{sillimanite}} rocks {{cut into}} the required shape and size are used mainly in glass industries. Sillimanite is the best raw material for the manufacture of high alumina refractories or 55-60% alumina bricks. But its use on large scale is not possible due to its fine grading and high cost.Dumortierite and <b>mullite</b> are similar mineral species found in porcelain.|$|E
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1968, when the {{large-scale}} mining of kaolin, bauxitic kaolin, and bauxite was begun by Mulcoa, <b>Mullite</b> Company of America, that the town was dramatically altered.

50|$|By {{the late}} Medieval period steel {{production}} {{had moved from}} India to modern-day Uzbekistan where new materials were {{being used in the}} production of steel crucibles, for example <b>Mullite</b> crucibles were introduced. These were sandy clay crucibles which had been formed around a fabric tube.

50|$|<b>Mullite</b> is a {{compound}} of alumina and silica, with the formula 3Al2O3-2SiO2. It has a low density, along with good mechanical properties, high thermal stability, low thermal conductivity, and is corrosion and oxidation resistant. However, it suffers from crystallization and volume contraction above 800C, which leads to cracking and delamination. Therefore, this material is suitable as a zirconia alternative for applications such as diesel engines, where surface temperatures are relatively low and temperature variations across the coating may be large.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{first the}} {{processing}} of particulate composites. The particulate phase of greatest interest is tetragonal zirconia because of the toughening {{that can be achieved}} from the phase transformation from the metastable tetragonal to the monoclinic crystalline phase, aka transformation toughening. There is also substantial interest in dispersion of hard, non-oxide phases such as SiC, TiB, TiC, boron, carbon and especially oxide matrices like alumina and <b>mullite.</b> There is also interest too incorporating other ceramic particulates, especially those of highly anisotropic thermal expansion. Examples include Al2O3, TiO2, graphite, and boron nitride.|$|E
50|$|In the {{batch process}} {{developed}} by Tibbetts, {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon/hydrogen/helium was passed over a <b>mullite</b> (crystalline aluminum silicate) with fine iron catalyst particle deposits maintained at 1000 °C. The hydrocarbon used was methane in the concentration of 15% by volume. Fiber growth in several centimeters was achieved in just 10 minutes with a gas residence time of 20 seconds. In general, fiber length can be controlled by the gas residence time in the reactor. Gravity {{and direction of the}} gas flow typically affects the direction of the fiber growth.|$|E
50|$|In {{the solid}} state {{reaction}} method bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) and iron oxide (Fe2O3) in a 1:1 mole ratio {{are mixed with}} a mortar, or by ball milling and then fired at elevated temperatures. The volatility of bismuth and the relatively stable competing ternary phases Bi25FeO39 (sillenite) and Bi2Fe4O9 (<b>mullite)</b> makes the solid state synthesis of phase pure and stoichiometric bismuth ferrite challenging. Typically a firing temperature of 800 to 880 Celsius is used for 5 to 60 minutes with rapid subsequent cooling. Excess Bi2O3 has also been used a measure to compensate for bismuth volatility and to avoid formation of the Bi2Fe4O9 phase.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} used to {{manufacture}} oxide fibre/oxide matrix CMC materials. Since most ceramic fibres can not withstand the normal sintering temperatures of above 1600 °C, special precursor liquids are used to infiltrate the preform of oxide fibres. These precursors allow sintering, that is ceramic-forming processes, at temperatures of 1000-1200 °C. They are, for example, based on mixtures of alumina powder with the liquids tetra-ethyl-orthosilicate (as Si donor) and aluminium-butylate (as Al donor), which yield a <b>mullite</b> matrix. Other techniques, such as sol-gel chemistry, are also used. CMCs obtained with this process usually have a high porosity of about 20%.|$|E
5000|$|The S-I cycle {{involves}} {{operations with}} corrosive chemicals at temperatures {{up to about}} [...] The selection of materials with sufficient corrosion resistance under the process conditions is of key importance to the economic viability of this process. The materials suggested include the following classes: refractory metals, reactive metals, superalloys, ceramics, polymers, and coatings.Some materials suggested include tantalum alloys, niobium alloys, noble metals, high-silicon steels, several nickel-based superalloys, <b>mullite,</b> silicon carbide (SiC), glass, silicon nitride (Si3N4), and others. Recent research on scaled prototyping suggests that new tantalum surface technologies may be a technically and economically feasible way to make larger scale installations.|$|E
