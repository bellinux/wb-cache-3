50|$|The {{summer of}} 1995 was a {{significant}} {{turning point in the}} history of notebook computing. In August of that year Microsoft introduced Windows 95.

Prior to this point each brand used custom BIOS, drivers and in some cases, ASICs, to optimize the battery life of its machines. This move by Microsoft was controversial in the eyes of notebook designers because it greatly reduced their ability to innovate; however, it did serve its role in simplifying and stabilizing certain aspects of notebook design.|$|E

The Estelle simulation model that we used to verify the ATM ABR protocol consists of two identical module instances of network station module. Connections between the two station nodes make a closed-loop feedback control system. We have defined Estelle observers to observe the behavior of the ABR protocol. Seven test cases have been designed and carried out. The results of all these test cases have shown that the protocol meets the functional specification for ABR protocol outlined in the ATM Traffic <b>Management</b> <b>Specification...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Key {{management}} {{is the most}} complex part of any security system dealing with encryption of data. Using cloud computing reduces not only pressure on IT cost but it provides satisfactory performance. However, a very fundamental issue on cloud computing {{is the loss of}} hands-on control of system, application, and data security. In viewing of current cloud-computing environment, there is an issue of a comprehensive key management scheme. This paper analyzes the special security requirements of key management under the cloud-computing environment. The study involves analyzing a cloud-computing key management framework based on the XML key <b>management</b> <b>specification</b> and designs the cloud-computing key management framework and module function for MyGRANTs. XML key <b>management</b> <b>specification</b> establishes an abstraction layer between the application program and PKI, which solves the interoperability problem between different PKI systems. As a result, the improved interoperabilty of cloud computing key management with three working modules based on different trust relationship for MyGRANTs is outlined...|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, web {{services}} {{are the largest}} implementation technology in cloud environments. However, {{web services}} also lead to several challenges {{that need to be}} addressed. Security web services standards describe how to secure communication between applications through integrity, confidentiality, authentication and authorization. There are several security standard specifications [79] such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), WS-Security, Extensible Access Control Markup (XACML), XML Digital Signature, XML Encryption, Key <b>Management</b> <b>Specification</b> (XKMS), WS-Federation, WS-Secure Conversation, WS-Security Policy and WS-Trust.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a group <b>management</b> <b>specification</b> and {{execution}} method that seeks a compromise between simple course design and complex adaptive group interaction. This is achieved through an authoring method that proposes predefined scenarios to the author. These scenarios already include complex learning interaction protocols in which student and group models use and update are automatically included. The method adopts ontologies to represent domain and student models, and object Petri nets to specify the group interaction protocols. During execution, the method is supported by a multi-agent architecture. Povzetek: Grupno učenje je podprto s scenariji, modeli, ontologijami, agenti, Petri mrežami. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the XML Key <b>Management</b> <b>Specification</b> (XKMS) is to {{facilitate}} {{the use of a}} Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) by transferring the complexity associated with PKI to a trusted Web Service. Although this specification contains information on how compatibility with PKIs such as PGP and SPKI/SDSI can be reached, it is straight focused on X. 509 PKI. This work uses XKMS to define a federated management model for SPKI/SDSI. In a web of SPKI Federations, the proposed model follows a peer-to-peer approach for discovering and establishing certificate chains. This model introduces a search algorithm and its effectiveness was verified through simulations. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a variety}} of <b>management</b> <b>specifications,</b> hardware, {{firmware}} and software implementations, most of the cluster computing toolkits do not include remote hardware management functionalities. The remote, hardware level management is a necessary task for a computer center.

For a multigeneration hardware environment, there is little in common across hardware level management interface implementations. In a cluster computing toolkit, {{there is a need to}} have a common hardware management interface/solution across processor architecture, platform, firmware, software and management fabric implementations. This paper presents a framework to address these differences that can be used in a cluster computing toolkit...|$|R
