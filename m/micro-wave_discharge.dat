40|$|Highly {{selective}} tching of Si 3 N 4 over SiO 2 {{has been}} investigated employing F and C 1 atoms generated by the <b>micro-wave</b> <b>discharge</b> of an NFa. + C 12 mixture. F atoms alone react spontaneously with both Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2, leading to insuffi-cient Si 3 N 4 /SiO 2 selectivity. By adding C 12 to NF~, most of the F atoms are rapidly converted to interhalogen FC 1 by a ti-tration reaction with C 12 in the gas phase. The resultant FC 1 molecules etch SigN 4 as well as St, but do not react with SiO 2 without any radiation assistance. As a result, infinite Si 3 N~/SiOa selectivity has been achieved. The faster etching for SigN 4 is attr ibuted to a lower ionicity in the chemical bond state for SiaN ~ than that for SiO 2. Si l icon nitride (Si 3 N 4) film is widely used as a mask ma-terial for the local oxidation of silicon, LOCOS (1), in VLSI manufacturing. Continual shrinkage of VLSI devices has led to decrease in device isolation width using LOCOS, which requires thinner pad SiO 2 to minimize the bird's beak length, which is the lateral ength of the SiO 2 region beneath Si 3 N 4 after oxidation. For this reason, oxidized Si 3 N 4, as well as as-grown SigN 4, has to be etched with hig...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Cassini mission around Titan {{revealed}} that {{the interaction between the}} N 2 and CH 4 molecules and the solar VUV radiation leads to a complex chemistry above an altitude of 800 km with the detection of heavy organic molecules like benzene (C 6 H 6). This is consistent with an initiation of the aerosols in Titan’s upper atmosphere. The presence of those molecules makes Titan a natural laboratory to witness and understand prebiotic-like chemistry but despite all the data collected, all the possible photochemical processes in such a hydrocarbon-nitrogen-rich environment are not precisely understood. This is why Titan’s atmospheric chemistry experiments are of high interest, especially those focusing on the photochemistry as most of the Titan-like experiments are based on N 2 -CH 4 plasma techniques. In order to reproduce this VUV photochemistry of N 2 and CH 4, we designed a photochemical reactor named APSIS which is to be coupled window-less with a VUV photon source as N 2 needs wavelengths shorter than 100 nm in order to be dissociated. Those wavelengths are available at synchrotron beamlines but are challenging to obtain with common laboratory discharge lamps. At LATMOS, we developed a table-top VUV window-less source using noble gases for the <b>micro-wave</b> <b>discharge.</b> We started with Neon, as it has two resonance lines at 73. 6 and 74. 3 nm which allow us to dissociate and/or ionize both CH 4 and N 2. We will present here our first experimental results obtained with APSIS coupled with this VUV source and then discuss them regarding the Cassini data and other previous laboratory photochemical studies...|$|E

In this context, we perform a microwave discharge (surfatron) in a neon gas flow. We characterizethe VUV photon flux emitted in different conditions, when working in the mbar pressure range, and compare it to synchrotron VUV fluxes alsoused for similar applications...|$|R
