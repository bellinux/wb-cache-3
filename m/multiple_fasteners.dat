50|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of traditional safety wire {{is the time}} it requires to install properly when securing fasteners, although technicians who use it often can implement it fairly quickly. It also leaves behind waste products when ends are clipped off or when it is cut off of secured fasteners {{that need to be}} removed during maintenance, resulting in sharp metal bits that can easily damage soft materials or injure skin. However, the amount of waste product is relatively small, it is non-toxic, and the hazard can be mitigated altogether if technicians properly dispose of any waste product. When clipping off ends, the ends can go flying off which makes their recovery difficult and can cause injury to anyone in the immediate vicinity, such as the technician or an assistant; however, this can also be easily mitigated by using extra care or by using safety wire pliers that have a special insert that is designed to catch clipped off ends. Another disadvantage is that since the manual skill required to implement traditional safety wire is easily learned, the techniques required to maximize the retentive force of safety wire (e.g., in which direction the retentive force should be exerted, the direction of twist, proper angles for securing <b>multiple</b> <b>fasteners,</b> proper twists per inch, which type of wire to use, etc.) are often ignored by non-formally trained technicians (e.g., hobbyists) who use safety wire for their projects.|$|E

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{method of}} surgical repair of fractured bones would incorporate recent and future {{advances in the}} art of composite materials. The composite materials used in this method would be biocompatible and at least partly bioabsorbable: that is, during the healing process following surgery, they would be wholly or at least partly absorbed into the bones and other tissues in which they were implanted. Relative to the traditional method, the proposed method would involve less surgery, pose less of a risk of infection, provide for better transfer of loads across fracture sites, and thereby promote better healing while reducing the need for immobilization by casts and other external devices. One requirement that both the traditional and proposed methods must satisfy is to fix the multiple segments of a broken bone in the correct relative positions. Mechanical fixing techniques used in the traditional method include the use of plates spanning the fracture site and secured to the bone by screws, serving of wire along the bone across the fracture site, insertion of metallic intramedullary rods through the hollow portion of the fractured bone, and/or inserting transverse rods through the bone, muscle, and skin to stabilize the fractured members. After the bone heals, a second surgical operation is needed to remove the mechanical fixture(s). In the proposed method, there would be no need for a second surgical operation. The proposed method is based partly on the observation that in the fabrication of a structural member, it is generally more efficient and reliable to use <b>multiple</b> small <b>fasteners</b> to transfer load across a joint than to use a single or smaller number of larger fasteners, provided that the stress fields of neighboring small fasteners do not overlap or interact. Also, <b>multiple</b> smaller <b>fasteners</b> are more reliable than are larger and fewer fasteners. However, there is a trade-off between structural efficiency and the cost of insertion time and materials. The proposed method is further based partly on the conjecture that through-the-thickness reinforcements could be excellent for fixing bone segments for surgical repair. The through-the-thickness reinforcements would superficially resemble nails in both form and function. Denoted small-diameter rods (SDRs) to distinguish them from other narrow rods, these reinforcements would be shot or otherwise inserted through adjacent segments of fractured bone to fix them in their correct relative positions (see figure). Shot insertion would be effected by use an applicator that would amount to a miniaturized and highly refined version of the pneumatic guns often used in carpentry to drive nails and brads. The applicator, envisioned to be {{about the size of a}} ball-point-pen, would be driven by pressurized carbon dioxide. To further promote stabilization of the segments, layers of bone glue could be applied to the fracture surfaces prior to insertion of the SDRs.

40|$|Fibre metal {{laminates}} (FMLs) {{were developed}} and refined for their superior crack growth resistance and critical damage size that complimented the damage tolerance design philosophy utilized in the aerospace sector. Robust damage tolerance tools {{have been developed}} for FMLs. However, they tend to focus on the evolution of an isolated crack. There is also a risk that they will be invalidated overtime {{as a result of the}} occurrence of multiple cracks within one structure (one form of widespread fatigue damage). To combat another failure due to widespread fatigue damage, the airworthiness regulations were revised to include the concept of a Limit of Validity (LOV) of the damage tolerance analyses. Consequently, it is crucial to examine fatigue crack growth (FCG) in FMLs containing Multiple-site Damage (MSD) cracks despite their superior damage tolerance merits. The focus of this thesis therefore is to analyse MSD crack growth in FML structures. Mechanically fastened FML joints are potentially weak structural designs that are susceptible to MSD due to the stress rising contributors such as secondary bending, pin loading and open holes subjected to bypass loading. In this thesis, predictive models were developed to address several key mechanisms that affect FCG in FML joints containing MSD, and validated with corresponding experimental work. Then the predictive models were systematically integrated and implemented for FML joints. It was identified that the nature of fatigue in FMLs led to the load redistribution mechanism as the key factor to be modelled in predicting MSD growth in FMLs. The structural stiffness reductions caused by the presence of multiple cracks resulted in load redistribution from the other cracks to the single crack to be analysed, exacerbating the total stress intensity factor (SIF) experienced at the tips of the single crack, increasing the crack growth rate (CGR). The load redistribution mechanism was first substantiated by investigating FCG in FMLs containing discretely notched layers. The prediction model fairly captured the load redistribution mechanism by idealizing the notches in the metal layers as removals of metal strips. The crack acceleration over a major portion of the crack propagation was well predicted with the model; however, the surge in CGR over roughly 3 mm crack length prior to the link-up was underestimated since the plasticity interaction was not accounted for. The capability of modelling the load redistribution mechanism allows the states of multiple cracks to be analysed one by one. It was found that the load redistribution could not be symmetric for every crack and non-symmetric crack configurations therefore developed in FMLs with finite width. Hence, non-symmetric crack growth in FMLs was also investigated in this work. It was also found that both crack tip non-symmetry and delamination shape non-symmetry affected the crack growth in the metal layers. The model for non-symmetric crack growth in FMLs was validated with experimental data. Good correlation was observed. The model for MSD growth in FML panels sequentially analyses each crack state. The other cracks are idealized as removals of metal strips when analyzing the state of a single crack. This non-physical idealization of the cracks led to consistently conservative prediction results in comparison with the test data. Nevertheless, the prediction model provided good predictions of the evolution of MSD configurations. Additionally, it was proven that a very non-conservative predicted fatigue life could be obtained if the load redistribution mechanism was not considered. The effects of pin loading on FCG in FMLs were also investigated. The test data showed very rapid growth of the crack in the vicinity of the pin loading. The CGR decreased with increasing crack length. The model applied the principle of superposition to split the non-symmetric tension-pin loading into simpler tensile loading and a pair of point loads acting on the crack flanks. The SIFs for the simpler loading cases were derived and superposed to obtain the total SIF as a result of the tension-pin loading. The predicted CGR and equivalent delamination shape correlated with the measurements very well, but the model failed to predict the crack path and the measured delamination shape which were trivial issues for this work. The relevance and applicability of the developed models in this thesis for predicting the MSD behaviour in mechanically fastened FML joints was examined. The predicted results captured the trends of the measured CGR in FML joints containing MSD cracks, although there were some discrepancies. The discrepancies are mainly due to the two major shortcomings of the model which are neglecting the load redistribution over <b>multiple</b> <b>fastener</b> rows and neglecting the effects of secondary bending stresses.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Delamination {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} damages in carbon fiber composites, which are being employed in primary aircraft structures. One common solution to prevent a delamination from propagating is to install fasteners, clamping the laminate together and partially arresting the delamination. In this thesis, the effectiveness of <b>multiple</b> <b>fasteners</b> installed in series to arrest the mixed-mode interlaminar failure in composite structures is investigated analytically. An accurate finite element model for predicting delamination propagation behavior of bolted-bonded structures was developed and validated by experimental test data. The finite element results showed that the presence of fasteners can slow down propagation of the crack by compressing the lamina together and transferring load via Mode II shear engagement of the fastener. Compared to the single-fastener case, damage tolerance of the structure was improved by the inclusion of the second fastener. Additionally, if the tensile modulus of the lamina is not high enough, laminate failure would occur before the delamination past the second fastener.

40|$|In {{cases of}} {{completely}} conforming frictionless contact, the contact area generally either decreases or {{stays the same}} under load, {{in which case the}} extent of the contact area is subsequently independent of load and the stress and displacement fields vary linearly with the loading parameter. Dundurs and Stippes describe such cases as receding contact problems. Here, we demonstrate that similar results apply in the presence of Coulomb friction, in which case the extent of the stick and slip zones and the local direction of sliding are independent of load. We also show {{that if there is a}} small initial gap or interference throughout the potential contact area, the extent of the contact area and the stress and displacement fields will approach those of the corresponding receding contact problem as the applied load is increased. If the interface conditions permit adhesion between the contacting surfaces, the extent of the adhesion zone shrinks to zero as the load increases without limit. Progress of the contact configuration towards the limit is governed solely by a dimensionless load factor involving the ratio between the applied load and the initial clearance or interference. This permits results for a variety of initial geometries (due to tolerance variations) to be obtained from a set of finite element results for a single case. Some of these characteristics are demonstrated using a finite element solution of a connecting rod/bushing/gudgeon pin contact.

RESULTS: The TIF procedure (n = 84) reduced all hiatal hernias (n = 49) and constructed valves measuring 4 cm (2 - 6 cm) and 230 degrees (160 degrees - 300 degrees). Serious adverse events consisted of two esophageal perforations upon device insertion and one case of postoperative intraluminal bleeding. Other adverse events were mild and transient.

The apparatus is applicable {{for use in}} hand tools and {{as a replacement for}} impact torque drivers, torque wrenches, motorized screw drivers, or the like, wherein the applied torque must be precisely controlled or limited. The bevel torque drive includes a drive gear which is axially displaceable and rotatable within cylindrical driver housing, a rotatable intermediate gear, and an output gear. Key rotationally secures displaceable gear with respect to input shaft but permits axial movement therebetween. A thrust bearing is preferably connected to the lower end of shaft for support to reduce play and friction between shaft and a transmission joint disc during rotation of the gear train. Coaxially mounted coiled spring is footed against displaceable gear for biasing the displaceable gear toward and into engagement with the intermediate gear for driving intermediate gear and output gear. Torque control is achieved by the use of straight or spiral beveled gears which are of configurations adapted to withdraw from mutual engagement upon the torque exceeding a predetermined limit.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Laminated {{composite}} structures convey tremendous benefits of specific strength and fatigue properties in plane, but are highly susceptible to interlaminar failures such as delaminations and disbonds. The initiation of this failure mode further complicates the design as delaminations initiate along termination points of bonded interfaces, {{such as a}} skin-stringer, or are often driven by discrete damage events. As a result, the service life cannot be predicted {{in the same manner}} as for metallic aircraft where fatigue analysis is used to substantiate the damage tolerance of the aircraft. In order to provide a substantiation for the FAA damage tolerance requirement of composite bonded structures (FAR 23. 573), fasteners are subsequently installed. The delamination arrest by fasteners was studied in depth to create a detailed understanding of the process such that it could be accurately predicted under varying load conditions. The fastener itself provides crack arrest capability initially through mode I suppression, and subsequently through fastener joint shear stiffness and frictional load transfer. However, there is also important interplay between these three fastener parameters, the laminate fracture toughness, fatigue properties and the expected loading conditions which ultimately determines the fastener’s effectiveness in delamination arrestment. Tests were conducted utilizing <b>multiple</b> <b>fasteners</b> to understand the capability of fasteners to arrest delaminations generated by in plane loading both under static and fatigue loading, i. e. mode II propagation. The test results show that the fastener is capable of crack arrest and retardation, but is highly sensitive to inclusion of clearance in the system. Testing, in conjunction with analysis, also demonstrated that the load transfer through friction, which is generated by fastener installation torque, is a critical parameter in the arrestment of fatigue delaminations and plays a dominant role under a number of fatigue loading conditions. In conjunction with the testing and finite element analysis in Abaqus FEA, a high efficiency FEA based tool was developed in MATLAB which allowed for the more direct manipulation of the input parameters in order to best understand the influence of each. Comparisons between the predictive tool and experimental results showed agreement which indicated the ability of a highly simplified, one dimensional, model to capture the relatively complex fatigue delamination process, provided care was taken in establishing the input parameters...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented into the behaviour of carbon fibre composite joints subjected to dynamic loading {{rates in the}} range of 0. 1 m/s to 10 m/s. The research is focused on the response of single fastener joints and more complex structural arrangements involving <b>multiple</b> <b>fasteners</b> and complex loads. Fasteners {{play a crucial role in}} the joining of aerospace components due to their ease of installation and inspection and their resistance to creep and environmental degradation. A consequence of the operating environment of aircraft is that many critical load cases involve impact and crash. These loading events are characterised by high loading rates, high kinetic energy and possibly loads well above the static design case. The properties of composite materials change with loading rate, so it is likely that the behaviour of bolted composite joints may also vary significantly. Dynamic behaviour of bolted joints is an area of research that has been given little attention to date. The few available papers on the topic are limited to the investigation of ideal bearing loads and include some contradictory results. The research developed a detailed understanding of the behaviour of bolted joints in composite structures through a combined numerical and experimental investigation. A set of quasi-static and dynamic single fastener joint tests was conducted to develop an understanding of the complex failure mechanisms present in bolted composite joints. Simple structural tests were developed to investigate the interaction of multiple bolts in a joint. High speed camera footage, full-field strain measurement and CT scanning techniques were all used to develop an understanding of the changes in the failure process with increased loading rate. Finite element analyses used implicit and explicit dynamic algorithms to model the tests. The finite element analysis contributed to the understanding of the experimental results as well as providing a predictive tool to minimise the need for further testing. A method of incorporating detailed information about bolt failure into large scale structural models was investigated and developed. The original contributions of this thesis involve novel dynamic joint testing including dynamic pull-through and structural tests. CT Scanning was utilised in a novel way to investigate the complex failure modes within a bolted joint. Novel finite element techniques were developed for modelling bolted joints at both a detailed level and a simplified level for structural analyses. These contributions significantly improve the current understanding of bolted joint failure, both quasi-statically and dynamically, and will allow for more efficient design of bolted composite structures for crash and impact loads...|$|E
40|$|Laminated bamboo {{could be}} a {{promising}} material {{when it comes to}} large span roofing structures where often truss structures are adopted. It is assumed that connection design used for timber trusses can also be applied in laminated bamboo trusses. For this research truss nodes with slotted-in steel plates are considered. This research will focus itself on the effect of using <b>multiple</b> <b>fasteners</b> in a row in laminated bamboo connections with a single slotted-in steel plate. As a starting point, the possible failure modes and methods for predicting the load-bearing capacity of a single fastener timber connection are assumed to be also applicable to laminated bamboo. Timber can show ductile and brittle failure modes. Ductile failure modes are described by the European Yield Model (EYM) which was first published by Johansen in 1949. Three different failure modes can be distinguished in the EYM, where mode 1 represents pure embedment failure, mode 2 is failure due to one plastic hinge in the fastener per shear plane and mode 3 shows two plastic hinges per shear plane. The brittle failure modes that can be distinguished are splitting, shear plug, tension failure of the net section and group tear-out. The capacity of a multiple fastener connection might not equal the capacity of a single fastener connection multiplied by the number of fasteners. The main parameters that might influence the load-carrying capacity of multiple fastener joints are the inaccuracies in manufacturing, fastener spacing and end distances, dowel slenderness ratio and the plastic behaviour of the fastener. The testing methods for determining the strength en deformation characteristics of laterally loaded connections with dowels in load-bearing timber structures are used for this research. The objective is to study the influence of the number of fasteners in one row on the load carrying capacity of a steel to laminated bamboo connection. The design of the test pieces is based on the European Yield Model (EYM) where three different failure modes can be distinguished. In order to accomplish this, 9 test series are performed with a variation in the number of fasteners in one row (i. e. 1, 2 and 3) and a variation in thickness of the laminated bamboo members (i. e. 15 mm, 43 mm and 90 mm). The test results show that laminated bamboo connections with a slotted-in steel plate and thin bamboo members have limited deformation capacity and tend to show premature brittle failure due to a shear plug. A clear plastic branch in the load slip diagram of the test series where a single fastener and a member thickness of 15 mm is used, indicates that there is some amount of embedment prior to fracture. In case of two dowels in a row this plastic branch shortens and in case of three dowels in a row no plastic behaviour was observed. The limited deformation capacity of these type of joints (especially when multiple dowels in a row are used) makes the applicability of the EYM for a laminated bamboo connection where failure mode 1 is governing questionable. Plastic hinges did develop in the dowels in the test variants where failure mode 2 and 3 was expected. the EYM can quite accurately predict the capacity of a double shear laminated bamboo joint with a central steel plate where the dowel slenderness ratio is sufficient to achieve failure mode 2 or 3. The effective number of fasteners in a laminated bamboo connection was found to be higher than predicted with the equation given in EC 5 irrespective of the observed failure mode. It is because of the decrease in deformation capacity that the load per dowel in a multiple fastener connection is lower than in a connection with a single fastener. The nef for laminated bamboo and several wood species was found {{to be in the same}} order of magnitude for a connection with three dowels in a row. The joint stiffness per dowel of a laminated bamboo connection with a slotted-in steel plate was found to decrease with increasing number of fasteners in a row. It also seems that the joint stiffness is higher in case of failure mode 2 and 3 than in case of failure mode 1. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural Engineerin...|$|E
