5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model. The method requires <b>maximization</b> of the geometric mean of spacings in the data, which are {{the differences between the}} values of the cumulative distribution function at neighbouring data points.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the United States and Canada {{signed the}} Columbia River Treaty, {{which focused on}} flood control and the <b>maximization</b> of {{downstream}} power generation. Canada agreed to build dams and provide reservoir storage, and the United States agreed to deliver to Canada one-half {{of the increase in}} USdownstream power benefits as estimated five years in advance. Canada's obligation was met by building three dams (two on the Columbia, and one on the Duncan River), the last of which was completed in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Other {{types of}} {{business}} organizations, such as cooperatives, credit unions and publicly owned enterprises, {{can be established}} with purposes that parallel, supersede, or even replace the profit <b>maximization</b> mandate of business corporations.|$|E
25|$|Large {{corporations}} might perhaps {{come closer}} to the neoclassical ideal of profit <b>maximization,</b> {{but this is not}} necessarily viewed as desirable if this comes at the expense of neglect of wider social issues.|$|E
25|$|By {{setting a}} goal {{that is based on}} <b>maximization,</b> people may feel that there is a set level that the group needs to be achieved. Because of this, they feel that they can work less hard for the overall desired effect.|$|E
25|$|Convex {{programming}} {{studies the}} case when the objective function is convex (minimization) or concave (<b>maximization)</b> and the constraint set is convex. This {{can be viewed as}} a particular case of nonlinear programming or as generalization of linear or convex quadratic programming.|$|E
25|$|Agroecology {{emphasize}} nutrient recycling, use {{of locally}} available and renewable resources, adaptation to local conditions, utilization of microenvironments, reliance on indigenous knowledge and yield <b>maximization</b> while maintaining soil productivity. Agroecology also emphasizes empowering people and local communities {{to contribute to}} development, and encouraging “multi-directional” communications rather than the conventional “top-down” method.|$|E
25|$|As for Hermitian matrices, the {{key point}} is to prove the {{existence}} {{of at least one}} nonzero eigenvector. To prove this, we cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but instead one can use a <b>maximization</b> argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. The above spectral theorem holds for real or complex Hilbert spaces.|$|E
25|$|Multi-objective {{optimization}} {{has been}} increasingly employed in chemical engineering. In 2009, Fiandaca and Fraga used the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) {{to optimize the}} pressure swing adsorption process (cyclic separation process). The design problem involved the dual <b>maximization</b> of nitrogen recovery and nitrogen purity. The results provided a good approximation of the Pareto frontier with acceptable trade-offs between the objectives.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} is {{an approach to}} economics focusing on the determination of goods, outputs, and income distributions in markets through supply and demand. This determination is often mediated through a hypothesized <b>maximization</b> of utility by income-constrained individuals and of profits by firms facing production costs and employing available information and factors of production, in accordance with rational choice theory.|$|E
25|$|In this, it generalizes <b>maximization</b> {{approaches}} {{developed to}} analyse market actors {{such as in}} the supply and demand model and allows for incomplete information of actors. The field dates from the 1944 classic Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. It has significant applications seemingly outside of economics in such diverse subjects as formulation of nuclear strategies, ethics, political science, and evolutionary biology.|$|E
25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value <b>maximization.</b> The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility <b>maximization,</b> as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E
25|$|However, consequentialism {{and virtue}} ethics {{need not be}} entirely antagonistic. Philosopher Iain King has {{developed}} an approach which reconciles the two schools. Other consequentialists consider effects {{on the character of}} people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the <b>maximization</b> of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.|$|E
25|$|In {{absorption}} spectroscopy of cylindrical flames or plumes, the forward Abel transform is the integrated absorbance along a ray with closest distance y {{from the center}} of the flame, while the inverse Abel transform gives the local absorption coefficient at a distance r from the center. Abel transform is limited to applications with axially symmetric geometries. For more general asymmetrical cases, more general-oriented reconstruction algorithms such as Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), Maximum Likelihood Expectation <b>Maximization</b> (MLEM), Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) algorithms should be employed.|$|E
25|$|Often these {{conditional}} distributions include parameters {{which are}} unknown {{and must be}} estimated from data, sometimes using the maximum likelihood approach. Direct <b>maximization</b> of the likelihood (or of the posterior probability) is often complex when there are unobserved variables. A classical approach to this problem is the expectation-maximization algorithm which alternates computing expected values of the unobserved variables conditional on observed data, with maximizing the complete likelihood (or posterior) assuming that previously computed expected values are correct. Under mild regularity conditions this process converges on maximum likelihood (or maximum posterior) values for parameters.|$|E
25|$|Distortion {{corrections}} {{account for}} field nonuniformities of the scanner. One method, as described before, {{is to use}} shimming coils. Another is to recreate a field map of the main field by acquiring two images with differing echo times. If the field were uniform, {{the differences between the}} two images also would be uniform. Note these are not true preprocessing techniques since they are independent of the study itself. Bias field estimation is a real preprocessing technique using mathematical models of the noise from distortion, such as Markov random fields and expectation <b>maximization</b> algorithms, to correct for distortion.|$|E
25|$|In microeconomics, {{the utility}} <b>maximization</b> problem and its dual problem, the {{expenditure}} minimization problem, are economic optimization problems. Insofar as they behave consistently, consumers {{are assumed to}} maximize their utility, while firms are usually assumed to maximize their profit. Also, agents are often modeled as being risk-averse, thereby preferring to avoid risk. Asset prices are also modeled using optimization theory, though the underlying mathematics relies on optimizing stochastic processes rather than on static optimization. International trade theory also uses optimization to explain trade patterns between nations. The optimization of portfolios {{is an example of}} multi-objective optimization in economics.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of the flux balance approach {{is that it does}} not require any knowledge of the metabolite concentrations, or more importantly, the enzyme kinetics of the system; the homeostasis assumption precludes the need for knowledge of metabolite concentrations at any time as long as that quantity remains constant, and additionally it removes the need for specific rate laws since it assumes that at steady state, there is no change in the size of the metabolite pool in the system. The stoichiometric coefficients alone are sufficient for the mathematical <b>maximization</b> of a specific objective function.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} {{is not up}} to this task because it begins with preconceived standards that it applies to explain empirical data, while leaving out that which is a theoretical anomaly; there is no causal basis of analysis, Unger says, rather everything is embedded in a timeless universal without any account for context. Furthermore, the ambiguity of concepts of <b>maximization,</b> efficiency, and rationalization pin the analysis to a certain notion of the behavior of the rationalizing individual, making the analysis either tautological or reduced to a set of power relations translated into the language of material exchange.|$|E
25|$|Yield {{management}} {{has become part}} of mainstream business theory and practice over the last fifteen to twenty years. Whether an emerging discipline or a new management science (it has been called both), yield management is a set of yield <b>maximization</b> strategies and tactics to improve the profitability of certain businesses. It is complex because it involves several aspects of management control, including rate management, revenue streams management, and distribution channel management. Yield management is multidisciplinary because it blends elements of marketing, operations, and financial management into a highly successful new approach. Yield management strategists must frequently work with one or more other departments when designing and implementing yield management strategies.|$|E
25|$|Of great {{importance}} {{in the theory of}} marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal private and social costs. The marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question. It is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their profit <b>maximization</b> goals. Marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but also any other cost (or offsetting benefit) to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product. It incorporates all negative and positive externalities, of both production and consumption. Examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection.|$|E
25|$|Castoriadis {{emphasized}} the need of societies to legitimize their laws or explain, in other words, why their laws are good and just as they claim them to be. Most traditional societies did that through religion, believing that their laws were given by a super-natural ancestor or god and therefore must be true. Modern capitalist societies legitimize their system (capitalism) through 'reason', claiming it makes 'logical sense'. Castoriadis observes that nearly all such efforts are tautological in that they legitimize a system through rules defined by the system itself. So just like the Old Testament and the Koran claim that 'There is only one God, God', capitalism first defines logic as the <b>maximization</b> of utility and minimization of cost, and then bases its own legitimacy on its effectiveness to meet this criterion.|$|E
25|$|In economics, many {{problems}} involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods {{is determined by}} the process of <b>maximization</b> of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} remains meaningful {{even when}} the system is far away from equilibrium. Other definitions assume {{that the system is}} in thermal equilibrium, either as an isolated system, or as a system in exchange with its surroundings. The set of microstates (with probability distribution) on which the sum is done is called a statistical ensemble. Each type of statistical ensemble (micro-canonical, canonical, grand-canonical, etc.) describes a different configuration of the system's exchanges with the outside, varying from a completely isolated system to a system that can exchange one or more quantities with a reservoir, like energy, volume or molecules. In every ensemble, the equilibrium configuration of the system is dictated by the <b>maximization</b> of the entropy of the union of the system and its reservoir, according to the second law of thermodynamics (see the statistical mechanics article).|$|E

500|$|Formal {{economic}} modeling {{began in}} the 19th century {{with the use of}} differential calculus to [...] represent and explain economic behavior, such as utility <b>maximization,</b> an early economic application of mathematical optimization.

500|$|Economics {{is closely}} enough linked to {{optimization}} by agents {{in an economy}} that an influential definition relatedly describes economics qua science as the [...] "study of human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means" [...] with alternative uses. Optimization problems run through modern economics, many with explicit economic or technical constraints. In microeconomics, the utility <b>maximization</b> problem and its dual problem, the expenditure minimization problem for a given level of utility, are economic optimization problems.

500|$|In the {{landmark}} treatise Foundations of Economic Analysis (1947), Paul Samuelson identified a common paradigm and mathematical structure across multiple {{fields in the}} subject, building on previous work by Alfred Marshall. Foundations took mathematical concepts from [...] physics and applied them to economic problems.

This extension followed {{on the work of}} the marginalists in the previous century and extended it significantly. Samuelson approached the problems of applying individual utility <b>maximization</b> over aggregate groups with comparative statics, which compares two different equilibrium states after an exogenous change in a variable. This and other methods in the book provided the foundation for mathematical economics in the 20th century.|$|E

The method works by breaking a series of possible MSAs into fragments and repeatedly rearranging those fragments with the introduction of gaps at varying positions. A general objective function is optimized during the simulation, most generally the [...] "sum of pairs" [...] <b>maximization</b> function introduced in dynamic programming-based MSA methods.
