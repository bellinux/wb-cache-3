40|$|International audienceAbstract The {{processing}} of oats differs significantly {{from that of}} other cereals such as wheat and maize while oats in northwest Europe appear to be relatively more susceptible to contamination with HT- 2 toxin and T- 2 toxin than these other cereals.

Concentrations of each fusarium mycotoxin fell by approximately 90 - 95 % during the process with the major loss being a physical distribution occurring at the de-hulling stage. Initial studies of losses occurring at other stages such as kilning or de-branning of prepared oat groats suggest these to be small.

40|$|Product {{quality is}} an {{important}} determinant of consumer acceptance. Consistent oat flake properties are thus necessary in the mill {{as well as in}} the marketplace. The effects of kilning and tempering conditions (30, 60 or 90 min at 80, 95 or 110 degrees C) on flake peroxidase activity, size, thickness, strength and water absorption were therefore determined. <b>After</b> <b>kilning,</b> some peroxidase activity remained but steaming and tempering effectively destroyed the activity of these enzymes. Thus the supposed protective effect of kilning or groat durability was not confirmed. Kilning resulted in an increase in flake specific weight, but no other significant effect on flake quality was observed. Tempering time and temperature interacted significantly to produce complex effects on flake specific weight, thickness and water absorption. Flake thickness and specific weight were significantly correlated (r = 0. 808, n = 54). Longer tempering times resulted in an increased fines' fraction, from 1. 45 % at 30 min to 1. 75 % at 90 min. It is concluded that whilst kilning has little effect on flake quality, the heat treatment immediately prior to flaking, can be used to adjust flake quality independently of flake thickness...|$|R
