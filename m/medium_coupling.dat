40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>medium</b> <b>coupling</b> on {{propagation}} of elastic waves {{is a general}} concern {{in a variety of}} engineering and bio-medical applications. Although some theories and analytical models are available for describing waves in multi-layered engineering structures, they do not focus on canvassing ultrasonic waves in human bones with coupled soft tissues, where the considerable differences in acoustic impedance between bone and soft tissue may pose a challenge in using these models (the soft tissues having an acoustic impedance around 80 % less than that of a typical bone). Without proper treatment of this coupling effect, the precision of quantitative ultrasound (QUS) for clinical bone assessment can be compromised. The coupling effect of mimicked soft tissues on the first-Arriving signal (FAS) and second-Arriving signal (SAS) in a series of synthesized soft-tissue-bone phantoms was investigated experimentally and calibrated quantitatively. Understanding of the underlying mechanism of the coupling effect was supplemented by a dedicated finite element analysis. As revealed, the <b>medium</b> <b>coupling</b> impacts influence on different wave modes to different degrees: for FAS and SAS, the most significant changes take place when the soft tissues are initially introduced, and the decrease in signal peak energy continues with increase in the thickness or elastic modulus of the soft tissues, but the changes in propagation velocity fluctuate within 5 % regardless of further increase in the thickness or elastic modulus of the soft tissues. As an application, the calibrated effects were employed to enhance the precision of SAS-based QUS when used for predicting the simulated healing status of a mimicked bone fracture, to find prediction of healing progress of bone fracture based on changes in velocity of the FAS or the SAS is inaccurate without taking into account the effect of soft tissue coupling, entailing appropriate compensation for the coupling effect.

30|$|We do {{not attempt}} to argue that our model {{describes}} transitions between normal and ictal activity. As in many other modeling studies there can be exogeneous parameter transitions causing these changes [31 – 33]. The most influential parameters are the background input B and the local connection w_EI. Then already for <b>medium</b> <b>coupling</b> strength α, rich multi-stable asymmetric dynamics appears. We have also carried out experiments with noisy input. These show that the low activity steady state can escape to normal oscillatory behavior and then can further transition to the high activity steady state depending on the noise amplitude. We found that switches from low to oscillatory activity and vice versa can occur. Once the activity jumps to the high activity branch, the dynamics can only return to low activity levels if B or w_EI is decreased substantially. Rather than changing a parameter artificially, the return to baseline may also be achieved by incorporating additional mechanisms such as energy consumption [34], de-inactivation of ion channels [35]. These act on a timescale from seconds to minutes and may be important to describe late phases of seizure activity.|$|E

The most efficient coupling of laser pump energy into the gain region occurs with the formation of lower density gradients in the pre-formed plasma and when the duration of the main heating pulse is comparable to the gain lifetime ({approx} 10 ps for mid-Z Ni-like schemes). This increases the output intensity by more than an order of magnitude relative to the commonly utilized case where the same pumping energy is delivered within a shorter heating pulse duration (< 3 ps).

40|$|In PT quantum {{mechanics}} a fundamental principle of {{quantum mechanics}}, that the Hamiltonian must be hermitian, {{is replaced by}} another set of requirements, including notably symmetry under PT, where P denotes parity and T denotes time reversal. Here we study the role of boundary conditions in PT quantum mechanics by constructing a simple model that is the PT symmetric analog of a particle in a box. The model has the usual particle in a box Hamiltonian but boundary conditions that respect PT symmetry rather than hermiticity. We find that for a broad class of PT-symmetric boundary conditions the model respects the condition of unbroken PT-symmetry, namely that the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operator PT have simultaneous eigenfunctions, implying that the energy eigenvalues are real. We also find that the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint under the PT inner product. Thus we obtain a simple soluble model that fulfils all the requirements of PT quantum mechanics. In {{the second part of}} this paper we formulate a variational principle for PT quantum mechanics that is the analog of the textbook Rayleigh-Ritz principle. Finally we consider electromagnetic analogs of the PT-symmetric particle in a box. We show that the isolated particle in a box may be realized as a Fabry-Perot cavity between an absorbing medium and its conjugate gain <b>medium.</b> <b>Coupling</b> the cavity to an external continuum of incoming and outgoing states turns the energy levels of the box into sharp resonances.
