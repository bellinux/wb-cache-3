50|$|In 1981 RAF Trimingham {{was closed}} and the site had been sold and the guardhouse {{converted}} into a private house, but by {{the latter part of}} the 1980s the now Ministry of Defence decided to re-purchase the site. The RAF installed a Marconi Type 91 Martello radar acting as a Ready Platform (along with RAF Hopton and RAF Weybourne) for the UKADGE Series II (United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment) Radar System controlled from the R3 underground control centre at RAF Neatishead. The guardhouse was converted into staff accommodation and offices and basic mess facilities. In May 1996 the Marconi Type 91 'Martello' radar at Trimingham was sold to the Turkish Ministry of Defence and it was replaced by what used to be known as No 86 Signals Unit, with a Type 93 (Plessey type ADGE-305, NATO designation TGRI 50011) that had been moved from Hopton when that base was closed. The Type 93 was originally a <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> (however it never actually obtained UK Dept of Transport authorisation to be allowed on UK roads under its own power and anytime it had to be moved, civilian low-loader transport specialists had to be contracted in), but at Trimingham it was fixed to a permanent mounting, due to constant cracking issues with the frame and mobile trailer.

Unlike previous works, both built-in accelerometer and magnetometer {{are used to}} handle <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> issues, including {{but not limited to}} disorientation, and misplacement errors. The authentication performance is improved by executing deep examination at pre-processing steps. A novel and effective segmentation algorithm is also provided to segment signal into separate gait cycles with perfect accuracy. Subsequently, features are then extracted on both time and frequency domains. We aim to construct a lightweight but high reliable model; hence feature subsets selection algorithms are applied to optimize the dimension of the feature vectors as well as the processing time of classification tasks. Afterward, the optimal feature vector is classified using SVM with RBF kernel. Since there is no public dataset in this field to evaluate fairly the effectiveness of our mechanism, a realistic dataset containing the influence of <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> errors and footgear is also constructed with the participation of 38 volunteers (28 males, 10 females).

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a virtual reality application which requires a <b>mobile</b> <b>installation,</b> and the experience gathered during the preparation, realization, and execution of this project. Recently, high-end virtual reality (VR) has received much attention in the marketing field. Professional advertisement agencies are trying to exploit the fascination in this technology raised within the public. IGD was approached by such an agency and requested to prepare a high-quality VR application, serving as a marketing event for the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft / Union de Banques Suisses (SBG/UBS), the largest Swiss bank. SBG wanted to attract the Swiss youth in order to promote its Junior Bank Card. This event was held in twelve major Swiss cities during four weeks in May/June, 1994, with daily presentations. The time schedule and the marketing concept required a <b>mobile</b> <b>installation.</b> As "Cyberspace Roadshow" the event was advertised in newspapers and radio spots. This was world wide the first mobile, immersive, high-quality VR installation. The complete VR infrastructure was installed in a large truck. The presentations were performed inside the truck as well. The hardware infrastructure was comprised of an image generator (SGI Crimson/RealityEngine), VR peripherals (head-mounted display, data glove, body tracking systems), a sound generator (SGI Indigo), and a large, stereoscopic rear projection screen using polarizing light. Within such an immersive environment, approximately 40 persons can be involved. Wearing 3 D glasses the audience can experience stereoscopic viewing and follow, passively, what one active person is controlling by utilizing the VR devices. For this event IGD created several entertaining virtual worlds using its proprietary VR system. The main idea was that one active player is flying through a tunnel, approaching a switch room with three alternatives: riding through a jungle, playing musical instruments or exploring a space labyrinth. Ea c h player had a time limit of approximately 5 minutes...|$|E

40|$|Within an {{interdisciplinary}} approach 24 groups of 20 pigs each were fattened outdoors {{to examine and}} calculate the nutrient inputs and their distribution in soils in relation to several management strategies. Management strategies varied in diets, field crops to pigs, static or <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> units like huts, troughs, and sun shelters. Stocking rates were adapted to the regulations of the Bioland organic farming associations, which limit the nutrient input to a maximum nitrogen load of 112 kg ha - 1 a- 1 or 10 fattening pigs ha- 1 a- 1, respectively. The results were discussed {{with regard to the}} nutrient accumulation in soils and leaching of nitrate into groundwater. Recommendations in relation to management strategies and integration of outdoor pig fattening within crop rotation of an organic farming system were formulated. Nutrient accumulation and leaching can be kept to a well tolerated level by adapting nutrient inputs and optimising their distribution. Therefore, the amount of concentrate has to be limited. Fodder loss should be avoided and available field fodder has to be considered as a ratio of concentrate. The main conclusion of this approach: The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} integrate pig production within crop rotation without the risk of high nutrient losses by moving huts and troughs at short intervals and rationed paddocks at weekly intervals, which markedly homogenised the distribution of nutrients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} theoretical {{results obtained}} under research contract about the pluvial soil erosion and landslide prognosis. The presented results {{refer to a}} reformulation of the USLE model {{in the spirit of}} theoretical physics, in order to modeling the pluvial soil erosion phenomenon as dynamic process. There are many problems to be solved {{in the direction of the}} USLE model formulation in the language of the modern physics: USLE formula must be express in variables which depends by space and time; the replacement of the particular physical quantities characteristic of this model with universal physics quantities (for example, like the hydraulic models for soil pluvial erosion); the application of the general principles of physics to modeling the transformation of the geometry of the eroded surface; introduction of the random elements in the model. Another research direction is currently redrafting USLE model in terms of vectors. This model divides the year into time units. The issue presented here is not exhaustive. In this paper is addressed only the first two problems. To check the results obtained, is used experimental data obtained using a <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> to estimate the risk of pluvial soil erosion. In aim to replacement the particular USLE model variables with universal (not particular) physical variables, is used the tool of the dimensional analysis. The results and their verification, show that the proposed formulation for USLE is plausible. With this material I hope to attract in this direction other researchers in the same category of phenomena. The new formulation can be a start to much new research...|$|E
40|$|Architecture is {{considered}} a permanent and solid structure incapable of responding and adapting to the constant changing needs of the user. This thesis questions the static nature of architecture and instead seeks to create a typology of flexible and dynamic architecture which engages the body with the built environment. The thesis focuses on the direct relationship between the body’s movement and architecture to understand how spatial experiences can be created in the built environment. In order to answer the thesis question how can movement be used to engage the body with architecture, investigations into architecture at the micro, medium and macro scale were completed. Two strategies of using movement; the physical and the contained (“conception/perception of movement in the architecture”) have been explored to understand which strategies work best at what scale. This inquiry into how movement engages the body with architecture was investigated using a design through research methodology. An iterative design process including model making, photography and sketches was {{used to create a}} body of work that tests architecture and movement. The results of this inquiry into movement in architecture were three architectural outcomes at three scales. Firstly the design of a <b>mobile</b> <b>installation</b> tested the user’s personal engagement with architecture at a micro scale. Secondly a medium scale house was designed to test how movement could be used to create different experiences in one space. Finally the findings of these two outcomes were incorporated into the design of a macro scale transport hub that used movement to create spatial experiences and engagement for the user. The use of movement in architecture, enables user to have an engagement with architecture through the varying spatial experiences created in the space...|$|E
