25|$|Increasing affluence in {{developing}} countries, {{as well as}} increased promotion of milk and milk products, {{has led to a}} rise in milk consumption {{in developing}} countries in recent years. In turn, the opportunities presented by these growing markets have attracted investments by multinational dairy firms. Nevertheless, in many countries production remains on a small scale and presents significant opportunities for diversification of income sources by small farms. Local <b>milk</b> <b>collection</b> centers, where milk is collected and chilled prior to being transferred to urban dairies, are a good example of where farmers have been able to work on a cooperative basis, particularly in countries such as India.|$|E
25|$|Milking is now {{performed}} {{almost exclusively}} by machine, though human technicians are still essential on most facilities. The most common milking machine {{is called a}} cluster milker. This milker consists of four metal cups—one per teat—each lined with rubber or silicon. The cluster is attached to both a <b>milk</b> <b>collection</b> system and a pulsating vacuum system. When the vacuum is on, it pulls air from between the outer metal cup and the liner, drawing milk out of the teat. When the vacuum turns off, it gives the teat an opportunity to refill with milk. In most milking systems, a milking technician must attach the cluster to each cow, but the machine senses when the cow has been fully milked and drops off independently.|$|E

This study attempts to assess and evaluate pertinent hazards inherent in the local production of wara (West African soft cheese) which is traditionally produced in small scale by Fulani women and consumed widely in Nigeria. The producers of wara in most cases are associated with poor hygiene, and their products are usually inconsistent in quality and possess very short shelf life. The processes of <b>milking</b> (<b>collection</b> of <b>milk)</b> from animal sources, transferring of the milk into metal pots for heating, heating of the milk, addition of coagulum, ladling of curds and whey into basket and transferring to container of cool water were identified as possible hazard entry points, which a properly designed quality control system should address. To check these hazards, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system has been proposed, and a major inclusion of this system in local production processes is advocated...|$|R

The milk iodine content as a potential source of iodine for humans is still a significant affair. Five <b>milk</b> <b>collections</b> were done in five observed farms during a lactation period.

The average iodine content in milk of individual farms ranged from 41. 72 to 143. 54 ?g I. l- 1 and the average iodine content in urine of individual farms ranged from 104, 1 to 165, 3 ?g I. l- 1.

40|$|On-farm {{analysis}} was conducted to compare management systems for the milking herd, heifer replacements and calves in five large and four small dairy cattle farms in the provinces of Batangas, Laguna and Quezon in the Philippines. Farm capacity in terms of number of dairy cows, land area, number of workers and farm’s daily milk production was higher in large dairy cattle farms (20 or more cows) than small farms (less than 20 cows). However, the differences in daily milk yield per cow, number of cows per hectare and per worker suggest the limitations and opportunities to improve basic farm management {{in order to improve}} efficiency of production in large and small dairy farms. Breed of cattle, <b>milking</b> <b>collection</b> system and <b>milking</b> practices were different between large and small farms. There were also differences in reproductive management practices, calving management, housing and feeding systems and herd health program and disease problems. The milking herd, replacement heifers and calves in large farms had generally better body condition and animal cleanliness scores than those in small farms. This study suggests that on-farm analysis should be used regularly by local dairy farmers, consultants, students and extension agents to generate specific recommendations for individual large and small dairy cattle (and buffalo) farms. Economics of production should be considered in the future to compare farm profitability among dairy cooperatives, individual private farms, commercial farms and institutional farms...|$|R
