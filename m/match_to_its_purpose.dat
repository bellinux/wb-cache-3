3000|$|Higher {{value of}} the metric average {{silhouette}} value (V [...] i [...] s [...]) indicates the better generators’ coherency identification. As {{can be seen from}} Table  9, the proposed coherency method has a higher average silhouette value of each case than HC and ICA methods. It signifies that the generators identified by the proposed method are more strongly <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> coherent group and poorly <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> neighboring groups. Hence, the proposed coherency method is effective to determine generators’ coherency considering the average silhouette value.|$|R

Such a system is perfectly well <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> environment. This idea is used to construct a framework that yields design objectives which may be used to design the system so that it is well <b>matched</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> environment. The design objectives express quantitatively the amount of stability required from the system to ensure that it is well matched. The framework is applied to classical systems and is used to shed light on conventional design objectives. 1...|$|R
