The remaining members of the team arrived from Rothera approximately 10 days later in the Twin Otter, flown by survey pilot Dave Leatherdale.|$|E
5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for <b>many</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Tour dates {{were limited}} to cities in Europe and North America. This {{decision}} caused some resentment among fans {{in other parts of}} the world. Drowned World became the first (and only) Madonna tour to skip over Canada completely. For <b>many</b> <b>weeks</b> prior to the launch of the tour dates, Arthur Fogel from Live Nation himself attempted to book dates in Toronto at the Air Canada Centre between the Sunrise, Atlanta, and Detroit dates, though no free bookings were available. In the end no dates were scheduled in Toronto, to the disappointment of many Canadian fans. Ticket sales were swift in London on April 25, as Madonna sold out her dates at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in record time– six shows in six hours. Madonna made history with the fastest-selling show ever at Earl's Court, as 97,000 tickets were sold.|$|E

Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to Baltimore, where it played {{for a number of}} months, including losing a match against Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers had constructed their own machine, the Walker Chess-player. Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel's machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises – sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a very loud, high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined <b>many</b> <b>weeks</b> after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so <b>many</b> <b>weeks,</b> something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|During {{his absence}} from the Test team, the Australian {{selectors}} had been unsuccessful {{in their attempts to}} find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for <b>many</b> <b>weeks,</b> missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.|$|E

In addition, in July 2005 Skurka {{completed the}} Sea-to-Sea Route, a transcontinental network of long-distance hiking trails from Quebec to Washington, which took him 11 months and which involved 1,400 miles of snowshoeing. Skurkas shorter hikes include the 1,700-mile California section of the Pacific Crest Trail (in 45 days), the 486-mile Colorado Trail (twice), the 2,170-mile Appalachian Trail (in 95 days), a 385-mile trek through northern Minnesota in January, and <b>many</b> <b>week</b> and weekend-long trips in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming.

5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for <b>many</b> <b>weeks,</b> missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Rockets {{for a second}} time in as <b>many</b> <b>weeks,</b> this time in Cleveland. The Rockets opened the scoring with a 74-yard pass from quarterback Jesse Freitas to {{receiver}} Eddie Prokop in the first four minutes of the game, and added a field goal by Jim McCarthy {{near the end of the}} second quarter. The Browns did not score in the first half, but came back to win the game in the second. Rockets defenders were double-teaming Cleveland's ends, and the Browns adjusted by sending halfbacks out to receive deep passes. Cleveland halfbacks Dub Jones and Bill Boedeker both caught long touchdown passes from Graham in the third quarter. Boedeker ran in for another touchdown in the fourth quarter to make the final score 21–10. As in the previous game, there were several cases of rough play: tackle Lou Rymkus was ejected from the game for hitting Jim Pearcy of the Rockets. A Rockets player picked up a handful of sand from the stadium's baseball infield and threw it in Mac Speedie's face during the game, temporarily blinding him. Hirsch was accidentally kicked by a Browns player and suffered a skull fracture.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies opened May {{against the}} division-rival New York Mets, losing the opening {{game of the}} month, 7–4. Back-to-back walks in the tenth inning of the Saturday {{afternoon}} game gave the Phillies their first win of the season over the Mets. After a rainout, the Phillies opened their first series in St. Louis with the Cardinals. They won {{the first game of}} the series on Howard's second grand slam in as <b>many</b> <b>weeks</b> after a pitchers' duel between starters Kyle Lohse and Joe Blanton and completed the two-game series sweep with a 10–7 victory on May 5, capped by a Jayson Werth three-run home run and a 4-for-5 performance from Victorino. The Phillies' brief stop in New York was marred by a two-game series sweep; Phillies hitters were shut down by Mets starters Johan Santana and Mike Pelfrey, and closer Francisco Rodríguez recorded saves in both games of the series. The following series was barely better, as the Phillies dropped two games to the Braves.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTemperature {{is one of}} the scalar {{quantities}} of major interest in most technical combustion systems such as gas turbines, furnaces or internal combustion engines. In this work, we present for the first time quantitative temperature measurements in a flame by time-domain based supercontinuum absorption spectroscopy. In a 1 -dimensional McKenna type burner temperature is inferred from broadband H 2 O spectra by a multi-peak least-square algorithm to data from the Barber-Tennyson line list (BT 2) within a spectral range from 1340 nm to 1485 nm. The results are compared with temperature measurements based on coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS). A good agreement is achieved, showing the capability of time-domain based supercontinuum absorption spectroscopy temperature measurements in a flame. Further the beneficial influence of high bandwidth detection equipment is presented, which allows for a more distinct detection of <b>many</b> <b>week</b> high temperature transitions...|$|R
