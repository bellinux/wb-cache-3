The analyzed alloys underwent microstructure observations as well as hardness measurements, and the abraded surfaces of the examined materials were observed by means of electron scanning microscopy.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} was the {{comparison}} of corrosion resistance in an aqueous sulfuric acid solution of two high-manganese austenitic steels of the 0. 05 C- 25 Mn-Al-Si-Nb-Ti type in a plastically deformed state. Design/methodology/approach: Investigations were carried out on specimens obtained from a thermo-mechanically rolled sheet and then plastically deformed through bending and immersed in corrosive solutions (1 N H 2 SO 4) for 100 hours. The <b>mass</b> <b>decrement</b> was calculated by the gravimetric method, whereas the character of corrosion damages was observed in metallographic investigations using light and scanning electron microscopes both in the polished and etched states. Findings: It was found that after the thermo-mechanical processing one steel is characterized by an austenitic structure with numerous annealing twins, whereas in the second steel lamellar martensitic phases in an austenitic matrix occur. The investigations showed that the examined high-manganese steels have very low corrosion resistance in normal H 2 SO 4. Higher impact on the corrosion resistance than the phase composition has the chemical composition. The <b>mass</b> <b>decrement</b> of the steel with martensite plates is a bit higher than that witha single-phase austenitic matrix. The specimens were intensively dissolved due to general corrosion accompanying by pitting and hydrogen cracking. Research limitations/implications: To investigate in more detail the corrosion behaviour of high-manganese austenitic steels, the polarization tests and the analysis of corrosion products should be carried out. Practical implications: The obtained results {{can be used for}} searching the appropriate way of improving the corrosion resistance of high-strength high-manganese austenitic steels. Originality/value: The corrosion resistance of two types of advanced high-manganese austenitic steels with different initial structures was compared. Hydrogen impact in austenitic steels was discussed...|$|E
40|$|We use {{recently}} derived ages for 61 Milky Way (MW) {{globular clusters}} (GCs) {{to show that}} their age-metallicity relation (AMR) {{can be divided into}} two distinct, parallel sequences at [Fe/H] - 1. 8. Approximately one-third of the clusters form an offset sequence that spans the full range in age (∼ 10. 5 [...] 13 Gyr), but is more metal rich at a given age by ∼ 0. 6 dex in [Fe/H]. All but one of the clusters in the offset sequence show orbital properties that are consistent with membership in the MW disk. They are not simply the most metal-rich GCs, which have long been known to have disk-like kinematics, but they are the most metal-rich clusters at all ages. The slope of the mass-metallicity relation (MMR) for galaxies implies that the offset in metallicity of the two branches of the AMR corresponds to a <b>mass</b> <b>decrement</b> of 2 dex, suggesting host galaxy masses of M_*∼ 10 ^ 7 - 8 for GCs that belong to the more metal-poor AMR. We suggest that the metal-rich branch of the AMR consists of clusters that formed in-situ in the disk, while the metal-poor GCs were formed in relatively low-mass (dwarf) galaxies and later accreted by the MW. The observed AMR of MW disk stars, and of the LMC, SMC and WLM dwarf galaxies are shown to be consistent with this interpretation, and the relative distribution of implied progenitor masses for the halo GC clusters is in excellent agreement with the MW subhalo mass function predicted by simulations. A notable implication of the bifurcated AMR, is that the identical mean ages and spread in ages, for the metal rich and metal poor GCs are difficult to reconcile with an in-situ formation for the latter population.

40|$|Purpose: In {{the paper}} there are {{presented}} {{the results of}} the influence of laser remelting parameters on the properties of the surface layer of the X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 and 55 NiCrMoV 7 hot work steel, using the high power diode laser (HPDL). The aim of this work was to compare the abrasion wear resistance of the X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 and 55 NiCrMoV 7 hot work tool steel surface layers enriched with the TiC, WC and VC ceramic powders. The surface layers of hot work tool steel remelted with a diode laser beam have been metallographically examined and analyzed {{with the use of a}} hardness testing machine. Design/methodology/approach: The high power diode laser (HPDL) and ceramic powders WC, VC and TiC were used. Remelting and alloying processes were carried out at the constant remelting rate and focus shape, varying the laser beam power for the alloyed test pieces in the range from 1, 2 – 2, 3 kW. Findings: On the basis of the wear abrasion tests carried out on 55 NiCrMoV 7 and X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 steels it could be ascertained that each of those steels is characterized by different resistance for the same powders and the power of the laser beam. In the case of employing 1, 2 kW laser, the surface layer formed using the majority of the investigated portions undergoes a total wear during the wear-rate test which also causes the wear of the initial material. When 2, 3 kW is employed, the surface layers have crack and microcrack defections which decrease the resistance to the abrasion. The smallest mass loss for 55 NiCrMoV 7 steel among all the analyzed cases has been observed for the surface layers alloyed with TiC powder, at the of the laser beam power of 2, 3 kW and for WC powder at 1, 2 kW laser beam power. For the X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 steel the smallest <b>mass</b> <b>decrement</b> has been observed for the steel alloyed with WC powder at 1, 2 kW laser beam power and VC powder at 1, 6 kW laser beam power. Practical implications: The investigations showed that as a result of the applied laser processing there is the increase in the hardness and resistance to abrasion of the surface layers in relation to the output material.

40|$|Geospace is {{the region}} of outer space near Earth, which {{includes}} the magnetosphere and the upper region of the atmosphere. It is a hazardous environment that contains high energy particles and is strongly dependant on the space weather. Studies show a high correlation between satellite operational anomalies, such as deep dielectric charging, and large flux enhancement of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt. An astronaut is exposed to radiation through high energy protons and relativistic electrons during extravehicular activities since these kinds of particles can penetrate a space suit. Furthermore, high energy particles can penetrate and transmit through instrument walls and thereby contaminate measurements through secondary electrons detected as noise. In order to prevent these radiation-induced effects {{it is crucial to}} explore and study how the space weather affects the radiation environment in geospace. The Energization and Radiation in Geospace (ERG) project is currently under development in the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) / Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for the declining phase of solar cycle 24. The main objective of this mission is to understand the dynamics of the Earth’s radiation belts. The satellite will be launched into the inner magnetosphere in December 2015. A set of instruments to cover a wide energy range and measure both ions and electrons will be onboard. One of those instruments is the Low Energy Particle instrument for ions (LEP-i). It is very difficult to measure low energy particles (<tens of keV) inside the inner magnetosphere since high energy particles will contaminate the measurements and produce a high background noise level. Therefore it is of utmost importance that the instrument is sufficiently shielded, which lead to another challenge of minimizing the mass of the instrument housing during the design process. The purpose of this thesis has been to optimize the thickness of the LEP-i instrument housing, preferably to reduce the total mass of the original design. This has been done by evaluation of the noise count rate levels in the detector and the Total Ionization Dose (TID) of the electronics boards through numerical simulations. The simulations have been done in the software Geant 4, which is a toolkit for accurate simulation of particle passage through matter. Both the LEP-i instrument geometry and the satellite structure with the other onboard instruments have been included in the computer model. The results of the simulations; the noise count rate and the TID, have been plotted over the corresponding decrement in mass that the decrease of a wall thickness represent. From the simulations it has been concluded that the total mass of the LEP-i instrument housing can be reduced by approximately 1. 22 kg compared to the original housing design, through decrement of several housing walls. From a scientific point of view, an apogee altitude of at least 30 700 km for the ERG satellite, is necessary to successfully achieve the mission objectives. Due to the ERG satellite design, the <b>mass</b> <b>decrement</b> of the LEP-i instrument with 1. 22 kg is equivalent to an apogee altitude increment of approximately 0. 04 RE, compared to the original housing design. This altitude increment may be very valuable during mission execution. Validerat; 20130828 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

30|$|Our {{ability to}} retain a piece of {{information}} improves with repeated exposure and decays with delay since the last exposure (Reddy, Labutov, Banerjee, and Joachims, 2016). Continual repetition usually eventuates in diminished returns (Chen & Squire, 1990; Miller, 1978). To support long-term retention, more practice is necessary but needs to be spread out on an optimal schedule (Anderson et al., 1999; Pavlik & Anderson, 2005). However, for initial learning, more practice becomes over-practice, and once learned, there are also downsides with continued repetition and might even be detrimental under certain conditions. Memory for repeated items decline with increased repetition under incidental-learning conditions (English & Visser, 2013). Response times were significantly longer when a category was repeated aloud for 30  s, as compared to only three seconds (Smith, 1984). This decline in performance with prolonged rehearsal was termed the <b>massed</b> repetition <b>decrement</b> (Kuhl & Anderson, 2011).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role played}} by language in the interpretation of emotional expression. Language labels may indirectly influence such tasks, organising and reactivating a useful repository of semantic knowledge (e. g. Barrett, Lindquist & Gendron, 2007). This proposal was explored using a series of semantic satiation experiments (Lindquist, Barrett, Bliss-Moreau & Russell, 2006). Participants repeated words 3 or 30 times before deciding whether two faces matched in emotional expression. Word type was manipulated across experiments (emotion labels, neutral labels and non-words); an indirect account would only predict reduced accuracy when participants experience semantic inaccessibility, achieved via massed repetition of an emotional label. However, reduced discrimination was found both after 30 (vs. 3) repetitions of any word, and two non-linguistic activities. Findings then suggest that the <b>massed</b> repetition <b>decrement</b> arises via a non-semantic mechanism, such as response uncertainty (e. g. Tian & Huber, 2010). However, an emotion-specific effect of language was also consistently observed. Participants showed facilitated performance after 3 and 30 repetitions of an emotion label, but only when it matched both expressions in the pair. This may suggest that language labels directly influence early emotion perception (Lupyan, 2007, 2012), or provide strategic support during paired discrimination (e. g. Roberson & Davidoff, 2000). A perceptual threshold procedure was used to test the direct assumption. Participants repeated an emotion or neutral label before deciding whether a briefly presented face did, or did not, display an emotional expression. In comparison to the neutral baseline, participants showed no facilitation in performance following exposure to emotion labels that were ‘weakly’ or ‘strongly’ congruent with the subsequently presented expression. Overall, findings inconsistently support the notion that language shapes the interpretation of emotional expression. This prompts discussion of how task demands may influence language-driven recruitment of conceptual knowledge, and the time-course across which these linked elements influence interpretation...|$|R

The research was done inside on a glass green house at the UNESP - College of Agronomical Science, Rural Engineering Department (Botucatu - SP - Brazil). Two trials were done to evaluate biomass, seedling height and diameter development. The first trial, using underground water on 17 cm, 31 cm and 45 cm depth, with or without coverage fertilization with N-P-K.

40|$|Abstract Background Bone mineral density (BMD) accrual during {{childhood}} and adolescence is important for attaining peak bone <b>mass.</b> BMD <b>decrements</b> {{have been reported in}} survivors of childhood bone sarcomas. However, {{little is known about the}} onset and development of bone loss during cancer treatment. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate BMD in newly diagnosed Ewing's and osteosarcoma patients by means of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods DXA measurements of the lumbar spine (L 2 - 4), both femora and calcanei were performed perioperatively in 46 children and adolescents (mean age: 14. 3 years, range: 8. 6 - 21. 5 years). Mean Z -scores, areal BMD (g/cm 2), calculated volumetric BMD (g/cm 3) and bone mineral content (BMC, g) were determined. Results Lumbar spine mean Z-score was - 0. 14 (95 % CI: - 0. 46 to 0. 18), areal BMD was 1. 016 g/cm 2 (95 % CI: 0. 950 to 1. 082) and volumetric BMD was 0. 330 g/cm 3 (95 % CI: 0. 314 to 0. 347) which is comparable to healthy peers. For patients with a lower extremity tumor (n = 36), the difference between the affected and non-affected femoral neck was 12. 1 % (95 % CI: - 16. 3 to - 7. 9) in areal BMD. The reduction of BMD was more pronounced in the calcaneus with a difference between the affected and contralateral side of 21. 7 % (95 % CI: - 29. 3 to - 14. 0) for areal BMD. Furthermore, significant correlations for femoral and calcaneal DXA measurements were found with Spearman-rho coefficients ranging from ρ = 0. 55 to ρ = 0. 80. Conclusions The tumor disease located in the lower extremity in combination with offloading recommendations induced diminished BMD values, indicating local osteopenia conditions. However, the results revealed no significant decrements of lumbar spine BMD in pediatric sarcoma patients after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Nevertheless, it has to be taken into account that bone tumor patients may experience BMD decrements or secondary osteoporosis in later life. Furthermore, the peripheral assessment of BMD in the calcaneus via DXA is a feasible approach to quantify bone loss in the lower extremity in bone sarcoma patients and may serve as an alternative procedure, when the established assessment of femoral BMD is not practicable due to endoprosthetic replacements. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} of obtaining galaxy cluster masses is increasingly being addressed by multiwavelength measurements. As scatters in measured cluster masses are often sourced by properties of {{or around the}} clusters themselves, correlations between mass scatters are frequent and can be significant, with consequences for errors on mass estimates obtained both directly and via stacking. Using a high resolution 250 Mpc/h side N-body simulation, combined with proxies for observational cluster mass measurements, we obtain mass scatter correlations and covariances for 243 individual clusters along ~ 96 lines of sight each, both separately and together. Many of these scatters are quite large and highly correlated. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize scatter trends and variations between clusters. PCA identifies combinations of scatters, or variations more generally, which are uncorrelated or non-covariant. The PCA combination of mass measurement techniques which dominates the mass scatter is similar for many clusters, and this combination is often present in a large amount when viewing the cluster along its long axis. We also correlate cluster mass scatter, environmental and intrinsic properties, and use PCA to find shared trends between these. For example, if the average measured richness, velocity dispersion and Compton <b>decrement</b> <b>mass</b> for a cluster along many lines of sight are high relative to its true mass, in our simulation the cluster's mass measurement scatters around this average are also high, its sphericity is high, and its triaxiality is low. Our analysis is based upon estimated mass distributions for fixed true mass. Extensions to observational data would require further calibration from numerical simulations, tuned to specific observational survey selection functions and systematics.
