500|$|From 1996 through 2001, Downey {{was arrested}} {{numerous}} times on drug-related charges including cocaine, heroin and marijuana and went several times through {{drug treatment programs}} unsuccessfully, explaining in 1999 to a judge: [...] "It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the trigger, and I like {{the taste of the}} gun metal." [...] He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, {{due to the fact that}} his father, also an addict, had been giving them to him.|$|E
500|$|Haley {{writes that}} during {{the last months of}} MalcolmX's life [...] "uncertainty and confusion" [...] about his views were {{widespread}} in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death MalcolmX said, [...] "I'm man enough to tell you that I can't put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible." [...] MalcolmX had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology {{at the time of his}} assassination and, Dyson writes, was [...] "experiencing a radical shift" [...] in his core [...] "personal and political understandings".|$|E

Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to [...] "Comfortably Numb": [...] "I caught a fleeting glimpse, {{out of the corner}} of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone." [...] Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, [...] "Jugband Blues": [...] "I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Left & Right" [...] is a funky party jam {{featuring}} rappers Method Man and Redman, who exchange verses as D'Angelo {{sings the}} song's verses and chorus. Entertainment Weeklys Matt Diehl calls Method Man's and Redman's lyrics [...] "misogynistic", {{adding that it}} upsets Voodoos [...] "organically sensual vibe". The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it [...] "could be about his MIA status ('Will I hang or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it's up to God'), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence ('I'm gonna put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the trigger/I'm gonna pull it, and then we gon' see/What the deal/I'm for real')". Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which {{a young black man}} lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is {{based on the fact that}} you like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E

2500|$|However little {{experience}} I may have had, I do {{go to the}} theatre [...] all the year round and I pay the most careful attention to what I see and hear.

2500|$|Banville {{said in an}} {{interview}} with The Paris Review that he liked Vladimir Nabokov's style; however, he went on, [...] "But I always thought there was something odd about it that I couldn't quite put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on.</b> Then I read {{an interview}} in which he admitted he was tone deaf." [...] He is highly influenced by Heinrich von Kleist, having written adaptations of three of his plays (including Amphitryon) and having used Amphitryon as a basis for his novel The Infinities.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{successful}} Stanley Cup winning campaign with the Pittsburgh Penguins where he scored 10 goals and 22 {{points in the}} playoffs, he was left off the American roster of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Following the elimination of Team USA after a 4-2 loss to Team Canada, Kessel tweeted [...] "Just sitting around the house tonight w my dog. Felt like I should be doing something important, but couldn't put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] This was interpreted by several Team USA players and personnel, including Dean Lombardi, John Tortorella, David Backes, Zach Parise, and Derek Stepan as Kessel jabbing following his snub. Kessel stated that his comments were not directed at anyone, and that he didn't mean any disrespect towards anyone.|$|E

60|$|I lost {{my temper}} at his persistence, and swore to myself. For a time we hated {{one another in}} silence. I drummed with <b>my</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the floor between my knees, and gritted the links of my fetters together. Presently I was forced to talk again.|$|R

2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and put <b>my</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." [...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus {{came into the world}} to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lucille spoke gravely, and I {{wondered}} {{whether she had}} guessed the full significance of the intimation.

60|$|I heard {{something}} breathing, saw something crouched together close beside me. I held my breath, {{trying to see}} what it was. It began to move slowly, interminably.
