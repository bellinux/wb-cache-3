40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is, to determine the socio-cultural and economic changes happened in Keçiborlu, after the closure of its Sulphur Enterprise. The Enterprise was active between 1934 and 1994; {{the welfare of the}} city was high. After closure of it, unemployment problem has grown and people begun to migrate. Household and trades surveys show the socio-economic and cultural differences between <b>mining</b> <b>period</b> and today's. It is revealed that Keçiborlu has transformed into a settlement of retired people and if it is left untreated, it will turn into an decrescent town because of immigrations...|$|R
50|$|Initially he had devoted the rancho chiefly to stock-raising, selling meat {{supplies}} to the many mining camps which were booming in the late 1840s and early 1850s during the early <b>mining</b> <b>period.</b> In the 1860s, he and his brothers switched to wheat-growing, and enclosed their land with fences to keep animals out. Wolfskill and his brother, William, divided their interests in the rancho, each taking one-half. John devoted most of his rancho to fruit-culture. A branch railroad was built to cross the ranch not far from Wolfskill's old home, the nearest station being Winters.|$|R
50|$|Long traditions with mining of {{iron and}} sulphur made Malm an {{industrial}} centre of the county. The mining company Fosdalen Bergverk was owned {{by the state of}} Norway and some of the profit was spent to build a top modern primary school. The school of Malm was one of three pioneer schools in Norway, which started a 3-year long middle school (junior high school, grades 7-9) in the 1950s. New small industry has been established {{since the end of the}} <b>mining</b> <b>period,</b> where steel constructions for offshore vessels and bridges are made.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} fluctuates seasonally and {{the town}} businesses rely on the tourist trade as the population increases in the summer. It was settled during the California Gold Rush in 1849 and produced {{a large amount of}} placer gold. Hard rock mines were established soon afterword and were very productive. Washington is the only settlement in the vicinity to have survived to this day. There remains today much evidence of placer gold mining, hydraulic mining, and hard rock mining. During the <b>mining</b> <b>period</b> there were a large number of Chinese living there.|$|R
50|$|Birtavarre is {{a former}} mining town with {{smelters}} in Ankerlia that are preserved by the Nord-Troms Museum. It was during the <b>mining</b> <b>period</b> that the village adopted the name Birtavarre. Up until that time the area had been called Kåfjordbotn, meaning {{the end of the}} Kåfjorden. Since there was also mining in Kåfjord in the nearby municipality of Alta, many workers ended up in the wrong Kåfjord. The name was changed simply for the practical reason of avoiding confusion. The Sámi name for the place, Gáivuonbahta, is translated from the old name Kåfjordbotn. The present name for the village comes from the nearby mountain Pirttivaara which is a Kven language name.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePillars of gypsum {{from the}} {{underground}} mine located at Grozon (Jura region, France) reveal degrees of instability that {{vary depending on}} the <b>mining</b> <b>period.</b> Observations carried out with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) shed light on the dissolution of gypsum, especially on the walls of pillars and in older zones. The time-dependent behavior of the gypsum is thus investigated in the laboratory and found to be a result of forced relative humidity. Variations of relative humidity have an influence on convergence values that are measured in situ. The analysis of this data reveals seasonal developments that are a function of variations in relative humidity...|$|R

50|$|Bear Creek {{states that}} 63.2 million ounces of silver (proven and {{probable}} mineral reserves) {{are at the}} site, 19.7% of the company's total silver reserves. Of these, 16.6 million ounces are proven, and 46.6 million ounces are probable. Bear Creek proposes to operate the mine for an 11-year period during which it would extract approximately 47.4 million ounces of silver. A possible extension of the <b>mining</b> <b>period</b> could bring an additional 35 million ounces, according to company estimates. Mineral reserves constitute 37 million tons of silver-containing rock; within them, the silver occurs at an average density of 53g of silver per ton of rock. Cyanide, a toxin, {{would be used to}} separate the silver from the rock.|$|R
50|$|Allen's son-in-law, Cornelius Blois, {{is often}} {{credited}} with discovering gold in Waverley. Two major gold <b>mining</b> <b>periods</b> ensued between 1861 {{through the early}} 20th century. Waverley became a boom town with highly skilled gold miners coming from Germany and England. Saloons, hotels, camp followers and the usual trappings of a gold town sprang up quickly, and there were even instances of murders and riots. A third attempt to restart the gold industry occurred years later in the 1930s, but it proved unprofitable and lasted only a few years. Other industries in Waverley have included millworking and forestry. It is also worthy of note that the Shubenacadie Canal system runs through Waverley, between Lake William and Lake Thomas.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinchillas {{project is}} a silver-lead-zinc deposit, located in the Puna region of northwestern Argentina, in Jujuy Province. Chinchillas is {{approximately}} 42 kilometers by road from the Pirquitas property. The 2017 pre-feasibility study on the Chinchillas project evaluates the development and construction of an open-pit mine and supporting infrastructure, which will supply ore to the Pirquitas processing facilities over an eight-year active <b>mining</b> <b>period.</b> Chinchillas will be mined by conventional drill, blast, truck, and loading open pit mining methods. A fleet of 35-tonne road haul trucks will transport ore approximately 42 kilometers to the Pirquitas processing facilities. Over the life of mine, the Pirquitas processing facility is expected to produce a silver-lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate. The two concentrates will be shipped internationally to smelters for processing.|$|R

In view of multiple periodic behaviors existing in time series, an algorithm which can <b>mine</b> all <b>periods</b> in time series is proposed in this paper. Based on the periodic behaviors, we recommend locations using item-based collaborative filtering algorithm.

40|$|International audienceContamination by lead (Pb) {{and zinc}} (Zn) was studied in seawater, sediment, seaweed and blue mussels near the former "Black Angel Pb-Zn Mine" in Maarmorilik, West Greenland. The mine was {{operated}} {{during the period}} 1973 - 90 when mine waste (tailings and later waste rock) was discharged directly into the sea. Metal concentrations peaked during the <b>mining</b> <b>period</b> and Pb and Zn in seawater within the discharge area were measured up to 440 and 791 μg L, respectively. Pb concentrations in sediment, seaweed and mussels just outside the discharge area were measured up to 187, 84 and 2, 650 and Zn up to 655, 363 and 1, 190 μg g dry wt., respectively. Within the discharge area, seawater metal concentrations (especially Pb) decreased abruptly after mine closure. Metals concentrations in sediment and biota, however, decrease more slowly and two decades after mine closure seaweed and blue mussels are still contaminated 12 km from the mine...|$|R
