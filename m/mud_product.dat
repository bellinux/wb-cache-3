40|$|Dirt {{collected}} with sugarcane {{is processed}} and {{separated from the}} juice in the sugar factory by filtration equipment for return to the cane fields. New technologies {{over the past decade}} have enabled performance improvements to be obtained for this key unit operation. Filter <b>mud</b> <b>product</b> still contains a reasonable amount of sugar and the transportation of high moisture <b>mud</b> <b>product</b> has considerable cost. Australiaâ€™s traditional approach has been to use Rotary Vacuum Filters for processing and separating mud and other impurities from juice, but in recent years there has been interest in reducing sugar losses and transportation costs through utilisation of new technologies such as Horizontal Bed Filters, Vacuum Belt Press Filters, Membrane Press Filters and Centrifuges. Increasingly, these alternative equipment are being installed in new factories. This chapter describes the general principles of mud filtration theory and mud conditioning followed by a detailed description and review of the various filtration technologies and analysis of the relative merits associated with the equipment...|$|E

40|$|New geopolymer {{formulations}} {{were designed}} by sodium silicate/NaOH activation of metakaolin, iron oxide and red mud mixtures. The effects of source materials on the microstructure and mechanical properties were studied. Each formulation induces different degree of geopolymerization reaction as reflected by the phase composition where the amorphous phase is predominant. These vestiges are related to silica provided by sodium silicate more reactive in the geopolymerization than the silica of metakaolin. Moreover, the variation in strength between the geopolymers is attributed to the same factors, with higher porosity and nonreacted phases found in the red mud based geopolymer matrix. In function of curing time, the mechanical strength increased from day 1 to 28 for the samples with a low amount of red mud. In these two cases, longer curing time improves the geopolymerization state resulting in higher compressive load. The metakaolin and metakaolin/red <b>mud</b> <b>products</b> exhibited comparable water absorption and density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Weyerhaeuser's Paper Mill in Albany, Oregon {{has been}} {{experiencing}} frequent ring {{formation in the}} # 3 rotary lime kiln. Rings form when lime <b>mud</b> (CaCOâ‚ƒ) or <b>product</b> lime (CaO) particles adheres to {{the walls of the}} lime kiln and become resistant to the abrasive action of the sliding motion of product lime particles (Notidis, 1994). Ring formation has resulted in frequent shut downs to remove (blast) the rings and caused a significant loss of productivity and revenue to the company. A careful analysis of the production process in the mill revealed that concentration of sodium was high and that of sulfur low in the lime mud. The high sodium was due to the low sulfur input to the kiln resulting in high sodium to sulfur ratio. The use of natural gas as a fuel source in the kiln partly causes low sulfur levels in the mud. This study examines the effects of burning emulsified sulfur in the # 3 rotary lime kiln to reduce sodium enrichment in the solids, and examine its effect on kiln operation and SOâ‚‚ emissions from the # 3 rotary lime kiln. A four day trial of burning emulsified sulfur to reduce sodium concentration in the # 3 rotary lime kiln was planned. Tote bins of 70...|$|R

40|$|The {{ionic liquid}} betainium is(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide [Hbet][Tf 2 N] {{was used for}} the {{extraction}} of scandium from aqueous solutions. The influence of several extraction parameters on the extraction efficiency was investigated, including the initial metal concentration, phase ratio, and pH. The extraction kinetics was examined, and a comparison was made between conventional liquidâˆ’liquid extraction and homogeneous liquidâˆ’liquid extraction (HLLE). The stoichiometry of the extracted scandium complex was determined with slope analysis. Scandium(III) is extracted as a complex with zwitterionic betaine in a 1 : 3 stoichiometry, with three bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide counterions. Upon extraction of scandium(III), proton exchange occurs and three protons are transferred to the aqueous phase. Scandium is an important minor element present in bauxite residue (red <b>mud),</b> the waste <b>product</b> that results from the industrial production of alumina by the Bayer process. To evaluate the suitability of [Hbet][Tf 2 N] for the selective recovery of scandium(III) from red mud leachates, the extraction of other metals present in the leachates (La(III), Ce(III), Nd(III), Dy(III), Y(III), Fe(III), Al(III), Ti(IV), Ca(II), Na(I)) was considered. It was shown that the trivalent lanthanide ions, yttrium(III) and the major elements aluminum(III), titanium(IV), calcium(II), and sodium(I), are all poorly extracted, which is advantageous for the selective recovery of scandium(III) from red mud. Iron(III) showed an extraction behavior similar to that of scandium(III). Scandium recovery was examined from a multielement rare-earth solution. Scandium could be separated from the other rare-earth elements by extraction with [Hbet][Tf 2 N] and subsequent scrubbing of the loaded ionic liquid phase to remove coextracted metal ions. The extracted scandium was recovered from the ionic liquid phase by using back-extraction with hydrochloric acid or precipitation stripping with oxalic acid. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Snakes in {{the grass}} is a visual {{research}} endeavour that utilises an arts and science disciplinary interface, to develop a method for generating a series of contemporary allegorical artworks that engage a study of Serpent symbolism and mythology. On the side of Trinity Catholic College beside St. Carthageâ€™s Cathedral in Lismore stands a life-sized sculpture of the Virgin Mary standing on a Serpent. Inside the school can be found a smaller {{version of the same}} sculpture, where priests and students light candles and incense, and place them around the statue. This thesis researches and questions the iconography of the â€˜cursed Serpentâ€™ as a primary signifier in the European Biblical tradition in Australia, as it stands alongside the iconography of the existing Indigenous cultures of this land, cultures that have a tradition of Serpent veneration. The intention is to identify correlations between differing cultural and social attitudes that are embedded in religious traditions, and different attitudes to the use of natural resources. Material collected through studying the history of Biblical traditions is superimposed, in a form of cultural montage, on to images of technical procedures of research undertaken by scientists researching an innovative water remediation process on Mt Carrington in northern NSW. The scientific research was focused at a disabled gold mine, where acid mine drainage contamination was severe, and represents a small yet significant example of environmental issues being faced all over the world. This research used salt water neutralised bauxite, or red <b>mud,</b> a waste <b>product</b> from aluminium mining to remediate water and soil affected by gold and silver mining. The creative process developed into a contemporary allegorical narrative that operates as a personification and an enactment of a subjective re-reading of issues surrounding Serpent symbolism and the environment. The resulting artworks include paintings, photographs and an earthwork sculpture on the mine site at Mt Carrington. These works are generated to research, focus attention on, and stimulate discussion about cultural and environmental changes and challenges in Australia...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results from {{a study of the}} possibilities of using red <b>mud,</b> a waste <b>product</b> derived from the digestion of bauxite with a versatile mineralogical composition, as additive in concrete, grout mortar and cement paste. Two types of red mud from China were used in the experiments. Concrete in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the compressive strength and dry shrinkage of concrete. Grout mortars in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the flexural and compressive strengths, dry shrinkage and water permeability of mortar. Cement paste in which 0 - 30 % of the mass of the binder was replaced by red mud were cast for investigating the effect of red mud addition on the capacity of Cs adsorption and ionic leaching. The results show that addition of red mud does not contribute to nor impair the strength of the concrete or grout mortar but instead acts as inert filler. The decrease in compressive strength of concrete with addition of red mud is mainly due to the increased water-cement ratio. There is no significant increase in dry shrinkage of concrete with addition of red mud, but there is a certain increase in dry shrinkage of grout mortar, especially when more than 20 % of the binder is replaced by red mud. Addition of red mud in grout mortar significantly increases the water permeability of the mortar due to the increased water-cement ratio. Owing to the fluctuant results from the adsorption test, it is difficult to draw a conclusion of the adsorption capacity for Cs by addition of red mud in concrete. However, the preliminary results from a quick adsorption test indicated a good adsorption behavior of cement with the addition of red mud, especially at a low initial Cs concentration...|$|R
40|$|Mud {{volcanism}} is a widespreaded {{phenomenon that}} has been reported both on land and on the seafloor. Despite their worldwide occurrence, more than 60 % of mud volcanoes are distributed in proximity of subduction zones. In these tectonically active areas, the presence of overpressured fluids and sediments released through the accretionary prism fuels the formation of such piercement structures. Hence, the mud volcanoes act as windows to depth, making available a wealth of material that otherwise could not be sampled by scientific drilling due to technical limitations. The nature of mud volcano ejecta is various since {{a lot of different}} processes interact during the ascent to the seafloor. Nevertheless, studies on <b>mud</b> volcanoic <b>products</b> contributed to elucidate the dynamics of the so-called subduction factory shedding some light on the fluid cycling in subduction zones. At the same time, {{in order to understand the}} role of mud volcanoes as fluid expulsion structures, their formation as well as evolution has to be constrained. The main mechanisms, which have been hold responsible for that, are either diapiric ascent of a buoyant body of fluidized mud or hydrofracturing in areas of structural weekness, setting the path to mud intrusions. Once they break trough the seafloor, mud volcanoes are subject to numerous internal and external triggers, which hamper or enhance their activity. Earthquakes, as well as episodic inflation and deflation of an underlying mud reservoir might play a major, concomitant role in the release of accumulated pressure at depth. This role as pressure release valves for deeper sediments makes mud volcanoes complex, dynamic environments governed from a multitude of different processes. The aim of this dissertation is to enhance the understanding of mud volcanism by summarizing the current knowledge on the matter with new insights from case studies, i) explaining the role of mud volcanoes in the Nankai subduction zone offshore Japan, ii) focussing on factors that govern mud volcanic activity at the Athina MV, in the Eastern Mediterranean and finally iii) answering the open questions regarding origin and evolution of these sedimentary structures through laboratory analog experiments. Thirteen mud volcanoes have been reported in the Kumano Basin, landwards of the Nankai Trough. Their role in the water budget of the Nankai subduction zone have been evaluated creating a model of water circulation in the upper and lower plates using constraints from IODP holes of the NanTroSEIZE project, in situ geochemical and heat flow data and water isotopes measurements. Clay minerals have been identified as an important origin of water release in the region whereas mud volcanoes are deemed only minimally responsible for water expulsion, which seems to be diffusively emitted through the whole basin. Admittedly, paroxysmal phases in mud volcanoes activity could not be taken into account in this study. However this aspect of mud volcanism have been tackled with the deployment of a multiparametric observatory on top of the Athina MV, south of Turkey. More than two years of pore pressure, tilt and temperature data revealed an unprecedented connection (in the submarine environment) between variations of those parameters and earthquake occurrence. Such external triggers of mud volcano activity have been linked to magnitude/distance ratio, ground motion and local factors like geology and tectonic structures. Moreover, signals not related to external triggers gave hints on the internal dynamics of the Athina system. Finally, to assess the existing concepts of formation and development of mud volcanoes, a set of analogue experiments on mud breccia samples have been conducted. The unicity of these tests lies in the material used to model hydraulic failure: sediment samples from three different submarine mud volcanoes (Japan, Costa Rica and Mediterranean Sea). The experiments, which showed the characteristics of the plumbing system and the surficial structures forming before and after hydraulic failure of the samples, confirmed hydrofracturing as formation mechanism responsible for mud volcano formation and demonstrated how episodicity in and around mud volcanoes can be the result of inflation and deflation of a mud reservoir at depth...|$|R
