40|$|Abstract. Five {{cases of}} postparturient {{vulvovaginitis}} and metritis in cattle caused by Clostridium septicum (<b>malignant</b> <b>edema)</b> {{are described in}} the current report. The diagnosis was established based on detection of C. septicum by culture and fluorescent antibody test. All animals were Holsteins, and 4 were primiparous (the parity of 1 animal was not reported). All animals developed clinical signs 1 – 3 days after calving, consisting of swelling of perineal and perivulvar areas, fever, and depression. Perineal, perivulvar, and perivaginal gelatinous and often hemorrhagic edema was consistently observed on gross examination. Longitudinal vulvar, vaginal, cervical, and uterine body tears, covered by fibrinous exudates, were also present. Microscopically, vulvar, vaginal, and uterine mucosae were multifocally necrotic and ulcerated. Large Gram-positive rods, some with subterminal spores, were present within the edematous subcutaneous and submucosal tissues. Clostridium septicum was demonstrated by culture and/or fluorescent antibody test in tissues of most animals. These cases of <b>malignant</b> <b>edema</b> {{were considered to be}} produced by C. septicum and predisposed by the trauma occurring during parturition.

40|$|Randomized {{trials have}} {{demonstrated}} the efficacy of craniectomy {{for the treatment of}} <b>malignant</b> cerebral <b>edema</b> following ischemic stroke. We sought to determine the prevalence and outcomes related to this by using a national database. Patient discharges with ischemic stroke as the primary diagnosis undergoing craniectomy were queried from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1999 to 2008. A subpopulation of patients was identified that underwent thrombolysis. Two primary end points were examined: in-hospital mortality and discharge to home/routine care. To facilitate interpretations, adjusted prevalence was calculated from the overall prevalence and two age-specific logistic regression models. The predictive margin was then generated using a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate the probability of in-hospital mortality after adjustment for admission type, admission source, length of stay, total hospital charges, chronic comorbidities, and medical complications. After excluding 71, 996 patients with the diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage and posterior intracranial circulation occlusion, we identified 4, 248, 955 adult hospitalizations with ischemic stroke as a primary diagnosis. The estimated rates of hospitalizations in craniectomy per 10, 000 hospitalizations with ischemic stroke increased from 3. 9 in 1999 - 2000 to 14. 46 in 2007 - 2008 (p for linear trend< 0. 001). Patients 60 + years of age had in-hospital mortality of 44 % while the 18 - 59 year old group was found to be 24 % (p =  0. 14). Outcomes were comparable if recombinant tissue plasminogen activator had been administered. Craniectomy is being increasingly performed for <b>malignant</b> cerebral <b>edema</b> following large territory cerebral ischemia.

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured 15. 9 ± 6. 4 h after the ictus. Patients were divided into a malignant (n = 9) and a benign group (n = 8) as a function of their clinical courses and edema. Edema was measured as maximal midline shift on follow-up CTs. Total hypoperfusion volume was divided into different subvolumes according to the degree of CBF reduction. Subvolumes of severe ischemia relative to total ischemic area were significantly larger in the malignant group than in the benign group and were significantly correlated with edema formation. The highest correlation and best predictive values for edema formation with a sensitivity, specificity, and a positive and negative predictive value of 100 % were found for subvolumes with severe ischemia. Correlation coefficients and prediction decreased for subvolumes with less severe perfusional deficit, pointing to the risk of misclassifying patients when relying on the volume of total perfusional deficit alone. Malignant MCA infarction seems to be determined more by the volume of severe perfusional deficit than that of total perfusional deficit.

30|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is a {{frequent}} cause of death from trauma with more than 50, 000 deaths annually in the United States. 5.3 million survivors of TBI require some assistance {{in the performance of}} their activities of daily living.

Medical therapies aimed at lowering intracranial pressure (ICP) include hyperosmolar therapy, barbiturate coma, sedation, therapeutic hypothermia and ventricular drainage.

40|$|The {{authors have}} no {{financial}} conflicts of interest. <b>Malignant</b> cerebral <b>edema</b> following ischemic stroke is life threatening, {{as it can}} cause inad-equate blood flow and perfusion leading to irreversible tissue hypoxia and metabolic crisis.

Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that preemptive decompressive hemicraniectomy effectively reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. Another life-saving decompressive surgery is suboccipital craniectomy for patients with brainstem compression by edematous cerebellar infarction. In addition to decompressive surgery, cerebrospinal fluid drainage by ventriculostomy should be considered for patients with acute hydrocephalus following stroke. Medical treatment begins with sedation, analgesia, and general measures including ventilatory support, head elevation, maintaining a neutral neck position, and avoiding conditions associated with in-tracranial hypertension.

30|$|The <b>malignant</b> {{cerebral}} <b>edema</b> that attends severe TBI is {{a primary}} cause of poor neurological outcome and death. In addition to the mass effect of hematomas, the consequences of progressive cerebral swelling results in marked increases in intracranial pressure resulting in impaired cerebral perfusion (vascular effect) and brainstem herniation (mechanical effect) (Stocchetti and Maas 2014). As such, control of traumatic cerebral hypertension is the principle target of brain protective therapies (Brain Trauma Foundation 2007). In those TBI patients in whom ICP control can be achieved, neurological outcomes are generally better. In those who escape conventional treatment guidelines, alternate approaches are employed to prevent herniation and death. In the recently updated Brain Trauma Foundation Guidelines for the Management of Severe TBI, both hypothermia and decompressive craniectomy are second tier therapies to be considered. Hypothermia will lower ICP, but alone, has limited impact on adverse outcomes (Andrews et al. 2015). Unilateral DC, by allowing the swollen hemisphere to decompress through the craniectomy defect, lowers ICP, facilitating cerebral perfusion, and reduces the mechanical displacement of the brain (Gouello et al. 2014; Ecker et al. 2011; Aarabi et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: We {{present an}} anecdotal series of 11 {{patients}} without past history of stroke with progressive neurological deterioration while on medical therapy for large cerebellar infarctions. Clinical signs of brain stem compression developed in these patients. Computerized tomography {{of the head}} confirmed mass effect from brain edema. It was the clinical judgment of the neurologists and neurosurgeons {{that each of these}} 11 patients would expire without surgical intervention. Methods: All 11 patients (seven men, four women; mean age, 54 years) were treated with suboccipital craniectomy for decompression and temporary ventriculostomy for cerebrospinal fluid pressure monitor-ing and drainage. Results: Seven patients demonstrated neurological improvement on the first postoperative day. Two patients returned to their previous jobs 3 months after surgery. The Barthel Index indicated that six individuals were functioning with minimal assistance within a follow-up period of 16 - 60 months. The remaining three were functionally dependent.

The author studies minutely the question of denomination, showing, by means of drawing and history, the origin of the diseases, both Norte American and Brazilian. The name Neotropic Exanthematic Typhus (in BRazil, Colombia, United States or India) should substitute the erroneous anme "Spotted Fever"; the disease is exanthematic, a very different thing. He formulates two hypotheses about these diseases: first - it passed from the neotropic to the neartic region, where it acquired individual properties; second - they developed independently in a more rmeote epoch, acquiring each its own characteristics. The disease is today rather of the neotropic than of the neartic region. As it also exists in India it cannot be named American exanthematic Typhus.

30|$|Hemicraniectomy was {{described}} as a treatment option for cerebral edema {{more than a century ago}} (Kocher 1901). It was first introduced in 1971 as a management option for traumatic subdural hematoma (Ransohoff et al. 1971). Early reports of decompressive craniectomy (DC) were disappointing as the procedure was used as a rescue attempt for <b>malignant</b> cerebral <b>edema</b> when medical therapy failed. Not surprisingly, the outcome of these patients was predictably poor with high mortality and unfavorable functional outcome in survivors (Ransohoff et al. 1971; Kjellberg and Prieto 1971; Venes and Collins 1975). Recently, there has been a renaissance of interest in DC, encouraged, in part, by its successful application to younger patients with large middle cerebral artery stroke (Juttler et al. 2007, 2014). In this population there is good evidence that early decompressive craniectomy improves both functional and mortality outcomes (Juttler et al. 2007). Furthermore, its application for military (penetrating/blast) injuries has resulted in some dramatic rescues (Ecker et al. 2011). Still, recent randomized control studies of bi-frontal craniectomy in blunt trauma showed decreased intensive care unit times and better control of ICP, but worse long-term outcome (Cooper et al. 2011). Even in the post hoc analysis when adjustments were made for pupillary reactivity, there were no benefits found with DC over medical management alone. Additionally, the 2009 Cochrane Review could not recommend DC in adult TBI patients (Sahuquillo 2006). Some recent series have had more encouraging results. Both survival and long term outcome were found superior to medical management especially when the procedure was performed within 48  h of injury rather than as a salvage procedure (Gouello et al. 2014; Aarabi et al. 2006; Eghwrudjakpor and Allison 2010; Whitfield et al. 2001).|$|R

In part 2 we looked at the optimal use of CTP for BBB permeability (BBBP) measurement, factors influencing BBB integrity in stroke and non-stroke patients, BBB integrity in infarcted, ischemic and non-ischemic tissue, and the predictive value of BBBP measurements for HT and ME. Part 1 : With CTP cerebral perfusion can be accurately estimated in patients without intracranial pathology. There are normally small differences between perfusion in different cerebral flow territories. Deviations from these normal differences may indicate pathology. In SAH patients vasospasm causes a decrease in perfusion in the flow territory behind the spastic segment. However, large vessel vasospasm is not present in almost half of DCI patients. This suggest that vasospasm alone is not sufficient to cause DCI and that a multifactorial origin of DCI is more plausible. Over time absolute perfusion parameters gradually worsen towards DCI while perfusion asymmetry worsens more prominently and occurs after absolute values have already worsened. This suggests that SAH patients with diffusely worse absolute perfusion parameters may be more susceptibly to additional changes in perfusion. Qualitative interpretation of CTP colormaps makes it possible to distinguish patients with DCI from patients with other causes of deterioration and quantitative perfusion measurements can distinguish patients with DCI from clinically stable patients. Currently there is no good evidence that CBF improves due to treatment with Triple-H or its separate components. Of all components, induced hypertension seems to be the most promising. Part 2 : BBB damage is the mechanism by which HT and ME occur after acute ischemic stroke. To calculate BBBP from CTP values the Patlak model {{can be applied to the}} delayed phase of the CTP acquisition (and not the first-pass). A second bolus can be used to increase anatomical coverage of BBBP measurements with CTP. In patients without ischemic stroke BBBP is increased in the presence of hypertension and diabetes type II. Aspirin use seems to protect against BBB damage. In patients with ischemic stroke BBBP is increased in infarcted and ischemic brain tissue compared to non-ischemic tissue on the admission CTP scan. Patients with more than 50 % collateral filling have lower BBBP values than patients with less collateral filling. Good collateral supply therefore seems to protect against BBB damage. Patients in whom severe BBBP damage leads to HT or ME can be accurately identified with BBBP measurements from the delayed phase of CTP on admission. Only patients with abnormally elevated BBBP, older than 65 years that received rtPA developed HT or ME in our population...|$|E
40|$|Background Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} stroke in the West; however, it is prevalent in Asia and the Middle East. CVST is treated with dose-adjusted heparin or heparinoid followed by warfarin to facilitate recanalization of venous sinuses. For those with progressive <b>malignant</b> cerebral <b>edema,</b> the role of decompressive surgery has been reported from developed countries. We present data on decompressive craniectomy from a tertiary care stroke center in a developing country and compare our results and population with that described in the international literature. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of all patients who underwent a decompressive hemicraniectomy for CVST at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan from 1999 till 2011. A record review of the Aga Khan University Hospital was performed as decompressive hemicraniectomy for malignant CVST is not being performed {{elsewhere in the country}} and the hospital is a major referral center. Using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition codes for CVST, we identified a total of 7 patients. Patients are presented along with descriptions of their presentation, neuroimaging, intraoperative findings, and long-term outcomes. Pearson chi-square test was done to identify features that predicted survival. A comparative literature review was also done through PubMed to identify all other reports of surgery for CVST. Results During a 12 -year review, 134 patients were diagnosed with CVST. Of these, 7 received intervention. The age range of the patients was 15 - 60 years. Four of the 7 patients had an excellent outcome, 2 of 7 died, and 1 of 7 left against medical advice (in a comatose state) and was lost to follow-up. Patients presented alert but progressively deteriorated preoperatively. All those patients who had preoperative reactive pupils with low Glasgow Coma Scale scores made a complete neurologic recovery, and patients with fixed, dilated, and nonreactive pupils preoperatively died in the first postoperative week (P =. 05). Conclusions Patients who received decompressive hemicraniectomy in Pakistan for CVST had excellent outcomes in all cases when intervention was performed with intact preoperative pupillary reflexes. Of the data reviewed, most reported (two-third) patients show the same prognosticators; however, one third show that even with nonreactive pupils complete recovery is possible...|$|R
