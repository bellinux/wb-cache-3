40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{roasting}} degree on coffee brew melanoidin properties and formation mechanisms was studied. Coffee brew fractions differing in molecular weight (Mw) were isolated from green and light-, medium-, and dark-roasted coffee beans. Isolated fractions were characterized for their melanoidin, nitrogen, protein, phenolic groups, chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, caffeic acid, and sugar content. It {{was found that the}} melanoidin level in all fractions correlated with both the nitrogen and the protein content. The melanoidin level also correlated with the phenolic groups¿ level and ester-linked quinic acid level. It was concluded that proteins and chlorogenic acids should be primarily involved in <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation.</b> Initial roasting, from green to light-roasted beans, especially {{led to the formation of}} intermediate Mw (IMw) melanoidins when compared to high Mw (HMw) melanoidins. Indications were found that this IMw <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> is mainly due to Maillard reactions and chlorogenic acid incorporation reactions between chlorogenic acids, sucrose, and amino acids/protein fragments. Additionally, it was found that prolonged roasting predominantly led to formation melanoidins with a high Mw. Furthermore, arabinogalactans seem to be relatively more involved in <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> than galactomannans. It was hypothesized that chromophores may be formed or attached through the arabinose moiety of arabinogalactan proteins (AGP). Finally, it could be concluded that galactomannans are continuously incorporated in AGP-melanoidins upon roasting...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{studying}} of <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> regularities at interaction of D-glucose and D-xylose with p-amino benzoic acid (PABA) in acidic ethanolic media have been presented; {{features of the}} chosen threefold systems are, firstly, existence of the low-active amino-compound of benzene series, secondly, presence of catalytic amounts of the biogenic metal. Regularities of melanoidins structure formation from similar systems are almost not studied, {{at the same time}} some important biological properties are predicted for them that demands research of reactions' kinetics and development of techniques of their directional synthesis. Studying has been carried out by synthetic methods in total with a sample drawing technique with UV-Vis-spectrophotometry filing and engaging of FTIR-spectroscopy. Based on electronic spectra analysis more intensive <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> in case of reaction from D-xylose has been shown, this can be bound to steric hindrance and to ability of aldopentoses to give more reactionary capable intermediates in comparison with aldohexoses. The accelerating role of copper (II) ions as the complexing center catalyzing both formation and degradation of the intermediate products at different reaction stages has been confirmed, {{at the same time the}} accelerating action is considerably shown since copper ion concentrations about 60 mg/l, but Cu(II) chelation degree by final products is low. The effect of solvent has been noted, in particular the influence of ethanol on nature of amino-carbonyl interactions manifested in strengthening of carbohydrates tendency to re-cyclization, it also probably accelerates <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation.</b> The data obtained have shown the percent of carbohydrates direct destruction (caramelization) in the presented conditions is insignificant, that allows developing based on the present researches target synthetic techniques for melanoidin products' preparation...|$|E
40|$|High-molecular-weight (HMW) {{coloured}} compounds called melanoidins {{are widely}} distributed, particularly in foods. It {{has been proposed}} that they originate through the Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic browning reaction, due to the interaction between protein or peptide amino groups and carbohydrates. The melanoidin structure is not definitively known, {{and they have been}} generally defined as HMW nitrogen-containing brown polymers. In order to gain information on the nature of melanoidins, a simple in vitro model was chosen to investigate the products of the reactions between sugars and peptide/proteins. This approach would elucidate whether <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> is due to the binding of different sugar units to a peptide/protein or vice versa. With this aim, the reactivity of two different peptides, EPK 177 and physalaemin, and a low-molecular-weight (LMW) protein, lysozyme, was tested towards different saccharides (glucose, maltotriose (MT), maltopentaose and dextran 1000) in aqueous solutions at different temperatures. The incubation mixtures were analysed at different reaction times by MALDI/MS. Furthermore, in order to verify the possible role of sugar pyrolysis products in <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation,</b> the products arising from the thermal treatment at 200 degrees C of MT were incubated with lysozyme, and the reaction products were analysed by the same MS approach. The obtained results allowed the establishment of some general views: melanoidins cannot simply originate by reactions of sugar moieties with proteins. In fact, the reaction easily occurs, but it does not lead to any coloured product, as melanoidins have been described to be; melanoidins cannot originate from the thermal degradation products of glycated proteins. In fact, the thermal treatment of glycated lysozyme leads to a severe degradation of the protein with the formation of LMW species, far from the view of melanoidins as HMW compounds; experimental evidence has been gained on the <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> through reaction of intact protein with the pyrolysis products of MT. This hypothesis has been supported either from MALDI measurements or from spectroscopic data that show an absorption band in the range 300 - 600 nm, typical of melanoidins...|$|E
40|$|Melanoidins {{are high}} {{molecular}} brown colored substances and products of sugar-amine reaction of Maillard. They are formed during roasting a green coffee beans under different thermal regimes of heat treatment. In the technological production {{of different types}} coffee beverages, the coffee powder is subjected to after-heat treatment. In these additional operations again become active processes of <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> and their changing their structures. This is changes of the Melanoidins have different effects on human health. It is therefore important to know their chemical structures and changes. Previous {{studies have shown that}} polysaccharides, proteins and chlorogenic acids are included in the formation of these melanoidins. However, the precise structures of coffee melanoidins and mechanisms involved in the formation are not yet clarified. This article systematize available information and provides an overview of research obtained so far on the structure of coffee melanoidins and mechanisms of their formation and potential health effects...|$|E
40|$|Non enzymatic {{browning}} (NEB) kinetics {{were studied}} at 125, 135 and 145 °C during a cocoa beans roasting process aimed {{to reach a}} final moisture content of 2 g 100 g- 1. Colour lightness and hue angle decreased with roasting time following a first and a zero order kinetic, respectively. Moisture content being equal, high temperature-short time (HTST) roasting processes minimized the extent of browning reaction. Melanoidins increased with roasting time following an asymptotic kinetic. Moisture content being equal, HTST processes maximized the melanoidins formation. The energy of activation of <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> (132 kJ mol- 1) was {{higher than those of}} colour changes and polyphenol oxidation (between 60 and 80 kJ mol- 1), thus NEB during roasting is not solely dependent on Maillard reaction occurrence. Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) increased exponentially with roasting time but its final content was low (0. 1 - 0. 8 g kg- 1). HTST processes minimized the HMF formation, which was not temperature dependent and was influenced by concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of {{high molecular weight}} (HMw) coffee melanoidin populations, obtained after ethanol precipitation, was studied. The specific extinction coefficient (Kmix) at 280, 325, 405 nm, sugar composition, phenolic group content, nitrogen content, amino acid composition, and non-protein nitrogen (NPN) content were investigated. Results show that most HMw coffee melanoidins are soluble at high ethanol concentrations. The amino acid {{composition of}} the HMw fractions was similar, while 17 % (w/w) of the nitrogen was NPN, probably originating from degraded amino acids/proteins and now part of melanoidins. A strong correlation between the melanoidin content, the NPN, and protein content was found. It was concluded that proteins are incorporated into the melanoidins and {{that the degree of}} chemical modification, for example, by phenolic groups, determines the solubility of melanoidins in ethanol. Although the existence of covalent interaction between melanoidins and polysaccharides were not proven in this study, the findings suggest that especially arabinogalactan is likely involved in <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation.</b> Finally, phenolic groups were present in the HMw fraction of coffee, and a correlation was found with the melanoidin concentratio...|$|E
40|$|The charge {{properties}} of melanoidins in {{high molecular weight}} (HMw) coffee brew fractions, isolated by diafiltration and membrane dialysis, were studied. Ion exchange chromatography experiments with the HMw fractions showed that coffee brew melanoidins were negatively charged whereas these molecules did not expose any positive charge at the pH of coffee brew. Fractions with different ionic charges were isolated and subsequently characterized {{by means of the}} specific extinction coefficient (Kmix 405 nm), sugar composition, phenolic group content, nitrogen content, and the arabinogalactan protein (AGP) specific Yariv gel-diffusion assay. The isolated fractions were different in composition and AGP was found to be present in one of the HMw fractions. The AGP accounted for 6 % of the coffee brew dry matter and had a moderate negative charge, probably caused by the presence of uronic acids. As the fraction that precipitated with Yariv was brown (Kmix 405 nm = 1. 2), compared to a white color in the green bean, it was concluded that these AGPs had undergone Maillard reaction resulting in an AGP-melanoidin complex. The presence of mannose (presumably from galactomannan) indicates the incorporation of galactomannans in the AGP-melanoidin complex. As the uronic acid content in the more negatively charged melanoidin-rich, AGP-poor HMw fractions decreased, it was hypothesized that acidic groups are formed or incorporated during <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|E
40|$|The antioxidative {{properties}} of coffee brew fractions were studied using {{electron spin resonance}} spectroscopy using 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- 1 -piperidin- 1 -oxyl (TEMPO) and Fremy¿s salt (nitrosodisulfonate) as stabilized radicals. TEMPO was scavenged by antioxidants formed during roasting and not by chlorogenic acid, whereas Fremy¿s salt was scavenged by all antioxidants tested including chlorogenic acid. The stabilized radical TEMPO allowed the exclusive measurement of roasting-induced antioxidants. The roasting-induced antioxidant activity of coffee brews increased with increasing degree of roast, {{and most of these}} antioxidants were formed during the initial roasting stage. The majority of these roasting-induced antioxidants were present in the high molecular weight fractions, indicating that the formation of these antioxidants preferably occurs at specific high molecular weight structures, likely being arabinogalactan and/or protein moieties which might be part of the melanoidin complex. It was found that chlorogenic acids most probably do not lose their antioxidant activity and phenolic characteristics upon incorporation in coffee melanoidins. The parameter fast reacting antioxidants (FRA) was introduced as an alternative for the antioxidative potential. FRA levels showed that coffee fractions rich in roasting-induced antioxidants exposed their antioxidant activity relatively slowly, which must be a consequence of its complex structure. Finally, the melanoidin content and the roasting-induced antioxidant activity showed a positive and linear correlation for the coffee brew fractions, showing that roasting-induced antioxidants are present within melanoidins. This {{is the first time that}} the formation of roasting-induced antioxidants could be directly correlated with the extent of Maillard reaction and <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> in a complex product such as coffee...|$|E
40|$|Honey storage initiates <b>melanoidin</b> <b>formation</b> that {{involves}} {{a cascade of}} seemingly unguided redox reactions between amino acids/proteins, reducing sugars and polyphenols. In the process, high molecular weight protein-polyphenol complexes are formed, but the mechanism involved remains unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} twofold: to determine quantitative and qualitative changes in proteins in honeys stored for prolonged times and in different temperatures and to relate these changes to the formation of protein-polyphenol complexes. Six -month storage decreased the protein content by 46. 7 % in all tested honeys (t-test, p< 0. 002) with the rapid reduction occurring during the first three month. The changes in protein levels coincided with alterations in molecular size and net charge of proteins on SDS -PAGE. Electro-blotted proteins reacted with a quinone-specific nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) on nitrocellulose membranes indicating that quinones derived from oxidized polyphenols formed covalent bonds with proteins. Protein-polyphenol complexes isolated by size-exclusion chromatography differed in size and stoichiometry and fall into two categories: (a) high molecular weight complexes (230 - 180 kDa) enriched in proteins but possessing a limited reducing activity toward the NBT and (b) lower molecular size complexes (110 - 85 kDa) enriched in polyphenols but strongly reducing the dye. The variable stoichiometry suggest that the large, "protein-type" complexes were formed by protein cross-linking, while in the smaller, "polyphenol-type" complexes polyphenols were first polymerized prior to protein binding. Quinones preferentially bound a 31 kDa protein which, by the electrospray quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Qtof-MS) analysis, showed homology to dirigent-like proteins known for assisting in radical coupling and polymerization of phenolic compounds. These findings provide a new look on protein-polyphenol interaction in honey where the reaction of quinones with proteins and polyphenols could possibly be under assumed guidance of dirigent proteins...|$|E
