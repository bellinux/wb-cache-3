5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Europe in 1923 with Tannahill and Kaesche, touring Italy and spending {{two months in}} Cassis before settling in Paris late that summer. Her friend Flora Schoenfeld convinced her to dye her hair red in the fashion of <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> their circle. While in Paris Lazzell studied Cubism and geometric abstraction alongside Fernand Léger, André Lhote, and Albert Gleizes. Lazzell's work was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne and the American Women's Club in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Concepts of women's {{social rights}} {{and social status}} during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, {{as men and women}} in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E

5|$|The {{contemporary}} Indigenous Australian art movement {{began in}} the western desert in 1971, when Indigenous men at Papunya took up painting, led by elders such as Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, and assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. This initiative, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of}} the Papunya Tula artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the communities wished to participate, and in the 1990s many began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} Victorian era, the leisure {{industry}} had emerged in all cities with <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> attendance.

25|$|Women gained {{important}} {{experiences in}} public speaking and organizing that stood them in good stead going forward. The Grimké sisters' public speaking {{played a critical}} part in legitimizing women's place in the public sphere. Some Christian women created cent societies to benefit abolition movements, where <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> a church would each pledge to donate one cent a week to help abolitionist causes.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{populations in}} rural Tajikistan {{experience}} spatial health inequities. A study by Jane Falkingham noted that physical access to healthcare {{was one of}} the primary factors influencing quality of maternal healthcare. Further, <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> rural areas of the country did not have adequate access to healthcare resources, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal care. These rural women were, for instance, far more likely to give birth in their homes without medical oversight.|$|E

25|$|Born in Pinar del Río in Cuba, Silva {{began to}} {{participate}} in pole vault competitions {{from the age of}} twelve. <b>Many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> her family took part in athletics and her mother was a javelin thrower. In spite of its strong traditions in track and field, pole vaulting was a discipline in which Cuba had not historically been successful. As a result, Silva quickly established herself nationally at the age of sixteen, coming second at the Cuban Athletics Championships and winning the Barrientos Memorial in 2003. In 2004, she cleared four metres for the first time, which was a Central American and Caribbean junior record. She improved this to 4.10m at the 2005 Barrientos meet, winning the competition again.|$|E
25|$|Icelandic {{society and}} culture has {{a high degree of}} gender equality, with <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> {{leadership}} positions in government and business. Iceland also has a highly progressive gay rights legislation, with couples having been able to register civil unions since 1996, adopt since 2006, and marry since 2010. Women retain their names after marriage, since Icelanders generally do not use surnames but patronyms or (in certain cases) matronyms. (See Icelandic name.) Iceland also has the most extensive and progressive child protection law. The new Children's Act, passed in March 2003, and effective as of November 2003, not only places Iceland on the list of 25 nations that have outlawed spanking, but also outlaws verbal and emotional abuse and makes child protection a priority. Physical or mental violence is punishable by imprisonment and/or fine, and there is no legal defense.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} {{do it yourself}} infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the active}} {{participation}} of <b>many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the revolution helped awaken many women about their political potential, and many middle-class women acted increasingly to support women’s rights. Increasing vocal opposition to policies which sanctioned polygamy, temporary marriage, free divorce for men, and child custody to fathers also took hold. A growing trend of women began to interpret Islam in more gender-egalitarian ways with {{the entry of}} more women {{in the public sphere}} and limitation of discourse to Islamic parameters. Growing activism and publicity brought some legal remedies to the women’s struggle for example limits on a husband’s right to prevent his wife from taking a job, and a new marriage contract which gave women the right to divorce. Judges became more sympathetic to women’s issues because of the hardship, and when some reforms did not make it through the legislative process, the government tried to ameliorate some of the injustices and gave instructions to the courts on how to do so.|$|E
25|$|An {{ideology}} of preserving family honor is deeply rooted is society {{and is not}} affected by high levels of education. <b>Many</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Turkey are well educated but still {{are expected to be}} modest and sexually pure in order to preserve the honor of their families. If a family's honor is breached, it brings shame to the entire family. In such cases, traditionally the family would decide the fate of the female that brought shame. This might involve forcing the young woman into a shotgun wedding, while in extreme cases a young male in the family was given the duty to cleanse the family name through an honor killing. With recent changes to criminal law that removed reduced sentences for honor killings, females that brought shame to the family are sometimes forced to commit honor suicides by their families, especially in the predominantly Kurdish South-East regions, a region that greatly values traditions. Families who do not want their sons to face possible incrimination have encouraged their daughters to commit suicide. The number of female suicides over the years has increased greatly. Stories have surfaced revealing girls who are given tools with which to kill themselves such as rope to hang themselves, poisons to drink, or a gun to shoot themselves. Some murders have also been disguised as suicides in order to protect family members. Female family members {{are not the only ones}} that may be punished to preserve family honor. It is proposed that the death of a male homosexual physics student, Ahmet Yildiz, was an honor killing.|$|E
