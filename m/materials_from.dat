5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of a cell}} has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing waste to leave, preventing <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> entering the cell, averting needed <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle's The Parts of Animals {{sets out}} enough {{details of his}} views on {{metabolism}} for an open flow model to be made. He believed that at each stage of the process, <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> food were transformed, with heat being released as the classical element of fire, and residual materials being excreted as urine, bile, or faeces.|$|E
5|$|As a corollary, Nyuserre {{was almost}} {{certainly}} a son of Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkare's queen. This relationship is also indicated by the location of Nyuserre's pyramid in Abusir next to that of Neferirkare, {{as well as his}} reuse for his own valley temple of <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> Neferikare's unfinished constructions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, new {{building}} methods, particularly concrete and steel were used, and the exterior was essentially facing. Thus <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> further away could be used, {{such as the}} Portland Stone used on the Leeds Civic Hall, the Parkinson Building of the University of Leeds and the Queens Hotel.|$|E

50|$|In shipyards, bucket {{wheels are}} used for the {{continuous}} loading and unloading of ships, where they pick up <b>material</b> <b>from</b> the yard for transfer to the delivery system. Bucket chains {{can be used to}} unload <b>material</b> <b>from</b> a ship's hold. TAKRAF's continuous ship unloader is capable of removing up to 95% of the <b>material</b> <b>from</b> a ship's hold, owing to a flexibly-configured digging attachment.|$|R

5|$|Polonium and its {{compounds}} must {{be handled}} in a glove box, which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E
5|$|Self-decoration is {{employed}} by animals in different groups, including decorator crabs, which attach <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> their environment, {{as well as}} living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, Eupagurus constans, has the hydroid Hydractinia sodalis growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another hermit crab, Eupagurus cuanensis, has the aposematic orange sponge Suberites domuncula which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.|$|E

5|$|The {{defensive}} forces sustained 20,000 casualties, {{and about}} 1,300 weapons were {{captured by the}} Germans.

He also suffered the revocation of all his awards, military degrees, and honors. The Germans used <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> the fortress elsewhere during their war against Russia.|$|E

5|$|After Rupert's {{retirement}} from active seafaring in around 1674, {{he was able}} to spend more time engaged in scientific research and became credited with many inventions and discoveries, although some subsequently {{turned out to be the}} innovative introduction of European inventions into England.

5|$|At the time, {{only about}} $15,000 from the {{building}} fund was still available since money had already been spent on buying the property and <b>materials</b> <b>from</b> the Mellon Mansion. Further fund raising generated 1,200 pledges, 95 percent of which were fulfilled: 60 {{percent of the money}} came from 10 percent of the parishioners and approximately 10 percent of the people did not contribute at all. During this time, all of the books concerning the finances of the construction of the new church were kept by ladies of the St. Peter's Cenacle. The ladies not only recorded all of the pledges and collections, but they also recorded all notices and minutes from their meetings. While the church was being built, the Campaigners met almost every evening.|$|E
