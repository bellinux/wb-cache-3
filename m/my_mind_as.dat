500|$|Salinger's {{writing has}} {{influenced}} several prominent writers, prompting Harold Brodkey (himself an O. Henry Award-winning author) to state in 1991: [...] "His {{is the most}} influential body of work in English prose by anyone since Hemingway." [...] Of the writers in Salinger's generation, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist John Updike attested that [...] "the short stories of J. D. Salinger really opened my eyes as to how you can weave fiction out {{of a set of}} events that seem almost unconnected, or very lightly connected... stick in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> really having moved me a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material." [...] The critic Louis Menand has observed that the early stories of Pulitzer Prize-winner Philip Roth were affected by [...] "Salinger's voice and comic timing".|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Junkie's Promise", sung by Moore, was {{described}} as a [...] "heroin vignette". It was originally interpreted by many as a tribute to Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. However, Moore later clarified that the song [...] "is purely about the emotional relationship between friends, one of which is a user. Any individual involved with drug addiction will lie to his friends for the self-serving need. It's the cruelest truth of the situation. Kurt may fit this profile and he was surely in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> I wrote but the song is not a specific dedication to him". Other songs such as [...] "Becuz" [...] and [...] "No Queen Blues" [...] were built upon [...] "numb grooves with slivers of melody, power, and gorgeously crafted noise". The final track on the album, [...] "The Diamond Sea", {{was described}} as a [...] "Neil Young-esque ballad billowing into an epic noise excursion". It is considered the longest track on any Sonic Youth album, excluding Sonic Youth Recordings releases. Due to its long duration, the song was edited down to 5:15 for release as a single, which also included an alternative 25-minute version as an additional track.|$|E

She also sang with Christopher Cross on the song [...] "Never Stop Believing" [...] on his 1988 album Back of <b>My</b> <b>Mind,</b> <b>as</b> {{well as with}} Bob Welch on his solo version of [...] "Sentimental Lady". McVie {{released}} an album with fellow Fleetwood Mac member Lindsey Buckingham titled Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie on 9 June 2017.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pattern of}} Wilson's speechmaking was {{exemplified}} by his performances in Buffalo and New York City. His oratory style was, [...] "right out of <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> {{it is working}} at the time". He maintained towards his primary opponent Roosevelt a tone of humorous detachment, describing the Bull Moose party as [...] "the irregular Republicans, the variegated Republicans". Wilson shunned the stump speech campaign routine, and initially was reluctant to conduct an extensive campaign tour, but this changed after Roosevelt went on the offensive.|$|E
2500|$|In an eighth-grade {{commencement}} address entitled “Humanity's Next Great Adventure,” {{given at}} a school in San Mateo, California, in 2002, Clancey recalled his own school years, when he “always got extra credit in eighth grade science, answering quiz questions about the latest Gemini two-person launches, getting us ready for the {{first trip to the}} moon in three years. I used to read these stories in the New York Times--absorbing every word. And of course when Star Trek began on TV in September, I watched the first episode and haven't missed any in 36 years. So space travel was on <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> I sat at MY eighth grade graduation, and it's probably no coincidence that I work for NASA today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|He wore 'black' {{on behalf}} of the poor and hungry, {{on behalf of}} [...] "the {{prisoner}} who has long paid for his crime," [...] and on behalf of those who have been betrayed by age or drugs. [...] "And," [...] Cash added, [...] "with the Vietnam War as painful in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> it was in most other Americans, I wore it 'in mournin' for the lives that could have been'... Apart from the Vietnam War being over, I don't see much reason to change my position... The old are still neglected, the poor are still poor, the young are still dying before their time, and we're not making many moves to make things right. There's still plenty of darkness to carry off." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{hearing his}} recommendation, the Kublai {{immediately}} ordered the envoy to summon him. After he arrived, the Emperor {{looked at him}} at length before asking, [...] "Are you afraid {{to come to the}} big country?" [...] He answered, [...] "The sage regards people in all directions as his sons. When a son comes to his father, what is there to fear?" [...] "Why do you come?" [...] He replied, [...] "My family has been living in the west for generations. I took the imperial edict to build the stupa in Tibet for two years. I saw constant wars there, and wish Your Majesty could pacify there. I come for sentient beings." [...] "What do you practice?" [...] He said, [...] "I take <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> my teacher and know roughly painting, casting, and carving." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike many umpires, Evans {{never made}} claims to infallibility. [...] "I missed {{a lot of}} {{decision}}s", he once said. [...] "At the time of making such a decision {{there was no doubt}} in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> to its correctness. However, a second or two later I felt that I erred and wished I could change my original ruling". Evans' humility and impartiality did not always protect him from abusive fans. As sports writers Daniel Okrent and Steve Wulf observed, [...] "roughness on the field seemed to elicit the same in the stands". On September 15, 1907, in the midst of a doubleheader between the St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers, Evans suffered a skull fracture when a bottle hurled by an angry spectator knocked him unconscious. The New York Times described the incident as [...] "one of the most disgraceful scenes ever witnessed on a ball field".|$|E
2500|$|On October 24, 1989, at a {{press conference}} at the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Washington, DC, Minister Farrakhan {{described}} a vision which he had on September 17, 1985 in Tepoztlán, Mexico. In this 'Vision-like' experience he was carried up to [...] "a Wheel, or what you call an unidentified flying object", as in the Bible's Book of Ezekiel. During this experience, he heard the voice of Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He said in the press conference that Elijah Muhammad [...] "spoke in short cryptic sentences and as he spoke a scroll full of cursive writing rolled down in front of my eyes, but it was a projection of what was being written in <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> <b>As</b> I attempted to read the cursive writing, which was in English, the scroll disappeared and the Honorable Elijah Muhammad began to speak to me." [...] , [...] "President Reagan has met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan a war. I want you to hold a press conference in Washington, D.C., and announce their plan and say to the world that you got the information from me, Elijah Muhammad, on the Wheel." ...|$|E

2500|$|Arthur C. Parker, Secretary of the Society of American Indians from 1911 to 1915, {{regarded}} McKenzie as the [...] "father of the movement." [...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who says anything to me tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and believe that is so, even though doubtful as to what extent that confidence involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him {{to stay with the}} Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you may have to do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain {{director}} David Cage {{described the}} game as [...] "a very dark film noir thriller with mature themes" [...] without any supernatural elements, and that [...] "the real message [...] is about how far you're {{willing to go to}} save someone you love." [...] In 2008, Cage gave a brief overview of the game's narrative and ambitions: [...] "Heavy Rain is about normal people who have landed in extraordinary situations. I wanted a much more personal story. The first thing that came to <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>as</b> a father of two little boys, was that the main theme should simply be a father's love for his son. This is not a game about saving the princess or the world. Its [...] purely about a father's love. The main story will revolve around four different characters, and we're putting the spotlight on their perceptions. The question 'what is good and what is evil' is the key here, that will be just a matter of viewpoint...I believe heavily in moral choices, I'm going to use them A LOT. They're not about being good or bad, but about finding the right balance." [...] Cage commented on the setting by saying, [...] "I don't want to do a big free-roaming city like GTA, because the flow of the story will then be hard to control. Nevertheless, I do want to incorporate big sets, with a crowd, heavy populated areas like a mall and a subway {{are going to be in}} there. Of course, the gameplay has got to make use of that aspect too." [...] Cage also stated that the game's storyline and themes was heavily influenced by the 2006-2010 science fiction psychological thriller television series, Heroes.|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>as</b> freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng strongly agreed with him.|$|E
