5000|$|A {{rechargeable}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> (also {{known as}} alkaline rechargeable or rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>manganese</b> (RAM)) {{is a type}} of <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> that is capable of recharging for repeated use. The first generation rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> were introduced by Union Carbide and Mallory in early 1970's[...] Several patents were introduced after Union Carbide's product discontinuation and eventually, in 1986, Battery Technologies Inc of Canada was founded to commercially develop a 2nd generation product based on those patents. Their first product to be licensed out and sold commercially was to Rayovac under the trademark [...] "Renewal". The next year, [...] "Pure Energy" [...] batteries were released by Pure Energy. After reformulating the Renewals to be mercury free in 1995, subsequent licensed RAM alkalines were mercury free and included ALCAVA, AccuCell, Grandcell and EnviroCell. Subsequent patent and advancements in technology have been introduced. The formats include AAA, AA, C, D, and snap-on 9-volt <b>batteries.</b> Rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> are manufactured fully charged and have the ability to hold their charge for years, longer than NiCd and NiMH <b>batteries,</b> which self-discharge.Rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> can have a high recharging efficiency and have less environmental impact than disposable cells.|$|R

5000|$|In {{consumer}} applications, Ni-Cd batteries compete {{directly with}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries.</b> A Ni-Cd cell {{has a lower}} capacity than that of an equivalent alkaline cell, and costs more. However, since the <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery's</b> chemical reaction is not reversible, a reusable Ni-Cd battery has a significantly longer total lifetime. There have been attempts to create rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> or specialized battery chargers for charging single-use <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> but none that has seen wide usage.|$|R
25|$|<b>Alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> {{account for}} 80% of {{manufactured}} batteries in the US and over 10 billion individual units produced worldwide. In Japan <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> account for 46% of all primary battery sales.

25|$|The use of {{disposable}} batteries increases by 5–6% every year. In the past, used batteries {{ended up at}} landfill sites, but in 2004, disposal of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> at landfill sites was forbidden by an EU regulation. EU member countries are committed to recycling 50% of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> by 2016. The need for recycling thus equals to 125,000 tons per year. The share of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> is approximately 80% of the whole.|$|R
50|$|NiOx {{batteries}} used in low-drain applications, have a lifespan {{similar to}} an <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery.</b> NiOx batteries produce {{a higher voltage}} (1.7V) than <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> (1.5V) which can cause problems in certain products, such as equipment with incandescent light bulbs (such as flashlights/torches), or devices without a voltage regulator.|$|R
25|$|Battery {{life can}} be {{extended}} by storing the batteries at a low temperature, as in a refrigerator or freezer, which slows the side reactions.

To reach their maximum voltage, batteries must be returned to room temperature; discharging an <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> at 250 mA at 0°C is only half as efficient as at 20°C. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> manufacturers such as Duracell do not recommend refrigerating batteries.|$|R

50|$|Rechargeable {{alkalines}} {{showed a}} slight increase in sales in 2016 and are expected to hold their share through 2020 but Lithium rechargeable show the most significant growth. Unlike rechargeable <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries,</b> NiMH batteries can endure anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand (or more) deep discharge cycles, resulting in a long useful life; their limitation is now more usually by age rather than cycles. Capacity of NiMH batteries is close to that of <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries.</b> Unlike all <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> (rechargeable or otherwise), internal resistance is low. This makes them well suited for high draw applications. Self discharge rates are comparable, at least up to 6 months.|$|R

40|$|Three {{mathematical}} models, two {{of primary}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathode discharge, {{and one of}} primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> discharge, are developed, presented, solved and investigated in this thesis. The primary aim of this work is to improve {{our understanding of the}} complex, interrelated and nonlinear processes that occur within primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> during discharge. We use perturbation techniques and Laplace transforms to analyse and simplify an existing model of primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathode under galvanostatic discharge. The process highlights key phenomena, and removes those phenomena that have very little effect on discharge from the model. We find that electrolyte variation within Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide (EMD) particles is negligible, but proton diffusion within EMD crystals is important. The simplification process results in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} model equations, and greatly decreases the computational overhead of the numerical simulation software. In addition, the model results based on this simplified framework compare well with available experimental data. The second model of the primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> cathode discharge simulates step potential electrochemical spectroscopy discharges, and is used to improve our understanding of the multi-reaction nature of the reduction of EMD. We find that a single-reaction framework is able to simulate multi-reaction behaviour through the use of a nonlinear ion-ion interaction term. The third model simulates the full primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> system, and accounts for the precipitation of zinc oxide within the separator (and other regions), and subsequent internal short circuit through this phase. It was found that an internal short circuit is created at the beginning of discharge, and this self-discharge may be exacerbated by discharging the cell intermittently. We find that using a thicker separator paper is a very effective way of minimising self-discharge behaviour. The equations describing the three models are solved numerically in MATLABR, using three pieces of numerical simulation software. They provide a flexible and powerful set of primary <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> discharge prediction tools, that leverage the simplified model framework, allowing them to be easily run on a desktop PC...|$|R
5000|$|When possible, oceanographers use <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> {{because they}} are {{inexpensive}} and readily available. However, when <b>alkaline</b> <b>batteries</b> provide insufficient capacity, oceanographers turn to lithium battery packs, which can supply three times the capacity. Battery packs based on lithium thionyl chloride chemistry cost more than <b>alkaline</b> <b>battery</b> packs, but they provide roughly three times the energy density at about 60% of the weight (both by volume). Lithium batteries have other advantages as well. They produce negligible gas, and what gas is produced is contained in hermetically sealed metal containers. The voltage {{over the life of}} the pack varies considerably less than the voltage of an alkaline pack. Low current lithium cells also have relative low self-discharge, losing less than 10% of their capacity in 10 years.|$|R
