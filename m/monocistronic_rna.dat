50|$|LVX {{does not}} have a known vector, but it most likely spreads and enters the cell through {{mechanical}} inoculation by insects. The replication of LVX, like other ssRNA(+) viruses, occurs in the cytoplasm of cells. Once the virus enters into the host cell, the virus is uncoated and releases the viral genome RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> is then translated into RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by the 5’-proximal ORF. The replication of LVX occurs in viral factories which are organized by the protein TGBp1. TGBp1 works to rearrange the actin and endomembranes of the host and creates an assembly of helical arrangements. These helical structures are surrounded by the host endomembranes, which create a region where the virus can replicate more efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Viral protein {{synthesis}} is completely {{dependent upon the}} translational machinery of the host cell. However, many RNA virus transcripts have marked structural differences from cellular mRNAs that preclude canonical translation initiation, such as {{the absence of a}} 59 cap structure or the presence of highly structured 59 UTRs containing replication and/or packaging signals. Furthermore, whilst the great majority of cellular mRNAs are apparently <b>monocistronic,</b> <b>RNA</b> viruses must often express multiple proteins from their mRNAs. In addition, RNA viruses have very compact genomes and are under intense selective pressure to optimize usage of the available sequence space. Together, these features have driven the evolution of a plethora of non-canonical translational mechanisms in RNA viruses that help them to meet these challenges. Here, we review the mechanisms utilized by RNA viruses of eukaryotes, focusing on internal ribosome entry, leaky scanning, non-AUG initiation, ribosome shunting, reinitiation, ribosomal frameshifting and stop-codon readthrough. The review will highlight recently discovered examples of unusual translational strategies, besides revisiting some classical cases...|$|E
40|$|Small {{nucleolar}} RNAs (snoRNAs) are intron encoded or expressed from monocistronic independent transcription units, or, in {{the case}} of plants, from polycistronic clusters. We show that the snR 190 and U 14 snoRNAs from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are co-transcribed as a dicistronic precursor which is processed by the RNA endonuclease Rnt 1, the yeast ortholog of bacterial RNase III. RNT 1 disruption results in a dramatic decrease in the levels of mature U 14 and snR 190 and in accumulation of dicistronic snR 190 -U 14 RNAs. Addition of recombinant Rnt 1 to yeast extracts made from RNT 1 disruptants induces the chase of dicistronic RNAs into mature snoRNAs, showing that dicistronic RNAs correspond to functional precursors stalled in the processing pathway. Rnt 1 cleaves a dicistronic transcript in vitro in the absence of other factors, separating snR 190 from U 14. Thus, one of the functions of eukaryotic RNase III is, as for the bacterial enzyme, to liberate <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNAs</b> from polycistronic transcripts...|$|R

This indicates that steady-state RNA abundance {{is controlled by}} posttranscriptional mechanisms involving differential RNA stability. In this study, in organello pulse-chase labeling experiments were {{used to analyze the}} stability of different T. brucei mitochondrial RNA populations. In this system, total RNA and rRNA are stable for many hours. In contrast, mRNAs can be degraded by two biochemically distinct turnover pathways. The first pathway results in the rapid degradation of mRNA (half-life [t 1 / 2] of 11 to 18 min) and is dependent upon the presence of an mRNA poly(A) tail. Remarkably, this pathway also requires the addition of UTP and therefore is termed UTP dependent. The second pathway results in slow turnover of mitochondrial mRNA (t 1 / 2 of ∼ 3 h) and is not dependent upon the presence of an mRNA poly(A) tail or the addition of exogenous UTP. In summary, these results demonstrate the presence of a novel, UTP-dependent degradation pathway for T. brucei mitochondrial mRNAs and reveal an unprecedented role for both UTP and mRNA polyadenylation in T. brucei mitochondrial gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis protein 1 (c-IAP 1) can regulate apoptosis {{through its}} interaction with downstream TNF receptor effectors (TRAF 1 and TRAF 2), by binding to and inhibiting certain caspases, and by controlling {{the levels of}} specific proapoptotic stimuli (e. g., Smac/DIABLO) within the cell. Studies involving the expression of c-IAP 1 mRNA and protein in cells and tissues have provided evidence suggesting c-IAP 1 expression may be posttranscriptionally controlled. Because the 5 ′-UTR of c-IAP 1 mRNA is unusually long, contains multiple upstream AUG codons, and {{has the potential to}} form thermodynamically stable secondary structures, we investigated the possibility it contained an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that may regulate its expression. In the present study, the c-IAP 1 5 ′-UTR exhibited IRES activity when dicistronic RNA constructs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and in transiently transfected cells. IRES-mediated translation was similar to that exhibited by the hepatitis C virus IRES but varied significantly in RRL and in HeLa, HepG 2, and 293 T cells, indicating the c-IAP 1 IRES was system and cell type specific. IRES-mediated translation was maintained in mono- and dicistronic constructs in which the UTR was inserted downstream from a stable hairpin that prevented cap-dependent ribosome scanning. In cells, {{the presence or absence of}} a methylated cap did not significantly affect the translation of polyadenylated, <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNAs</b> containing the c-IAP 1 5 ′-UTR.

40|$|The ribosomal protein S 4 gene (rps 4) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a single copy sequence in the mitochondrial genomes of two distant higher plants, Magnolia and Helianthus. Sequence analysis revealed that the rps 4 genes present in the magnolia and sunflower mitochondrial genomes encode S 4 polypeptides of 352 and 331 amino acids, respectively, longer than their counterparts in liverwort and bacteria. Expression of the rps 4 genes in the investigated higher plant mitochondria was confirmed by Western blot analysis. In Helianthus, one of two short nucleotide insertions at the 3 '-end introduces in the coding region a premature termination codon. Northern hybridizations and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that the <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> transcripts generated from the rps 4 locus in Magnolia and Helianthus mitochondria are modified by RNA editing at 28 and 13 positions, respectively. Although evolutionarily conserved, RNA editing requirements of the rps 4 appear more extensive in Magnolia than in Helianthus and in the other higher plants so far investigated. Furthermore, our analysis also suggests that selection of editing sites is RNA sequence-specific in a duplicated sequence context. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Human rhinoviruses, {{the most}} {{important}} etiologic agents of the common cold, are messenger-active single-stranded <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> viruses that have evolved a highly complex cascade of proteolytic processing events to control viral gene expression and replication. Most maturation cleavages within the precursor polyprotein are mediated by rhinovirus 3 C protease (or its immediate precursor, 3 CD), a cysteine protease with a trypsin-like polypeptide fold. High-resolution crystal structures of the enzyme from three viral serotypes {{have been used for}} the design and elaboration of 3 C protease inhibitors representing different structural and chemical classes. Inhibitors having α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups combined with peptidyl-binding elements specific for 3 C protease undergo a Michael reaction mediated by nucleophilic addition of the enzyme’s catalytic Cys- 147, resulting in covalent-bond formation and irreversible inactivation of the viral protease. Direct inhibition of 3 C proteolytic activity in virally infected cells treated with these compounds can be inferred from dose-dependent accumulations of viral precursor polyproteins as determined by SDS/PAGE analysis of radiolabeled proteins. Cocrystal-structure-assisted optimization of 3 C-protease-directed Michael acceptors has yielded molecules having extremely rapid in vitro inactivation of the viral protease, potent antiviral activity against multiple rhinovirus serotypes and low cellular toxicity.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} of figwort mosaic virus (FMV), a caulimovirus, was investigated by electroporation of Nicotiana edwardsonii cell suspension protoplasts with cloned viral constructs {{in which a}} reporter gene was inserted at various positions on the genome. The {{results showed that the}} genome of FMV contains two promoters; one is used for the production of a full-length RNA and another initiates synthesis of a separate <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> for gene VI. Evidence is provided that the full-length transcript, the probable template for reverse transcription, can serve as a polycistronic mRNA for translation of genes I through V and perhaps also gene VI. Expression of all the genes on the polycistronic mRNA is trans activated by the gene VI protein. Reporter gene expression appears most efficient when its start codon is in close proximity to the stop codon of the preceding gene, as for the native genes of caulimoviruses. We propose that the gene VI product enables {{expression of}} the polycistronic mRNA by promoting reinitiation of ribosomes to give translational coupling of individual genes.

Retina polysomes involved in translation of this enzyme were precipitated {{with a high}} degree of specificity by the gammaglobulin isolated from antiserum against the enzyme (anti-enzyme gammaglobulin). Using immunoprecipitation procedures, we determined that the amount of polysome-bound nascent enzyme was maximal in polysomes comprising 9 - 14 ribosomes and was about 3 -fold higher in the induced than in the noninduced retina. Within this size group of polysomes, those comprising 11 - 13 ribosomes showed consistently greater binding of anti-enzyme [125 I]gammaglobulin than of normal [125 I]-gammaglobulin.

40|$|A single {{internal}} ribosomal entry site (IRES) {{in conjunction}} with IRES transactivating factors (ITAFs) is sufficient to recruit the translational machinery to a eukaryotic mRNA independent of the cap structure. However, we demonstrate that the mouse TrkB mRNA contains two independent IRESes. The mouse TrkB mRNA consists of one of two 5 ' leaders (1428 nt and 448 nt), both of which include the common 3 ' exon (Ex 2, 344 nt). Dicistronic RNA transfections and in vitro translation of <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> demonstrated that both full-length 5 ' leaders, as well as Ex 2, exhibit IRES activity indicating the IRES is located within Ex 2. Additional analysis of the upstream sequences demonstrated that the first 260 nt of exon 1 (Ex 1 a) also contains an IRES. Dicistronic RNA transfections into SH-SY 5 Y cells showed the Ex 1 a IRES is constitutively active. However, the Ex 2 IRES is only active in response to retinoic acid induced neural differentiation, a state which correlates with the synthesis of the ITAF polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB 1). Correspondingly, addition or knock-down of PTB 1 altered Ex 2, but not Ex 1 a IRES activity in vitro and ex vivo, respectively.

The lacto-coccal galU gene was identified by a PCR approach using degenerate primers and was found by Northern blot analysis to be transcribed in a <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA.</b> The L. lactis galU gene could complement an Escherichia coli galU mutant, and overexpression of this gene in L. lactis under control of the inducible nisA promoter resulted in a 20 -fold increase in GalU activity. Remarkably, this resulted in approximately eightfold increases in the levels of both UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose. This indicated that the endogenous GalE activity is not limiting and that the GalU activity level in wild-type cells controls the biosynthesis of intracellular UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose. The increased GalU activity did not significantly increase NIZO B 40 EPS pro-duction. Disruption of the galE gene resulted in poor growth, undetectable intracellular levels of UDP-galactose, and elimination of EPS production in strain NIZO B 40 when cells were grown in media with glucose as the sole carbon source.

We found that cg 3 O mutants had no striking phenotype in cell lines derived from Spodoptera frugiperda or Trichoplusia ni or in T. ni larvae. Although cg 3 O is known to be transcribed as an early <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> and as the second cistron of an abundant late bicistronic RNA, production of a CG 30 -},-galactosidase fusion protein was observed mainly at early times postinfection.

These cells can be maintained and labeled efficiently in organ culture; their in vitro (and cell free) protein synthetic activity reflects their activity in vivo. During differentiation the cells undergo dramatic changes in protein synthesis. For 2 days the cells are devoted almost exclusively to production of distinctive chorion proteins of low molecular weight and of unusual amino acid composition. Each protein has its own characteristic developmental kinetics of synthesis. Each is synthesized as a separate polypeptide, apparently on <b>monocistronic</b> messenger <b>RNA</b> (mRNA), and thus reflects {{the expression of a}} distinct gene. The rapid changes in this tissue do not result from corresponding changes in translational efficiency. Thus, the peptide chain elongation rate is comparable for chorion and for proteins synthesized at earlier developmental stages (1. 3 - 1. 9 amino acids/sec); moreover, the spacing of ribosomes on chorion mRNA (30 - 37 codons per ribosome) is similar to that encountered in other eukaryotic systems...|$|R

To elucidate how these different species are produced in vivo, RNA synthesized from the 3 '-proximal N gene was characterized by Northern RNA blot and RNase protection analyses. The results showed that measles virus produced three size classes of plus-sense N-containing RNA species corresponding to <b>monocistronic</b> N <b>RNA,</b> bicistronic NP RNA, and antigenomes. Unlike vesicular stomatitis virus, measles virus does not produce a detectable free plus-sense leader RNA.

These various RNA species accumulated concurrently throughout infection. However, cycloheximide preferentially inhibited accumulation of antigenomes and leader-containing RNA but not leaderless and subgenomic RNAs late in infection, suggesting that synthesis of the former RNA species requires a late protein function or a continuous supply of structural proteins or both.

40|$|Legionella pneumophila colonizes {{freshwater}} amoebae and {{can also}} replicate within alveolar macrophages. When their nutrient supply is exhausted, replicating bacteria become cytotoxic, motile, and infectious, which is thought to promote transmission to a new amoeba. The differentiation of L. pneumophila is coordinated by the sigma factors RpoS and FliA and the two-component regulator LetA/LetS and is enhanced by the letE locus. Here we demonstrate that letE promotes motility by increasing expression of the flagellin gene flaA but has little impact on the transcription of fliA, the flagellar sigma factor gene. In addition to promoting motility, letE induces the characteristic shape, pigment, and heat resistance of stationary-phase L. pneumophila. To gain insight into how letE promotes {{the expression of the}} transmission phenotype, we designed molecular genetic experiments to discriminate between the following three models: letE mutations are polar on milX; letE encodes a small novel protein; or, by analogy to csrB, letE encodes a regulatory RNA that sequesters CsrA to relieve repression. We report that letE encodes an activator protein, as it does not complement an Escherichia coli csrB mutant, it directs the synthesis of an ∼ 12 -kDa polypeptide, and a letE nonsense mutation eliminates function.

40|$|Abstract Background Regulating {{synthesis}} of the Fragile X gene (FMR 1) product, FMRP alters neural plasticity potentially through {{its role in the}} microRNA pathway. Cap-dependent translation of the FMR 1 mRNA, a process requiring ribosomal scanning through the 5 ' leader, is likely impeded by the extensive secondary structure generated by the high guanosine/cytosine nucleotide content including the CGG triplet nucleotide repeats in the 5 ' leader. An alternative mechanism to initiate translation – internal initiation often utilizes secondary structure to recruit the translational machinery. Consequently, studies were undertaken to confirm and extend a previous observation that the FMR 1 5 ' leader contains an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Results Cellular transfection of a dicistronic DNA construct containing the FMR 1 5 ' leader inserted into the intercistronic region yielded significant translation of the second cistron, but the FMR 1 5 ' leader was also found to contain a cryptic promoter possibly confounding interpretation of these results. However, transfection of dicistronic and <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> ex vivo or in vitro confirmed that the FMR 1 5 ' leader contains an IRES. Moreover, inhibiting cap-dependent translation ex vivo did not affect the expression level of endogenous FMRP indicating a role for IRES-dependent translation of FMR 1 mRNA. Analysis of the FMR 1 5 ' leader revealed that the CGG repeats and the 5 ' end of the leader were vital for internal initiation. Functionally, exposure to potassium chloride or intracellular acidification and addition of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid as mimics of neural activity and double stranded RNA, respectively, differentially affected FMR 1 IRES activity. Conclusion Our results indicate that multiple stimuli influence IRES-dependent translation of the FMR 1 mRNA and suggest a functional role for the CGG nucleotide repeats. </p...|$|E

R. Shaffer, E. A. Brown, and S. M. Lemon, J. Virol. 68 : 5568 - 5578, 1994). To characterize this replication defect, the ts mutant delta 131 - 144 was grown under one-step conditions at the nonpermissive temperature (37 degrees C). A shift to the permissive temperature (31 degrees C) for the first 18 h of the viral replication cycle did not enhance virus yields, indicating that temperature sensitivity is not due to a defect in viral entry or uncoating. Similarly, absence of increased yield with a late shift to 31 degrees C between 54 and 72 h suggested that the ts defect does not involve viral assembly. Although <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> transcripts containing the delta 99 - 144 deletion directed translation 22 to 58 % less efficiently than the standard 5 'NTR in transfected BS-C- 1 cells, this difference was present at both 31 and 37 degrees C. In addition, there were no temperature-dependent differences in the abilities of bicistronic transcripts containing either ts or non-ts 5 'NTR sequences within the intercistronic space to direct translation of a downstream reporter gene. Thus, ts mutations do not confer a demonstrable temperature-related defect in cap-independent translation. In contrast, an RNase protection assay showed that synthesis of viral plus-strand RNA was markedly delayed in BS-C- 1 cells infected with ts virus at 37 degrees C. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence surrounding the deletion in a non-ts revertant derived from delta 116 - 144 virus revealed that a single U-to-G transversion at nt 114 (CUUUU [...] >CUUGU) had restored the sequence normally present between nt 140 and 144. These results indicate that ts mutants of HAV with deletions extending downstream from the pY 1 domain to nt 140 to 144 are defective in RNA synthesis and that the single-stranded RNA segment containing nt 140 to 144 plays {{a critical role in}} replication of HAV RNA...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus NS 5 A is a multi-functional {{viral protein}} {{essential}} for viral replication and assembly, although the exact role the protein {{plays in the}} viral lifecycle remains unclear. A vast array of functions {{have been attributed to}} NS 5 A in recent years, despite the lack of enzymatic activity. NS 5 A has been found to interact with over 130 host proteins including many which are central to cellular signaling pathways. NS 5 A is composed of three domains separated by regions of low complexity. All three domains perform important functions in the viral lifecycle. Domains I and II are essential for viral replication whereas domain III is required for viral assembly. However, the role that NS 5 A and its individual domains may play in modulating viral translation remains controversial. Previous studies have utilized translation reporter systems that do not accurately reflect the role of the viral 3 ´-UTR in modulating viral translation. We and others have shown that NS 5 A binds to the poly-U/UC region of the 3 ´-UTR. In addition to serving as the initiation site for negative strand synthesis the 3 ´-UTR functions to significantly enhance viral translation. The mechanism of translation enhancement remains unclear but may involve long range RNA-RNA interaction with the IRES, the binding of cellular proteins which stimulate translation and/or the recycling of ribosomes. Therefore, the protein-RNA interaction between NS 5 A and the poly-U/UC region has the potential to modulate viral translation. Therefore we set out to determine the role of NS 5 A and its individual domains in modulating viral translation {{and the role of the}} NS 5 A-poly-U/UC region interaction in this modulation. Utilizing <b>monocistronic</b> <b>RNA</b> reporters which contain the viral 5 ´- and 3 ´-UTRs and an internal Renilla luciferase reporter gene, we determined that NS 5 A specifically down-regulates viral translation in a dose-dependent manner through a mechanism dependent upon the presence of the poly-U/UC region in the viral 3 ´-UTR. Furthermore, we have re-tested the effect using full-length HCV genomic RNA reporters. These results suggest that NS 5 A is able to interfere with the stimulation of viral translation exerted by the 3 ´-UTR. This down-regulatory function of NS 5 A may function in mediating a switch from translation to replication, a step required in the lifecycle of a positive sensed RNA virus. Having established a role for NS 5 A in modulating viral translation, we then aimed to determine which region of NS 5 A was responsible for this effect. We found that each of NS 5 A domains was capable of this modulatory effect on viral translation independently. Although surprising, this finding is not entirely unexpected as each domain has been shown to retain the ability to bind to the poly-U/UC region. Within NS 5 A domain I we identified a 61 aa. region sufficient for translation down-regulation. Furthermore, we have identified a number of positively charged residues within this region involved in the modulation of viral translation, in particular arginine 112 (R 112). This residue has previously been found to be at the domain I dimer contact interface and to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with glutamic acid 148 (E 148). We found that mutations R 112 A and E 148 A individually negate the ability of domain I to modulate viral translation and these mutations impede the formation of domain I dimers. Additionally, the R 112 A mutation appears to affect the ability of domain I to interact with the poly-U/UC region of the viral 3 ´-UTR alluding to the possible mechanism of translation modulation. Finally this mutation was lethal in an HCV subgenomic replication, confirming the link between NS 5 A dimerization, RNA binding and viral replication. These results collectively point to a crucial role for the NS 5 A arginine 112 residue in the modulation of HCV lifecycle by NS 5 A. Within NS 5 A domain II, we identified a 47 aa. region sufficient for translation modulation. Through the mutation of positively charged amino acids within this region, we found that lysine 312 (K 312) was essential for this effect. The ability of this domain to modulate viral translation was completely lost when K 312 was mutated within a full domain II protein fragment. The mechanism behind this modulation remains unclear but the 47 aa. region identified has been previously found to contain a region proposed to make contact with poly-U RNA and the K 312 residue was suspected to interact directly with such RNA. Furthermore, this region interacts with the host protein cyclophilin A, an interaction that enhances the RNA binding ability of domain II. These findings strongly suggest that domain II modulates viral translation by binding within the poly-U/UC region. While investigating the modulation of viral translation by NS 5 A domain III we determined that the C-terminal 31 aa. are sufficient for the effect of this domain on viral translation. Through alanine scanning mutagenesis we identified glutamic acid 446 (E 446) as playing a key role in the modulatory function of this region. Within a domain III protein fragment mutation of this E 446 residue abolishes the modulatory function of this domain towards HCV translation. The mechanism behind this modulation and the role of E 446 in this effect remains to be determined. These findings suggest that in addition to being essential for viral replication and assembly, NS 5 A has an important role in modulating viral translation through a mechanism requiring the poly-U/UC region of the viral 3 ´-UTR. Furthermore, each domain of NS 5 A appears to contribute to this effect. These results support the description of NS 5 A as a multi-functional protein and the further characterization of its functions may aid in the development of novel antivirals targeting the numerous functions of this complex, and at times puzzling, viral protein...|$|E

Results suggest the possible molecular basis of the inhibitory activity of PA extract against HCV which would help in optimization and subsequent development of specific antiviral agent using P. amarus as potent natural source.

40|$|Iodination of reovirus, cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV), {{and wound}} tumor virus (WTV), and their {{respective}} subviral forms, followed by analysis of the labeled polypeptides by using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, {{has been used to}} compare the protein contents of these three diplornaviruses. This approach, when combined with electron microscopy and buoyant density determinations, appears capable of localizing individual polypeptides in some of the viral and subviral forms. CPV (p = 1. 435 g/cm 3) seems to resemble reovirus cores (p = 1. 440 g/cm 3) in both ultrastructure and polypeptide composition. CPV is composed of five polypeptides with molecular weights of about 151, 000, 142, 000, 130, 000, 67, 000, and 33, 000. The polyhedral matrix, which in nature encapsulates the virions, is, in turn, composed mainly of two polypeptide species with molecular weights of about 30, 000 and 20, 000, and several minor proteins. The proteins of WTV consist mainly of four species of polypeptide with molecular weights of about 156, 000, 122, 000, 63, 000, and 44, 000, and several minor components. These molecular weight determinations are consistent with the hypothesis that, as has been suggested for reovirus, the viral proteins of CPV and WTV seem to be coded for by <b>monocistronic</b> mes senger <b>RNA</b> molecules transcribed from distinct segments of the double-stranded RNA viral genomes...|$|R
