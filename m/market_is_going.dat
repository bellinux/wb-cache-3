In the Pachino area the export of musts and blending wines to northern Italy and France markets has gained importance throughout the years.

The town is part of the City of Wine.The [...] "Porto Grande," [...] a maritime infrastructure, was built (circa 1850) in Fossa (a Marzamemi hamlet) for the marketing of wine. Wine-ducts linked the Rubino Winery directly with tankers. The tankers filled with wine would depart to the port of Marseilles. After the construction of Pachino rail station (circa 1935) until the late 1960s wine and other goods were transported by rail.In the 1970s Pachino's viticulture underwent through a serious crisis, which led to the abandonment and weeding of many vineyards, which were replaced by greenhouses of fruit and vegetables that now constitute Pachino's main production. This market generates a very high turnover and employs almost 4000 people just in the Pachino area. But today, even the fruit and vegetable <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> through a difficult period, due to market disruptions and infrastructure problems. Pachino is experincing a revival of the vineyards, however, now dedicated to quality productions such as Nero d'Avola and other DOC wines.The production of red Tuna mullet is also notorious, which is manufactured by local Marzamemi's artisans, according to an old Arab tradition. The crafted conservation of fruit and vegetables and locally caught fish is also well developed which holds the secrets of an ancient culinary tradition, and is now much sought after.|$|E
40|$|Stock options {{have been}} criticized as fair weather friends: good at {{motivating}} and retaining executives when the <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> up, but of little incentive value when the <b>market</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> down. The veracity of this criticism is of particular importance to executives at information technology (IT) companies, where options are used aggressively and where stock declines in 2000 were extreme. In this study, we compare the performance-effectiveness of IT CEOs ’ stock and option holdings in the up market of 1993 through 1999 with their performance-effectiveness in the down market of 2000. We find that stock options that were exercisable had stronger positive performance effects during 2000 than in previous years but that options that were unexercisable (not vested) had much weaker performance effects in 2000 than in previous years. For non-IT CEOs, we also observe stronger performance effects for exercisable options in 2000 {{but we do not}} observe th...|$|E
