40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the market}} transformation in heritage tourism destinations when excessive tourism demand determines {{the emergence of}} a class of excursionists among visitors. Building on the approach of Keane (1997) and Shapiro (1983), some important dimensions of sustainable tourism development are highlighted. The lesser capacity of excursionists to learn the true quality of the tourist goods provides an opportunity for producers to cut back on quality. To serve high quality goods and keep up the reputation of the destination, producers need to gain a mark-up on price that might not be sustained in a competitive market. Hence the decline in ``high-paying'' demand segments, increasingly substituted by visitors with lesser quality expectations, has significant consequences on the use and preservation of the heritage. The proposed formulation allows the identification of appropriate policy instruments to reverse this process.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the conflicting sentiments generated by Macau’s recent developments {{and how these}} dynamics have helped galvanize particular visions amongst Macau’s residents holding different possessive relationships to the city. More specifically, it explores these processes through the simultaneous construction of two incongruent landscapes: a fantasyland of gaming and leisure propelled by the liberalization of the casino industry, and a ‘historic city of culture’ exemplified by Macau’s newly acquired UNESCO World Heritage City status. Building on Debord’s conception of the dialectic of the spectacle, this paper illustrates how the growing support for heritage conservation in Macau has been propelled by a shared anxiety over the phenomenal changes brought by an expanding casino industry and concomitant erosion of Macau’s cultural identity. Through extensive interviews with local architects, conservation experts and activists, I elucidate how the designation of Macau as a World Heritage City has helped consolidate particular sets of <b>moral</b> claims around <b>heritage</b> and culture as well as introduced new commodifications of the environment that cannot be easily delinked from other spaces of the ‘spectacle city. ’postprin...|$|R

But what happens when such a conflict of cultural traditions is manifested within the legal system of one single nation? May conduct which is normal and acceptable in one culture be justified or excused when it violates the criminal code of the nation in which it is performed?

40|$|Stanisław Głąbiński (1862 – 1941) {{professor}} at the Lvov University, {{the author of a}} two volume work entitled „National economics” is a representative of the historical-national trend in Polish economics. The subject matter of his concept of national economics is the national economy which is a higher rank entity, encompassing all economic entities in the country that are related materially and spiritually. Bonds that link individuals into a higher rank entity, i. e. a nation, are reflected in the term ‘social resources’. Głąbiński understands them as <b>moral</b> and material <b>heritage</b> of past generations that influences attitudes of the contemporary generation. He divides them into moral and material resources, and especially emphasizes the importance of the former ones. In the concept of moral resources, Głąbiński included his claims concerning the whole socio-ethical conditions of economic processes. He appreciated the influence exerted by the changes in the ethical viewpoint of the society on the economic activity {{as well as on the}} shaping of the sense of duty towards the whole society. Special emphasis placed in Głąbiński’s economic theory on the role of ethical motives undoubtedly springs from the influence exerted by the German historical school and, in particular, by Bruno Hildebrand. It also is a result of the effect of Polish economic thought including in particular the views of Fryderyk Skarbek and Józef Supiński. According to Głąbiński, the most important constituent element of material resources was finance, understood by him as stocks of economic goods...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in violence in South African schools, as elsewhere, {{has been associated}} with a general ‘decline in moral values’. There have been three different responses that emphasise the decline in religious teaching at schools, the loss of traditional values like ubuntu, communalism and the like; and humankind’s increasing alienation from nature. In other words, in terms of teaching and learning initiatives, we should turn to religion, community and the common good and nature (the natural environment and nonhuman animals) in order to feel the force of morality and, consequently, to counteract human violence and cruelty. After critically examining these responses, the present article focusses on the third as the most promising, albeit one that is in need of re-conceptualisation. We need to teach not as if nature mattered but that it matters. Concepts and principles like justice, equality and rights have worked in the past. They have been useful in governing and regulating relations between human individuals. Indeed, it is the recognition of and respect for rights that best exemplifies the transculturality of values. Taking these concepts and principles seriously requires extending and employing them beyond the human realm. This may well be the most reliable way of halting the rapid deterioration of the world. Humane education, insofar as it incorporates guidance in moral reasoning and critical thinking – over and above nurture of appropriate feelings in individuals – and engages both rationality and individual responsibility, consists of transmission as well as in transcendence of our <b>moral</b> and cultural <b>heritage.</b> ‘Decline in <b>moral</b> values’, then, is counteracted by an approach that combines caring with respect for rights, in order to contribute towards erasing what has been called ‘the ultimate evil’, namely human violence and abuse. Environmental education and humane education, so re-conceived, arguably have longterm benefits for both humans and nonhuman...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{contribute}} to the discussion of urban futures in Asia by examining heritage conservation as a specific kind of future-oriented urban intervention through which different social actors contest to reshape the forms of cities. More specifically, it explores these dynamics in Macau and Hong Kong, two postcolonial city-states that have seen a rapid rise of social activism centering on heritage protection in recent years. While many commentators have already explained that these phenomena are effects of historical ruptures that drive citizens to search for a postcolonial identity, less {{attention has been paid to}} how particular <b>moral</b> claims about <b>heritage</b> have been mobilised in ongoing conservation campaigns. I argue that these activities can be interpreted as what Aihwa Ong called “worlding practices,” which refer to the ways in which different social actors seek to reinvent the urban future by drawing on local and global discourses. The concept of worlding is useful because it directs attention not only to the roles of multiple constituencies in urban remaking, but also to the divergent motivations and affect of belonging that were shaped by specific historical experiences. The challenge is to elucidate how existing discourses about the city and its people are being reworked in conservation projects as they interact with the postcolonial politics of identities and ongoing urban development. This chapter, which belongs to a more extensive study of conservation practices in East Asia, posits three main arguments. The first is that despite concerted calls to protect local heritage and cultures in face of accelerating globalisation, people with different social backgrounds do not support heritage campaigns for the same reason. These are reflected in the many conversations I had with local residents in Hong Kong and Macau that are keen to underscore their possessive relationship to the city against those of others. Second, a closer examination of the narratives in conservation projects suggests that the presumed divide between “official” and “unofficial heritage” is far from clear, as not only do government officials and heritage activists tend to deploy similar rationalities in their causes, some also tend to maintain a close relationship with each other. This is especially apparent in Macau, where many activist organisations rely on government sponsorship under a colonial-era patronage governing system. Third, the comparison of Macau and Hong Kong shows that their very different forms of “colonial heritage” have continued to serve as key references for the construction of cultural imaginaries of the past. At the same time, the growing desire for building a more open and democratic society amidst economic and political integration with China has helped galvanised alternate visions of the future that are increasingly shared by citizenries in both territories...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{advent of}} moral {{pluralism}} in the post-modern age {{leads to a}} set of issues about how pluralistic societies can function. The questions of biomedi-cal ethics frequently highlight the larger issues of moral pluralism and social cooperation. Reflection on these issues has focused on the decision making roles of the health care professionals, the patient, and the patient's family. One species of actor that has been neglected has been those institutions which are part of the public, secular realm and which have a particular <b>moral</b> <b>heritage.</b> Key Words: approval, compromise, condemnation, integrity, toleration Health care is set in a terrain which is public and morally pluralis-tic. The terrain is often difficult to negotiate since there are many competing senses of the moral good. The lack of a coherent, content-full, and shared view of the good has led bioethicists to reflect on issues of pluralism, communal values, individual values, and public order (e. g., Engelhardt, 1986, Chapter 2). The degree of pluralism which exists in accounts of the good or theoretical accounts of the moral life may be described in a variety of ways. One way is to describe contemporary society as one of moral strangers. Another description is to cast contemporary society as moral acquaintances with certain commonalities which exist across communities. However one describes the phenomenon and degree of moral pluralism it is clear that ethical practices in a pluralistic setting will focus on procedural norms which set out the limits of mora...|$|E
40|$|Conscious of its {{spiritual and}} <b>moral</b> <b>heritage</b> the European Union {{is founded on}} the indivisible, {{universal}} values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity’. This remarkable assertion in the Preamble of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU) has received scant regard as the meaning of 'spiritual' is considered unproblematic. There is no interpretive guidance regarding the Preamble and still no convincing attempt at defining ‘spiritual’ in the European context. Discussions about the Union’s ‘spiritual dimension’ invariably insinuate references to its religious roots and historical relationship with Christianity. Similarly, 'spiritual' and 'spirituality', used interchangeably, are emerging as umbrella terms for, and alternatives to, 'religion'. The ‘spiritual’ terminology favoured in European political discourse is a more generic, neutral and inclusive expression suited to the secular sensitivities of a pluralist society. However, over time spirituality has emancipated itself from its religious origins to plant new roots in various academic and professional disciplines. A multi-faceted non-theistic ‘new spirituality’ has since emerged but has yet to migrate {{to the field of}} European studies. The founding fathers of the European Union had the vision of post-war Europe as a united political and spiritual entity. In light of today’s global crisis, the Union must radically redefine itself as more than a regeneration project for continued and sustainable integration. Given the teleological tradition of the European Court of Justice, the Charter Preamble could impact on EU law interpretation and development, spelling the advance of a spiritual age for European integration. This calls for a more informed conceptualisation of this ‘spiritual heritage’...|$|E
40|$|In their {{responses}} to {{the works of the}} American psychologist and philosopher William James (1842 - 1910), American Catholic thinkers have developed at least five different approaches: Neo-Scholastic, Neo-Traditionist, Radical, Liberal, and Academic. Investigation of these responses may suggest some answers to the general question, In what ways have Catholic intellectuals related to American culture and society during the twentieth century? This dissertation is a study of the Neo-Scholastic and Neo-Traditionist responses. It begins with an account of the American Catholic intellectual scene in 1900 and an exposition of James 2 ̆ 7 s religious philosophy. Next, the Neo-Scholastic and the Neo-Traditionist responses are analyzed separately; the development of their major themes is traced; their distinctive characteristics are defined; and their historical and ideological relationships are described. Finally some implications of the study are suggested regarding the historiography of American Catholicism and the conduct of systematic theology by American Catholics. Catholic writers have regularly responded to James 2 ̆ 7 s religious philosophy {{from the beginning of the}} century to the present. The earliest responses came from those who associated themselves with Neo-Scholastic (usually Neo-Thomist) philosophy and theology; and this variety was dominant from 1900 to 1960. It developed through four stages: (1) Naive, dominant before 1907, which evaluated James by his usefulness to Catholics; (2) Religious, typical until 1920, which condemned James for his Protestantism, Modernism, immoral teaching, and Americanism; (3) Rational, dominant from 1910 to 1960, which judged James 2 ̆ 7 s logic, epistemology, and metaphysics to be radically incompatible with its own; and (4) Reflective, dominant among Neo-Scholastics since the 19602 ̆ 7 s, which tolerated James 2 ̆ 7 s radical differences and encouraged more extensive inquiry and dialog. A major alternative to Neo-Scholasticism was embodied in the Neo-Traditionism formulated by Robert Channon Pollock (1901 - 1978) of Fordham University beginning in the 19402 ̆ 7 s. Relying on Augustinian themes, he detected radical sympathies and compatibilities between James 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy and the intellectual and <b>moral</b> <b>heritage</b> of the Catholic tradition. For the historiography of American Catholic intellectual life, a chronology of its development and a taxonomy of its varieties are suggested. For American Catholic theology, this dissertation suggests greater emphasis on the value and practice of pluralism; greater commitment to professional standards in the practice of scholarship, philosophy, and theology; and greater involvement with the main currents of American intellectual life [...] including the religious philosophy of William James...|$|E
