50|$|The Guides {{predicted}} in her 1999 book The World To Come that the walk-in president {{would not come}} until 2008 at the earliest, and therefore the Shift would be delayed until 2010-2012 at least. The potential catastrophe of the shift was also reduced by human free will. Except for Florida and the coast of California, the Guides reported, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> will survive, a direct contradiction of Montgomery's earlier forecast of significant global destruction in the coming event.|$|E
50|$|On 30 August 2005, many gas {{stations}} raised prices by {{a considerable amount}} putting <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> over $3.00/gallon, {{as shown in the}} movie. http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/31/news/gas_prices/index.htm?cnn=yes On 1 September 2005, {{gas stations}} throughout the country began to run out of fuel due to worries of mass shortages. Some stations in Atlanta, Georgia sold gas at nearly $6/gallon. Most of this was due to panic buying, as noted in the film, rather than physical shortage. Subsequently, as the extent of the damage became clearer, prices eased.|$|E

50|$|Saginaw {{became the}} {{destination}} {{for a great}} number of workers migrating from areas of the United States that were greatly devastated by the Great Depression, especially from the south. This migration continued throughout the war years and in the economic boom, which followed. Saginaw, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> benefited from the dramatic economic prosperity following the war. General Motors expanded its presence in Saginaw, and other manufacturers increased production as well. This caused the population of the City to swell to its height of approximately 100,000 during the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|After the {{surrender}} of Japan on September 2, 1945, America occupied the home islands of Japan. As MacArthur took residence in Tokyo, he decided on a strategy of continuity for the Japanese people. Even though many Japanese and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> wanted the Emperor put on trial (70% of Americans wanted him hanged) MacArthur thought that keeping the Emperor in his position would offer a symbol for the Japanese people to rally around. If the Japanese people could rally around Hirohito and he could be controlled by the Americans, then fewer troops {{would be required to}} keep the peace in Japan.|$|E
50|$|In time, Kilmer would {{influence}} <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> {{with his}} new products. By the late 19th century, railroads had taken {{most of the nation}} by storm. Americans were traveling more and farther than ever. To address the medical needs of travelers, Kilmer decided to introduce first-aid kits. The Red Cross symbol became as well known as the bald eagle. Soon, people believed that the first-aid kits were as important to their daily lives as railroads, light bulbs, and family. It became an American way of life to grab a first-aid kit when in need of help.|$|E

50|$|Ridership on the Champaign-Urbana City Lines was high, {{reaching}} 1,000,000 passengers {{served in}} 1958. Like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> however, buses in Champaign-Urbana became less {{popular with the}} advent of affordable automobiles. On November 17, 1970, P.E. Cherry, the manager of Champaign-Urbana City Lines, published an article in the Courier stating that declining ridership, aging buses, and a rising deficit would force the line to close. The Illinois Commerce Commission conducted a hearing on the petition to close the city lines and suggested that rather than close the lines, a referendum should be drafted to create a mass transit district.|$|E
50|$|America Sings {{was born}} out of the company's desire to {{celebrate}} America's Bicentennial. It didn't quite fit the theme of the land, but its relevance to that period in America made it appropriate. However, once the Bicentennial was over, the attraction became more misplaced, in a land dedicated to all things futuristic. Disney's imagineering team began dreaming up new ideas for Tomorrowland, that included a new show in the carousel theater more fitting for the land of the future. Separately, in 1984, the log flume attraction Splash Mountain idea was born. Knowing America Sings was eventually to close for a more appropriately themed show, the idea developed to give <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> Sings' audio animatronic figures a new home in Splash Mountain.|$|E
5000|$|Thanks to the {{increased}} pollution, drastic climate change and damage to mid-western water supplies would cause <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> to become desert ("the Des") from the 70s onwards. Violent dystopian gangcults - the Maniax, the Psychopomps, and the Confederate Air Force being central to the books - would rise to prominence. In 1985, to control the increasing violence, the Enderby Amendment opened up law enforcement to private groups and individuals: the Sanctioned Ops, the most famous being Turner-Harvest-Ramirez Agency and their star agent Rachel [...] "Redd" [...] Harvest. President Heston would also bring in the Moral Re-Armament Drive and recreate the United States Road Cavalry, a heavily armed Mad Max-style group garbed like the original Cavalry, to patrol the roadways and interstates.|$|E

50|$|The ideals {{for ending}} the war and {{violence}} are completely different between Dekoven, and Tshembe vs. Charlie. We see this in the revolution and the conversations between Dekoven and Charlie. Dekoven explains to Charlie that the issue and the hatred of the Black man {{is not that they}} are lazy like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> thinks, but that they refuse to work for them and live for the same things they do. As Charlie condemns the rampant killings that the rebels are resorting to Tshembe defends it as the only way for the world to pay attention, the only reason Charlie himself is there right now. Charlie represents the heart of a white man that cares but the ignorance of a culture that can’t understand the systemic unchanging oppression.|$|E

50|$|This {{would soon}} change. Benjamin Franklin already had {{noted in his}} will the high {{elevation}} and quality of Wissahickon water, proposing that in some future day the stream be dammed to supply a safe and pure water source for Philadelphia’s water supply, and even allocating funds for this purpose. This did not happen, but the quest for pure water affected the Wissahickon’s subsequent history. Seeking to prevent the stream’s industrial discharges from affecting {{the purity of the}} water of the Schuylkill River, the Fairmount Park Commission took title of much of the land along the Wissahickon in 1869-1870, and continued to expand its holdings in subsequent decades. The mills were razed; the last active mill was demolished in 1884. Several decades later the Schuylkill River itself became seriously polluted by sources in the coal fields far upstream beyond Philadelphia’s control, but the waters of the Wissahickon had been restored and the beauty of the Wissahickon Valley had been preserved. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America</b> became more industrialized, but the Wissahickon valley quietly returned to its original wilderness character.|$|E

Raúl Castillo Despite having a bicultural upbringing, Castillo stated that he always felt American growing up, and that he and his siblings were considered [...] "gringos" [...] when they visited Mexico. He identifies as Mexican-American. Castillo describes his childhood as sheltered from racism and racial dynamics in the US due to McAllen's high Hispanic and Latino population. When Castillo moved to Boston to study acting, he recounts that he was often viewed by others as being foreign. Regardless, Castillo described his experiences in the diversity of Boston to be a positive experience in expanding his horizons.|$|E
50|$|By 1919, Lewis {{was leading}} his own band, {{and had a}} {{recording}} contract with Columbia Records, which marketed him as their answer to the Original Dixieland Jass Band who recorded for Victor records. For a time (as they did with Paul Whiteman) Columbia gave him a special record label featuring his picture. At {{the start of the}} 1920s, he was considered by many people without previous knowledge of jazz (that is to say, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>America)</b> {{to be one of the}} leading lights of hot jazz. Lewis's clarinet playing barely evolved beyond his style of 1919 which in later years would sound increasingly corny, but Lewis certainly knew what good clarinet playing sounded like, for he hired musicians like Benny Goodman, Jimmy Dorsey, Frank Teschemacher,and Don Murray to play clarinet in his band. Lewis actually could play normally well without missed notes, as exemplified by his earliest records. For years, his band also included jazz greats Muggsy Spanier on trumpet and George Brunies on trombone. Ted Lewis' band was second only to the Paul Whiteman band in popularity during the 1920s, and arguably played more real jazz with less pretension than Whiteman, especially in his recordings of the late 1920s.|$|E
