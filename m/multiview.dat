50|$|The terms orthographic {{projection}} and orthogonal projection are sometimes reserved specifically for <b>multiviews.</b> However, orthographic and orthogonal more correctly {{refer to the}} right angle formed between the projection rays and the projection plane, versus the angle formed between {{the subject of the}} drawing and the projection plane. Thus, {{orthographic projection}}s include axonometric or auxiliary views in addition to <b>multiviews.</b>|$|R
40|$|To exploit {{theoretical}} {{advances in}} elastic wave inverse scattering, an automated <b>multiviewing</b> ultrasonic transducer system and associated signal processing algorithms {{have recently been}} developed for the characterization of flaws in solids. The reliability of the model-based reconstruction method depends {{on the extent of}} the flaw surface illuminated by the interrogating ultrasonic field within a finite viewing aperture and is therefore sensitive to the orientation of the flaw. In this paper, the reconstruction of arbitrarily oriented flaws using the <b>multiviewing</b> system is addressed. The effects of aperture size on the reconstruction reliability is investigated by computer simulation and experimental results are presented for the reconstruction of tilted oblate and prolate spheroid-like flaws. The <b>multiviewing</b> capability of the system is used to predetermine a spatial data acquisition pattern which improves the reconstruction reliability by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and the surface area of the flaw illuminated by the <b>multiviewing</b> transducer...|$|R

40|$|A <b>Multiviews</b> Component is an {{extension}} of a UML 2. 0 component [El Asri (2005 a) ], that offers a richer behavior by adopting the concept of views. The problem of its representation has been tackled by VUML [Nassar (2004) ] [El Asri (2005 b) ], which is a UML extension (UML profile). In this paper, we propose an approach to implement <b>Multiviews</b> Components under the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) initiative [Soley (2000) ]. This process follows two sequential steps: The first step is a PIM-to-PIM transformation. It transforms and converts a <b>Multiviews</b> Component (which is a Platform Independent Model) into a conventional UML component by applying a proprietary design pattern [Hain (2006) ] [Hain (2007) ]. The second step transforms the resulting PIM into a PSM (Platform Specific Model) that targets Java / EJB platform. Our approach offers two major advantages. The first advantage reduces the complexity related to VUML <b>Multiviews</b> Component handling by making it UML based. The second step implements these components into a specific development platform, which can be taken as an example for other target platforms...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{similarities}} and spatial adjacencies between {{various kinds of}} objects, shadow, and occluded areas behind high-rise objects {{as well as the}} complex relationships between various object types lead to the difficulties and ambiguities in object recognition in urban areas. Using a knowledge base containing the contextual information together with the <b>multiviews</b> imagery may improve the object recognition results in such a situation. The proposed object recognition strategy in this paper has two main stages: single view and <b>multiviews</b> processes. In the single view process, defining regionâ€™s properties for each of the segmented regions, the object-based image analysis (OBIA) is performed independently on the individual views. In the second stage, the classified objects of all views are fused together through a decision-level fusion based on the scene contextual information in order to refine the classification results. Sensory information, analyzing visibility maps, height, and the structural characteristics of the <b>multiviews</b> classified objects define the scene contextual information. Evaluation of the capabilities of the proposed context aware object recognition methodology is performed on two datasets: 1) multiangular Worldview- 2 satellite images over Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and 2) <b>multiviews</b> digital modular camera (DMC) aerial images over a complex urban area in Germany. The obtained results represent that using the contextual information together with a decision-level fusion of <b>multiviews,</b> the object recognition difficulties and ambiguities are decreased and the overall accuracy and the kappa are gradually improved for both of theWorldView- 2 and the DMC datasets...|$|R

40|$|A <b>multiviewing</b> transducer, {{described}} in the companion paper in this volume (1) has been designed and developed to exploit advances in theoretical inverse elastic wave scattering in the long and intermediate wavelength regime. The <b>multiviewing</b> transducer concept is shown in Fig. 1. In addition, {{and as part of}} a broader effort to develop a decision tree for general flaw characterization shown in Fig. 2, a first generation set of post-processing data procedures has been developed and implemented for use with the multiprobe instrumentation. These procedures provide a 3 -D reconstruction and characterization of volumetric flaws (size, shape, orientation and acoustic impedance estimates) and are shown by solid boxes in Fig. 2...|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} <b>multiviewing</b> {{ultrasonic transducer}} and a first generation signal processing program {{have been developed}} for the purpose of detecting and characterizing flaws in materials. The <b>multiviewing</b> transducer has been designed and developed to exploit advances in theoretical inverse elastic wave scattering in the long and intermediate wavelength regime made in recent years. The signal processing algorithm has been assembled as a first step {{in the development of a}} decision-tree algorithm for flaw characterization. First results that have been obtained in a completely automatic mode are given in this paper. It is concluded that this new long and intermediate wavelength, model-based reconstruction is feasible and potentially very useful in quantitative NDE applications on real systems...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} {{a project}} to develop an {{ultrasonic}} <b>multiviewing</b> transducer which is capable of providing sufficient information for flaw reconstruction, results have been obtained that address certain phases of the required signal processing routine. It is well known that individual ultrasonic transducers show a considerable variation in signal responses. Inasmuch as the <b>multiviewing</b> transducer uses a sparse array of individual transducers arranged in a particular geometry, it becomes important that signal processing routines be developed and applied which overcome these variabilities. There are, of course, several possible sources of variability in transducer performance. These include those of measurement (diffraction, attenuation and effects associated with imperfect deconvolution processes), and those due to fabrication (transducer design, materials, reproducibility of fabrication techniques, etc.). The results presented in this paper address only the former of these two. In particular, they represent a limited experimental assessment of the adequacy of specific data processing procedures for three different transducers and three different samples utilizing Weiner filter concepts and diffraction and attenuation corrections. Use is made of theoretical curves for scattering amplitude as an absolute standard of comparison and therefore as the criterion of adequacy...|$|R
50|$|The term orthographic is {{sometimes}} reserved specifically for depictions of objects where the principal axes or planes {{of the object}} are parallel with the projection plane (or the paper on which the orthographic or parallel projection is drawn). However, the term <b>multiview</b> projection is also used. In <b>multiview</b> projections, up to six pictures of an object are produced, with each projection plane perpendicular {{to one of the}} coordinate axes. Sub-types of <b>multiview</b> orthographic projections include plans, elevations and sections.|$|E
50|$|The {{next major}} feature {{added to the}} {{standard}} was <b>Multiview</b> Video Coding (MVC). Specified in Annex H of H.264/AVC, MVC enables the construction of bitstreams that represent more than one view of a video scene. An important example of this functionality is stereoscopic 3D video coding. Two profiles were developed in the MVC work: <b>Multiview</b> High Profile supports an arbitrary number of views, and Stereo High Profile is designed specifically for two-view stereoscopic video. The <b>Multiview</b> Video Coding extensions were completed in November 2009.|$|E

By contrast, CASIA dataset B [43] is widely used because it includes <b>multiviews,</b> different clothing, and carrying status. CASIA dataset C [49] consists of the largest number of subjects among the CASIA databases, and the subjects were captured in an outdoor night scenario, with walking speed and carriage variations. The CASIA databases, however, cannot be used to conduct experiments on age estimation {{because of the lack of}} age information.|$|R

This is particularly true in the case of flaw sizing algorithms in which it has been demonstrated that a need exists for transducers with specified bandwidth characteristics. As a {{part of an effort to}} develop a composite, <b>multiviewing</b> ultrasonic transducer for flaw characterization, a computational tool has been developed which provides a convenient way to select driver pulse shapes and transducer characteristics which optimize this property. The purpose of this paper is to discuss this computational tool...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust object modeling system that generates an object model from <b>multiviewing</b> range data. The {{purpose of the}} system is to obtain an exact object model, overcoming a noise problem in rage data. Our system computes object existence in voxel space by integrating observations from multi-viewpoints. The noise in range data is excluded by this integration process. Then, a triangular mesh is efficiently obtained by using adjacent relationships between voxels. Finally, a fine object model is acquired by associating brightness values in color image with the vertex on the mesh. Experiments are performed for plural real objects (dolls and a cup) and effectiveness {{of the system is}} shown...|$|R

It typically plays a key role as a bridge between requirements and code. Practitioners have come to realize that having a good architectural design is a critical success factor for complex system development. To improve design at architectural level, we have proposed a description model based on the view notion. Through this model, it is possible to describe both components and connectors according to several views. In this paper, we deal with the code generation from architectural specification obtained via our <b>multiviews</b> description model. ...|$|R

Real-time panorama is conducive to timely treat traffic accidents and to greatly improve traffic capacity. This paper designs a 3 D road scene monitoring framework based on real-time panorama. The system is the combination of large scale panorama, satellite map textures, and 3 D scene model, in which users can ramble freely. This paper has the following contributions. Firstly, land-points were extracted followed by motion detection, then comotion algorithm was applied to land-points from adjacent cameras, and homography matrix was constructed. Secondly, reference camera was chosen and transformed to overhead viewpoint; subsequently <b>multiviews</b> were morphed to the same viewpoint and stitched to panorama. Finally, the registration based on high-precision GPS information between 2 D road panorama and 3 D scene model was also proposed.

40|$|In manufacturing, {{the ability}} to detect and {{characterize}} failure-initiating flaws {{is important in the}} assurance of the structural integrity of materials and components. One major technique in the detection and characterization of such flaws is ultrasonics. In recent years, significant advances have been made in inverse ultrasonic scattering in the region where the ultrasonic wavelength is of the same order as the 2 Ì† 2 radius 2 Ì† 2 of the flaw. Such work is based on physical models that describe the interaction between an elastic wave and the flaw for both long and intermediate wavelength inverse scattering. To exploit these theoretical advances in elastic wave inverse scattering, an automated <b>multiviewing</b> ultrasonic transducer system and associated software has been designed and built in order to perform characterization and analysis of volumetric flaws. The flaw is characterized by its size, shape, and orientation within a material. Utilizing inverse ultrasonic scattering theories, signal processing algorithms perform three-dimensional reconstruction by finding an ellipsoid that best fits the inverse scattering data taken from many independent perspectives within a specified aperture...|$|R

We implement a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model to foresee the optimal video encoding and packet scheduling policies to be used at the video source to generate the video frames with the goal of minimizing the overall distortion of the video consumed at the end user side. By means of simulation, we discuss the insights gained into the impact of frame correlation and time-varying wireless channel on the video stream generation and transmission, and the possible benefits from extending the model to more complex video coding and scheduling mechanisms...|$|R
