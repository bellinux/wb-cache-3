40|$|International audienceCutaneous {{malignant}} melanoma {{represents one of}} the most dramatic skin cancers because its incidence is steadily growing in White populations. Of note, its metastatic risk and mortality dramatically increase when the primary neoplasm reaches about one millimeter thick. It is believed that angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis associated with cutaneous melanoma potentially influence the neoplastic progression of the primary tumor and its metastases. In some instances, both the intratumoral and peritumoral microvasculature are correlated to booming of the tumoral growth fraction. In addition, the vascular network serves as a migration path for the intravascular and perivascular neoplastic spread. Hence, the quantification of the microvasculature might help establishing a prognostic factor of evolution. Among the available methods, spectral analysis of immunohistochemical sections highlighting vessels helps defining the microvasculature distribution.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) is {{a significant}} issue in children. Treatment options include allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy. The use of nasal saline douching (NSD) in children has recently gained acceptability. However, there is limited data regarding the acceptability and tolerability of NSD in children with AR. METHODS: A search was conducted using Medline and Embase databases from January 1946 until June 2015 {{on the use of}} NSD in children aged 4 - 12 years with AR. All publications identified that assessed the beneficial effects, acceptability and tolerability were included. RESULTS: 40 studies were analyzed. Data varied considerably in terms of saline solutions used, <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> participant numbers, study design, follow up and outcomes. Factors that appear to influence the acceptability and tolerability of NSD include parental and health professionals' preconceptions, and characteristics of the solution. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal saline douching appears to be effective, being accepted and tolerated in the majority of children (78 - 100 %). NSD has a significant positive impact on {{the quality of life in}} children with allergic rhinitis. When used as an adjunctive treatment having mainly a cleansing property, NSD potentiates the effects and may reduce the dose required of AR medications. Among the principal factors that influence the acceptability and tolerability of NSD are the child's age, delivery system and method, and tonicity. Nasal saline douching provides an accessible, low cost, low morbidity, easy to use treatment in children with allergic rhinitis...|$|R

The treatments proposed, generally a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and / or targeted therapy, are constantly improving, allowing {{a reduction in the}} mortality rate, but they are still causing many side effects, not only early but also late, which leads us to consider the post-cancer period as a chronic condition. Side effects, reviewed in this commentary, may affect physical functions, psychological status, social situation, body composition, well-being and quality of life of the patient. In view of the extent of these areas in which side effects of breast cancer and of its treatments can be found, the supportive care offered at the end of treatment need to be multidisciplinary. Different supportive care interventions may be proposed to the patients such as psychological and behavioral interventions, complementary therapies, diet interventions, physical activity/rehabilitation or also physiotherapy interventions for example, all having shown some beneficial effects in the literature. The benefits of these supportive care interventions are thereby already established and they are described in this article, but others studies will be needed to clearly define indications and most optimal <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> to reduce side effects and improve quality of life of patients.

40|$|A mistura em tanque de herbicidas dessecantes com residuais tem sido utilizada com frequencia pelos agricultores no sistema de plantio direto. Sabe-se, no entanto, que alguns herbicidas residuais têm problemas de retenção na palha quando utilizados isoladamente em préemergência nesse sistema. O objetivo do presente trabalho, foi estudar o comportamento dos herbicidas residuais {{atrazine}} e acetochlor em mistura com dessecantes no manejo em plantio direto. Para tal, foi instalado um experimento em blocos ao acaso com parcelas subdivididas e quatro repetições. Os tratamentos, alocados na parcela, em número de nove, foram constituidos pelas seguintes misturas de herbicidas: 1) acetochlor + glyphosate; 2) acetochlor + glyphosate + 2, 4 D; 3) acetochlor + paraquat; 4) acetochlor + paraquat + 2, 4 D; 5) atrazine + glyphosate; 6) atrazine + glyphosate + 2, 4 D; 7) atrazine + paraquat; 8) atrazine + óleo vegetal; 9) testemunha não tratada. Os tratamentos da sub parcela, em número de dois, foram constituidos pelas modalidades de aplicação dos herbicidas na cobertura vegetal: 1) aplicação com a cobertura "em pé"; 2) aplicação com a cobertura "rolada". A cobertura vegetal de inverno era formada pela consorciação de aveia-preta + ervilhaca comum. Os resultados mostraram que o controle de Brachiaria plantaginea, Euphorbia heterophylla e Bidens pilosa foi melhor efetuado com os tratamentos onde entrou o atrazine. De maneira geral, o controle obtido na modalidade "em pé," foi melhor do que na modalidade "rolada," principalmente nos tratamentos com acetochlor. A análise cromatográfica de resíduos feita em amostras de solo retiradas do experimento antes e após uma chuva de 41 mm ocorrida 24 horas após a aplicação dos tratamentos, mostrou que menos de 6 % do acetochlor aplicado foi detectado no solo, em ambas as modalidades de aplicação. Quanto ao atrazine, no entanto, mais de 78 % do total aplicado foi detectado no solo após a chuva na modalidade "rolada", em qualquer tratamento; neste caso, os maiores valores foram 91 % para atrazine+óleo vegetal e 90 % para atrazine+glyphosate+ 2, 4 D. Na modalidade "em pé'', os maiores valores foram obtidos com atrazine+óleo vegetal (77 %) e com atrazine+glyphosate+ 2, 4 D (70 %). Tank mix involving desiccants plus residual herbicides {{have been}} used by farmers in no- till system. Nevertheless, it has been commented that the residual herbicides can stay retained in the straw when used in pre-emergence in this system. The objective of this trial, was to study the reaction of the residual herbicides atrazine and acetochlor in tank mix with desiccants herbicides for corn crop in no-till system. The experiment was settled in Londrina, State of Paraná, using a randomized complete block design in a split plot arrangement. Nine treatments were located at the main plots: 1) acetochlor + glyphosate; 2) acetochlor + glyphosate + 2, 4 D; 3) acetochlor + paraquat; 4) acetochlor + paraquat + 2, 4 D; 5) atrazine + glyphosate; 6) atrazine + glyphosate + 2, 4 D; 7) atrazine + paraquat; 8) atrazine + vegetal oil; 9) check without herbicides. Two modalities of herbicides application of herbicides were tested in split plots: 1) application on a "non rolled" cover crops; 2) application on a "rolled"cover crops. The winter cover crops were a mixture of plants formed by Avena strigosa Schreb plus Vicia sativa L. The best control of Brachiaria plantaginea, Euphorbia heterophylla and Bidens pilosa was obtained with atrazine treatments. In general terms, the treatments "non rolled" were better than the "rolled" ones for weed control. The chromatografic analysis of the soil sampled from the plots before and after 41 mm of a rainfall that occured 24 h after application of the herbicides, showed that less than 6 % of the acetochlor applied was detected in soil in both <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>application.</b> In respect to atrazine however, more than 78 % of the total applied was detected in soil after the rain in the "rolled" modality in any treatment. In this case, the highest values were obtained with atrazine + vegetal oil (91 %) and atrazine + glyphosate + 2, 4 D (90 %). In the same manner, in "non rolled"modality, the highest values were obtained with atrazine + vegetal oil (77 %) and atrazine + glyphosate + 2, 4 D (70 %) ...|$|E

40|$|The Internet in Canada is an {{assemblage}} of private and public networks. A variety of institutions and networking codes manage these networks. Conflicts exist between these parties despite their interconnection. Tensions heightened when commercial ISPs began managing traffic on their network using sophisticated routing algorithms. Concerned parties demanded legislation based on a network neutrality principle to prevent undue discrimination. While the network neutrality controversy has been addressed as a question of public policy, the controversy also includes a conflict between various codes constituting networks in Canada. The conflict between codes involve two key networking software that manifest incongruous networks. Their algorithms, the logics embedded in code, differentiate {{the different types of}} networking code. The two types of algorithms are Quality of Service and End-to-End. These algorithms treat different <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> Internet communication differently, in part due to their deployment by different institutions.

40|$|The JET Toroidal Field (TF) coils were {{originally}} designed for operation at 3. 4 tesla. In order {{to upgrade the}} field to 4 tesla and thus improve {{the performance of the}} JET machine, new mechanical tests and analysis were carried out on the insulation of TF coil samples. They are aimed at investigating the mechanical properties and the status of the insulation in order to set allowable stresses and force limits. In particular since the shear stress in the insulation is strongly affected by the shear modulus of elasticity G, it is important to measure this parameter. A method for the measurement of G in glass-resin fibres, the V-notched beam method (Iosipescu method), was applied. The particular shape of the rectangular Iosipescu V- notched sample and the particular <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> force <b>application</b> produce pure shear stress for a reliable measurement of the G value and of the shear strength of the insulation. The effect of temperature on these mechanical properties was also investigated. Results show higher average shear strength with lower scatter compared with previous tests on conventional rectangular samples, thus confirming the reliability of the method. Micrographic analysis of the insulation and comparison between the straight and curved regions of the magnet, where the highest stress occurs, confirm the good quality of the impregnation of the coil. Glass-resin content, void content, micros and TG measurements have been performed on different samples and correlation between the different properties of the insulation investigated. Moreover fatigue tests at different temperatures were performed and data analyzed with the cumulative damage technique, which allows for an extrapolation of the fatigue curve with less samples than the standard method.

40|$|Abstract—In {{resource}} provisioning for datacenters, {{an important}} issue is how resources may be allocated to an application such that the service level agreements (SLAs) are met. Resource provisioning is usually guided by intuitive or heuristic expectation of performance and existing user model. Provisioning based on such methodology, however, usually leads to more resources than are actually necessary. While such overprovisioning may guarantee performance, this guarantee may come {{at a very high}} cost. A quantitative performance estimate may guide the provider in making informed decisions about the right level of resources, so that acceptable service performance may be provided in a cost-effective manner. A quantitative estimate <b>of</b> <b>application</b> performance must consider its workload characteristics. Due to the complex workload characteristics of commercial software, estimation of its performance and provisioning to optimize for cost is not straightforward. In this work we looked at breaking the application into isolated modalities (modality is a scenario in which an application is used, for example, instant messaging, and voice calls are two different <b>modalities</b> <b>of</b> a media <b>application)</b> and measuring resource cost per modality as an effective methodology to provision datacenters to optimize for performance and minimize cost. When breaking the application into modalities, resource cost is assessed in isolation. Results are then aggregated to estimate the overall resource provisioning requirements. A validation tool is used to simulate the load and validate the assumptions. This was applied to a commercially available solution and validated in a datacenter setting.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aspires to}} realize the first monographic study of political and administrative activity of the Earl Vittorio Lodovico d’Hallot Des Hayes, Viceroy of Savoy in Sardinia from 1767 to 1771. This was the crucial moment in the policy of reformation for the Island, starting with Gian Battista Lorenzo Bogino, the Minister for Sardinian Affairs (1759 - 1773), intent upon increasing bureaucracy on the Island and realizing an administrative centralization. Reconstructing the political activity of Des Hayes allows the controversial studies of this reform politics of the Savoy household to be revised. This required new investigation of the documents regarding these years, correspondence, reports and essays, to realize an efficient wider framework. Des Hayes participated in debates in Cagliari and Turin about reform projects for the Island, disclosing their real efficiency, the <b>modality</b> <b>of</b> their <b>application,</b> and also class involvement, namely nobility and clergy (diocesan and regular) and their feelings about this. First of all, analysis of discussions within the councils reveals that Cagliari was less marginal than what has often considered by historians: Sardinian bureaucrats took {{an active part in}} these open discussions, suggesting many concrete and solid state interventions to face political, administrative, economic, feudal, ecclesiastical and cultural problems. Secondly, it results that the viceroy pursued a clear intent of reformation, but with extreme prudence. He found it essential to reconstitute warily, not upset drastically. Therefore, his approach was pragmatic: every reform had to be based on field work, the only way to remove preconceptions and to avoid intervention resulting from rash determination.
