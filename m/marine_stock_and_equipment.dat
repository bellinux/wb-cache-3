40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{literature}} exists regarding the global fisheries crisis. However, the human element has been largely overlooked. This study seeks to understand the relationship that traditional Fante-speaking peoples have with oceanic resources. Interviews with artisanal fishers, trades-women, and influential elders from the coastal village of Anomabo in the Central Region of Ghana were conducted over a six-week period. Interviews revealed {{the degree to which}} artisanal fishers compete with industrial fleets (both domestic and foreign), the nutritional and economic importance of the artisanal industry as well as the cultural practices embedded within maritime subsistence activities. Industrial fisheries threaten global <b>marine</b> <b>stocks,</b> <b>and</b> with them, the survival of cultures tied to the sea. This study suggests a necessity for swift policy change in order to ensure the health of West African <b>marine</b> <b>stocks,</b> <b>and</b> to protect the nutritional, economic, and cultural basis of Fante-speaking communities...|$|R

40|$|Although Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are an {{increasingly}} popular policy tool for protecting <b>marine</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> biodiversity, they pose high costs for small-scale fisherfolk {{in poor countries}}. With Tanzania’s Mnazi Bay Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park as an example, we develop a spatial economic decision-modelling framework as a lens to examine fishers’ reactions to incentives created by an MPA. We argue that MPAs in poor countries can only contribute to sustainability if management induces changes in incentives to fish {{through a combination of}} enforcement (‘sticks’) and livelihood projects (‘carrots’). We emphasise practical implementation issues and implications for fostering marine ecosystem sustainability...|$|R

50|$|Despite his {{technical}} {{excellence and}} the general popularity of his prints, Baxter’s business was never profitable - his process was laborious and {{it seems likely that}} his perfectionism prevented him from completing many of his commissioned works on time. In 1860 he held a sale of all his <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> most of which was not sold. Eventually he sold his plates and blocks to the printer Vincent Brooks, who later republished some of Baxter’s images. Baxter was declared bankrupt in 1865 and died in 1867, after an accident involving a horse omnibus.|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1970s the creek was 8 metres (26 feet) deep and over 50 metres (164 feet) wide, and farmers had to privately fund the {{construction}} of bridges to cross {{from one part of}} their properties to the other. These were all washed away, along with crops, <b>stock,</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> by particularly severe flooding in 1978. The farmers of Cowwarr had long blamed government incompetence over nearly three decades for their woes, but when they were denied the right to claim compensation for loss of land, productivity and private infrastructure in 1978 they decided to take further action.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of seafood}} ecolabels is {{expanding}} {{in the world}} marketplace, but so are labels indicating other product attributes, such as country of origin and wild vs. farmed. The interactive effects of these labels and attributes in evaluating consumers' preferences for ecolabeled seafood are relatively unexplored. In this paper we investigate (1) the direct and interactive effects of seafood ecolabels with other common fish labels, and (2) how consumers' perceptions {{about the state of}} <b>marine</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> the valuation of ecolabels may be affected by different information. We find moderate interactive effects between ecolabels and country of origin labels, whereas the valuation for seafood ecolabels is fairly high. In terms of information, we find that consumers' perceptions about fish stock levels changed (negatively) after receiving information on declining <b>stock</b> levels, <b>and</b> more sensationalized information led to increased change. However, valuation for a seafood ecolabel increases only when the information was perceived positively (credible/interesting); whereas exaggerated information (which was also perceived less credible) had insignificant effects on WTP...|$|R
50|$|Camcorders {{are used}} in the {{production}} of low-budget TV shows if the production crew does not have access to more expensive equipment. Movies have been shot entirely on consumer camcorder equipment (such as The Blair Witch Project, 28 Days Later and Paranormal Activity). Academic filmmaking programs have also switched from 16mm film to digital video in early 2010s, due to the reduced expense and ease of editing of digital media and the increasing scarcity of film <b>stock</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment.</b> Some camcorder manufacturers cater to this market; Canon and Panasonic support 24p (24 fps, progressive scan—the same frame rate as cinema film) video in some high-end models for easy film conversion.|$|R
40|$|Although Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{provide an}} {{increasingly}} popular policy tool for protecting <b>marine</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>and</b> biodiversity, they pose high costs for small-scale fisherfolk who have few alternative livelihood options {{in poor countries}}. MPAs often address this burden on local households by providing some benefits to compensate locals and/or induce compliance with restrictions. We argue that MPAs in poor countries can only contribute to sustainability if management induces changes in resource-dependent households’ incentives to fish. With Tanzania’s Mnazi Bay Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park (MBREMP) and its internal villages as an example, we use an economic decision modeling framework as a lens to examine incentives, reaction to incentives, and implications for sustainable MPA management created by park managers’ use of enforcement (“sticks”) and livelihood projects (“carrots”). We emphasize practical implementation issues faced by MBREMP managers and implications for fostering marine ecosystem sustainability in a poor country setting. marine protected areas, sustainable marine reserves, Tanzania, practical enforcement, marine-dependent livelihoods...|$|R
