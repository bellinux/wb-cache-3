40|$|In recent years, {{the heating}} value of CPU has been {{increasing}} rapidly with the improvement of computer performance. Therefore computer industry is requiring <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> with high <b>cooling</b> performance for CPU in applicable to high heating value and heat flux. The existing <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> for CPU has been air-cooling aluminum fin, however {{it can not be}} adaptable to high heating value. We have developed a new compact boiling refriberant type <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> for CPU. In this paper, the basic cooling performance of this boiling refrigerant type <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> was evaluated, it was clarified that the boiling refrigerant type <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> has high <b>cooling</b> performance compared with conventional air cooling aluminum fin. Furthermore the calculation method for predicting the cooling performance by modeling boiling and condensing phenomena was proposed. relation: isVersionOf: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{costs are}} {{increasing}} rapidly. Energy efficiency strategies {{are required to}} reduce electricity consumption for energy intensive operations. Cooling systems of deep level mines consume approximately 25 % of their total electricity consumption. Cold water supplied by these systems is reticulated throughout the mine. Water reticulation can account for a further 42 % of the total electricity consumption of a typical deep level mine. Underground working areas in deep level mines must be cooled to account for temperatures of up to 60 °C. Mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> are often used to cool underground working areas. These units require significant amounts of chilled water. Adequate supply of chilled water to these units is crucial to comply with health and safety regulations. It is often found that the water supply to mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> is not properly managed. Energy savings can be achieved on the cooling systems {{as well as the}} reticulation systems by reducing the water consumption of mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units.</b> Various valves were identified as possible equipment to be used to manage water consumption on mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units.</b> A case study proved that flow reductions on the mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> are possible. Worker safety and mine production was not affected by the installations. Electrical energy savings were achieved through reduced pumping and reduction in refrigeration energy consumption. Water consumption for one mobile <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> was reduced by 237 kℓ/day. This is equivalent to an average saving of 37. 5 kW per unit. This saving includes the reduced power consumption on the chillers and pumps. Installing the valve on 26 MCUs would potentially result in a total saving of approximately 1 MW, an annual saving of R 2. 8 million[URL]...|$|R
40|$|A good {{matching}} between {{size and}} efficiency is a desirable design feature of <b>cooling</b> <b>units</b> for electronic systems, {{due to high}} capacity to size ratio and small weight. For this purpose, Embraco developed a new refrigerating system for small enclosures and telecommunication stations, which makes use of a new miniaturized linear microcompressor. The air-conditioning <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> consists of finned-tube heat exchangers and a direct current (DC) oil-free microcompressor that uses R- 134 a as the refrigerant. The paper presents {{a detailed description of}} the <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> and performance tests. A novel refrigerating cycle for thermal management of the microcompressor was created especially for high ambient temperatures. In order to run all experimental tests, a <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> calorimeter was assembled. In the experimental facility, the ambient temperature was varied (25, 35 and 55 °C) and the bulk temperature inside the enclosure was controlled via an electric heater. Commercially available thermoelectric systems used for electronics cooling were also compared with the vapor compression system. The results have shown that the microcompressor unit presented a coefficient of performance (COP) approximately two times larger than thermoelectric solutions...|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{samples that}} are taken during a biopsy {{need to be}} snap-frozen in order to {{preserve}} their properties and use the tissue for contemporary molecular biology technologies that may improve the treatment of the patient. There is currently a lack of (safe) methodologies or devices for snap- freezing tissue. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on the optimal cooling rate, which depends on the type of tissue and is important to know in order to avoid damage to the cells. This report comments on the biological background of the acceptable cooling rates and also describes a design for a new biopsy snap-freezing device. The suggested device fulfills the requirements for use inside a hospital environment. The device consists of a <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> and a base station. The copper <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> can be pre-cooled on the base station until used. After biopsy, the tissue sample inside a cryovial can be deposited into the <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> and is then cooled down at rates between 1 - 10 K/sec, which is within the biologically safe range for several tissue types.
