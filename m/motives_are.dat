5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|The United States Capitol {{shooting}} {{incident of}} 1998 {{was an attack}} on July 24, 1998, {{which led to the}} deaths of two United States Capitol Police officers. Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were killed when Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., entered the Capitol and opened fire. Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at George Washington University Hospital. Weston's exact <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> unknown, but he has a mental disorder and maintains a strong distrust of the federal government. He remains in a mental institution due to paranoid schizophrenia and has yet to be tried in court.|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} ways a defendants <b>motive</b> can <b>be</b> pertinent {{to his or}} her criminal liability. <b>Motive</b> can <b>be</b> fully inculpatory or exculpatory or only partially inculpatory or exculpatory.

If illegal activity with a particular motive does not hold a defendant responsible than that <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> fully exculpatory. When a motive supplies inadequate defense to a crime, the <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> partially exculpatory. When a motive says the kind of infraction for which the defendant <b>is</b> responsible, the <b>motive</b> <b>is</b> partially inculpatory.|$|R
5|$|The {{rock art}} of Soacha-Sibaté, in the {{southwest}} of the Bogotá savanna, has been studied in detail between 1970 and 2006, after initial studies by Triana. In these petrographs certain motives have been described; triangular heads are pictographs of human figures where the heads are painted in a triangular shape. They are applied using red colours and demonstrate various sizes. Similar <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> noted in Mongua, Tenjo and Tibacuy. In most cases of the rock art on the Altiplano, the body extremities, such as hands, are shown in simple shapes. In some cases however, the hands are elaborated with much more detail using spirals, concentric circles and more strokes, identified as complex hands. Apart from Sibaté, these shapes are encountered also in Saboyá and Tibaná in Boyacá. A third class of petrographs has been named radial representations. This motive shows the main figures with concentric square or circular lines drawn around them. The concentric circular drawings have been interpreted as representing the main deities of the Muisca religion; Chía (the Moon) and Sué, her husband the Sun. Rhomboidal <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> found in Sibaté, but their exact purpose {{has not yet been}} concluded. Both in Soacha and in Sibaté a fifth type of petrographs has been identified; winged figures. These motives resemble the birds that are described in tunjos and ceramics of the Altiplano.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently indeed; {{although}} the Second Athenian Confederacy was dissolved, the Athenians {{were allowed to}} keep their colony on Samos, and their prisoners were freed without ransom. Philip's <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> not entirely clear, but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians. Philip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations; both received Macedonian garrisons. He then turned to deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely {{to take advantage of}} the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese. The Spartans refused Philip's invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged Lacedaemonia, but did not attack Sparta itself.|$|E
5|$|Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) {{is special}} {{projects}} director of Weyland-Yutani Corporation's Special Services Division {{and the primary}} antagonist of Aliens. After telling Ellen Ripley about her daughter's death and hearing her account of the Nostromo incident, Burke uses the information to have LV-426's colonists rendezvous with the Derelict and trigger an Alien outbreak. He persuades her to join the Colonial marine expedition, to destroy (not extract) specimens, as an adviser in exchange for her regaining her flight license. Burke accompanies the squad aboard Sulaco to safeguard the company's investment in the terraforming colony. His ulterior <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> discovered by Ripley; his rationale is that the Aliens are an important species they cannot exterminate and the facility is a significant investment. Burke tries to have Ripley and Newt impregnated by imprisoned facehuggers, but the Colonial Marines intervene. Although most of the survivors press for Burke's execution, Ripley protests; the Aliens cut the power and use an architectural-design flaw {{to break into the}} room. He escapes, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to die, but is confronted by an Alien in the locked medical lab and his screams are heard by those outside.|$|E

40|$|Although episodic {{volunteers are}} a {{critical}} resource for many organisations, their <b>motives</b> for volunteering <b>are</b> poorly understood. A systematic review {{was conducted to}} describe empirical evidence about motives for episodic volunteering (EV) across sectors (sport, tourism, events, health and social welfare). Identified EV <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> then categorised using core functions from the Volunteer Functions Inventory (VFI) for comparison across studies. Twelve databases (1990 –December 2014) were searched. Thirty-three English language studies included results describing EV <b>motives.</b> Studies <b>were</b> predominantly cross-sectional, quantitative, event-based and originating in North America. Measurement of <b>motives</b> <b>was</b> also inconsistent. Common <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> helping others and socialising. Physical challenge and healing <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> specific to sport-based events and charity sport events, respectively. Over 80 % of <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> classified using VFI functions, particularly enhancement, values and social functions. The VFI supplemented by qualitative work may be efficacious to further identify EV motives and retention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} among motives for health-related YouTube use, cognitive involvement with health information on YouTube, post-exposure online activity, and sense of empowerment regarding health and health care. As a result of the analysis of data from 263 participants, social utility, convenient information-seeking, habit-passing time, and exciting entertainment <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> identified as four motives for health-related YouTube use. Social utility and convenient information-seeking <b>motives</b> <b>were</b> positively related to cognitive involvement and cognitive involvement was positively related to perceived control. Social utility <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> negatively related to perceived competence, whereas convenient information-seeking <b>motive</b> <b>was</b> positively related to perceived competence.

However, Abby's <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> to obtain a legal document from their company {{in order to help}} Greg Sumner, who is being sued. Should she obtain the document, Greg will pay her the $1 million she needs. Greg then informs her he no longer needs the document.

He is a biochemist leading the research into a cure for the virus {{from the safety of}} a biologically secure research and development facility. As the research begins to require increasingly unethical practices, he lies and rationalises in the struggle to maintain the loyalty of his colleagues. Unbeknownst to the other workers (all of whom had lost loved ones in the pandemic), he had secreted his wife (portrayed by Alisa Arnah) and young son within the facility, violating protocol. His true <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> suspect, as he answers to someone called Mr. Landry, with whom he communicates over a satellite video link. Until his death he was using stolen anti-virus produced from Abby's blood for himself, keeping it from the others, who died when the virus got into the lab after Abby infected his wife. At {{the end of the second}} series, he is accidentally shot and killed by a sniper in Landry's employ.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E

5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|The rich art {{elaborated}} by the Muisca {{has inspired}} modern artists and designers in their creativity.

The art of the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is well studied by many different researchers who published their work right from the beginning of colonial times. The conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, wrote in his memoires about a skilled and well-organised civilisation of traders and farmers. Friar Pedro Simón described the relation between art and the religion and later contributions in the analysis of the various artforms have been made by Alexander von Humboldt, Joaquín Acosta and Liborio Zerda in the 19th century, Miguel Triana, Eliécer Silva Celis and Sylvia M. Broadbent in the 20th century and modern research is dominated by the work of Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda, Javier Ocampo López and many others.|$|E

When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus; Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Arcangel intervene Orb's forces to preserve the nation's neutral status. Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus' attempted murder, but his <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained a weapon of mass destruction, Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person's entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT's forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates.|$|E

Hunter has a happy reunion with Verity and Jimmy, but Sunstreaker, angry over what has been done to him, abandons his former partner. After the initial battles on Earth, the Decepticons lie low, experimenting with creating new life and eventually creating the Insecticons {{to take advantage of a}} now captured Hunter, as well as thousands of failed experiments eventually dubbed the Swarm. As the Autobots have reinforced their position on Earth, the Decepticons lure them into a trap by planting disinformation about a Decepticon trap with the help of Sunstreaker, who is convinced that he is in fact helping Starscream kill Megatron. His <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> darker than merely helping the Autobots win by disposing of Megatron - he asks the Decepticon to kill all the humans in revenge for what was done to him. Armed with the disillusioned Autobot's knowledge, unified and with their new weapon - Devastator - the Decepticons decimate the Autobots. Planning to dispose of them through a portal to Cybertron, Prime manages to fight them off long enough for his troops to escape through the portal, though at great cost - Prime is heavily damaged and rendered comatose by the damage he takes, and the Autobots are marooned on Cybertron.|$|E

Although the Zerg are able to follow the Protoss to Shakuras, Raszagal informs the survivors of a Xel'Naga temple {{on the surface of}} the planet with the power to scour the Zerg from the surface if activated. With Zeratul and Artanis reluctantly partnering with Sarah Kerrigan, who informs them of a new Overmind growing on Char, the player joins them in an operation to recover two key crystals (Khalis and Uraj) necessary to operate the temple. Upon their return, it is revealed that Aldaris has begun an uprising against the dark templar over their alliance with Kerrigan. The uprising is crushed, and Aldaris is killed by Kerrigan, who reveals that her <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> to ensure the destruction of the Zerg cerebrates on Shakuras so she can gain control of the Zerg herself before departing the planet. Despite knowing that activating the temple will accomplish Kerrigan's objectives, Zeratul and Artanis proceed with little other choice, wiping the Zerg off Shakuras' surface.|$|E
5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{surviving}} Early Middle Ages sources, {{there are six}} that mention Helmichis by name. Of these, the only contemporary one is the Chronica of Marius of Avenches, written in the 580s. Marius was bishop of Aventicum, a town located in the western Alps in the Frankish Kingdom of Burgundy. Because of the small distance from Aventicum to the Italian peninsula, the chronicler had easy access to information regarding northern Italy. For this reason, historian Roger Collins considers the Chronica, though short, to be reliable on Italian matters. The remaining sources all come from Italy and were written in later centuries. Two of them were written in the 7th century, the Continuatio Havniensis Prosperi and the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, both anonymous. The Continuatio is a chronicle written around 625 that has reached us in a single manuscript. As its name suggests, it {{is a continuation of}} the 5th century chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine. Derived in considerable measure from the Chronica Majora of Isidore of Seville, it blames the Romans for their inability to defend Italy from foreign invaders, and praises the Lombards for defending the country from the Franks. This is the earliest surviving work to name Rosamund, the queen of the Lombards who plays a central role in Helmichis' attested biography. The other 7th century work, the Origo, is a brief prose history of the Lombards that is essentially an annotated king list, although it begins with a description of the founding myth of the Lombard nation. Giorgio Ausenda believes that the Origo was written around 643 as a prologue to the Edictum Rothari, and continued to be updated till 671. According to Walter Pohl, the author's <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> mostly political: the Origo serves to consolidate the Lombards' national identity by emphasising a shared history. Apart from the origin myth, the only more detailed account is the one concerning the death of Alboin, and thus Helmichis.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{encounters}} the antagonistic team, Team Galactic, {{early in}} the game, {{when he or she}} must save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their <b>motives</b> <b>are</b> unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.|$|E
