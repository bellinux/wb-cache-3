5000|$|As already mentioned, {{the reason}} for the two {{different}} case colors was a hardware change that Sony had made fairly early in the PlayStation production cycle - the original machines were built using Rev. A (early Japan <b>market</b> <b>units)</b> or Rev. B (later Japan units, US and Europe) hardware, both using the same GPU with VRAM to store the video data. Later models used Rev. C silicon and SGRAM - although the two chipsets had very similar performance, and Rev. C was explicitly designed with compatibility in mind, they were not identical - the Rev. C version was significantly faster at doing alpha blending, and hence the PS [...] "semitransparent" [...] writing mode - it was also rather slow at certain screen memory block moves (basically, ones involving narrow vertical strips of the display) on top of this there were some minor hardware bugs in the older silicon that had been addressed by including workarounds for them in the libraries - the later library versions checked the GPU type at startup time and disabled the patches if they were not needed. Because this made the two machine types quite significantly different from each other, you had to test your title on both of them before submitting it. The blue debugs (DTL-H100x, DTL-H110x) had the old silicon and the green ones (DTL-H120x) had the new silicon.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} a financial {{strategy for the}} implementation of the Lawrence-Allen Secondary Plan. The financial strategy is intended to provide a fiscally responsible framework for financing the infrastructure identified within the Secondary Plan. The Secondary Plan allows for, among other things, the revitalization of social housing and the integration of new market housing within the Lawrence Heights area. To accomplish this, the Secondary Plan requires significant reinvestment in City infrastructure and community facilities. Funding for the revitalization of the social housing stock which comprises 1, 208 units entirely owned by the Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) will be TCHC's responsibility. TCHC's business and financing plans do not rely on City financial assistance for funding the estimated $ 350 million cost of social housing replacement. Rather, TCHC anticipates, in large part based on the Regent Park revitalization model, that its primary source of funding will come from revenues generated from the sale of land and land rights to private developers who in turn will build <b>market</b> <b>units</b> to provide a mixed-income, mixed-use community...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 It is {{generally}} accepted that {{households in the}} Housing Choice Voucher program (HCV) encounter discrimination when searching for private <b>market</b> <b>units.</b> Observational research suggests that households and program administrators perceive discrimination. Research and enforcement audits, typically carried out in a single metro area, suggest that landlords discriminate against HCV households. However, the extent of HCV discrimination is unknown. This study adds to this research by empirically demonstrating discrimination against HCV households in multiple metro areas. Using an email audit design, over 6, 000 landlords were contacted by testers over 60 days during summer 2016 in 14 different metro areas selected to vary in vacancy rates and Source of Income (SOI) law coverage. Testers randomly varied in racial affiliation, conveyed through name, and HCV status, conveyed through email text. Landlord response behavior was recorded and classified to measure discrimination. Findings show that after controlling for tester, unit, neighborhood, and SOI law characteristics, 33. 6 % of HCV households receive any response from landlords, compared to 48. 2 % of non-HCV households, a difference of 14. 6 percentage points. Only 10. 3 % of HCV households receive a positive response compared to 46. 5 % of non-HCV households, a difference of fully 36. 2 percentage-points. SOI law coverage is not associated with response behavior. HCV status does not have different effects by racial affiliation. Due to the randomization of tester attributes, {{it is likely that}} these effects are causal: HCV households experience discrimination when contacting landlords advertising rental units online. Given the severity of this discrimination, HCV program administrators and advocates should focus on rental search assistance for households and reducing {{the time it takes to}} complete pre-leasing approvals...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore {{evaluation}} in the Swedish Public Employment Service, with particular focus on how the use of evaluations looks like. The study consists of two studies. The first one is an analysis of the Employment Service’s all policy documents that describe or mention evaluation as well as an interview-study with all the management staff in one of the Employment Service’s local labor <b>market</b> <b>units.</b> The second study is a comparative study with analysis of the Employment Service’s entire evaluation production for the years 2010 and 2015. The results show that the Swedish Public Employment Service is a hierarchically controlled governmental organization with routines for effective communication of management's messages to all levels in the organization. Employment Service's evaluation is governed and implemented centrally and communicated from the top, down through the organization. Evaluations are mainly used as a routine for checking and reporting, as well as accounting to the government. Managers on a middle and local level find that much of the evaluation is about control, and that control is not adapted to needs of the everyday business on the local level. Evaluation activities are extensive. Evaluations seems to have become an end in itself, used in legitimizing purposes rather than as a tool for developing of the service to the clients. Half of the evaluations that the Employment Service carried out by their own, is regular evaluations. Almost all evaluations carried out by the European Social Fund Council in Sweden and “Samordningsförbund” (associations for coordination of social projects) are single occasion-evaluations. Legitimizing dominates the use of evaluation, both 2010 and 2015 in evaluating production. Evaluation for improving of the service to the clients is mentioned only in a small number of policy documents. Evaluations that includes the client’s perspective as well as proposals for change occurs to a limited extent in both 2010 and 2015. The Organization of the Employment Service's evaluation activities are heavily influenced by New Public Management's management philosophy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn May 2007, E. ON Group (E. ON) set {{an ambitious}} target for {{reducing}} the specific CO 2 emissions of the overall group’s electricity generation. By 2030, E. ON will reduce the specific CO 2 emissions to 360  grams per kilowatt hour, half the 1990 figure. Thus, besides increasing the share of renewables and maintaining the nuclear share, E. ON identified the need to advance the technology of fossil fuel fired power plants. E. ON pursues a strategy of replacing power stations {{at the end of}} their life cycle with new, state-of-the-art power stations which are ready to be equipped with CCS (carbon capture and storage) and therefore “capture ready”. Moreover, E. ON is developing CO 2 capture and storage as this technology has the potential to drastically reduce emissions from coal-fired plants. Beginning in 2020, E. ON intends to have large scale CCS technology available. E. ON’s coordinated strategy encompasses research, development and demonstration (RD&D) and is directed towards pre combustion capture, oxyfuel and post combustion capture with a focus on the latter. E. ON is working together with international partners to further develop the existing technologies for capturing of CO 2 by testing advanced technologies in several pilot plants at our sites. The goal of the pilot projects is to optimise the downstream capture of CO 2 from flue gas (post combustion capture) hence reducing the auxiliary power consumption of the capture process. An update on the pilot projects, suppliers and achievement made will be given. Besides improving the capture process itself the technology needs a significant increase of the treatable flue gas capacity compared to today’s limits known from chemical industry. Therefore E. ON is also involved in the development of demo scale projects proving the feasibility of the full CCS chain (including transport and storage). E. g. our Kingsnorth power station in the UK has entered the next stage of the UK Government’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) competition after developers. We submitted an Outline Solution Bid competition on 9 November 2009. The competition is aiming to deliver the UK’s first fullscale CCS demonstration project. We have come to an agreement with both the European Commission and the Dutch Government on the funding of our ROAD-project. This is our joint project with Electrabel (part of GDF SUEZ) at RotterdamMaasvlakte (NL). The Dutch part of the funding is now before the European Commission for State Aid approval. We will report about the projects and the progress made in our <b>market</b> <b>units.</b> In addition E. ON is engaged in the development of storage sites and transport routes for CO 2. Our business unit E. ON Gas Storage is involved in several research and development activities. The paper will highlight E. ON’s main CCS activities. An overview will be given as well as an update on the status of the current projects and available results...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} {{economic}} climate the circumstances and the environment for companies constantly change and organizations which in the future want to be competitive have to adapt to these new conditions and market requirement else {{they are forced to}} be out of business. Seeing the rapid change in telecom sector with flat sales in many countries during 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ericsson decided to do a major re organization in 2010. Ericsson management set out to restructure the company to trim off fat and to help the company function as a leaner and more productive entity by assigning transformational leaders that can help company cope with the changing market conditions with focus on business performance, growth, new market segments and getting more close to customer. As a result of that change Ericsson Saudi Arabia that was known as Market Unit Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (MU KSA) part of 23 <b>Market</b> <b>Units</b> across the globe transformed to Customer Unit Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (CU KSA) part of Region Middle East (RMEA) with new Head and management team. By 2009 - 2010 Ericsson CU KSA was facing issues like flat sales, operators were cautious to spend more money since revenues were declining, emergence of Chinese players in the marker resulted in dramatic culture shift in industry where business models and ways of working changed and Ericsson in Saudi Arabia was having direct impact on revenue and market share. During 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ericsson in Saudi Arabia lost local market share from 60 % to 50 % and a complete overhaul was inevitable. One of the primary objectives of this study will be to determine the relationship of transformational leadership to organizational performance by analyzing data collected from Ericsson Saudi Arabia. It will be analyzed if new management in Ericsson Saudi Arabia has the capabilities of transformational leadership. Later I’ll try to establish correlation of transformational leadership towards strategic management, Organizational culture and Employee Motivation & Commitment {{to see if there is}} any significant impact of these that will help overcome existing market challenges explore new opportunities and redefine strategies while resulting in positive business growth and performance. For the purpose of research a study a mix of qualitative and quantitative approach was chosen. Questionnaire surveys were used as part of quantitative research. Interview surveys together with Sales reports and balanced score cards were used as part of qualitative research. A total of 48 questionnaire surveys along with 8 interviews form different members of management in CU KSA were conducted. Data analysis tool function in Excel was used to figure out mean, median and standard deviation for Transformational leadership attributes. Data analysis tool was also used to calculate correlation coefficient factor between transformational leadership with strategic management, organizational culture and business performance. It was discovered after analysis conducted using interview and survey results that Ericsson CU KSA Head and Management fulfill the criterion of transformational leadership having strong presence of transformational leadership attributes namely vision, Inspirational, role model, support for personal growth, trust and consideration for followers needs. It was also discovered that transformational leadership has a strong correlation towards strategic management, organizational culture, employee Motivation and business performance. Data collected from Interviews, Sales reports and Balanced Score Card supported the data analysis of questionnaire. This means that if companies want to experience growth in their business especially in these days of tough competition, there should be focus on making sure the leadership is transformational with strong emphasis on process of Strategic Management, fostering organization culture and boosting employee motivation & commitment that will lead towards positive Business Performance...|$|E

The author wishes to thank the following for their time, insights and assistance: Bonnie Rice, Darren Kitchen, David Lach, Garth Davis, Genevieve Bucher, Jill Atkey, Kira Gerwing, Mike Lewis, Penny Gurstein, Susana Cogan, and Thom Armstrong. Thanks to Don McNair of McNair Editing for his help on one of the tables. This case study examines the Vancouver Community Land Trust Foundation (Land Trust), a project being implemented in Vancouver, BC by a consortium of non-profit organizations, social finance 1 institutions and the municipal government. The case study was created in order to describe and examine the Land Trust as a potential model for providing long-term affordable housing without senior government funding or ongoing operating subsidies. Metro Vancouver is experiencing a crisis in housing affordability and {{there is a need for}} innovative solutions to the crisis. It is hoped that this case study will be useful for governments, non-profit organizations, social finance institutions and other actors that may be interested in replicating the model in Metro Vancouver and beyond. The Mayor’s Taskforce on Affordable Housing, and a resulting Request for Expressions of Interest (RFEOI) put forward by the City of Vancouver in August 2012 provided the catalyst for the consortium of non-profit, social finance and professional organizations to come together under the umbrella of the Land Trust. However, in the years prior to the Taskforce, these same actors had all been looking at the big picture of affordable housing in the region, and putting in place the structures that enabled them to quickly come together with the innovative Land Trust model when the RFEOI was issued. The overall initiative can be seen as the result of strategic actions by and between various actors converging in the emergence of a strategic social-public 2 partnership – a collaboration between the municipality and social actors for the long-term delivery of affordable housing. The Land Trust project provides 358 units of non-market rental housing on four sites. The City of Vancouver is leasing the land at the four sites through 99 -year leases at a nominal rate. The Land Trust, a non-profit organization established by the Co-op Housing Federation of BC, is the lead proponent in the project. Non-profit and co-operative organizations will operate units for a diverse range of tenants, including low-income families and individuals with mental health and / or addictions. A key feature of the project is a ‘portfolio approach’ that is enabling efficiencies in developing and operating the site, as well as enabling cross-subsidization from higher rent units to lower end of <b>market</b> <b>units</b> across the portfolio. Units will rent at varying levels of affordability ranging from units for those living on incomeassistance to units renting at close to market rates. Overall units will rent at an aggregated maximum of 76 % of market; within this aggregate, rents will range from 23 % of market rents to 90 % of market. The core commitment of the Land Trust to providing affordable housing, and agreements with the City on affordability requirements ensures long-term affordability. Construction is due to start on the first two projects in the spring of 2015, with completion and occupancy in 2017 – 1018. No one piece of the financing structure unlocks affordability; rather, it is the collective impact of all the different kinds of investment, combined with the cross-subsidies built into the business model that make it work. In particular, the City of Vancouver’s investment through the discounted land-lease along with the strong participation of social finance institutions stand out as critical features of the project’s funding. As well, the agreement between the City and the Land Trust anticipates operating surpluses that will be used for future expansion of affordable housing. Surpluses will be split between the Land Trust and the City of Vancouver. In addition to reinvestment in new affordable housing units, surpluses can also be used to deepen affordability for low and moderateincome people living in the existing Land Trust units. The potential for replication of the Land Trust model is unfolding in the context of the transfer of provincial land assets to social housing organizations starting in 2014 as well as the end of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s operating agreements and their related mortgages. The Land Trust may provide a model for non-profits, co-ops, municipalities and other actors to leverage under-developed land that is already owned by the community or municipalities for affordable housing without ongoing government subsidies. The case study identified significant strengths in the model as well as some initial lessons learned. In particular, replication of the model will require commitment and leadership from government and social finance institutions collaborating in social-public partnerships with non-profit and co-operative housing organizations. In the unfolding provincial context, there is a particular opportunity for non-profit and cooperative associations to redevelop their own properties. Considerable sophistication and capacity is required to manage their own development; there is a gap in experience and equity and some may not be willing to assume the risks of redevelopment. In considering the Land Trust as a potential model for redevelopment, challenges that have emerged to date, such as tensions around decision-making and the reality of the time involved in, will have to be considered. Finally, the Land Trust is in early days of implementation; a Development Agreement has been signed but construction had not yet begun at the time of publication of this case study. As such, the analysis contained in this case study must be read with the caution that this is a promising but not yet proven model.
