Atherton she wrote: [...] In particular their ascription of the whole thing to a dream of HCE seems to me nonsensical. <b>My</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that Mr. Joyce did not intend the book to be looked upon as the dream of any one character, but that he regarded the dream form with its shiftings and changes and chances as a convenient device, allowing the freest scope to introduce any material he wished—and suited to a night-piece. [...] Bernard Benstock also argued that [...] "The Dreamer in the Wake is more than just a single individual, even if one assumes that on the literal level we are viewing the dream of publican H.C. Earwicker." ...|$|E
500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I {{think one of the}} biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> <b>is</b> the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. Lo and behold, here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E

The decision, Teva Canada Ltd. v. Pfizer Canada Inc., pointed to section 27(3)(b) of The Patent Act which requires that disclosure must include sufficient information [...] "to enable any person {{skilled in the art}} or science to which it pertains" [...] to produce it.

2500|$|Sukarti also {{experienced}} racist criticism against him over this conflict. The name [...] "'Alawi-Irshadi conflict" [...] became {{applied to the}} split between the Sayyid faction (known as 'Alawis, Alawīyūn) and the non-Sayyids (al-Irshād led by Surkati). The 'Alawi Sayyid Muhammad bin 'Abdullāh al-'Aṭṭās even said [...] "The al-Irshad organization, in <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> <b>is</b> no pure Arab organization. There is too much African blood among its members for that". [...] 'Abdullāh Daḥlān attacked Surkati's stance that all humans whether Sayyid or non-Sayyid were equal by arguing that God creating some humans like the Prophet's family (the Sayyids) as superior to others. He said, [...] "will the Negro return from his error or persist in his stubbornness?" [...] Some Hadrami Sayyids including Daḥlān resorted to extreme racist results and insulted Sukarti, calling him [...] "the black death", [...] "black slave", [...] "the black", [...] "the Sudanese" [...] and [...] "the Negro", all while claiming that Sukarti could not speak Arabic and was a non-Arab.|$|E
2500|$|Reform of {{the office}} is usually only {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a New Zealand republic. Helen Clark, when defending Dame Silvia Cartwright following a political controversy over prison sentences, stated [...] "ne of the challenges for us is we clearly are no longer a dominion of Britain where the Governor-General is exactly like the Queen. I think we need to consider how the role of governor-general might evolve further. As you know, <b>my</b> <b>view</b> <b>is</b> that one day there will be a president fulfilling the kind of role the governor-general does." [...] Others, such as Professor Noel Cox have argued that the Governor-General's role needs to be updated, rather than reforming the office. Some constitutional academics expressed concern that the process of electoral reform could result in the Governor-General having greater political influence. In 1993, the then Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard caused controversy by suggesting that under the proposed Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system, the Governor-General may have to use their reserve powers more often. Following the adoption of MMP at a referendum later in 1993, Prime Minister Jim Bolger suggested at the opening of parliament in 1994 that one reason New Zealand might move to a republic was that the Governor-General would have more influence under the new electoral system.|$|E
2500|$|In 1891 [...] "Goldthwaite's Geographical Magazine, Volumes 1-2" [...] said [...] "FOUR months ago, {{a band of}} 500 pirates {{attacked}} the French residency at Chobo, in 'l‘onkin. They beheaded the French resident, ransacked and burned the town, and killed many of the people." [...] In 1906 the [...] "Decennial Reports on the Trade, Navigation, Industries, Etc., of the Ports Open to Foreign Commerce in China and Corea, and on the Condition and Development of the Treaty Port Provinces ..., Volume 2" [...] said [...] "Piracy on the Tonkin border was very prevalent {{in the early years}} of the decade. Fortified frontier posts were established in 1893 by the Tonkin Customs at the most dangerous passes into China, for the purpose of repressing contraband, the importation of arms and ammunition, and specially the illicit traflic of women, children, and cattle, which the pirates raided in Tonkin and carried beyond the Chinese mountains with impunity. These posts were eventually handed over to the military authorities." [...] In 1894 [...] "Around Tonkin and Siam" [...] said [...] "This, in <b>my</b> <b>view,</b> <b>is</b> too pessimist an estimate of the situation, a remark which also applies to the objection that these new roads facilitate the circulation of pirates. Defective as they may be, these roads must, it seems to me, be of service to cultivation and trade, and, therefore, in the long run to the pacification of the country." [...] In 1893 [...] "The Medical World, Volume 11" [...] said [...] "Captain Hugot, of the Zouaves, was inclose pursuit of the fnmous Thuyet, one of the most redoubtable, ferocious, and cunning of the Black Flag (Annamite pirates) leaders, the man who prepared and executed the ambuscade at Hue. The captain was just about to seize the person of the young pretender Ham-Nghi, whom the Black Flags had recently proclaimed sovereign of Armani, when he was struck by reveral ar rows, discharged by the body-guard of HamNghi. The wounds were all light, scarcely more than scratches, and no evil effect was feared at the time. After a few days, however, in spite of every care, the captain grew weaker, and it became apparent that he was suffering from the effects of arrow poison. He was removed as quickly and as tenderly as possible to Tanh-Hoa, where he died in horrible agony a few days later, in spite of the most scientific treatment and the most assiduous attention."— National Druggist.
