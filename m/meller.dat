25|$|Now {{playing in}} the <b>Meller</b> Braggins Cricket League, Park had lost the {{services}} of Foran and bowler Carl Ainsworth but had a new skipper in Chris Stenhouse. The rebuilding process continued {{to be affected by}} some disappointing results early in the 2011 season as they slumped towards the bottom two in June. However crucial news came that month when the club decided to apply for a return to the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. The move was granted which helped the 1st XI turn their fortunes around as Stenhouse produced some incredible bowling performances to ensure Park ended their time in Cheshire with a top 6 finish. Mark Evans also landed his first trophy as 2nd XI skipper as his team won the <b>Meller</b> Braggins 2nd XI Division.|$|E

25|$|Enrique Gómez Carrillo (February 27, 1873 in Guatemala City – November 29, 1927 in Paris) was a Guatemalan {{literary}} critic, writer, {{journalist and}} diplomat, {{and the second}} husband of the Salvadoran-French writer and artist Consuelo Suncin de Sandoval-Cardenas, later Consuelo Suncin, comtesse de Saint Exupéry, who in turn was his third wife; he had been previously married to intellectual Aurora Caceres and Spanish actress Raquel <b>Meller.</b>|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{early in}} the morning of July 30, a taxi brought from Tel Aviv, {{so as not to be}} recognized, arrived at the plant. Meanwhile <b>Meller</b> was looking for a route to move the bodies without risking arrest. After several hours such a route was found, and at 9:00 the order was given to move the bodies into the cab. The Irgun group {{concealed}} the bodies in bags and moved them out of the plant in broad daylight. They were seen doing this by workers at the neighboring plants.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mellers</b> {{birth is}} unknown. In the 1480s she is {{mentioned}} as married. She came to notice {{when her husband}} Richard <b>Mellers</b> died in 1507. He left substantial bequests to her, their three children and many good causes. He had manufactured bells {{and he had been}} the Mayor of Nottingham twice.|$|R
25|$|On July 11, 1947, a {{group of}} Irgun men {{retrieved}} weapons, chloroform, cloths and ropes from a hidden cache. After the recent failures, the Irgun militants in Netanya were skeptical regarding the chances of this kidnapping attempt. Because of this they {{did not go to}} any great lengths to cover their tracks, considering the complicated operation they were planning: they did not steal or borrow a vehicle or bring in non-local members who {{were less likely to be}} recognized. Furthermore, Yosef <b>Meller,</b> a longtime Netanya resident and newly recruited Irgun member, volunteered to use his black taxi cab, which was well known around town, for the kidnapping. The abduction operation was led by Benjamin Kaplan, who had been freed in the Acre Prison break. At nightfall one basic precaution was taken; the taxi's license plates were changed in an attempt to prevent it being recognized in the course of the abduction.|$|E
25|$|Five years later, on 11 February 1894, John Galloway senior died aged almost 90. His {{estate was}} valued at £143,117 {{and by this}} time the company had 500 {{employees}} at the Knott Mill site and a further 800 at Ardwick. His last home address was Coldstream House, Old Trafford and his executors were William Lewis Galloway (a sugar refiner, of The Lawn, Brook Lane, Timperley and sometime councillor of the County Borough of Salford), Edward Napier Galloway (Normanby, Altrincham) and John Galloway <b>Meller</b> (a land agent of Cooper Street, Manchester). An engineer, Edward Galloway was appointed a Land Tax Commissioner in 1899; he died on 5 October 1919 when living at Hill Rise, Leicester Road, Altrincham. The children of John Galloway established a charitable fund in memory of him and his wife, Emma, in 1895. This survived under the name of the John and Emma Galloway Memorial until October 1991, when it was amalgamated.|$|E
25|$|That evening Weinberg and the {{intended}} victims showed up once {{more at the}} café. Martin and Paice were in civilian clothes, were unarmed, were outside their camp at hours typically forbidden for British soldiers to be outside camp, and {{were not part of}} a group of four. After being informed that his intended victims were there, Kaplan posted his men around the coffee shop and along the road leading north to the camp and waited for an opportunity to perform the abduction. Weinberg and the two sergeants did not leave the coffee shop until after midnight. The two sergeants had decided to walk Weinberg home before returning to camp. Meller's cab, with Kaplan and three others inside, started after them. It pulled over and the four men emerged, masked and holding guns, and assaulted their targets. After resistance by one of the sergeants, they were forced into the car and <b>Meller</b> drove off. Weinberg was left, under guard, in an orchard in north Netanya, from where he was later taken to another orchard and released.|$|E

25|$|When news began leaking {{that the}} three men were to be {{executed}} and a country-wide curfew would be imposed at 11:00 PM, Paglin was at a movie. After being called out and told the news, he hurried to Begin's safe house, where he was meeting with members of his high command, where doubts were being raised over the feasibility of hanging the sergeants with the British and Haganah on high alert. Paglin, {{who had not been}} allowed to venture into British-controlled areas by the high command for the previous six months, asked to take personal charge of the operation. He was convinced that the sergeants could be hanged inside the plant, and the bodies could be moved to an orange grove and hung there, since attempting to move the two alive would be too great a risk. Since the hangings were meant as a 'lesson for all to see', Irgun wanted the bodies hung up in public. That was so clear that the mayor of Tel Aviv, Yisrael Rokah, feared Irgun would hang them in the city's main square, while in Netanya it was feared that they would be hanged on local lamp posts. Begin approved Paglin's plan. Paglin then slipped {{out of the house and}} drove to Netanya in his car, where he collected four Irgun men; Benjamin Kaplan, Yoel Kimchi, Avraham Rubin, and Yosef <b>Meller.</b> They arrived at the diamond plant in the afternoon.|$|E

500|$|The main theme {{used as a}} leitmotif for {{the blind}} flower girl is the song [...] "La Violetera" [...] ("Who’ll Buy my Violets") from Spanish {{composer}} José Padilla. Chaplin was unable to secure the original song performer, Raquel <b>Meller,</b> in the lead role, but used her song anyway as a major theme. Chaplin lost a lawsuit to Padilla (which took place in Paris, where Padilla lived) for not crediting him. Some modern editions released for video include a new recording by Carl Davis.|$|E

Mexican guitarist Carlos Santana {{appears as a}} featured artist on the song, playing an electrical guitar throughout. The guitar was also played by Lyle Workman. The other instruments featured in the song are keyboards played by Lester Mendez, bass by Paul Bushnell, drums by Shawn Pelton and percussion by Luis Contez. The mixing was done by Rob Jacobs while the audio engineering was finished by Kevin Killen, Serge [...] "Sergical" [...] Tsai and Vlado <b>Meller,</b> who mastered the song {{with the assistance of}} Mark Santangelo.|$|E

500|$|Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—a critic {{described}} by Fleming's biographer, John Pearson, as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—thought that the [...] "high-spots are all effectively described... but the narrative is loose and jerky". Boucher concluded that Live and Let Die was [...] "a lurid <b>meller</b> contrived by mixing equal parts of Oppenheim and Spillane". In June 1955 Raymond Chandler was visiting the poet Stephen Spender in London {{when he was}} introduced to Fleming, who subsequently sent Chandler a copy of Live and Let Die. In response, Chandler wrote that Fleming was [...] "probably the most forceful and driving writer of what I suppose still must be called thrillers in England".|$|E
500|$|On June 23, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{they were close}} to finishing recording. On the same day, the group worked on rough mixes of [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "21 and Invincible" [...] with Kaffel. The following Sunday, the band went to Los Angeles, California for a week to make sure [...] "everything [...] finished and that [...] didn't forget anything." [...] Further recording was done at 4th Street Recording in Santa Monica, California, with assistance from engineers Neil Couper, P.J. Smith and Jon Scholl. Smith also contributed additional background vocals. Kaffel and Wirt mixed the recordings at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, with assistance from engineer Neal Ferrazzani. Further mixing was performed at Skip Saylor Recording in Los Angeles, with assistance from engineer James Mugshorn. Vlado <b>Meller</b> mastered the recordings at Sony Mastering in New York.|$|E
500|$|... "Quiero" [...] is a latin pop song {{written and}} {{performed}} by Arjona. It {{was produced by}} Tommy Torres, Dan Warner and Lee Levin. The song was recorded between five studios in Miami: The Tiki Room, Picks & Hammers, Jet Wash Studio, The Hit Factory Criteria and Hit Masters; and on Jocoteco Studios in Mexico City. [...] "Quién" [...] was mixed in Barking Doctor Studios in New York City by Mick Guzauski, and mastered by Vlado <b>Meller</b> at the Sony Music Studios on that city. Website ADN Mundo called the song [...] "bohemian" [...] and [...] "hippie", saying it was [...] "a love story that doesn't speak about love, but instead about the recent events on {{the world we live}} and finally comes to the search of an indidivual who challenges nostalgia finding entertainment on the impossible." [...] In 2009, [...] "Quiero" [...] was awarded, along with other selected songs, the Pop/Ballad Songs of the year award by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mellers</b> sees Lennon's later song [...] "Oh Yoko!" [...] {{from the}} Imagine to be a [...] "positive counterpart" [...] to [...] "My Mummy's Dead," [...] being {{addressed}} {{to his wife}} Yoko Ono rather than his mother. <b>Mellers</b> notes that both songs {{are in the same}} key and utilise the [...] "Three Blind Mice" [...] melody, which is also reminiscent of the melody of the Beatles' [...] "All You Need Is Love." ...|$|R
