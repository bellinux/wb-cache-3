At the event, Amy gives an inspiring speech about how all the <b>moms</b> <b>are</b> overworked, and that they need to take time off, do fewer and less stressful events, and most importantly, allow themselves to make mistakes. Amy wins by a landslide, and eventually winds up comforting a devastated Gwendolyn, who reveals that her life is not perfect like she claims it is and that being in charge of the PTA was her only way to take her anger out on the problems she is facing.|$|E

However, unlike Dance Moms (where the <b>moms</b> <b>are</b> in a room above the studio watching the practices), the moms in Bring It! are featured outside the studio. In early seasons, the parents could only see what happens in practice through the studio windows; in later seasons Miss D has made a room for the parents to watch the girls through a TV screen.

5000|$|Two {{articles}} on Adweek identified the video {{as a way}} for Pandora to get an early start on associating itself positively with motherhood in the weeks running up to Mother's Day, which would be observed on May 10, 2015. One wrote: [...] "It underscores how irreplaceable our <b>moms</b> <b>are,</b> and {{how important it is to}} them that we know them well—particularly on days like Mother's Day. (Hint, hint, buy her some personalized jewelry.) ... It's also a not so subtle hint to her significant other, because c'mon, that 3-year-old isn't paying for the bracelet himself." [...] Another noted: [...] "While the spot contains little overt branding (one of the moms does appear to be wearing Pandora Jewelry, but it’s a quick shot), it ties the brand to the emotional sentiment while encouraging viewers to purchase Pandora Jewelry for mothers day." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Mommy Wars," [...] as {{introduced}} by Nina Darnton in a June 1990 Newsweek article, represents the media-staged tensions between stay-at-home moms and working moms. Stay-at-home moms criticize working moms for abandoning {{their children and}} homes to build a personal career, while working moms resent stay-at-home moms both {{because of the time}} and attention they are able to devote to their children, and because of the notion that a mother is only [...] "good enough" [...] if she can devote all her time and attention to the children and household. Susan Podnieks argues that The Mommy Myth, as well as the so-called battle between working moms and stay-at-home <b>moms,</b> <b>are</b> circulated by news media and talk shows, sparking debates about the proper sphere of women. As a result, the general public believes that [...] "there is a bitter war in the suburban cul-de-sacs of the United States between the complacent minivan-driving stay-at-home moms and the overachieving soon-to-be-burnout working mothers who still think they can have it all." [...] This leads to grouping mothers into rigid and rival categories, leading them to feel insecure about their mothering, and in turn leading them to devalue other mothers in order to elevate themselves.|$|E
5000|$|Weathered {{veterans}} of the Houston scene, Truth Decay includes {{former members of the}} Pain Teens (arguably the best-known-outside-of-Houston postpunk outfit this city's ever produced) and legendary art-punks Ms. Carriage and the Casual Tease. The tall, scary frontman has even played sax on Really Red records, which takes us back to the early Reagan years. So yes, they can be excused for being bitter old bastards, which they are. What'll surprise you is that their music is also so... catchy. They write tight, solid songs, always sharp, often funny and fueled by with guitar pyrotechnics that ought to make big-haired poseurs think about going back to get those dental hygienist certifications their <b>moms</b> <b>are</b> always nagging 'em about. Indeed, TD's weirdly crowd-pleasing arena-rock/punk would qualify as radio-friendly in any other universe but our own. As it is, they work the circuit of local dives regularly. See them grind out an ancient Houston punk masterpiece like [...] "Atomic Bomb" [...] and realize that there have always been great punk rock bands in Houston, that you've probably never heard (or heard of) any of them and that half of them included the guys now in Truth Decay.

5000|$|... "The dad {{is always}} {{expected}} in the family to be strong, so I made him strong. The <b>moms</b> <b>are</b> always pulled in a million different directions, so I made her stretch like taffy. Teenagers, particularly teenage girls, are insecure and defensive, so I made her turn invisible and turn on shields. And ten-year-old boys are hyperactive energy balls. Babies are unrealized potential." [...] - Brad Bird, writer and director of The Incredibles. Bird came to Pixar with the lineup of the story's family members worked out: a mom and dad, both suffering through the dad's midlife crisis; a shy teenage girl; a cocky ten-year-old boy; and a baby. Bird had based their powers on family archetypes. After several failed attempts to cast Edna Mode, Bird took on her voice role himself. It was {{an extension of the}} Pixar custom of tapping in-house staff whose voices came across particularly well on scratch dialogue tracks. During production, Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli visited Pixar and saw the film's story reels. When Bird asked if the reels made any sense or if they were just [...] "American nonsense," [...] Miyazaki replied, through an interpreter, [...] "I think it's a very adventurous thing you are trying to do in an American film." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} procedure for discriminating between a Down syndrome or neural tube defect (NTD) fetus and a normal fetus relies, {{to a great}} extent, on the reporting of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), hCG, and uE 3 results {{in the form of}} multiples of the median (MoMs). Further, threshold MoMs values for MSAFP, such as 2. 5 <b>MoMs,</b> <b>are</b> often used to define a reference range to identify an NTD fetus. We show that a constant threshold-MoMs cutoff for MSAFP values actually refers to different percentiles of MSAFP levels at different gestational ages and that the combining of MoMs values between centers and gestational ages, such as suggested by Wald et al. for deriving a patient-specific risk index, is highly questionable.
