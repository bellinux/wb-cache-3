50|$|As {{the farmer}} milked the cows in series, the cart would be rolled {{further down the}} center aisle, the long <b>milk</b> <b>hose</b> {{unwrapped}} from the cart, and hung on open hooks along {{the ceiling of the}} aisle.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} {{vacuum breaker}} in the milkhouse cyclically pulled milk from the cart {{into a glass}} jar using system vacuum, followed by a release of vacuum to atmospheric pressure, allowing the milk to flow into the bulk tank by gravity flow. When the float level in the jar dropped to setpoint, system vacuum was reapplied to restart the process. Check valves on the vacuum breaker <b>milk</b> <b>hose</b> prevented milk from flowing backwards to the cart when the jar vacuum was released.|$|E
50|$|The four {{streams of}} milk from the teatcups are usually {{combined}} in the claw and {{transported to the}} milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single <b>milk</b> <b>hose.</b> Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or {{with a combination of}} airflow and mechanical pump to a central storage vat or bulk tank. Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a heat-exchanger or in the bulk tank, or both.|$|E
500|$|The British {{government}} retaliates {{by breaking}} off negotiations, and Burgundy is isolated; the residents {{are invited to}} [...] "emigrate" [...] to England, but few leave. Power, water and deliveries of food are all cut off at the border by the British. Late one night, the Burgundians covertly connect a hose to a nearby British water main, which fills a bomb crater, solving the water problem, but this floods the food store. Unable to overcome this new problem, the Burgundians prepare to give up. Sympathetic Londoners begin to throw food parcels across the barrier, and soon others join in; the Burgundians have an ample supply, and decide to stay. A helicopter pumps <b>milk</b> through a <b>hose</b> and pigs are parachuted into the area.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) for the Cal Poly dairy milk barn, which will help prepare students to be more efficient at milking in the newly renovated milking parlor. A double 10 parallel parlor is {{to be put into}} place to update the current milk barn. The current milking parlor is a double 8 herringbone barn which holds eight cows per side that are positioned at an angle. The double 8 herringbone parlor is to be remodeled into a double 10 parallel parlor. In addition, a double 10 parallel barn has ten cows on each side and are being milked between the hind legs. Information was gathered from the Cal Poly dairy’s herd manager, Rich Silacci, to develop a new SOP poster for the new milking parlor. Proper milking procedures were discussed and a poster was developed. The poster is to be placed in the milk barn near the pit where students are milking. The SOP poster is to be used as an easy way to answer any questions that they may have about proper milking procedures. The poster that was created contains 6 different steps to insure that students are consistent in their milking procedures. The first step in this SOP poster is to Pre-dip. It is important to apply the Pre-dip to the first five cows, cover the whole bottom 2 / 3 of each teat and allow the Pre-dip to sit for 30 seconds. Step number 2 calls for stripping the milk from the teats of the five cows and remove 2 - 3 squirts from each quarter. Step number 3 calls for wiping all five cows teats clean and to use as many towels as needed, but making sure not to transfer dirty towels to the next cow. Step number 4 calls for attaching the milking unit to the five cows and to make sure the <b>milk</b> <b>hose</b> and pulsation hose are parallel with the cows body pointing directly back towards the parlor pit. The <b>milk</b> <b>hose</b> will rest on the hose clamp located on the curb. Step number 5 is when the automatic take-off removes the milking unit when the cow is done being milked. Finally, step number 6 calls for the five cow’s four teats to be post-dipped. In addition, the SOP poster will contain extra information such as attending to liner slips, also known as squawking, as soon as possible to decrease chance of mastitis. In addition, it is important to make sure cows are completely milked out to decrease the chance of mastitis. The use of this SOP poster will aid students in learning how to milk the cows properly and provide for their success in the work place...|$|E
