One of the most important research projects during this period was the SAC Steel joint Venture Project where a large number of moment connections were tested and analyzed and design recommendations were formulated. In this project, almost all specimens had a column with depth of no more than 14 - 16 inches. However, since in many cases of <b>moment</b> <b>frames,</b> the governing design requirement is the stiffness to control the drift, the use of deep columns with a depth of 24, 27 and even 30 inches, becomes very economical. Unfortunately, there is no extensive and reliable information on actual cyclic behavior and design of <b>moment</b> <b>frames</b> with deep columns.

40|$|When a {{structure}} undergoes seismic excitation, the intensities and spatial distributions of the reactive weights {{on the structure}} {{may not be the}} same as those assumed in original design. Such a difference is inevitable due to many facts with the random nature (e. g., redistribution of live load), resulting in accidental eccentricity and consequently torsional response in the system. The added torsion can cause excessive deformation and premature failure of the lateral force resisting system and its detrimental effect is typically accounted for in most building design codes with an arbitrarily specified accidental eccentricity value. While it tends to amplify drift response of buildings under earthquake excitations, it is unclear whether the code specified accidental eccentricity is quantitatively adequate or not in seismic fragility assessment of steel <b>moment</b> <b>frames</b> (including low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise frames) with random reactive weight distributions. This thesis applies surveyed dead and live load intensities and distributions to three representative steel <b>moment</b> resisting <b>frame</b> structures that have been widely investigated in a series of projects under the collaboration of the Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC), the Applied Technology Council (ATC), and Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE), known as SAC.

However, in many cases of <b>moment</b> <b>frames,</b> the governing factor is the frame stiffness, therefore the use of deep columns for Special <b>Moment</b> Resisting <b>Frames</b> (SMRF) becomes economical and attractive to engineers, architects, and owners.

The paper also introduces a new facet of bioinspiration which attempts {{to benefit from}} some of the natural design strategies involved in the structural performance of trees, rather than utilizing them as raw materials. The paper suggests that bioinspiration can help transfer and improve basic design concepts from trees to <b>moment</b> <b>frames</b> under seismic as well as gravity loading scenarios.

In other words, it is preferable for earthquake resistant structures to be designed in accordance with observed rather than expected behavior, i. e., desirable response characteristics should be induced rather than investigated. These features constitute the core of the recently developed performance control (PC) methodology that aims at rational design of engineering structures under both service as well as extreme loading conditions. In the interim a number of new design formulae have also been introduced.

40|$|Steel {{buildings}} in high seismic areas often require special structural systems to transfer large lateral forces induced by earthquake accelerations. The selection of an appropriate seismic steel system (braced frame, <b>moment</b> <b>frame,</b> shear wall, etc.) is often influenced by architectural considerations. <b>Moment</b> <b>frame</b> configurations {{offer the most}} architectural flexibility, but are limited by code prequalification requirements that limit the use of non-orthogonal (skewed) beam-column connection geometries. A recent study has investigated laterally skewed <b>moment</b> <b>frame</b> connections, indicating that skew increases the potential for column twist and column flange yielding; however, {{it is unclear how}} realistic column axial loads will affect the skewed connection performance. This study investigates the effects of column axial loads on skewed special <b>moment</b> <b>frame</b> connections containing reduced beam sections (RBSs). Detailed finite element analyses are used for all investigations, and several beam-column connection configurations are considered, representing: 3 beam-column geometries (shallow, medium and deep columns); 4 levels of skew at the beam-to-column connection; and 4 levels of applied column axial load. Results indicate that combined beam skew, axial load, and applied connection rotations lead to local buckling issues within deep column <b>moment</b> <b>frame</b> configurations; however, increasing beam-skew and axial load has little effect on connection moment capacity prior to column local buckling initiation. Beam-skew angle is the dominate contributor to resulting column twist and increasing column axial load (up to 50 % ΦPn) has a negligible effect on resulting column twist.
