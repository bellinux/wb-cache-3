25|$|In late 2004, {{throughout}} 2005 {{and into}} 2006, iiNet moved to introduce their own DSLAM infrastructure (colloquially known as iiSLAMs or iiDSLAMs in the industry) into telephone exchanges Australia-wide. This move allowed iiNet {{to be the}} first Australian DSL carrier to offer speeds of over 1.5 Mbit/s to a significant number of customers. The <b>maximum</b> <b>download</b> speed was initially 8 Mbit/s (ADSL1), which increased to 12 Mbit/s and later to 24 Mbit/s, as ADSL2/ADSL2+ standards have been ratified and tested with iiNet's equipment.

50|$|At {{the end of}} 1999, Astro's {{operator}} MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems {{announced a}} proposal to provide high-speed satellite-delivered Internet access services. The service, called @stronet-JARING, {{was to be a}} one-way terrestrial return system, whereby Malaysian ISP Jaring would provide the outbound data service through dial-up (and later broadband) access. Downloads would be received via the MEASAT satellite system, which promised a <b>maximum</b> <b>download</b> speed of 6.5Mbit/s. A PC-based trial was performed in early 2000 with a <b>maximum</b> <b>download</b> speed of 400kbit/s. Other proposed services included Multicast File Transfer and Multicast Streaming Delivery.

40|$|Over the air {{download}} is {{an important}} feature for terrestrial digital television systems. It provides a cheaper option for DTV receiver manufacturers to provide bug fixes and quality improvements to their products, allowing a shorter time to the market. This paper presents a mechanism proposal of an over the air download software update for the Brazilian system. This mechanism was specified considering the Brazilian DTV over the air download specifications, but it was extended considering efficiency, reliability and user transparency as requirements for software update. A proof of concept was implemented on a Linux based set-top box. The mechanism is divided into five main functional parts: download schedule, packets download, packets authentication, installation and error robustness. Some analyses were conducted upon the implementation considering the following criteria: <b>download</b> robustness and <b>maximum</b> <b>downloading</b> rate. (1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} distributing k blocks from a source to N nodes in a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network with both node upload and download capacity constraints. As k scales up, we prove for homogeneous networks that if network coding is allowed, randomly matching senders and receivers in each time slot asymptotically achieves the <b>maximum</b> <b>downloading</b> rate at each node. For heterogeneous networks with network coding allowed, we show that a fair and optimal downloading rate at each node can be asymptotically approached, if in each time slot, each node randomly allocates its upload bandwidth to its receivers that have available download bandwidth. We also give a performance lower bound of the above randomized coded dissemination when both k and N scale under certain conditions. These results demonstrate that with network coding, simple randomized receiver selection and rate allocation suffice to achieve P 2 P broadcast capacity, forming a theoretical foundation for mesh-based P 2 P networks with network coding.

40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{growth of}} internet contents, specially social media, invoking {{a challenge to}} the load of cellular networks. In addition, nowadays, the demands of quality of experience (QoE) became a more practical norm in contrast of quality of service (QoS), in which downloading delay is an important factor of it. To satisfy this demand, we propose two resource allocation (RA) algorithms to optimize the place of social media in the cache of the Base stations (BSs) and radio resources (i. e., transmit powers and subcarriers), jointly in a multi-cell Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based system. In the first scheme, the total downloading delay of the network is minimized, while in the second scheme, a fairness-aware scheme is proposed in which the <b>maximum</b> <b>downloading</b> delays is minimized. We propose iterative algorithms to solve each problem, where the content placement problem and the joint subcarrier and transmit power allocation problem will be iteratively optimized. We also prove that the proposed approaches converges to a near-optimal solution, as well as the number of iterations increases. Comment: We decide to upgrade this version to a high quality version with a better structure. We found a problem in the time scale of two separated phases known as caching phase and delivery phase. Therefore, We should not jointly optimize the content placement and radio resource...|$|R

50|$|This works faster {{because the}} rate at which the file servers upload is finite and {{download}} rates are generally faster than upload rates. Therefore, downloading from a single server would create a bottleneck if the server's upload rate does not equal your <b>maximum</b> <b>download</b> rate. So distributing the download across multiple servers allows you to utilize all of your download rate potential.|$|E

40|$|Although {{podcasting}} {{has been}} a well used resource format {{in the last few}} years as a way of improving the student learning experience, the inclusion of enhanced audiovisual formats such as screencasts has been less used, despite the advantage that they work well for both visual and auditory learners. This study examines the use of and student reaction to a set of screencasts introduced to accompany embryology lectures within a second year module at Brighton and Sussex Medical School. Five mini-lecture screencasts and one review quiz screencast were produced as digital recordings of computer screen output with audio narration and released to students via the managed learning environment (MLE). Analysis of server log information from the MLE showed that the screencasts were accessed by many of the students in the cohort, although the exact numbers were variable depending on the screencast. Students accessed screencasts at different times of the day and over the whole of the access period, although <b>maximum</b> <b>downloads</b> were predictably recorded leading up to the written examination. Quantitative and qualitative feedback demonstrated that most students viewed the screencasts favorably in terms of usefulness to their learning, and end-of-module written examination scores suggest that the screencasts may have had a positive effect on student outcome when compared with previous student attainment. Overall, the development of a series of embryology screencasts to accompany embryology lecture sessions appears to be a useful addition to learning for most students and not simply an innovation that checks the box of "technology engagement. ...|$|R

50|$|Data rates, {{including}} those given in this article, are usually defined and advertised {{in terms of}} the <b>maximum</b> or peak <b>download</b> rate. In practice, these maximum data rates are not always reliably available to the customer. Actual end-to-end data rates can be lower due to a number of factors. In late June 2016, internet connection speeds averaged about 6 Mbit/s globally. Physical link quality can vary with distance and for wireless access with terrain, weather, building construction, antenna placement, and interference from other radio sources. Network bottlenecks may exist at points anywhere on the path from the end-user to the remote server or service being used and not just on the first or last link providing Internet access to the end-user.|$|R
