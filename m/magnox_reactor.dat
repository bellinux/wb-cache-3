25|$|The AGR was {{developed}} from the <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor,</b> the UK's first-generation reactor design. The first Magnox reactors had been optimised for generating plutonium, {{and for this reason}} it incorporated a number of features that are not necessarily the best for economic performance. Primary among these requirements was the Magnox's ability to run on natural uranium, which demanded the use of a coolant with a low neutron cross section, in this case CO2, and efficient neutron moderator, graphite. Magnox also ran relatively cool compared to other power-producing designs, which made it less efficient extracting power from the reactor core.|$|E
50|$|The British <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor,</b> a Generation I gas cooled reactor(GCR) design, can rarely {{produce a}} fuel burnup {{of more than}} 2-5 GWd/tU. The <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> design was codenamed PIPPA (Pressurised Pile Producing Power and Plutonium) by the UKAEA to denote the plant's dual commercial(power reactor) and military(production reactor) role.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The UK {{nuclear power}} {{industry}} is predominantly based on gas-cooled, graphite moderated reactors with their being 20 operating and 6 shutdown <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors.</b> The radioactive graphite {{issues associated with}} the <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> relate mainly to the reactor core graphite but, at two of the stations, there is also another graphite waste stream which results from the handling of their particular design of fuel elements which incorporate graphite fittings. The decommissioning plan for the <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> is to apply the Safestore strategy in which the defuelled reactors will be maintained in a quiescent state, e. g. to gain benefit from radioactive decay, with their dismantling being deferred {{for a period of}} time. In preparing for and developing the decommissioning strategy detailed studies have been undertaken on all relevant aspects. These have resulted in, for example, extensive information on the graphite radioactive inventories, the condition of the graphite throughout the quiescent deferral period, safety assessment, and, dismantling, waste management and disposal plans. Significant work has also been undertaken on the management of the graphite fuel element debris that has accumulated at the two stations. For example, work is well advanced at one of the stations to install equipment to retrieve this waste and package it in a form suitable for eventual deep geological disposal. 1...|$|R
25|$|In 1996 the UK's eight most {{advanced}} nuclear plants, seven advanced gas-cooled reactors and one pressurized water reactor, were privatised as British Energy, raising £2.1 billion. The remaining <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> remained in public ownership as Magnox Electric. On 30 January 1998 Magnox Electric was merged into BNFL as BNFL Magnox Generation.|$|R
50|$|The {{graphite}} cores each weigh 3800 tonne LT; 6,156 vertical fuel channels contain over 49,248 {{natural uranium}} magnox-clad fuel elements, {{hence the name}} <b>magnox</b> <b>reactor.</b> A further 200 channels allow boron control rods to enter the reactor and control the nuclear reaction. The primary coolant in the reactors is carbon dioxide gas.|$|E
50|$|All the UK's <b>Magnox</b> <b>Reactor</b> Sites (apart from Calder Hall) are {{operated}} by Magnox Ltd, a Site Licence Company (SLC) of the NDA. Reactor Sites Management Company (RSMC) holds {{the contract to}} manage Magnox Ltd {{on behalf of the}} NDA. In 2007, RSMC was acquired by American nuclear fuel cycle service provider EnergySolutions from British Nuclear Fuels.|$|E
50|$|In January 2007 BNFL {{announced}} that it would sell BNG's <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> sites operating business, Reactor Sites Management Company Ltd. It was later sold in June 2007 along with its subsidiary that held the operating contracts with the NDA, Magnox Electric, to EnergySolutions. All UK Magnox power stations are due cease operation by the end of 2015.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the closure}} of Garrett's, the town's economy has been {{dominated}} by two nuclear power stations on the coast at Sizewell: the now decommissioned <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> of Sizewell A and the more modern Pressurised Water Reactor of Sizewell B. A number of smaller companies operate from industrial areas within the town.|$|R
50|$|Nine UNGG power {{reactors}} {{built in}} France, all now shut down. These were carbon dioxide-cooled, graphite reactors with natural uranium metal fuel, very similar {{in design and}} purpose to the British <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> except that the fuel cladding was magnesium-zirconium alloy and that the bars were disposed horizontally (instead of vertically for Magnox).|$|R
50|$|Opened in 1967, it had two <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> {{producing}} 424 megawatts (MWe) {{in total}} - enough electricity {{on a typical}} day to serve an urban area {{twice the size of}} Bristol. Reactor 1 went critical on 18 September 1967 and first generated electricity on 9 November 1967, Reactor 2 started generating electricity in April 1968.|$|R
50|$|The graphite-moderated, gas-cooled {{design was}} proven at the WAGR - the Windscale {{experimental}} AGR facility {{and is a}} significant evolution of the <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> designs.The entire UK commercial reactor programme shares a common heritage with, and was built on operating experience gained from the early PIPPA reactors at Calder Hall and Chapelcross and prior to that, the Windscale piles.|$|E
50|$|BNG's US subsidiary, BNG America, its <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> business, Reactor Sites Management Company, its {{consultancy}} business, BNG Project Services and its {{one third}} share in Atomic Weapons Establishment management company, AWE Management Ltd were all sold. The remaining business of BNG {{was responsible for}} the decommissioning work at Sellafield. This was renamed Sellafield Ltd and ownership was passed to the NDA.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, {{the older}} <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> - Hunterston A was {{transferred}} to Magnox Electric - established to own and operate a proportion of the old Magnox nuclear stations of Nuclear Electric. The assets of Magnox Electric were later combined with BNFL in 1998, and eventually operated and managed by US based EnergySolutions through its June 2007 acquisition of the BFNL subsidiary - Reactor Sites Management Company.|$|E
50|$|In all, 11 power {{stations}} totalling 26 units {{were built in}} the United Kingdom where the design originated. In addition, one was exported to Tōkai in Japan and another to Latina in Italy. North Korea also developed their own <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors,</b> based on the UK design which was made public at an Atoms for Peace conference.|$|R
50|$|Over its lifetime, the B205 {{plant has}} handled over 35,000 tons of {{expended}} Magnox fuel, and returned over 15,000 tons of uranium to the fuel cycle. Now that the <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> have been retired from use, the final fuels are being processed, and the B205 plant {{is slated for}} decommissioning around 2020 after all fuel has been reprocessed.|$|R
50|$|The power station, {{which is}} {{currently}} being decommissioned, had two <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors,</b> each supplying steam to three English Electric 93.5 MWe turbine generator sets which were all together across both reactors designed to produce 500 MWe net but, after de-rating of the reactor power output due to corrosion concerns, both reactors combined produced 470 MWe net.|$|R
50|$|Magnox {{spent fuel}} is not {{designed}} for long-term storage as both the casing and uranium metal core react with water; {{it is designed to}} be reprocessed within a few years of removal from a reactor. As a carbon dioxide cooled, graphite moderated <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> does not require difficult-to-produce enriched uranium fuel or heavy water moderator it is an attractive choice for a wholly indigenous nuclear reactor development.|$|E
50|$|The Hinkley Point Site is {{currently}} organized as two nuclear power stations: Next to Hinkley Point A with its two <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> buildings there is Hinkley Point B, operated by EDF Energy, with two AGCR reactors in one building.In October 2013, the UK government {{announced that it}} had approved the construction of Hinkley Point C. This new plant, consisting of two EPR units, {{is scheduled to be}} completed in 2023 and remain operational for around 60 years.|$|E
5000|$|The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) {{announced}} on December 30, 2015 that Wylfa Unit 1 - the world's last operating <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> - was closed. The unit had generated electricity {{for five years}} longer than originally planned. Two units at Wylfa were both scheduled to shut {{down at the end}} of 2012, but the NDA decided to shut down Unit 2 in April 2012 so that Unit 1 could continue operating in order to fully utilize existing stocks of fuel, which is no longer being manufactured.|$|E
50|$|The Sizewell {{nuclear power}} {{stations}} are two nuclear power stations {{located near the}} small fishing village of Sizewell in Suffolk, England. Sizewell A, with two <b>magnox</b> <b>reactors,</b> {{is now in the}} process of being decommissioned, while Sizewell B has a single pressurised water reactor and is the UK's newest nuclear power station. A third power station is planned.|$|R
50|$|The {{splitting}} process {{created a}} separate company in 1996 called 'Magnox Electric' - which would hold {{a proportion of}} the old CEGB's nuclear stations, its older <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors.</b> The assets of Magnox Electric were later combined with BNFL in 1998, and eventually operated and managed by US based EnergySolutions through its June 2007 acquisition of the BNFL subsidiary - Reactor Sites Management Company.|$|R
50|$|The main plant {{consisted}} of two 1,010 MW (thermal) <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors,</b> which were natural uranium, carbon dioxide gas cooled, graphite moderated units. These supplied heat to eight boiler units, four associated with each reactor. The steam produced by the boilers was fed to two turbo-generators each rated at 325 MW, but which operated at a reduced capacity of 250 MW from 1969.|$|R
50|$|The AGR was {{developed}} from the <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor,</b> the UK's first-generation reactor design. Magnox had been designed with the secondary purpose of generating plutonium, {{and for this reason}} it incorporated a number of features that are not necessarily the best for economic performance. Primary among these requirements was the Magnox's ability to run on natural uranium, which demanded the use of a coolant with a low neutron cross section, in this case CO2. Magnox also ran relatively cool compared to other power-producing designs, which made it less efficient extracting power from the reactor core.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the older}} steel {{pressure}} vessel design, boilers and gas ducting {{are outside the}} concrete biological shield. Consequently, this design emits {{a significant amount of}} direct gamma and neutron radiation, termed direct [...] "shine", from the reactors. For example, the most exposed members of the public living near Dungeness <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> in 2002 received 0.56 mSv, over half the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommended maximum radiation dose limit for the public, from direct [...] "shine" [...] alone. The doses from the Oldbury and Wylfa reactors, which have concrete pressure vessels which encapsulate the complete gas circuit, are much lower.|$|E
5000|$|In total, only a {{few dozen}} {{reactors}} of this type were constructed, {{most of them in}} the United Kingdom from the 1950s to the 1970s, with very few exported to other countries. The first <b>magnox</b> <b>reactor</b> to come online was Calder Hall (at the Sellafield site) in 1956, frequently regarded as the [...] "first commercial-scale electricity producing reactor in the world", while the last in Britain to shut down was Reactor 1 in Wylfa (on Ynys Môn) in 2015. North Korea remains the only operator to continue using Magnox style reactors as of 2016, at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. The Magnox design was superseeded by the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor, which is similarily cooled but includes a number of changes to improve its economic performance.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{the power}} station, which was {{undertaken}} by a consortium of GEC and Simon Carves, began in 1957 and the facility was opened by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother on 22 September 1964. Hunterston A had two <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> capable of generating 180 MWe each. The reactors were supplied by GEC and the turbines by C.A. Parsons & Company. The main civil engineering contractor was Mowlem.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear {{graphite}} for the UK <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors</b> was manufactured from {{petroleum coke}} mixed with coal-based binder pitch heated and extruded into billets, and then baked at 1,000 °C for several days. To reduce porosity and increase density, the billets were impregnated with coal tar at high temperature and pressure before a final bake at 2,800 °C. Individual billets were then machined {{into the final}} required shapes.|$|R
50|$|The {{plutonium}} {{sent to the}} US {{included some}} produced in UK civil <b>Magnox</b> <b>reactors,</b> and the US gave assurances that this civil plutonium was not used in the US nuclear weapons program. It was used in civil programmes which included californium production and reactor research. However, the UK did obtain military nuclear material in return, so via this barter UK civil power stations probably provided weapons material.|$|R
