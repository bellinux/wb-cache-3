The research methodology is post-survey and research attitude is post-structural; since it reveals social realities.

With one year left we have to make the middle-term- review over our research activities, standing on the bridge connecting between both research groups.

40|$|The <b>deteriorated</b> urban <b>areas</b> are the {{problems}} that cannot be ignored in the contemporary cities. These textures confront various problems and {{not paying attention to}} these fabrics will result in the lost of live in them. These problems can be mentioned in brief as follows: inconsistency with urban structure, high population density, decreased physical/social/economic and environmental quality, etc. The problems of the <b>deteriorated</b> <b>areas</b> are mostly multi-aspect. Therefore solving these problems needs various programs and measures each of which focuses on a particular aspect. According to experiences, the one-aspect approach to urban fabric is not much useful. Therefore interfering in these textures should be made in all physical, social and economic aspects. What is of the most importance in the preparation of the projects for these areas, is the deep, extended, and multidimensional studies before starting the planning phase. On the other hand, the topic that has been considered as a principle in these projects is the people’s participation...|$|R

5000|$|Price {{ceilings}} {{can create}} shortages and reduce quality {{when they are}} less than the equilibrium price. By capping the price of housing, rent control can increase demand and reduce available supply, causing a shortage. [...] It is argued that rent control also reduces the quality of available housing, deters investment, and raises rents on tenants who are excluded from its protections (for example, in jurisdictions with vacancy decontrol, tenants who move or arrive later). When property owners are restricted in the rents they charge, they are less willing to construct more housing (a form of capital strike). Since supply is low, landlords worry less about tenants leaving and {{have little incentive to}} maintain the property. For example, unless owners can reasonably expect that punitive action will be taken against them, they might let building <b>maintenance</b> <b>deteriorate</b> in order to mitigate the lower rental income. People moving into the city have difficulty finding housing because of the shortage created by rent control.|$|R

40|$|The work {{presents}} the results of an in-situ experience performed using combined non-destructive testing techniques to support the restoration plan for the vaults of a Neoclassical church in Turin. During the restoration work at the Church of San Massimo, it was necessary to evaluate the areas of plaster which had become detached from the spandrels of the dome's frescoed surfaces. The investigations were carried out with the complementary use of qualitative and quantitative infrared thermography with remote visual inspection. First of all, we evaluated the heating system best suited to the geometry of the object and its colour finish using IR qualitative thermography, than we carried out a thermographic analysis in active conditions (QIRT) with the application of an experimental procedure. The Thermal Inertia study of a number of sample zones chosen on the surface and compared with a reference area (sound area according to the knocking-test) enabled us to recognize <b>deteriorated</b> <b>areas</b> without contact with the paintings. The comparison of these results to the outcome of the qualitative IR testing allowed us to extend the indications obtained from the examination of individual areas to entire regions without, however, gaining information on the type of plaster detachment. The results obtained from the IR investigations enabled us to focus the visual inspections on the <b>deteriorated</b> <b>areas.</b> The indirect visual analysis was carried out within existing cavities made in the past to inject consolidation material, cracks in the wall and small holes made specifically. The combined use of the two techniques allowed the assessment of the state of deterioration in the detached areas and also allowed us to highlight areas requiring urgent conservation action...|$|R

Before any policy reform, it is vital to investigate landowners’ tendency for adoption. In this study we were particularly interested in examining the tendency for adoption if the soil quality implies a high leaching risk or water quality is already poor. For this purpose, survey data were combined with GIS data. Furthermore the aim was to analyse the effect of farm and farmer characteristics and attitudes on adoption. The findings derived by probit models indicated that, for active farmers, financial variables were the key determinants. For passive owners, adoption was also explained by attitudes.
