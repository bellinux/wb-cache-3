Delegates remembered him {{for his role in}} the Tariff of 1842, and he had been mentioned as a vice presidential possibility along with Lawrence and Ohio's Thomas Ewing. His rivalry with Seward (already known for anti-slavery views and statements) made him more acceptable in the South.|$|E

500|$|The girdle's {{symbolic}} meaning, in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, {{has been}} construed {{in a variety}} of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a [...] "trophy". However, it is not entirely clear who the [...] "winner" [...] is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain’s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In Sir Gawain, the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one’s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either–or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in <b>more</b> <b>ways</b> <b>than</b> <b>one.</b> [...] While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak’s wife’s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of Sir Gawain, Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of superconductivity in alkali-ammonia co-intercalated FeSe has generated intensive interest {{because of their}} highest Tc (45 K) among iron-chalcogenide superconductors with bulk form. Here, we report the phase diagrams of two series of Li/Na-ammonia co-intercalated FeSe 1 -zTez. When superconductivity is suppressed by Te doping, the magnetic ordering states are emergent. Moreover, a novel phase Lix(NH 3) yFe 2 -δTe 2 with possible antiferromagnetism is discovered. This strongly indicates the intimate relation between superconductivity and magnetism in these materials, like in other iron-based superconductors. On the other hand, comparative structure analysis with FeSe 1 -zTez suggests that although there is remarkable similarity in phase diagrams for both iron-chalcogenide and iron-pnictide superconductors, {{the different types of}} anions with different charges lead to the dissimilar controlling factors in superconductivity for both classes of materials.

5000|$|Parallel to {{printing}} {{efforts by}} the Protestant missionaries at Tranquebar or Tarangampãdi, {{the growth of the}} Jesuit missionary Constanzo Beschi (Viramãmunivar; Constantine Joseph Beschi 1680-1747) was equally significant in revolutionizing the face of Tamil print and literature. The difference in the Christian beliefs of the respective cults gave rise to rigorous disputes and theological debates, which on many occasions even led to violent conflicts resulting in injuries and death. These disputes were carried on by the Lutherans through “printed books and pamphlets", whereas Beschi (due to lack of a Jesuit-owned printing press) mainly concentrated on writing influential pieces of literature. Although printing in Tamil was introduced by the Jesuits, by the eighteenth century the scenario had changed and the domain of the press came to be majority controlled and cultivated by the Protestants. Beschi's efforts in a place populated with thousands of Lutheran converts (mainly Tanjore and Travancore), grew to become an “alarming”, “arrogant” and “formidable” rival to the already sprawling missionary activities of the Protestant fathers. One particular reason for Beschi’s popularity was, as Blackburn observes, his “Romanish compromises with local customs”. In the books of Muttusami Pillai( [...] Beschi’s Tamil biographer), he is frequently portrayed as a traditional Eastern or Oriental king, adorned with ornate jewellery and chandan on his forehead. Beschi was reportedly favoured by the local rulers, especially Chanda Sahib whom he had served diwan to, thereby making it easier for him to master the language.
