40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the radiation dose in the thyroid attributable to different <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and {{to estimate the}} thyroid cancer risk in pediatric patients. Methods: The information about pediatric patients who underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was abstracted from the radiology information system in one general hospital between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012. The radiation doses were calculated using the ImPACT Patient Dosimetry Calculator and the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of thyroid cancer incidence was estimated based on the National Academies Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII model. Results: The subjects comprised 922 children, 68 % were males, and received 971 <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The range of typical radiation dose to the thyroid {{was estimated to be}} 0. 61 – 0. 92 mGy for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 1. 10 – 2. 45 mGy for head <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> and 2. 63 – 5. 76 mGy for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The LAR of thyroid cancer were as follows: for head CT, 1. 1 per 100, 000 for boys and 8. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 0. 4 per 100, 000 for boys and 2. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 2. 2 per 100, 000 for boys and 14. 2 per 100, 000 for girls. The risk of thyroid cancer was substantially higher for girls than for the boys, and from chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was higher than that from head or paransal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Conclusions: Chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> caused higher thyroid dose and the LAR of thyroid cancer incidence, compared with paransal sinus or head <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to protect the thyroid when children underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> especially chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans...</b>|$|R

METHODS: Pediatric head trauma cases were retrospectively retrieved from the hospital’s electronic database. Patients’ charts, <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and surgical notes were evaluated by one of the authors. Repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> for operated patients were excluded from the total number of repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and thirty-eight pediatric patients were admitted to the clinic due to head traumas. Brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was requested in 863 patients (76 %) in the cohort. Follow-up brain <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were obtained in 102 patients.

METHODS: The Echography in Spondylarthritis French cohort consists of 489 patients with suspected SpA. At baseline, all patients underwent clinical examination, HLA-B typing, and pelvic radiography. Pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> was performed if sacroiliitis on radiography was considered uncertain or if patients presented with buttock pain duration of > 6 months. A set of 100 paired radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was read in a blinded manner by 2 radiologists, and the kappa coefficient {{was used to assess}} their interreader reliability. One of the radiologists read the 173 available pairs of radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> performed at baseline. RESULTS: After training, interreader reliability was moderate for sacroiliitis grading on radiographs (κ = 0. 59), excellent on <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 91), and excellent for ascertaining sacroiliitis on both radiographs (κ = 1) and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 96). The first and second readers considered the quality of imaging to be excellent in 66 % and 67 %, respectively, of the radiographs (κ = 0. 88) and in 93 % and 92 %, respectively, of the <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (κ = 0. 93). Concordance between radiographs and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was low for sacroiliitis grading (κ = 0. 08) or ascertainment (κ = 0. 16). Definite sacroiliitis was ascertained on radiographs in 6 patients (3. 5 %) (confirmed by <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in 4 patients) and on <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in 32 patients (18. 5 %). A history of uveitis was associated with definite sacroiliitis on radiographs (P = 0. 04) and <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> (P < 0. 0001).

However, preoperative and intraoperative <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> have not been merged {{for the purposes of}} transferring a plan. If spine surgeons can create the optimal surgical pathway before surgery and then merge the pre-planned pathway onto the real patient <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in the operating room, the result will be efficiency and better time management for the spine surgeon. Our objective was to analyze the feasibility of merging computed tomography (CT) preplanned with sacroiliac fusion iliosacral screw trajectories with the original <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Methods: Twenty-seven patients were identified from the institutional Faculty Group Practice who had undergone <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in the pelvic region. The pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were transferred to Medtronic’s StealthStation®, which allowed for analysis in coronal, sagittal, and axial sections. Three trajectories were mapped out, representing three working pathways for fixation. The position of the trajectories was localized by measuring their distance from anatomic landmarks. The <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> with the planned trajectories was merged with the original <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> The same measurements made pre-merge were performed post-merge to check for the accuracy of the merging process. Results: Post-merge measurements were nearly identical to pre-merge measurements, with a maximum difference of ± 0. 1 mm. No significant differences existed between pre-merge and post-merge measurements for any of the trajectories Conclusion: The merging of preplanned trajectory <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> with intraoperative <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> is a highly accurate technique...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate whether surgeons can predict the usefulness of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> to facilitate choice of treatment plan and/or pre-operative planning for DRF. Four surgeons evaluated 51 patients with displaced DRF. The choice of treatment (operative or nonoperative) was based on conventional radiographs. Subsequently, the surgeons were asked whether they would have requested an additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> to determine this treatment choice, and also whether they required a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for pre-operative planning. After 4  weeks, the additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was provided and the cases were assessed again. Based on these data, we calculated the number needed to scan (NNS) and number needed to harm (NNH) for two decision models. Model 1 : Only provide a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> if the surgeon requested one based on their judgment of the X-rays. Model 2 : <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> for all displaced intra-articular DRF. For choice of treatment, the NNS was lower for model 1 than for model 2 (2.6 vs. 4.3) and the NNH is higher for model 1 (3.1 vs. 1.3). For pre-operative planning, the NNS (1.3 vs. 1.4) and NNH (3.7 vs. 3.4) were comparable for both models.

METHODS: We used an observational epidemiological study based in a teaching hospital. Data were obtained on numbers and rates of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> from 2009 to 2015. The main outcome was age-stratified rates of receiving a <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> RESULTS: There were a total of 262, 221 <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> There was a large step change in the rate of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> over the period of transition from paediatric to adult medical care. Individuals aged 10 - 15 years experienced 6. 7 <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> per 1000 clinical episodes, while those aged 19 - 24 years experienced 19. 8 <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> per 1000 clinical episodes (p< 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: {{lower lobe}} lung tumors move with amplitudes {{of up to}} 2 cm due to {{respiration}}. To reduce respiration imaging artifacts in planning <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 4 D imaging techniques are used. Currently, we use a single (midventilation) frame of the 4 D data set for clinical delineation of structures and radiotherapy planning. A single frame, however, often contains artifacts due to breathing irregularities, and is noisier than a conventional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> since the exposure per frame is lower. Moreover, the tumor may be displaced from the mean tumor position due to hysteresis. The aim of this work {{is to develop a}} framework for the acquisition of a good quality scan representing all scanned anatomy in the mean position by averaging transformed (deformed) CT frames, i. e., canceling out motion. A nonrigid registration method is necessary since motion varies over the lung. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 4 D and inspiration breath-hold (BH) <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were acquired for 13 patients. An iterative multiscale motion estimation technique was applied to the 4 D <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> similar to optical flow but using image phase (gray-value transitions from bright to dark and vice versa) instead. From the (4 D) deformation vector field (DVF) derived, the local mean position in the respiratory cycle was computed and the 4 D DVF was modified to deform all structures of the original 4 D <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> to this mean position. A 3 D midposition (MidP) <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was then obtained by (arithmetic or median) averaging of the deformed 4 D <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Image registration accuracy, tumor shape deviation with respect to the BH <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> and noise were determined to evaluate the image fidelity of the MidP <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and the performance of the technique. RESULTS: Accuracy of the used deformable image registration method was comparable to established automated locally rigid registration and to manual landmark registration (average difference to both methods < 0. 5 mm for all directions) for the tumor region. From visual assessment, the registration was good for the clearly visible features (e. g., tumor and diaphragm). The shape of the tumor, with respect to that of the BH <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> was better represented by the MidP reconstructions than any of the 4 D CT frames (including MidV; reduction of "shape differences" was 66 %). The MidP scans contained about one-third the noise of individual 4 D <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> frames. CONCLUSIONS: We implemented an accurate method to estimate the motion of structures in a 4 D <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> Subsequently, a novel method to create a midposition <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> (time-weighted average of the anatomy) for treatment planning with reduced noise and artifacts was introduced.

[44] found a 96  % correlation between 3 D <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> measurements and arthroscopic evaluation. They concluded that <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> utilization is an effective preoperative tool.|$|R
