To make it more acceptable, Qabbani showed it to Munir al-Ajlani, the minister of education {{who was also a}} friend of his father and a leading nationalist leader in Syria. Ajlani liked the poems and endorsed them by writing the preface for Nizar's first book.|$|E

500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as {{you have been a}} father, a benefactor and a friend for <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you." [...] In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth {{was the only one of}} Verdi's operas of his [...] "early period" [...] to remain regularly in the international repertoire, although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists.|$|E
500|$|David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson {{both had}} other {{commitments}} {{as the season}} began, resulting in the producers delaying filming for this episode. It ended up being filmed third in the season, after the episodes [...] "Hungry" [...] and [...] "The Goldberg Variation". Carter wrote the episode {{at the same time}} as Duchovny was working on the next episode, [...] "". Kim Manners said preparations were confusing since it wasn't known at the time how the storyline would unfold. Spotnitz said of the end result, [...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot like a fifties monster movie with Scully out on the beach with this guy going nuts with a machete, the bug attacks, and the sea of blood. Yeah, it was supposed to be serious business but, overall, I thought it was shaping up as a pretty entertaining hour." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving {{school at}} 16, {{he decided to}} be a painter and began {{training}} in commercial illustration at Saint Martin's School of Art. While attending a rehearsal for a workshop at the Oval House, a fire eater was teaching people how to eat fire {{and he decided to}} join. A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting found <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that I had, and acting was something I was good at, something which was appreciated. That was a great satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] was {{recorded}} at The Hit Factory studios, New York, and was mastered and mixed at Sterling Sound Studios, New York. Babyface recalled {{that he was}} nervous about recording with Madonna, since he feared that Madonna was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] in the studio, and that would ultimately be time consuming for the whole process. However, {{it was one of}} the fastest recording and mixing. The song was backed by a full orchestra and was also the first time that Babyface had worked with live strings. He recalled that using strings in the song was [...] " [...] suggestion, and it was Nellee Hooper who actually [...] She had worked with them before but for <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> new experience". Along with Hooper, Jessie Leavey, Craig Armstrong and Susie Katiyama also worked on the strings and conducting.|$|E
500|$|Rob Bowman used {{a couple}} of {{specific}} camera techniques for the scenes on board the Stargazer during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, {{and each of the}} Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. For <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> real creative stretch and it felt great for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E
500|$|... "Hand in Glove" [...] was {{released}} as the Smiths' debut recording in May 1983. The single sold consistently {{for the next}} 18 months. Although the single failed to reach the UK Singles Chart, it reached number three on the UK Indie Chart. Its relative success earned the group a listing in the Guinness Book of Records in January 1984 when it and the group's next two singles' [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and [...] "What Difference Does It Make?"' held the top three position on the UK Indie Chart. [...] "It {{should have been a}} massive hit", Morrissey later said, [...] "it was so urgent. To <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> complete cry in every direction. It really was a landmark." [...] The single did raise the band's profile; a week after its release the band gained its first major live reviews in the music press, which in turn led to their first radio session with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel.|$|E

500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennonâ€“McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that {{no one seems to}} get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
500|$|In July 1945, {{after the}} Red Cross {{confirmed}} {{the deaths of}} the Frank sisters, Miep Gies gave Otto Frank the diary and a bundle of loose notes that she had saved in the hope of returning them to Anne. Otto Frank later commented that he had not realized Anne had kept such an accurate and well-written record of their time in hiding. In his memoir, he described the painful process of reading the diary, recognizing the events described and recalling that he had already heard some of the more amusing episodes read aloud by his daughter. He saw {{for the first time the}} more private side of his daughter and those sections of the diary she had not discussed with anyone, noting, [...] "For <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> revelation... I had no idea of the depth of her thoughts and feelings... She had kept all these feelings to herself". Moved by her repeated wish to be an author, he began to consider having it published.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrison's live shows. [...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where I was brought up and it was a very [...] different scene. [...] To <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very mystical place. [...] It was a whole avenue lined with trees and I found it a place where I could think." ...|$|E

500|$|The story also {{deals with}} Alison Bechdel's own {{struggle}} with her sexual identity, reaching a catharsis in {{the realization that}} she is a lesbian and her coming out to her parents. The memoir frankly examines her sexual development, including transcripts from her childhood diary, anecdotes about masturbation, and tales of her first sexual experiences with her girlfriend, Joan. In addition to their common homosexuality, Alison and Bruce Bechdel share obsessive-compulsive tendencies and artistic leanings, albeit with opposing aesthetic senses: [...] "I was Spartan to my father's Athenian. Modern to his Victorian. Butch to his nelly. Utilitarian to his aesthete." [...] This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given gender roles: [...] "Not only were we inverts, we were inversions of each other. While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine through <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation." [...] However, shortly before Bruce Bechdel's death, he and his daughter have a conversation in which Bruce confesses some of his sexual history; this is presented as a partial resolution to the conflict between father and daughter.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Mercury had a {{long-term}} relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, the singer had begun {{an affair with a}} male American record executive at Elektra Records and, in December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, into 12 Stafford Terrace in Kensington and bought Austin a place of her own nearby. They remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, [...] "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary , but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me." [...] He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is [...] "Love of My Life". Mercury's final home, Garden Lodge, 1 Logan Place, a twenty-eight room Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, had been picked out by Austin. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, rather than his partner Jim Hutton, saying to her, [...] "You would have been my wife {{and it would have been}} yours anyway." [...] Mercury was also the godfather of Austin's oldest son, Richard.|$|E
500|$|With Fox not reprising her role, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley {{was chosen}} to play Sam's new love interest. RamÃ³n RodrÃ­guez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience working on that one because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E

500|$|Entering the 2005â€“06 season, Horton {{stated in}} {{response}} to a question about his shoulders, [...] "I feel better. I feel stronger, bigger." [...] In the season opener against the Atlanta Thrashers, Horton scored the first goal for the Panthers. Through the first games of the season, Horton was tied for the team lead in goals. On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a pretty nice feeling. I felt like there was no one on me. I just tried to get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out to <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|E
2500|$|R. Lee Ermey, {{an actor}} in Kubrick's film Full Metal Jacket, claimed that Kubrick phoned him two weeks before his death to express his despondency over Eyes Wide Shut. [...] "He told <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> piece of shit", Ermey said in Radar magazine, [...] "and that he was disgusted with it and that the critics were going to 'have him for lunch'. He said Cruise and Kidman had their way with him â€“ exactly the words he used." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd {{played the}} role of Johnny Appleseed in Everywhere I Roam (1938â€“39), a play by Arnold Sundgaard that was {{developed}} by the Federal Theatre Project and staged on Broadway by Marc Connelly.

[...] "For <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> success; in those days, before the Tony Awards, the critics' Ten Best Performers list {{at the end of the}} year was the greatest recognition.
