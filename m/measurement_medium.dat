The absolute, relative measurements and measurement indices moreover correlations between age, live weight and measurements were evaluated and compared for the mentioned breeds. Animals in study were born between 1989 and 2002, kept on the same condition on peat-bog soil pasture at Keszthely. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) were found among breeds {{in most of the}} body measurements. Blonde d’ Aquitaine was the heaviest in live weight (638 kg), highest as for the height at withers (142. 5 cm), height at rump (146. 6 cm) and length of the body (151. 5 cm). Limousin had longest measurements as for the length of the rump (47. 4 cm) and width of the rump (58. 3 cm). Shaver had the longest width between shoulders (52. 9 cm) and width of the head (25. 1 cm) while Lincoln Red the longest length of the head (52. 8 cm). The correlations between live weight and <b>measurements</b> were <b>medium</b> or strong positive (r = 0. 40 – 0. 83), between age and measurements slight positive (r = 0. 01 – 0. 46), among the different <b>measurements</b> <b>medium</b> or strong positive (r = 0. 22 – 0. 81) ...|$|R

With the recent availability of low cost overmolded plastic LDMOS RF power amplifier transistors, such as the Freescale family of MRF 6 VXXXXN devices, it is possible to design and build a low cost, compact, broadband power amplifier offering simplicity and reliability. In this article, an RF power amplifier using the low cost OMP Freescale MRF 6 V 2300 N LDMOS transistor is presented (photo in Figure 1). It operates at Vdd = 50 VDC with an average drain efficiency in excess of 60 % and a gain of 24 dB with a 1 dB gain flatness over the 88 MHz to 108 MHz band. No tuning is required as the amplifier is broadband.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} an inverse method is {{developed}} {{to determine the}} heat flux distribution on a moving plane wall. The method uses {{a thin layer of}} material (the <b>measurement</b> <b>medium)</b> glued on the conveyor belt. The heat flux distribution on the moving wall is then determined by an inverse method based on the temperature measurement by infrared thermography on the upper surface of the <b>measurement</b> <b>medium.</b> A finite element based inverse algorithm of a steady state heat conduction advection in the Eulerian frame is performed. The algorithm entails the use of the Tikhonov regularization method, along with the L-curve method to select an optimal regularization parameter. Both the direct solution of moving boundary problem and the inverse design formulation are presented. The accuracy of the inverse method is examined by simulating the exact and noisy data with four different values of the surface-to-jet velocity ratio, and two different materials (PVC and Aluminum) for the <b>measurement</b> <b>medium.</b> The results show a greater sensitivity to the convective heat flux allowing a better estimation of heat flux distribution for the PVC layer. An alternative underdetermined inverse scheme is also studied. This configuration allows a different extend between the retrieval heat flux surface and the measurement temperature surface.

30|$|In {{view of the}} {{accuracy}} requirement for stiffness measurement, the track stiffness measurement can be categorized based on three grades, namely low accuracy (10  kN/mm, substructure disease identification, for heavy haul railways mainly), medium accuracy (1  kN/mm, potential safety hazard checking), and high accuracy (0.1  kN/mm, evaluation of track regularity, for high-speed railways mainly). For example, for continuous measurement vehicle with low measurement accuracy, single-axle vehicle can be used. The axle load should be more than 150  kN to ensure the vertical measurement for subgrade, and one span length (sleeper pitch) along the railway line can be the measurement unit. For the continuous <b>measurement</b> with <b>medium</b> <b>measurement</b> accuracy, it is advised to use double-axle vehicle with axle loads of 20 and 100  kN, the vertical measurement range {{is limited to the}} track structure, and the measurement unit ranges from 1 to 4 span lengths. For continuous measurement vehicle with high measurement accuracy, it is advised to use double-axle vehicle with axle loads of 10 and 50  kN, the vertical measurement range is limited to the rail and fasteners, and 4 – 10 span lengths can be adopted as the measurement unit.|$|R
