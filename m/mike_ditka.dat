5|$|The Chicago Bears honored Payton's {{career and}} life on November 1, 2009 by airing a special tribute video during halftime. The video {{consisted}} of highlight clips from Payton's career and interview segments from <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka,</b> Virginia McCaskey, Richard Dent, {{and many other}} members of the Bears organization. Payton's wife, daughter, son, and mother were present to watch the video, which aired on Soldier Field's Jumbotron.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the third}} Super Bowl to have two players rush for more than 100 yards as Dominic Rhodes had 113 for the Colts and Thomas Jones had 112 for the Bears. Tony Dungy is the third man to win the Super Bowl {{as a head coach}} as well as a player, {{following}} Tom Flores and <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Saints quarterback Billy Joe Hobert {{was lost}} for {{the season with a}} {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon, the Saints signed Tolliver to a two-year deal. After four starts by Danny Wuerffel, Saints coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> gave Tolliver the start against the Atlanta Falcons. After starting for four weeks and having a few impressive performances, Tolliver was benched in favor of Kerry Collins, who finished the season as starting quarterback. Tolliver finished the year with one of his most statistically impressive seasons, completing 110 of 199 passes for 1,427 yards, eight touchdowns, four interceptions, and finishing with a QB rating of 83.1.|$|E
25|$|This was <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> last playoff win as Bears head coach.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2008, ESPN ran {{a segment}} {{featuring}} Bill Swerski discussing <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> real-life possible {{run for a}} U.S. Senate seat in 2004, against Barack Obama. (Ditka decided not to run, and Obama ended up winning the seat.) ...|$|R
50|$|The 1999 New Orleans Saints {{season was}} the Saints' thirty-third NFL season. This was <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> {{third and final}} season as the Saints' head coach, as he was fired, along with his entire {{coaching}} staff and general manager Bill Kuharich, {{three days after the}} conclusion of the season.|$|R
5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever draft choice of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka,</b> coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option. In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka,</b> where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{struggled}} to assemble consecutive winning seasons, landing only two playoff berths since his arrival. The {{lack of success}} prompted the Bears' management to replace Neill Armstrong with <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> for the season {{that began in the}} Fall of 1982. Ditka, a tight end during the 1960s and 1970s who would also join the Pro Football Hall of Fame, led the Bears to a 3–6 (strike-shortened) record in 1982. He led the Bears to an 8–8 finish in 1983 and to a 10–6 finish in 1984. Payton continued his success by rushing for more than 1,400 yards in both seasons. On October 7, 1984 against the New Orleans Saints, Payton broke Jim Brown's career rushing record of 12,312 yards. In 1985, Payton rushed for more than 1,500 yards, helping the Bears establish the league's second-best offense with the emergence of quarterback Jim McMahon. The Bears' 46 defense of that season would go on {{to become one of the}} best in NFL history, setting a record for fewest points allowed. In one 1984 game, Payton was pressed into service as the team's fourth-string quarterback.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, he {{recorded}} the most touchdowns by a Bears tight end (6) since <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> finished with 8 in 1963. The following season, {{he was placed}} on the injured reserve list with a broken left leg, after the sixth game of the season. He was waived injured on December 10, 1997.|$|R
50|$|Still smarting {{from their}} poor {{performance}} at Buffalo, the Niners {{traveled to the}} Superdome and crushed <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> Saints 31-0. The game was another penalty-laden affair with a combined 24 fouls eating up 240 yards. The Niners shut down Danny Wuerffel and Billy Joe Tolliver, limiting them to 15 completions for 174 yards and a pick.|$|R
50|$|The Bears {{have retired}} 14 uniform numbers, {{which is the}} most in the NFL, and ranks fourth behind the {{basketball}} Boston Celtics (21), baseball New York Yankees (21), and hockey Montreal Canadiens (15) for the most in North American professional sports. The Bears retired <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> number 89 jersey on December 9, 2013. It is the last number that the Bears retired.|$|R
5|$|On December 27, Brandon Marshall and Matt Forte {{were named}} to the 2014 Pro Bowl, the fewest number of Bears sent since 2009, when two were also sent, {{and the first time}} a Bears {{defensive}} player was not invited since 2004. On January 14, 2014, Marshall and Forte were {{named to the}} Pro Football Writers Association's All-NFC Team. On January 3, 2014, the Associated Press released its annual All-Pro team, with no Bears named. On January 9, 2014, Alshon Jeffery was named to the Pro Bowl after an injury to Calvin Johnson. Jeffery was later named the PFWA's Most Improved Player on January 17. On January 20, Tim Jennings and Kyle Long were named to the Pro Bowl, replacing Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks, who advanced to Super Bowl XLVIII and Mike Iupati suffered an injury, respectively. Long's invitation marked the first time a Bears rookie was invited since special teamer Johnny Knox in 2009, and the first offensive rookie since Gale Sayers in 1965. The four offensive Pro Bowlers are the most sent by the Bears since 1985, when Jim McMahon, Walter Payton, Jay Hilgenberg and Jim Covert were invited to the game. Forte, Marshall and Jeffery's invitations also marked the first time since 1985 the Bears sent multiple skill position players, and the most sent by the team since 1963 with Bill Wade, Joe Marconi and <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka.</b> Forte, Marshall and Jeffery were eventually drafted in the fantasy draft by Team Rice, while Long and Jennings were assigned to Team Sanders. In the 22–21 victory for Team Rice, Forte ran for 31 yards on six attempts while catching three passes for 24 yards. Jeffery and Marshall recorded two and one catch for 22 and 21 yards, respectively. For Team Sanders, Jennings recorded three tackles, while Long assisted in shoving Cam Newton into the endzone.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1982, George Halas summoned <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> {{back from}} Dallas and offered him the head {{coaching}} job, which he accepted.|$|E

50|$|Landry {{began his}} {{coaching}} career in 1985 handling the Cleveland Browns quarterbacks, and later joined <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> staff as quarterback coach in 1986, following the Bears' rout of the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX. With the Bears, {{he was also}} the wide receivers and tight ends coach before taking over as offensive coordinator from 1988 to 1992 and participating in six division championships.|$|R
50|$|On March 12, Bennett {{signed a}} {{four-year}} {{deal with the}} Chicago Bears. Bennett concluded the 2013 season with a career-high 65 receptions and 759 yards. The 65 receptions were tied for eighth in the league among tight ends, and the second-highest in team history, behind <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> 75 in 1964. The 759 yards were tied for ninth in yards, while Bennett also tied for 12th in touchdowns among tight ends.|$|R
50|$|The 1991 Chicago Bears {{season was}} their 72nd {{regular season and}} 21st postseason {{completed}} in the National Football League (NFL). The Bears returned to the playoffs for a second consecutive season as one of three NFC Wild Cards, finishing with an 11-5 record and in {{second place in the}} NFC Central. They were beaten, however, by the Dallas Cowboys in their first playoff game. This was <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> last playoff game as a head coach.|$|R
25|$|McSweeney has {{received}} few PAC contributions. As of March 31, 2006, only six PAC contributions exceeded $1,000. Among individual contributors, <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> {{is the biggest}} name.|$|E
25|$|Gresham {{was named}} to his second {{consecutive}} Pro Bowl and joins <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> and fellow Sooner Keith Jackson as the only tight ends in NFL history to have over 50 receptions {{in the first three}} years of their career.|$|E
25|$|Under {{head coach}} <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka,</b> {{who won the}} 1985 NFL Coach of the Year Award, the Bears went 15–1 in the regular season, {{becoming}} the second NFL team to win 15 regular season games, while outscoring their opponents with a staggering margin of 456–198.|$|E
5000|$|Brown {{turned down}} then-Saints coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> offer of nine draft picks for {{one in the}} 1999 NFL draft against then-coach Coslet's advice. Coslet wanted as many draft picks as {{possible}} to help the Bengals' defense. Instead, Brown overruled Coslet and selected University of Oregon quarterback Akili Smith. [...] Smith only played 22 games in his NFL career. Coslet later regretted that he [...] "didn't insist hard enough" [...] in trying to persuade Brown to accept the Saints' offer.|$|R
5000|$|Various [...] "signature segments."

500|$|The Bears {{announced}} on May 24, 2013, {{that they would}} retire former tight end and head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> number 89 jersey at the Bears-Cowboys halftime ceremony. The number {{was the last to}} be retired by the organization, with team chairman George McCaskey stating, [...] "If {{there is going to be}} a last one, there is no more appropriate one than 89." [...] During the ceremony, players from the 1985 Bears congratulated Ditka through messages on the videoboard. Ditka concluded his speech by saying, [...] "Thank you, thank you, thank you. Go Bears!" ...|$|R
25|$|Pitt alumni {{who have}} excelled in {{professional}} sports include Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Dan Marino '83, <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> '61, and Tony Dorsett '77. Basketball Hall of Fame inductees include pioneering coach Clifford Carlson '18 & '20 while others, such as John Woodruff '39 and Roger Kingdom '02, have won Olympic gold.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 season {{started with}} a deal that sent Jim McMahon to the San Diego Chargers. The move was made as McMahon fell out of favor with <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> and the Bears front office with his {{behavior}} and repeated injuries. This gave the starting job to Mike Tomczak, who had already seen considerable playing time as McMahon regularly missed games due to various injuries. The change at quarterback did not help the Bears as they finished 6–10 missing a sixth consecutive division title. The Bears came into the 1990 season bouncing back from a 6–10 season to finish in 1st Place with an 11–5 record. During the season, Head Coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> earned legendary status when he coached the team again just 10 days after a heart attack. This incident had been referenced and used several times in Bill Swerski's Superfans. However, {{a change in the}} playoff system caused the Bears a three seed to play in a wild card game to get to the Divisional Playoffs. In the first ever NFC 3 vs. 6 game the Bears defeated the New Orleans Saints, 16–6, to advance to a Divisional Playoff showdown against the New York Giants. The Bears were trounced 31–3 by the eventual Super Bowl Champion. The Bears made a return trip to the playoffs in 1991 with an 11–5 record in a season that saw <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> earn his 100th career-coaching win. The Bears did not win the division, but made the playoffs as a Wild Card qualifier. In the wild card round the Bears were defeated by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–13, in Chicago. The 1992 season saw {{the end of an era}} in Chicago. The Bears suffered their worst record of Mike Ditka's tenure, finishing 5–11. As a result, the <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> era ended as team president Mike McCaskey fired Ditka and hired Dave Wannstedt. Another era that ended that season came with the retirement of Hall of Famer Mike Singletary, who was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year.|$|E
25|$|The coin toss {{ceremony}} {{featured the}} winning head coaches of the Super Bowls {{that had previously}} been in New Orleans: Hank Stram (Super Bowl IV), Tom Landry (Super Bowl VI, Super Bowl XII), Chuck Noll (Super Bowl IX), Tom Flores (Super Bowl XV), <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> (Super Bowl XX), and George Seifert (Super Bowl XXIV). Hank Stram was given the honor of doing the coin toss.|$|E
50|$|The Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame, {{located in}} the Hawthorne Race Course, in Stickney/Cicero, near Chicago, Illinois, honors sports greats {{associated}} with the greater Chicago area. It was founded in 1979 as a trailer owned by the Olympia Brewing Company parked at Soldier Field in Chicago. The Chicago Park District took over the exhibits in 1983. From 1988 the exhibits were displayed in <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> restaurant until the restaurant closed in 1991. The Hall of Fame moved to the Maryville Academy in Des Plaines in 1996 and has operated {{under the guidance of}} Father John P. Smyth since that time. As of 2008, it was operating at Hawthorne.|$|R
50|$|The {{characters}} were typically shown in <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> sports bar, drinking {{large amounts of}} beer, smoking, and gorging themselves on ribs, Polish sausage, and similar foods. All of the characters wore dark sunglasses and thick mustaches to resemble Ditka, the popular coach of the Bears at the time, and who was the idol of all the Superfans. In addition to discussing Ditka and the Bears, another frequent topic of discussion was the Chicago Bulls basketball team, and their star player, Michael Jordan, who were winning their first three NBA Championships at the time. Both Ditka and Jordan would make appearances (playing themselves) in episodes of the sketch.|$|R
50|$|Several of the {{previous}} game's starters missed the game with injuries, including James Wilder, Jack Thompson, and both starting defensive ends (Lee Roy Selmon and John Cannon). Walter Payton rushed for 106 yards despite having been held out of practice the preceding week with fluid on his knee. In the process, he also passed 1,000 yards for the season, and moved past O. J. Simpson into third place on the NFL's all-time career rushing list with 11,257 yards. It was Payton's 53rd career 100-yard game and his seventh 1,000-yard season, which tied the record of Jim Brown and Franco Harris, the two players ahead of him on the career list. It also left him with 315 pass receptions, third all-time among Bears players and one short of <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> total.|$|R
25|$|In eleven {{seasons at}} Pitt, the second longest {{coaching}} {{tenure at the}} school after Sutherland's, Michelosen achieved a 56–49–7 record with only 4 losing campaigns. Pitt finished ranked among the top twenty programs in four seasons with Michelosen at the helm. Michelosen was a major coaching influence on such modern day NFL coaching greats as <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> and Marty Schottenheimer, both of whom played at Pitt under Michelosen.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his post-retirement endorsements and charity work, Warner has invested in the Elite Football League of India, a South Asian professional football league. Other prominent American backers include former Chicago Bears head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka,</b> former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin, sports analyst Ron Jaworski, and actor Mark Wahlberg. Warner's total investment amount remains undisclosed, although $50,000 of it will go towards a donation of footballs to schools and underprivileged children throughout India.|$|E
25|$|One oddity in the Bears' {{victory was}} that Walter Payton had a {{relatively}} poor performance running {{the ball and}} never scored a touchdown in Super Bowl XX, his only Super Bowl appearance during his Hall of Fame career. Many people including <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> have claimed {{that the reason for}} this was {{due to the fact that}} the Patriots' defensive scheme was centered on stopping Payton. Although Payton was ultimately the Bears' leading rusher during the game, the Patriots' defense held him to only 61 yards on 22 carries, with his longest run being only 7 yards. He was given several opportunities to score near the goal line, but New England stopped him every time before he reached the end zone (such as his 2-yard loss from the New England 3-yard line a few plays before Butler's second field goal, and his 2-yard run from the 4-yard line right before McMahon's first rushing touchdown). Thus, Chicago head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka</b> opted to go for other plays to counter the Patriots' defense. Ditka has since stated that his biggest regret of his career was not creating a scoring opportunity for Payton during the game.|$|E
2500|$|The 1982 {{season was}} <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> {{first season as}} {{head coach of the}} Bears, and he began his {{rebuilding}} program by drafting Jim McMahon from Brigham Young University with the intention of his being a franchise QB. The season was interrupted by a players' strike and shortened to nine games. As a result, the NFL held a special playoff tournament involving the top eight teams in both conferences. The Bears did not qualify for the postseason, finishing in 12th place with a 3–6 record. In the spring of 1983, George Halas died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 88. He was the last surviving NFL founder. The death of Halas also brought the addition of the initials [...] "GSH" [...] on the left sleeve of the Bears uniforms. In Ditka's second season, the Bears improved and finished with a record of 8–8. With Halas's passing, his daughter Virginia McCaskey and her husband Mike McCaskey assumed ownership of the team. The 1983 draft was a critical one as it saw the core of the Bears' 1985 championship team arrive.|$|R
50|$|But {{it was not}} the 1989 Draft {{that would}} harm the 1989 Bears-although the '89 draft would {{have a lot to do}} with the demise of the team leading up to <b>Mike</b> <b>Ditka's</b> {{dismissal}} three years later. One of the nails in the '89 coffin were failures high in the 1985-1988 drafts. A second-rounder was blown in 1985 on cornerback Reggie Phillips, released in 1988. 1989's second 2nd round pick was tackle Dave Zawatson, who did not make the 1990 roster. Third-round busts were James Maness in '85, David Williams in '86, the pick traded for Doug Flutie in 1987, and Ralph Jarvis in 1988. Fourth-round picks such as Paul Blair ('86) and Sean Smith ('87) weren't much better. the San Francisco 49ers built their late-decade dynasty around middle-round picks like Tom Rathman, Charles Haley and John Taylor during those years, while the Bears failed to restock as the Super Bowl Team of 1985 aged. This, along with letting Pro Bowlers like Marshall and Gault leave, would contribute to their downfall for more than a decade.|$|R
