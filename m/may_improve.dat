5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although there is some indication that it <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study indicated that}} yoga <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> psychological health during cancer treatment, although more complete clinical evidence is needed to confirm this possible effect. Other preliminary research indicated that yoga could be a useful supplementary treatment to reduce the general psychopathology of schizophrenia, and may have positive effects on mental health, although the quality of research to define these effects is low.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{there is}} little scientific evidence that yoga is beneficial for physical health, and it may cause muscular or spinal injuries, although it <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> mental health both for healthy people and for those with illnesses.

5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> tolerability.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event. Lactulose is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options.

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its {{taste is}} {{sometimes}} rated highly, although others {{have described the}} flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> the flavor.

5|$|Obesity {{prevention}} {{programs have been}} found to reduce the cost of treating obesity-related disease. However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur. Researchers, therefore, conclude that reducing obesity <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> the public's health, but it is unlikely to reduce overall health spending.|$|E

5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases.

5|$|Calcitriol, {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of vitamin D3, {{appears to be}} a catalyst for glutathione production. Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration. It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> treatment outcomes.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are {{unwilling or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E

Antihistamines <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is ongoing}} {{on the use}} of metformin, a {{diabetes}} medication, in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery. Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation.

Long-term use of metformin has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer, but <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> overall survival.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of sodium bicarbonate solution to rapidly improve the acid {{levels in the}} blood is controversial. There {{is little evidence that}} it improves outcomes beyond standard therapy, and indeed some evidence that while it <b>may</b> <b>improve</b> the acidity of the blood, it may actually worsen acidity inside the body's cells and increase the risk of certain complications. Its use is therefore discouraged, although some guidelines recommend it for extreme acidosis (pH<6.9), and smaller amounts for severe acidosis (pH 6.9–7.0).|$|E

50|$|By {{relying on}} {{identity}} information, {{such as that}} publicly traceable to telephone numbers or voter registration addresses and that voluntarily provided by respondents such as age and gender, polls can be made more scientific. Straw polls <b>may</b> be <b>improved</b> by asking identity questions, tracing group-based trends, and publishing statistical studies of the data. Opinion polls <b>may</b> be <b>improved</b> by more closely mirroring the larger poll or election anticipated, such as in wording of questions and inclusion procedure. Honor-system polls <b>may</b> be <b>improved</b> by adding ordinary voting controls; for example, online polls, such as the great Pepsi Man straw poll of 2013 may rely on established social-networking and identity providers for verification to minimize multiple voting.|$|R
