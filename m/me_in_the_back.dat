500|$|The TPF {{formed a}} phalanx and {{attempted}} to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu kick lines, and sang {{to the tune of}} Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay: [...] "We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair." [...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops. Just as the line got into a full kick routine, the TPF advanced again and cleared the crowd of screaming gay powerites down Christopher to Seventh Avenue." [...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's when I realized this is not a good thing to do, because they got <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with a nightstick." [...] Another account stated, [...] "I just can't ever get that one sight out of my mind. The cops with the [...] and the kick line on the other side. It was the most amazing thing... And all the sudden that kick line, which I guess was a spoof on the machismo... I think that's when I felt rage. Because people were getting smashed with bats. And for what? A kick line." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{second half}} {{started off with}} Crayston briefly taking {{on the role of}} a forward, driving in a shot that Smith did well to save. Arsenal's {{forwards}} followed this with a flowing move from James, Hulme and Bastin, with the final move resulting in Bastin heading just wide of the post. Although play in the first half was relatively equal, in the second half Arsenal were the superior side, simply outclassing the Second Division Sheffield United. In the 74th minute a movement was started by James, who passed the ball to Bastin. Bastin dribbled the ball past Hooper before crossing the ball into the centre for Drake, who drove the ball into the roof of the net with his left foot. Moments after the goal United were on the attack, Barton broke down the right wing, crossing the ball in for Dodds who, finding his marker out of position, headed the ball against the bar. Dodds later said in an interview, [...] "I was just about to direct the ball down into the net when a wee fellow called Wilf Copping went up behind me and, in striving to get to the ball, punched <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> This had the unfortunate effect of knocking my head backwards so the ball thudded against the crossbar instead of nestling itself {{in the back of the}} net. But for that, who knows, things might have turned out different." [...] Arsenal won the game with a single goal, the match having been mostly full of positive play and relatively free of fouls, although Drake was penalised on five occasions for using his elbows too much.|$|E

[...] "I went around the outside to pass him and braked really late, and I think he spun. I'm not going to say it was {{completely}} Ralf's fault. I mean, we were racing and everything...I know I gave him plenty of room because I was right {{on the edge of the}} track. Because I braked so late, I nearly didn't even make the corner. I braked really late, just made the corner, and something hit <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> When I looked in the mirror, I saw Ralf." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why naturally?" [...] Francis retorted. [...] "You {{belong to}} a {{powerful}} family, Giustiniani, and my father is only a trader, but I don't see that naturally you have any more right to get <b>me</b> stabbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> than I have to get you put out of the way." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the killings of Diệm and Nhu, she immediately accused the United States, saying [...] "Whoever has the Americans as allies does not need enemies", and that [...] "No coup can erupt without American incitement and backing". She went on to predict a bleak future for Vietnam and said that, by {{being involved in the}} coup, the troubles of the United States in Vietnam were just beginning. She called the deaths an [...] "indelible stigma" [...] against the Americans and said [...] "My family has been treacherously killed with either official or unofficial blessing of the American government, I can predict to you now that the story is only at its beginning." [...] She invoked biblical analogies, saying [...] "Judas has sold the Christ for thirty pieces of silver. The Ngô brothers have been sold for a few dollars." [...] When asked if she wanted asylum in the United States, she said, [...] "I cannot stay in a country whose government stabbed <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> I believe all the devils in hell are against us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hines {{recalled}} {{much of the}} group's early {{material as}} being [...] "primitive," [...] stating that [...] "the production on our early stuff didn't come up to par until [...] "Klap Ya Handz." [...] A producer named Dexx, also from Crown Heights, produced [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] for the group. In early 1991, Hines and Weston heard that EPMD would be hosting a talent show at Club Tropicana in Richmond, Virginia and decided to enter. Hines and Weston performed their song [...] "Klap Ya Handz," [...] which they'd recorded as a demo with Dexx (In fact, for the album, Hines and Weston had to rhyme over the demo for [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] because they didn't have an instrumental version of the music.). The group apparently had {{the highest score in}} the contest, which would earn the winner a $100 prize. However, according to Weston, although the duo had the highest score Parrish Smith, one half of the group EPMD, told the club announcer to give the second best group the prize. While the winning group went up to claim their prize, Smith came to Hines and Weston and said, [...] "yo, what would you guys rather have: a record deal or a hundred dollars? Meet <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the club in five minutes." [...] Smith and Erick Sermon, the other member of EPMD, met with Hines and Weston {{in the back of the}} club and asked the two to play them the [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] track again. Sermon and Smith were so impressed by the song that they asked Hines and Weston for the tape, with Smith telling them, [...] "if you can get us nine more songs like the one you just performed, we can get you a deal." [...] Hines and Weston kept in touch with EPMD during their junior year in college, finishing out the school year in May.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{know there}} was any one here," [...] he said, in a hoarse, panting whisper. [...] "The police are after me. I have fought for an hour, and run over a mile, and I'm dead beat--I can go no farther. Let <b>me</b> hide <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> room, and tell them you haven't seen any one, will you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Regardless, Carr said he next {{drove to}} [...] "a cut-rate gas station". [...] "I {{went inside and}} an older guy, around 50, came back out with <b>me,</b> looked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat, and said, 'I think you've got a problem'. He was very kind, and said Oak Hill General Hospital was six miles on my left," [...] and that would place him in Mount Hope.|$|R

'Yes,' said Walter, 'certainly I could; but, you see, Jonas, {{it might}} happen {{that one of}} them might bite <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and I should have more trouble in killing them. If I only knew that there were not more than two I should not mind, for them I should take one in each hand and give them a good shaking, like Susanna once shook me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} do it, missie," [...] he said. [...] "He is asleep and looks just like a child.

60|$|I {{had emerged}} by another door, and stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street {{for a little}} while, as if I really were a {{stranger}} upon earth: but the unceremonious pushing and hustling that I received, soon recalled me to myself, and put <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road <b>back</b> to <b>the</b> hotel; whither I went, revolving the glorious vision all the way; and where, after some porter and oysters, I sat revolving it still, at past one o'clock, with {{my eyes on the}} coffee-room fire.|$|R

60|$|The {{time has}} come for you to leave this house. Seventeen days ago you foisted {{yourself}} upon me, and since then we have been together night and day. You were unwelcome and uninvited, and you made yourself intensely disagreeable. We wrestled, you and I, but you attacked <b>me</b> unawares <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and you threw me. Then, like the ungenerous foe that you are, you struck me while I was down. However, your designs have failed. I struggle to my feet and order you to withdraw. Nay, withdraw is too polite a word. Your cab is at the door; get out. But, stop, a word with you before you go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen," [...] said Dr. Warner cheerfully, [...] "I've {{been pretty}} well entertained {{with all this}} {{pointless}} and incompetent tomfoolery {{for a couple of}} days; but it seems to be wearing rather thin, and I'm engaged for a city dinner. Among the hundred flowers of futility on both sides I was unable to detect any sort of reason why a lunatic should be allowed to shoot <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> garden." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{you say is}} {{all very}} well, uncle," [...] {{returned}} Duane, [...] "but {{the only way out}} for me is to run, and I won't do it.

Besides, Cal would shoot <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> some day if I didn't face him." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am pleased}} to see that we have a {{cessation}} of war for the time. This coming from me, a soldier, you will appreciate. I was a soldier in the Southern war for two weeks, and when gentlemen get up to speak of the great deeds our army and navy have recently done, why, it goes all through me and fires up the old war spirit. I had in my first engagement three horses shot under me. The next ones went over my head, the next hit <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> Then I retired to meet an engagement.|$|E
60|$|You {{would have}} been proud of me, my friends, if you could have seen and heard me, for I clashed my sabre as I spoke, and swung my dolman as though my {{regiment}} was picketed outside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courtyard. They listened to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> silence, but <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> Prince bowed more and more as though the burden which weighed upon it was greater than his strength. He looked round with haggard eyes.|$|R
5000|$|After {{seeing an}} ad in Soldier of Fortune" [...] {{magazine}}, he {{came into contact with}} the American Odinist Fellowship, and the Ásatrú Free Assembly, which he joined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s. He has stated that, [...] "That summer when I was living in Colorado, a friend of mine showed <b>me</b> an ad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Soldier of Fortune magazine for The Handbooks of the Religion of Odin. The book had a list of addresses at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and from there I contacted the Odinist Fellowship and joined." ...|$|R
60|$|The English battery which {{fired the}} first gun was still banging away on our left, and a German one was {{hard at work}} upon our right, so that we were wrapped round with the smoke; but we were not so hidden as to screen us from a line of French guns opposite, for a score of round shot came piping {{through the air and}} plumped right into the heart of us. As I heard the scream of them past my ear my head went down like a diver, but our {{sergeant}} gave <b>me</b> a prod <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with <b>the</b> handle of his halbert.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{crash and}} a sharp point cut my nose, but I was out upon the grass. Then there were twenty other crashes, and all the hounds were out too, for Tom had cheered them on. I ran {{to the edge of}} the lawn and saw a steep slope leading to the sands and the sea. Now I knew what the sea was, for after Tom had shot <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> I lived by it for a long while, and once swam across a little creek to get to my form, from which it cut me off.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{understand}} one another {{once and for}} all. I cannot at my mature age participate in the sports of children with such abandon as I could wish. I entertain, and have always entertained, the sincerest regard for such games as Hunt-the-Slipper and Blind-Man's Buff. But I have now reached a time of life, when, to have my eyes blindfolded {{and to have a}} powerful boy of ten hit <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> with a hobby-horse and ask me to guess who hit me, provokes me to a fit of retaliation which could only culminate in reckless criminality. Nor can I cover my shoulders with a drawing-room rug and crawl round {{on my hands and knees}} under the pretence that I am a bear without a sense of personal insufficiency, which is painful to me.|$|E
60|$|Here a tram-car, {{without any}} visible means of support, slid stealthily {{behind me and}} nearly struck <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> This was the famous cable car of San Francisco, which runs by {{gripping}} an endless wire rope sunk in the ground, and of which I will tell you more anon. A hundred yards further {{there was a slight}} commotion in the street, a gathering together of three or four, something that glittered as it moved very swiftly. A ponderous Irish gentleman, with priest's cords in his hat and a small nickel-plated badge on his fat bosom, emerged from the knot supporting a Chinaman who had been stabbed in the eye and was bleeding like a pig. The by-standers went their ways, and the Chinaman, assisted by the policeman, his own. Of course this was none of my business, but I rather wanted to know {{what had happened to the}} gentleman who had dealt the stab. It said a great deal for the excellence of the municipal arrangement of the town that a surging crowd did not at once block the street to see what was going forward. I was the sixth man and the last who assisted at the performance, and my curiosity was six times the greatest. Indeed, I felt ashamed of showing it.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{as to the}} reading. I {{am sorry}} {{to say that it}} is out of the {{question}} this season. I have had an attack of rheumatism--quite a stranger to me--which remains hovering about my left side, after having doubled <b>me</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and which would disable me from standing for two hours. I have given up all dinners and town engagements, and come to my little Falstaff House here, sensible of the necessity of country training all through the summer. Smith would have proposed any appointment to see you on the subject, but he has been dreadfully ill with tic. Whenever I read in London, I will gladly put a night aside for your purpose, and we will plot to connect your name with it, and give it some speciality. But this could not be before Christmas time, as I should not be able to read sooner, for <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot weather it would be useless. Let me hear from you about this when you have considered it. It would greatly diminish the expenses, remember.|$|R

60|$|From {{the prison}} to the Palace I {{was taken in}} chains like any thief--for the law demanded this indignity to be borne by one charged with the crimes they imputed to me. The {{distance}} was but short, yet I found it over-long, which is not wonderful considering that the people stopped to line up as I went by and to cast upon me a shower of opprobrious derision--for Toulouse was a very faithful and loyal city. It was within some two hundred yards of the Palace steps that I suddenly beheld a face <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd, {{at the sight of}} which I stood still in my amazement.

Fortified with these directions I proceeded till I found a mighty street full of sumptuous buildings four or five stories high, but paved with rude cobble stones in the fashion of the Year One. A cable-car without any visible means of support slid stealthily behind me and nearly struck <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> A hundred yards further there was a slight commotion in the street--a gathering together of three or four--and something that glittered as it moved very swiftly.
