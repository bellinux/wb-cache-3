Fabricating these 3 D-SICs using Wafer-to-Wafer (W 2 W) stacking has several advantages including: high throughput, thin wafer and small die handling, and high TSV density. However, W 2 W stacking suffers from low compound yield. This paper investigates various matching processes by using different wafer <b>matching</b> <b>criteria</b> {{in order to}} maximize the compound yield. It first establishes a framework covering different matching processes and wafer <b>matching</b> <b>criteria</b> for both replenished and non-replenished wafer repositories.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the impact of <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> purification on the accuracy of differential item functioning (DIF) detection in large-scale assessments. The three matching approaches for DIF analyses (block-level matching, pooled booklet matching, and equated pooled booklet matching) were employed with the Mantel– Haenszel procedure. Five factors—the length of a test, the proportion of items exhibiting DIF, a sample size, a ratio of a reference and focal group, {{and the existence of}} an average ability difference between two groups—were manipulated. The three matching approaches were used with and without purification. Also, a systematic test form difference was considered. The results indicated that overall, <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> purification in the three approaches contributed to the improvement of power in the detection of DIF. Depending on the psychometric characteristics of items exhibiting DIF and the existence of an average ability difference, the amount of power improvement due to <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> purification was different across the three approaches. The purification of a <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> contributed to the slight reduction of Type I error rates in the three approaches when no mean ability difference existed between the two groups.

Previous work focused on implementing pixel truncation using fixed-block-size motion estimation. However, pixel truncation fails to give satisfactory results for smaller block partitions. In this paper, we analyse the effect of truncating pixels for smaller block partitions and propose a method to improve the frame prediction. To further reduce power consumption, we adopt low-complexity <b>matching</b> <b>criteria</b> for the highly truncated bit. The low-complexity <b>matching</b> <b>criteria</b> can work together with pixel truncation to reduce computational complexity without significantly degrading picture quality. I...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new {{approach}} for MC-DCT (motion compensated – Discrete Cosine Transform) hybrid video coding based on true motion estimation is proposed. The true motion estimation technique employs the leastmedian-squares (LMedS) <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> in block matching process for motion estimation. The rationale for using such true motion estimator is that at low bit-rates, very few bits are available for coding the motioncompensated DCT errors, and thus the detection of the true underlying motion of the picture block becomes {{much more important than}} just trying to find a blockmatch that satisfies the traditional least-mean-squares (LMS) <b>matching</b> <b>criterion.</b> Without detecting the true motion of the picture block, the errors due to insufficient bits for coding the motion-compensated DCT errors will be propagated to succeeding inter-frames, resulting in a progressive degeneration on perceptual quality of the pictures. An important advantage of using true motion estimation is that it results in better perceptual video quality compared to the conventional block-matching algorithm that utilizes least-mean-squares <b>matching</b> <b>criterion.</b> Experimental results obtained had supported our proposition on using the LMedS-based <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> in block-matching motion estimation for low bitrate video coding. 1...|$|E

Using Scholastic Aptitude Test verbal data with large samples, both male/female and black/white group comparisons were investigated.

When large samples were used, values based on the bivariate <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> were ordered very similarly to MH D-DIF values based on the other criteria. With small samples, the values based on the bivariate <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> displayed only moderate correlations with values from the other criteria. DIF category classifications based on the bivariate <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> showed fewer high DIF items than those 'based on the rights or formula scored matching criteria.

The proposed feedback technique {{is based on}} Bayesian learning method and incorporates a time-varying user model into the formulation. We define the user model with two terms: a target query and a user conception. The target query is aimed to learn the common features from relevant images so as to specify the user’s ideal query. The user conception is aimed to learn a parameter set to determine the time-varying <b>matching</b> <b>criterion.</b> Therefore, at each feedback step, the learning process updates not only the target distribution but also the target query and the <b>matching</b> <b>criterion.</b> In addition, another objective {{of this paper is}} to conduct the relevance feedback on images represented in region level. We formulate the <b>matching</b> <b>criterion</b> using a weighting scheme and proposed a region clustering technique to determine the region correspondence between relevant images.

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method combined with time-varying user model indeed achieves satisfactory results and our proposed region-based techniques further improve the retrieval accuracy.
