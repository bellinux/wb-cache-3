ABSTRACT: In this study we estimate the risk of water erosion in coastal watersheds between M'diq and Fnideq located in northern Morocco, through using a new approach based on spatial cartography. Precisely, the methodology adopted here integrates a Geographic Information System (GIS) with the universal soil loss equation (USLE). The field data includes three major components namely, lithology, degree of slope and vegetation density. Each of these components is represented by a separate layer, in which 1 to 5 value expresses its lateral variability degree. The final map of water-erosion risk is obtained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sum of superposed indices, separately assigned to three thematic layers (facies, slope and vegetation cover), and <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentages</b> of <b>the</b> contribution of each factor to determine <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of weighting [...] Secondarily, a complementary table translates the cartographic values of each layer as <b>percentage</b> values expressing <b>the</b> impact exerted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> corresponding risk factor throughout the studied area. The risk map is deducted after validation of these weightings on <b>the</b> field <b>by</b> choosing checkpoints distributed throughout the watersheds of the site. This method would allow for the tracking and of course monitoring of water erosion {{on a larger scale}} and to better direct the administrations concerned to the priority of installations...|$|R

Remote sensing data have been developed to provide information at different scales for surveys of forest ecosystems, but obtaining information about the understorey remains a challenge. As rapid and efficient tools for forest structure attribute estimation, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) have attracted much attention. We examine the relationship between ALS and TLS data and detect changes in the forest understorey caused by forest-tending events in the study area. We conducted trials in five plots within a young Khasi pine (Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gord.) plantation in Yunnan province, China, before and after forest tending. We collected bi-temporal ALS data in this area and TLS data from 10 scanning stations. Canopy height profiles were retrieved from ALS and TLS data, and understorey material volume retrieved from filled TLS voxels volume agreed well with the understorey point clouds percentile distribution (PD) obtained from ALS data.

40|$|Abstract Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays {{performed}} on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections traditionally have been semi-quantified by pathologist visual scoring of staining. IHC {{is useful for}} validating biomarkers discovered through genomics methods as large clinical repositories of FFPE specimens support the construction of tissue microarrays (TMAs) for high throughput studies. Due to the ubiquitous availability of IHC techniques in clinical laboratories, validated IHC biomarkers may be translated readily into clinical use. However, the method of pathologist semi-quantification is costly, inherently subjective, and produces ordinal rather than continuous variable data. Computer-aided analysis of digitized whole slide images may overcome these limitations. Using TMAs representing 215 ovarian serous carcinoma specimens stained for S 100 A 1, we assessed {{the degree to which}} data obtained using computer-aided methods correlated with data obtained by pathologist visual scoring. To evaluate computer-aided image classification, IHC staining within pathologist annotated and software-classified areas of carcinoma were compared for each case. Two metrics for IHC staining were used: the percentage of carcinoma with S 100 A 1 staining (%Pos), and the product of the staining intensity (optical density [OD] of staining) <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of carcinoma with S 100 A 1 staining (OD*%Pos). A comparison of the IHC staining data obtained from manual annotations and software-derived annotations showed strong agreement, indicating that software efficiently classifies carcinomatous areas within IHC slide images.

40|$|Studies of {{eukaryotic}} genome expression {{demonstrate the}} importance of steroid receptor coactivators in mediating efficient gene transcription. Little is know about the physiological role of these coactivators in vivo. We recently showed that the Steroid Receptor Coactivator SRC- 1 is densely expressed in steroid-sensitive brain areas in birds and its expression is steroid-dependent and sexually differentiated. We tested the role of SRC- 1 in the activation by testosterone of male sexual behavior in quail. Daily injections of LNA antisense oligonucleotides in the third ventricle (AS group) significantly reduced the expression of male copulatory behavior in response to exogenous testosterone compared to control animals (Ctrl group) receiving the vehicle alone or scrambled LNA. Sexual behavior was restored and even enhanced within 48 hours after interruption of LNA injection (ASSC group). Western blot analysis confirmed the decrease of SRC- 1 expression in AS animals and suggested an over-expression of the coactivator in ASSC animals. The effect of SRC- 1 knock down on behavior was correlated with a reduced volume of the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) defined by Nissl-staining and aromatase immunohistochemistry. In addition, the amount of aromatase-immunoreactive material in POM, defined as the relative optical density of the aromatase immunoreactivity <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of surface covered within the nucleus and by the total POM volume of the POM, was decreased in the AS compared to the Ctrl group, suggesting a blockade of aromatase transcription.

Anecdotal evidence indicated that the aquifers may be vulnerable to pollution. The aquifer vulnerability was assessed by developing a new method RDSS. The RDSS method was developed by combining relevant vulnerability parameters of DRASTIC, GOD, EPIK, SEEPAGE, COP and SINTACS. RDSS evaluates the vadose zone as a pathway for pollutants <b>by</b> using <b>the</b> following four parameters namely: Recharge, Depth to water table, Soil type and Slope. Recharge was estimated using the Chloride-mass balance method. Depth to water table was measured in the field using a dipmeter. For inaccessible boreholes, data was requested from Groundwater Project Consulting Company. The seepage behaviour (soil type) was determined using parameters such as hydraulic conductivity, infiltration and percolation. Percolation and hydraulic conductivity was determined by undertaking percolation tests in accordance with SABS 0252 - 2 : 1993. Infiltration was determined using the double ring infiltrometer. Slopes were determined from the digital elevation method using ArcGIS software. High recharge was revealed in the lower parts of both B 81 G and B 82 D. Shallow depth to water level was revealed on the upper part of B 82 D and extended towards the lower part of B 81 G. Soil type relates to saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity, which was rated to be high in the northeast of B 81 G. Gentle (high influence due to preferential infiltration to runoff) slopes extend from the south towards the northern parts of both B 81 G and B 82 D. The four parameters (recharge, depth to water table, soil type, and slope) were overlaid using Weighted Sum, Weighted Overlay and Raster Calculator to produce the final vulnerability map. When using Weighted Overlay and Weighted Sum, rasters were given different percentages of influence in different scenarios. The Weighted Overlay tool inputs multiple rasters and sets all weights equal to 100 %. The Weighted Sum tool inputs multiple rasters and sets all weight equal to 1. 0.

The estimates from the Delphi exercise were <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of patients using government facilities to estimate the number of asthma patients managed in Oman. Treatment costs were also calculated using data from the Delphi exercise and the Asthma Insights and Reality for the Gulf and Near East study (reported in Omani riyals [OMR] and US dollars [USD]). Results: The prevalence of asthma was estimated to be 7. 3 % of adults (n = 96, 470) and 12. 7 % of children (n = 58, 344). Of these, 95 % of both adults and children were estimated to be using government healthcarefacilities. Inpatient visits accounted for the largest proportion of total direct costs (55 %), followed by emergency room and outpatient visits (25 % and 20 %, respectively) and medications (< 0. 2 %). The annual cost of treatment excluding medications, was OMR 34, 273, 696 (USD 89, 111, 609) for adults and OMR 27, 014, 735 (USD 70, 238, 311) for children. Including medications, the total annual direct cost of asthma treatment was estimated to be over OMR 61, 500, 294 (USD 159, 900, 761). Conclusion: Given the high medical expenditures associated with facility visits relative to the lower medication costs, the focus of Oman’s asthma cost savings should be on improving asthma control rather than reducing medication costs...|$|E

METHOD: A prospective, 48 site, cross-sectional, observational study of patients attending Emergency Departments (ED) in England, UK was conducted. Pharmacists at each site collected up to 400 admissions and paediatric patients were included in the data collection. The pharmacist independent prescribers (one for each site) were asked to identify patient attendance at their Emergency Department, record anonymised details of the cases-age, weight, presenting complaint, clinical grouping (e. g. medicine, orthopaedics), and categorise each presentation into one of four possible categories: CP, Community Pharmacist, cases which could be managed by a community pharmacist outside an ED setting; IP-cases that could be managed at ED by a hospital pharmacist with independent prescriber status; IPT, Independent Prescriber Pharmacist with additional training-cases which could be managed at ED by a hospital pharmacist independent prescriber with additional clinical training; and MT, Medical Team only-cases that were unsuitable for the pharmacist to manage. An Impact Index was calculated for the two most frequent clinical groupings using the formula: Impact index=percentage of the total workload of the clinical grouping <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> ability of pharmacists to manage that clinical group. RESULTS: 1623 out of 18, 229 (9 %) attendees, from 45 of the 48 sites, were children aged from 0 to 16 years of age (median 8 yrs, range 0 - 16), 749 were female and 874 were male. Of the 1623 admissions, 9 % of the cases were judged to be suitable for clinical management by a community pharmacist (CP), 4 % suitable for a hospital pharmacist independent prescriber (IP), 32 % suitable for a hospital independent pharmacist prescriber with additional training (IPT); and the remaining 55 % were only suitable for the Medical Team (MT). The most frequent clinical groups and impact index for the attendees were General Medicine= 10. 78 and orthopaedics= 10. 60. CONCLUSION: Paediatric patients attending Emergency Departments were judged by pharmacists to be suitable for management outside a hospital setting in approximately 1 in 11 cases, and by hospital independent prescriber pharmacists in 4 in 10 cases. With further training, it was found that the total proportion of cases that could be managed by a pharmacist was 45 %.

Red blood cells in the cell pellet were lysed with lysis buffer, and the cells were washed in PBS and subsequently resuspended in medium containing IMDM (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 2.5 % fetal calf serum (FCS; Greiner Bio-one, Monroe, NC, USA) and Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S; Invitrogen Corp., Paisley, UK). Total cardiac cell numbers were determined with a Sysmex cell counter (Sysmex America, Inc. Mundelein, Illinois, USA). The resulting single-cell suspensions were stained for flow cytometry with primary antibodies for 30  min at 4 °C in darkness and the cells were washed with PBS/ 1 % human Albumin (Sanquin, Leiden, The Netherlands) before analysis using a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). The following antibodies were used: anti-CD 90 -APC, 53 – 2.1, -B 220 -APC, RA 3 - 6 B 2, -CD 49 b-APC, DX 5, -NK 1.1 -APC, PK 136, -Ly- 6 G-APC, 1 A 8, CD 11 b-eFluor 450, M 1 / 70, -F 4 / 80 -FITC, -CD 11 c-FITC, HL 3, -I-Ab -FITC, AF 6 - 120.1, -Ly- 6 C-PE, AL- 21, -CD 11 c-PE, HL 3 (All above antibodies are from BD Biosciences) and C 1 :A 3 - 1 (ABD Serotec, Kidlington, UK). Monocytes were identified as CD 11 b high (CD 90 /B 220 /CD 49 b/NK 1.1 /Ly- 6 G) low. They were further divided into Ly- 6 C high/low (F 4 / 80 /I-Ab/CD 11 c) low as previously described (Nahrendorf et al. 2007; Swirski et al. 2009). Macrophages were identified as CD 11 b high, F 4 / 80 high. Dendritic cells were identified as CD 11 b, I-Ab and CD 11 c high. Neutrophils were identified as CD 11 b, Ly- 6 G high. Monocyte and macrophage/dendritic cell numbers were calculated as the total cells <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> of cells within the monocyte/macrophage gate. The analysis of the acquired data was done with FlowJo software version 7.6. 1 (Tree Star Inc. Ashland, OR, USA).|$|E
30|$|Rather than to {{estimate}} the mean liver absorbed dose <b>by</b> <b>multiplying</b> <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> taken up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> liver region reached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> microspheres with the S factor of this region, a voxel-based dosimetry could be obtained <b>by</b> convolving <b>the</b> reconstructed 90 Y distribution with a dose deposition kernel [18, 20]. This will allow computation of the normal tissue complication probability using the equivalent uniform dose {{in order to take}} into account the liver irradiation heterogeneity. This can be done using Niemerko's model [32] and the normal tissue tolerance determined by Emami et al. [33]. The software performing this computation is already available [34], and recently, an improvement of Niemerko's model was proposed [35].|$|R

Weighted value basisOne {{method for}} {{determining}} VOWD for major equipment {{is based on}} weighted values of items of equipment.At {{the outset of the}} project a list of equipment is prepared, and the weighted (%) value of each piece of equipment, with the sum of the weighted values of all items totaling 100%.When an item of equipment is received on site <b>the</b> <b>percentage</b> contribution of that equipment is added to the previous months weighted value of all other equipment to determine <b>the</b> total cumulative <b>percentage</b> value of equipment received on site.The VOWD of major equipment is calculated <b>by</b> <b>multiplying</b> <b>the</b> weighted <b>percentage</b> value of all equipment received at site <b>by</b> <b>the</b> total current approved contract value of the Major Equipment scope.|$|R
25|$|To {{calculate}} the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then {{divided into three}} separate salary brackets—each <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> a different benefit <b>percentage.</b> <b>The</b> benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are {{the sum of the}} salary in each bracket times <b>the</b> benefit <b>percentages</b> that apply to each bracket. <b>The</b> benefit <b>percentages</b> are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The bendpoints, where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> benefit <b>percentage</b> of 90%, <b>the</b> second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> 32%, <b>the</b> third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income <b>multiplied</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor retirement plan for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental retirement plan unless they want to live on significantly less after retirement than they used to earn.|$|R
