3000|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a secure cluster-routing protocol {{based on a}} multilayer scheme in ad hoc networks. This work provides scalable, threshold authentication scheme in ad hoc networks. We present detailed security threats against ad hoc routing protocols, specifically examining cluster-based routing. Our proposed protocol, called [...] "authentication based on multilayer clustering for ad hoc networks" [...] (AMCAN), designs an end-to-end authentication protocol that relies on mutual trust between nodes in other clusters. The AMCAN strategy takes advantage of a <b>multilayer</b> <b>architecture</b> that is designed for an authentication protocol in a cluster head (CH) using a new concept of control cluster head (CCH) scheme. We propose an authentication protocol that uses certificates containing an asymmetric key and a <b>multilayer</b> <b>architecture</b> so that the CCH is achieved using the threshold scheme, thereby reducing the computational overhead and successfully defeating all identified attacks. We also use a more extensive area, such as a CCH, using an identification protocol to build a highly secure, highly available authentication service, which forms {{the core of our}} security framework.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel hierarchical spatiotemporal orientation representation for spacetime image analysis. It {{is designed to}} combine {{the benefits of the}} <b>multilayer</b> <b>architecture</b> of ConvNets and a more controlled approach to spacetime analysis. A distinguishing aspect of the approach is that unlike most contemporary convolutional networks no learning is involved; rather, all design decisions are specified analytically with theoretical motivations. This approach makes it possible to understand what information is being extracted at each stage and layer of processing as well as to minimize heuristic choices in design. Another key aspect of the network is its recurrent nature, whereby the output of each layer of processing feeds back to the input. To keep the network size manageable across layers, a novel cross-channel feature pooling is proposed. The <b>multilayer</b> <b>architecture</b> that results systematically reveals hierarchical image structure in terms of multiscale, multiorientation properties of visual spacetime. To illustrate its utility, the network has been applied to the task of dynamic texture recognition. Empirical evaluation on multiple standard datasets shows that it sets a new state-of-the-art.
