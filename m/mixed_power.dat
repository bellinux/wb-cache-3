[...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just down the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club <b>mixed</b> <b>power,</b> money, and glamor.

40|$|Adding product {{into the}} mixer exerts {{a strong and}} rapid impact during {{concrete}} mixing. Experimental data obtained from a planetary mixer in a full-scale concrete plant under laboratory conditions show {{that the state of}} mixture progress with mixing time is well described by the <b>mixing</b> <b>power</b> evolution. More specifically, a reliable method for detecting the time corresponding to the transformation of a mixture from a cohesive granular material into a granular paste (i. e. the so-called 'transition time'), through use of a <b>mixing</b> <b>power</b> measurement, will be presented herein. Moreover, once this transition has been achieved, <b>mixing</b> <b>power</b> consumption will be related to mixture rheology and then to mixer geometry by means of a simplified hypothesis. This equation can also be obtained via a dimensionless analysis. Lastly, it will be shown that mixture behavior beyond the transition point is well fitted by a hyperbolic equation. The corresponding <b>mixing</b> <b>power</b> evolution can then be predicted by the level of power at this transition time. These results are suitable for application to online process monitoring...|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s the British {{developed}} <b>mixed</b> <b>power</b> {{designs to}} cover the performance gap that existed in then-current turbojet designs.

The Saunders-Roe SR.53 was a successful design and was due to be developed into production when economics forced curtailment of most British aircraft programmes in the late 1950s. The advancement of the turbojet engine output, the advent of missiles, and advances in radar had made a return to <b>mixed</b> <b>power</b> unnecessary.|$|E

The optimization was made taking into account <b>mixing</b> <b>power</b> and homogenization time for ribbon impellers with a different number of ribbons and width operating in a laminar motion for Newtonian fluid. Due to minimum mixing energy required to stir a unit volume of liquid the most efficient impeller appeared to be that with one ribbon of width equal to 0. 1 to 0. 15 of the mixing vessel diameter. Impellers with more than one ribbon needed much higher <b>mixing</b> <b>power</b> but did not increase significantly secondary circulation in the vessel.

50|$|Advances in {{jet engine}} design were making Lippisch's ideas more practical, and Convair became {{interested}} in a hybrid (<b>mixed</b> <b>power)</b> jet/rocket design which they proposed as the F-92. In order to gain experience with the delta wing handling at high speeds, they first built a test aircraft, the 7002 which, on June 9, 1948, became the first jet-powered delta-wing aircraft to fly. Although the U.S. Air Force lost interest in the F-92, the next test model 7003 was designated the XF-92A. This led Convair to proposing delta wing {{for most of their}} projects through the 1950s and into the 1960s, including the F-102 Delta Dagger, F-106 Delta Dart and B-58 Hustler.|$|E
50|$|The {{successes of}} the P-47N and P-51 gave the {{impression}} that the escort fighter was a concept worth continuing {{after the end of the}} war. The high fuel use of early jet engines made such aircraft difficult to design, and a number of experimental designs were tried that used <b>mixed</b> <b>power,</b> typically a turboprop and jet, but these failed to meet performance requirements. A new concept, the XF-85 Goblin microfighter, planned to act as a parasite fighter for the Convair B-36, was tested with a B-29 Superfortress and found to be utterly impossible to use operationally. Later the FICON project attempted a similar solution, docking jet fighters with heavy bombers via a trapeze mechanism or their wingtips.|$|E
