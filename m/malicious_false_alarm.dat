Results indicate that fire incidents are not static in either time or space and that spatiotemporal variation is related to incident type.

50|$|The VFRS Fire {{prevention}} Division is {{the division}} {{that is responsible}} for educating the population of Vaughan to take precautions to prevent potentially harmful fires, and be educated about surviving them. The Fire Prevention Division provides inspections and plan reviews for fire/carbon monoxide alarms, sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, and general fire hazards. They conduct building inspections {{to make sure they are}} compliant with fire codes, and they also visit schools and daycare centers to make presentations about arson, <b>malicious</b> <b>false</b> <b>alarms,</b> and fire safety. VFRS's fire investigation team works with the Ontario Fire Marshal’s Office and reaches out to inspectors and public educators in Vaughan with regards to fire risks and fire safety. One of the Fire Prevention Division's responsibilities is to educate seniors about fire safety. In addition to their annual inspections and witnessing of fire drills for all retirement homes and care facilities throughout Vaughan, the Fire Prevention Division together with B.A.S.S.I.C. (Bringing an Awareness of Senior Safety Issues to the Community) delivers fire safety education to approximately 700 attendees at B.A.S.S.I.C.'s annual senior’s symposium.|$|R

Despite this, {{there has been a}} comparative lack of research into the spatial and temporal analysis of fire incidence in urban contexts. In this paper, we redress this gap through an exploration of the association of fire incidence to weather, calendar events and socio-economic characteristics in South-East Queensland, Australia using innovative technique termed the quad plot. Analysing trends in five fire incident types, including <b>malicious</b> <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> (hoax calls), residential buildings, secondary (outdoor), vehicle and suspicious fires, results suggest that risk associated with all is greatly increased during school holidays and during long weekends. For all fire types the lowest risk of incidence was found to occur between one and six a. m. It was also found that there was a higher fire incidence in socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods and there was some evidence to suggest {{that there may be a}} compounding impact of high temperatures in such areas.

30|$|At present, {{advanced}} researches {{of optical}} fiber intrusion measurement {{are based on}} the constant <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> rate (CFAR) algorithm. Although these conventional methods overcome the interference of non-stationary random signals, there are still a large number of <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> in practical applications. This is because there is no specific study on orthogonal polarization signals of <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> and intrusion. In order to further reduce <b>false</b> <b>alarms,</b> we analyze the correlation of optical fiber signals using birefringence of single-mode fiber. This paper proposes the harmful intrusion detection algorithm based on the correlation of two orthogonal polarization signals. The proposed method uses correlation coefficient to distinguish <b>false</b> <b>alarms</b> and intrusions, which can decrease <b>false</b> <b>alarms.</b> Experiments on real data, which are collected from the practical environment, demonstrate that the difference in correlation is a robust feature.

40|$|Abstract — Traditionally the <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> rate in {{change point}} {{detection}} problems {{is measured by}} the mean time to false detection (or between <b>false</b> <b>alarms).</b> The large values of the mean time to <b>false</b> <b>alarm,</b> however, do not generally guarantee small values of the <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> probability in a fixed time interval for any possible location of this interval. In this paper we consider a multichannel (multi-population) change point detection problem under a non-traditional <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> probability constraint, which is desirable for a variety of applications. It is shown that in the multichart CUSUM test this constraint is easy to control. Furthermore, the proposed multichart CUSUM test is shown to be uniformly asymptotically optimal when the <b>false</b> <b>alarm</b> probability is small: it minimizes an average detection delay, or more generally, any positive moment of the stopping time distribution for any point of change.

30|$|In {{future work}} {{we plan to}} {{experiment}} with cost-sensitive classification in which {{the costs of the}} two types of errors (i.e., missing a <b>malicious</b> file and <b>false</b> <b>alarm)</b> are not equal. We believe that the application of cost-sensitive classification depends on the goals to be achieved, and accordingly the cost of having a misclassification of each type. Having experience in using this approach in real life setting, we can give two general examples of such applications. The first example pertains to for anti-virus companies that need to analyze dozens of thousands of maliciously suspected (or unknown) files, including benign files, every day. In such an application the goal is to perform an initial filtering {{to reduce the amount of}} files to investigate manually. Thus, having a relatively high false-positive is reasonable in order to decrease the probability of missing an unknown malicious file. Another application is as an anti-virus. In this case we would like to decrease the probability of false-negative, which will result in quarantining, deleting, or blocking of a legitimate file. For both scenarios it is difficult to assign the costs for the two errors (note that each type of malware can be assigned with a different cost level based on the damage it causes) and therefore in this paper we focus on exploring and identifying the settings and classifiers that can classify the files as accurately as possible, leaving the cost-sensitive analysis for future work.|$|R
