5|$|Filmed in {{both black}} and white as well as Gevacolor, Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> was {{released}} on 22 August 1958 and garnered positive critical reception. It was a commercial success, grossing 11million in its lifetime, thereby becoming only the second Tamil film to earn 10million after another Ramachandran starrer Madurai Veeran (1956); it became a silver jubilee film. Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> acquired cult status in Tamil cinema. It was dubbed into Telugu as Anaganaga Oka Raju and in Hindi as Hamen Bhi Jeene Do.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack {{album and}} {{background}} score were composed by Bharathwaj. Since making his entry into Tamil films with Saran's directorial debut Kaadhal <b>Mannan,</b> he has scored {{the music for}} most films directed by Saran. The lyrics were written by poet-lyricist Vairamuthu.|$|E
5|$|Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> {{was first}} re-released on 4 August 2006 in Chennai and Chengalpattu by Divya Films, which spent 300,000 on poster designs and {{promotions}} for its re-release. The film opened {{to a positive}} response from the audience. It received another successful re-release on 18 March 2011 in Madurai.|$|E
40|$|The {{cell wall}} <b>mannans</b> of two Candida albicans {{serotype}} A strains, NIH A- 207 and J- 1012 (abbreviated as A and J strains, respectively), cultured in yeast extract-Sabouraud liquid medium at pH 2. 0, contained neither a phosphate group nor a beta- 1, 2 -linked mannopyranose unit (H. Kobayashi, P. Giummelly, S. Takahashi, M. Ishida, J. Sato, M. Takaku, Y. Nishidate, N. Shibata, Y. Okawa, and S. Suzuki, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 175 : 1003 - 1009, 1991). In this study, the <b>mannans</b> obtained from A and J strains grown in pH 2. 0 medium (abbreviated as <b>mannans</b> A 2 and J 2, respectively) exhibited quite different reactivities against rabbit anti-C. albicans and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae sera {{compared with those}} of <b>mannans</b> from the corresponding strains cultured in conventional medium at pH 5. 9 (abbreviated as <b>mannans</b> A and J, respectively). Namely, <b>mannans</b> A 2 and J 2 lost reactivity against the former serum but reacted with the latter serum to a higher extent than <b>mannans</b> A and J. In order to account for these difference in more detail, <b>mannans</b> A 2 and J 2 were subjected to acetolysis. Elution profiles of the acetolysates were completely different from those of acetolysates obtained from <b>mannans</b> A and J reported in our previous papers. The 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the oligosaccharides from <b>mannans</b> A 2 and J 2 obtained by this procedure indicate that the side chains are composed of alpha-linked mannopyranose units densely linked to the alpha- 1, 6 -linked backbone. The long side chains containing one alpha- 1, 3 -linked mannopyranose unit are markedly increased...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{overview}} {{of the structure of}} <b>mannans</b> in plant cell walls and other organisms is presented. In particular, <b>mannans,</b> galactomannans and glucomannans in seed endosperm and vegetative tissues such as bulbs and tubers, galactoglucomannans (GGMs) in primary cell walls, and glucomannans and GGMs in secondary walls of hardwoods and softwoods are covered. Possible roles of <b>mannans</b> in primary plant cell walls other than as storage polysaccharides are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Polysaccharides, {{the most}} {{abundant}} biopolymers, are required {{for a host of}} activities in lower organisms, animals, and plants. Their solution characterization is challenging due to their complex shape, heterogeneity, and size. Here, recently developed data analysis approaches were applied for traditional sedimentation equilibrium and velocity methods in order to investigate the molar mass distribution(s) of a subtype of polysaccharide, namely, <b>mannans</b> from four Candida spp. The molecular weight distributions of these <b>mannans</b> were studied using two recently developed equilibrium approaches: SEDFIT-MSTAR and MULTISIG, resulting in corroboratory distribution profiles. Additionally, sedimentation velocity data for all four <b>mannans,</b> analyzed using ls-g*(s) and Extended Fujita approaches, suggest that two of the fungal <b>mannans</b> (FM- 1 and FM- 3) have a unimodal distribution of molecular species whereas two others (FM- 2 and FM- 4) displayed bi-modal and broad distributions, respectively: this demonstrates considerable molecular heterogeneity in these polysaccharides, consistent with previous observations of <b>mannans</b> and polysaccharides in general. These methods not only have applications for the characterization of <b>mannans</b> but for other biopolymers such as polysaccharides, DNA, and proteins (including intrinsically disordered proteins) ...|$|R
5|$|Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> was {{inspired}} by films such as The Prisoner of Zenda, If I Were King and Viva Zapata!. Ramachandran, in an account about the film he wrote in 1959, mentioned three specific differences from The Prisoner of Zenda. In the original, the look-alike and the queen have an intimate relationship while in Nadodi <b>Mannan,</b> Veerangan rejects Manohari's advances. When she realises that Veerangan is not Marthandan, she addresses him as her brother instead. Secondly, the look-alike {{was related to the}} king and shared the same interests. Veerangan is not related to Marthandan and initially has contrasting qualities until they meet. Thirdly, the character of Vijayavarman, and the sequences in Kanni Theevu, do not feature in the original, while these were incorporated as part of Nadodi Mannans main plot.|$|E
5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, {{who was then}} a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali <b>Mannan</b> (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.|$|E
5|$|Film {{historian}} Film News Anandan noticed {{publicity stills}} of Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> on Veerappan's office desk when {{he happened to}} visit the office of Em.Gee.Yar Pictures. He then offered to distribute them to the press. Veerappan agreed knowing that Anandan was then {{a member of the}} South Indian Film Journalists Association. After a few days, stills of the film were published in many magazines. Ramachandran was impressed with Anandan's work and, at Veerappan's suggestion, hired him as the film's public relations officer (PRO). This was Anandan's debut film as a PRO; however, his name does not appear in the opening credits.|$|E
40|$|Some yeast <b>mannans</b> {{increased}} vascular permeability {{and caused}} anaphylaxis-like reactions, fatal in some cases, in nonsensitized CFW mice. In SWR mice deficient in the complement system component C 5, anaphylactic shock did not develop after the injection of <b>mannans</b> but was readily induced by goat serum after the mice had been sensitized with Bordetella pertussis and goat serum. The observed biological {{activity of the}} yeast <b>mannans</b> appears to depend upon the α(1 → 2) and α(1 → 6) linkages in their main chain. Their relative inactivity in C 5 -deficient mice and the consumption of whole hemolytic complement after their addition to normal mouse serum suggest that yeast <b>mannans</b> may activate late-acting complement components to produce anaphylatoxin from complement components C 5 and C 3...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{cells of}} Candida albicans NIH A- 207 strain (A-strain) {{cultivated}} in YSLM at high temperatures (37 and 40 °C) did not undergo agglutination with the factor sera 4, 5, and 6 in a commercially available factor serum kit, ‘Candida Check’, {{and formed a}} grape-like shape. The <b>mannans</b> isolated from the cells had lost their reactivity against the factor sera in ELISA. It was also revealed by 1 H NMR analysis that the <b>mannans</b> contained neither a phosphate group nor a β- 1, 2 -linked mannopyranose unit, although these <b>mannans</b> increased the non-reducing terminal α- 1, 3 -linked mannopyranose unit. The cells and the <b>mannans</b> prepared by cultivation at such high temperatures followed by 27 °C in the same medium entirely recovered the reactivity with the factor sera...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{the characteristics of}} <b>mannans</b> isolated from the yeast forms of two relatively avirulent Candida albicans strains, designated 4918 - 2 and 4918 - 10. Investigations have been expanded to include an analysis of <b>mannans</b> from the hyphal form of these strains {{as well as from}} the hyphal form of the parental strain, 4918. After extraction, <b>mannans</b> were further purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography on a Bio-gel TSK DEAE- 5 -PW column. Subsequent to either mild acid hydrolysis, alkali hydrolysis, or acetylation followed by acetolysis, the resulting products were fractionated by high-pressure liquid chromatography on an Aminex HPX- 42 A column. The results of acid hydrolysis showed only minor quantitative differences in the products released from each strain, with mannose constituting the vast majority of product liberated. The profiles of mannooligosaccharides obtained from either alkali hydrolysis or acetolysis for strain 4918 - 2 showed distinct quantitative differences compared with profiles of the other two strains. Finally, a general characteristic noted is a decrease in the average chain length of mannooligosaccharides in hyphal <b>mannans</b> compared with the yeast counterpart...|$|R
5|$|Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran not having {{enough money to buy}} release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|The DMK party {{celebrated the}} success of Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> with a public {{function}} on 16 October 1958 at the Tamukkam Ground in Madurai. The function, which was attended by 200,000 people, saw Ramachandran being taken in a procession on a chariot drawn by four horses and garlanded twice. He was awarded a golden sword worth 110 pounds by the party leader C. N. Annadurai and member V. R. Nedunchezhiyan. Ramachandran later donated the sword to the Kollur Mookambika Temple. The film's 100th day theatrical run celebrations were held on 30 November 1958 at the Alagappa College in Madurai.|$|E
5|$|Nadodi <b>Mannan</b> was {{produced}} {{on a budget}} of 1.8million, which was considered approximately two-and-a-half times {{more expensive than the}} average Tamil film made at the time. Nearly a year was spent on pre-production and casting. K. Ramnoth was appointed initially to direct the film, but died before production began resulting in Ramachandran taking over the position himself, thereby making his directorial debut. This was the second film produced by Ramachandran, and the first under the production banner of Em.Gee.Yar Pictures, which was handled by Ramachandran, Chakrapani and Veerappan. Kannadasan and Ravindar, who assisted Veerappan, Lakshmanan and Sami with the story, wrote the dialogues. The screenplay was written by the trio of C. Kuppusami, K. Srinivasan and P. Neelakantan. G. K. Ramu, K. Nageswar Rao and R. N. Nagaraja Rao were in charge of cinematography, art direction and stills. K. P. Ramakrishnan and Arunachalam acted as stunt doubles for Ramachandran.|$|E

Phagocytes express cell-surface endocytic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have affinity and efficacy against non-specific microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Most PAMPs that bind to endocytic PRRs and initiate phagocytosis are cell wall components, including complex carbohydrates such as <b>mannans</b> and β-glucans, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycans, and surface proteins. Endocytic PRRs on phagocytes reflect these molecular patterns, with C-type lectin receptors binding to <b>mannans</b> and β-glucans, and scavenger receptors binding to LPS.|$|R
5|$|Ramachandran {{had dreamed}} of making his own film ever since he {{attended}} a screening of Frank Lloyd's historical drama, If I Were King (1938) starring Ronald Colman, in Calcutta. This occurred while he was playing a minor role in Maya Machhindra (1939). He wished {{to make a film}} that would express his political views and interests to the people of Tamil Nadu. To this end, he assembled a team of three people: R. M. Veerappan, V. Lakshmanan and S. K. T. Sami. He gave them suggestions about the outline of the story and urged them to watch If I Were King and two other films: The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), another Colman film, and Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952). After several brainstorming sessions, the team came up with a story loosely based on the three films and decided on the title Nadodi <b>Mannan.</b> The trio then helped make it look more Indian.|$|E
5|$|Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides {{that are}} of {{interest}} to the medical field, because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T.mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions—has been shown to consist of a <b>mannan</b> backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T.mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory, protecting against radiation, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects.|$|E

His next two Tamil films, the fantasy comedy Athisaya Piravi, (a remake of Chiranjeevi's 1988 film Yamudiki Mogudu) which also released in 1990 and the family drama Dharmadorai (1991), did above-average business at the box office. His stint with Bollywood continued since the past decade as {{he went on to}} star in more Hindi films. Hum released in 1991 saw him doing the second main lead with Amitabh Bachchan became an inspiration for Badsha. In 1991, he worked with Mani Ratnam in Thalapathi, which was heavily inspired by the Mahabharata. in which he co-starred with actor Mammooty; the film dealt with the friendship between two unknown characters based on Karna and Duryodhana, respectively, and was set in a more contemporary milieu and was both critically acclaimed and successful upon release. He went on to appear in remakes of films from other languages, mostly from Hindi and Telugu. Annamalai, which released in 1992, was yet another friendship-centric film and was loosely based on the 1987 Bollywood film Khudgarz. <b>Mannan,</b> directed by P. Vasu, a remake of Kannada actor Rajkumar's 1986 blockbuster Anuraga Aralithu, also was released in 1992 and became a box office success. Rajinikanth wrote his first screenplay for the film Valli (1993), in which he also made a special appearance. He also starred in the film Yejaman, in which he played the role of Vaanavaraayan, a village chieftain.
