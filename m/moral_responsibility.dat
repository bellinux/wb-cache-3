5|$|According to {{a verdict}} {{delivered}} by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek offstage and thus had <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally liable, {{and most of the}} blame lay with promoters and security members. The acquittal was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by the suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. <b>Moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
5|$|While the Social Gospel {{was making}} inroads within the denomination, the {{ministry}} of baseball player turned evangelist Billy Sunday demonstrated that Evangelicalism and the revivalist tradition was still a force within the denomination. Sunday became the most prominent evangelist of the early 20th century, preaching to over 100 million people and leading an estimated million to conversion throughout his career. Whereas Stelzle emphasized the social aspects of Christianity, Sunday's focus was primarily on the conversion and <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> would be required.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{specific}} proposed amendments to European directive 2007 / 36 /EC and 2013 / 34 /EU, and evaluates as to how such amendments alter shareholders’ <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> To be responsible is here simply {{to be understood as}} being under an obligation, where an obligation is a requirement on an agent to either act or refrain from acting in a given way. In order to determine whether changes to the proposed directives alter shareholders’ <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> the following analysis argues that {{we need to look at}} three factors: whether such changes do in fact alter the subject matter of shareholders’ obligations, a closer look at the agent i. e. shareholders to whom the obligation is to apply and thirdly whether they do actually apply...|$|R
5|$|Rotblat {{retired from}} St Bartholomew's in 1976. In 1975–1976, he was Montague Visiting Professor of International Relations at the University of Edinburgh. He {{believed}} that scientists have an individual <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> and, {{just as the}} Hippocratic Oath provides a code of conduct for physicians, he thought that scientists should have their own code of moral conduct, a Hippocratic Oath for scientists. During his tenure {{as president of the}} Pugwash conferences, Rotblat nominated Israeli nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu for the Nobel Peace Prize every year from 1988 to 2004. Vanunu had disclosed the extent of Israel's nuclear weapons programme and consequently spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 years in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 2012 the Czech {{police arrested}} Randy Blythe {{for his actions}} during a 2010 concert in Prague. Blythe was charged, in the Prague 8 {{district}} court, with committing intentional bodily harm after an incident in which a 19-year-old fan climbed up onto the stage with him. Blythe pushed the teen who then hit {{his head on the}} floor when he fell and later died of the injury. Lamb of God canceled their upcoming tour but resumed touring 38 days later when Blythe was released on bail. Blythe was indicted on the charges in December 2012. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage and had <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the fan's death but he was not criminally liable. The decision was appealed, and upheld by the Prague High Court in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility,</b> particularly as wives and mothers. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even {{to be able to}} independently read the Bible, but most commentators of the period, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Girls were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, such as Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{framework}} for analyzing the <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of global agents in what I call the Global Health Crisis (GHC), with special attention devoted to the <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of pharmaceutical companies. The main contribution of this thesis is {{to provide a}} general account of the <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of different global players, mapping the different kinds of duties they have, their content and force, and their relation to the responsibilities of other relevant actors in the GHC. I also apply this account to current debates surrounding the need for reforms to the international legal rules addressing the GHC, notably the TRIPs regime. In doing so, this thesis will discuss the allocation of responsibilities for the GHC among different global players, such as state and non-state actors, the latter including pharmaceutical companies. In order to investigate the allocation of duties, I will first analyze the object of such allocation which constitutes the object of the current GHC (Part A); then the agents responsible for addressing this crisis (Part B); and finally, existing institutional alternatives to reform the international legal rules addressing the GHC, such as the TRIPs regime (Part C). This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
40|$|It’s widely {{agreed that}} animal pain matters morally – that we shouldn’t, for instance, starve our animal companions, {{and that we}} should provide medical care to sick or injured {{agricultural}} animals, and not only because it benefits us to do so. But do we have the same <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> towards wild animals? Should we feed them if they are starving, and intervene to prevent them from undergoing other forms of suffering, for instance from predation? Using an example that includes both wild and domesticated animals, I outline two contrasting ways of thinking about our <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> with respect to assisting animals that are apparently in need. One approach is based entirely around animals’ capacities; the other takes context and historical relations into account as well. While not attempting to adjudicate between these views, I’ll point out the advantages and difficulties of both...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} individuals’ lay understandings of <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> between adult kin members. Moral sentiments and practical judgments {{are important in}} shaping kinship responsibilities. The article discusses how judgments on requests of support can be reflexive and critical, taking into account many factors, including merit, social proximity, a history of personal encounters, overlapping commitments, and moral identity in the family. In so doing, we argue that <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> are contextual and relational. We also analyze how class, gender, and capabilities affect how individuals imagine, expect and discuss care responsibilities. We also offer a critique of social capital theory of families, suggesting that their versions of morality are instrumental, alienated, and restrictive. Although Bourdieu’s concept of habitus overlaps with our proposed moral sentiments approach, the former does not adequately address moral concerns, commitments, and evaluations. The article aims {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of everyday morality by drawing upon different literatures in sociology, moral philosophy, postcommunism, and development studies...|$|R
25|$|Whether people {{naturally}} {{adhere to}} an incompatibilist model {{of free will}} has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive – it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality). Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive – it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> in general. Joshua Knobe and Shaun Nichols have proposed that incompatibilism {{may or may not}} be intuitive, and that it is dependent to some large degree upon the circumstances; whether or not the crime incites an emotional response – for example if it involves harming another human being. They found that belief in free will is a cultural universal, and that the majority of participants said that (a) our universe is indeterministic and (b) <b>moral</b> <b>responsibility</b> is not compatible with determinism.|$|E

40|$|In {{organisational}} change processes {{people inside}} organisations {{have to decide}} about difficult and possibly conflicting issues. These issues concern not only choices about the most effective or efficient change process {{but also about the}} <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> associated with it. This brings along an intricate and paradoxical situation for the decision makers of the organisational change process. They have a functional responsibility to comply with the goals of the organisation. They also have <b>moral</b> <b>responsibilities</b> when their decisions affect people inside and outside of the organisation. On top of this they have limited freedom of action because several groups can influence the decision making. This problematic situation leads to the following central research question: How can decision makers deal with moral questions which arise between interests of the organisation and interests of employees in processes of organisational change? Because {{of the nature of the}} central research question an inductive research design is necessary. This study seeks to gain insights into the way managers can deal with different responsibilities when making decisions about organisational change processes...|$|R
