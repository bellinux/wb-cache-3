50|$|On brass {{instruments}} the <b>mouthpiece</b> is the <b>part</b> {{of the instrument}} placed on the player's lips. The mouthpiece is a simple circular opening that leads, via a semi-spherical or conical cavity, to {{the main body of}} the instrument.|$|R
50|$|On single-reed instruments, {{such as the}} {{clarinet}} and saxophone, the <b>mouthpiece</b> is that <b>part</b> of the instrument to which the reed is attached. Its function is to provide an opening through which air enters the instrument and one end of an air chamber to be set into vibration by {{the interaction between the}} air stream and the reed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mouthpiece</b> is the <b>part</b> of a horse's {{bit that}} goes into the mouth of a horse, resting on the bars of the mouth in the {{sensitive}} interdental space where there are no teeth. The mouthpiece is possibly the most important determinant in the severity and action of the bit. Therefore, it should be carefully considered when choosing a bit for a horse. Some mouthpieces are not allowed in dressage competition.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the <b>mouthpiece</b> opening for <b>part</b> of the wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>mouthpiece</b> is a <b>part</b> {{that the}} user grips {{in the mouth}} to make a {{watertight}} seal. It is a short flattened-oval tube that goes in between the lips, with a curved flange that fits between the lips and the teeth and gums. On the inner ends of the flange there are two tabs with enlarged ends, which are gripped between the teeth. Most recreational diving regulators are fitted with a mouthpiece. In twin-hose regulators and rebreathers, [...] "mouthpiece" [...] may refer to the whole assembly between the two flexible tubes. A mouthpiece prevents clear speech, so a full-face mask is preferred where voice communication is needed.|$|R
25|$|The bailout valve (BOV) is an {{open circuit}} demand valve built into a rebreather <b>mouthpiece</b> or other <b>part</b> of the {{breathing}} loop. It can be isolated while the diver is using the rebreather to recycle breathing gas and opened {{while at the same}} time isolating the breathing loop when a problem causes the diver to bail out onto open circuit. The main distinguishing feature of the BOV is that the same mouthpiece is used for open and closed-circuit, and the diver does not have to shut the Dive/Surface valve, remove it from their mouth, and find and insert the bailout demand valve in order to bail out onto open circuit. Although costly, this reduction in critical steps makes the integrated BOV a significant safety advantage.|$|R
5000|$|The cornett, {{which became}} one of the most popular wind {{instruments}} of the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, was developed from the fingerhole-horn idea. In its most common form it was a gently curved instrument, carved in two halves from wood. The pieces were then glued together and wrapped in black leather (hence the term [...] "black cornett"), and a detachable mouthpiece added. Another variant, called the [...] "mute cornett", was turned from a single piece of wood with the <b>mouthpiece</b> an integral <b>part</b> of the instrument. Because the types of wood used were usually light in colour, these were sometimes referred to as [...] "white cornetts". Amongst the earliest representations of the cornett, showing its characteristic octagonal exterior, is a carving in Lincoln Cathedral from about 1260, which shows an angel apparently playing two cornetti at once. The earliest use of the name in English is in Le Morte d'Arthur from about 1400 where, as in most subsequent sources it is spelled with a single T: [...] "cornet". The spelling with two Ts is a modern convention, to avoid confusion with the nineteenth-century valved brass instrument of that name, though in Old French the spelling cornette is found. The name is a diminutive derived the Latin cornu, [...] "horn".|$|R
