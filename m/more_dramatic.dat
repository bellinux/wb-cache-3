5|$|Bond {{receives}} a spear gun-armed underwater jet pack scuba (allowing the frogman to manoeuvre faster than other frogmen). Designed by Jordan Klein, green dye {{was meant to}} be used by Bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers. Instead Ricou Browning, the film's underwater director, used it to make Bond's arrival <b>more</b> <b>dramatic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adrian Paul {{said that}} Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her {{out as a}} {{different}} character from Tessa. Paul also said that his lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, Lisa {{was more like a}} temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> effect.|$|E

40|$|Esophageal {{injuries}} {{caused by}} the ingestion of corrosive substances (caustic) constitute one of the <b>more</b> <b>dramatics</b> affections in childhood and a challenge for pediatric surgeons. Frequently they leave esophageal strictures hard to treat, that many times require prolonged stricture dilatation and/or replacement of the esophagus.

5|$|Crawford {{continued}} her reign {{as a popular}} movie actress well into the mid-1930s. No More Ladies (1935) co-starred Robert Montgomery and then-husband Franchot Tone, and was a success. Crawford had long pleaded with MGM's head Louis B. Mayer to cast her in <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> roles, and although he was reluctant, he cast her in the sophisticated comedy-drama I Live My Life (1935), directed by W.S. Van Dyke. It was well received by critics and made a larger profit than the studio had expected.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a series}} of {{commercial}} failures, Grant was now more popular than ever and in high demand. According to Vermilye, in 1939, Grant played roles that were <b>more</b> <b>dramatic,</b> albeit with comical undertones. He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film Gunga Din, set at a military station in India. Roles as a pilot opposite Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth in Hawks's Only Angels Have Wings, and a wealthy landowner alongside Carole Lombard in In Name Only followed.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E

5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction on a given crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|He {{also had}} {{recurring}} roles {{on the television}} series Mad About You and Friends, played the title character in the drama Huff (2004–2006), and appeared in the popular stage musical Spamalot. Though originally known as a comic actor, Azaria has also taken on <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> roles, including the TV films Tuesdays With Morrie (1999) and Uprising (2001). He has won six Emmys and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Azaria was married to actress Helen Hunt from 1999 to 2000 and has been married to actress Katie Wright since 2007.|$|E
5|$|Mia Ikumi {{spent a year}} {{designing}} the Tokyo Mew Mew manga before {{the release of the}} first volume in February 2001. The story she originally presented to her editors, Tokyo Black Cat Girl, featured a heroine named Hime Azumi. An intergalactic police officer named Masha gave her the ability to transform into a cat-girl and asked her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Bugs. After the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> series.|$|E
50|$|At {{the height}} of his career, he was greatly admired for his range and versatility, having possessed a {{sufficiently}} accomplished bel canto technique to enable him to sing the music of Handel, Mozart, Rossini, yet power enough to handle the <b>more</b> overtly <b>dramatic</b> roles written by Verdi and Puccini.|$|R
5000|$|Rich Cline of Shadows on the Wall {{gave the}} film a more {{critical}} review, noting {{the film is}} “artfully made…but by fracturing the chronology, it ends up feeling rather long and repetitive.

5|$|Mowry's {{performance}} received {{positive feedback}} from critics. While discussing {{her career in}} his 2010 book Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television, author Bob McCann wrote that Mowry demonstrated maturity through her <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> role in the series. Though critical of the overall show, the Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan was pleased with Mowry's charismatic performance. Melody K. Hoffman of Jet wrote that, through her performance in the show, Mowry had demonstrated her love for acting and her capacity to portray a woman. In a negative review, USA Today's Robert Bianco was uncertain of Mowry's capabilities as a comedic actress, saying that she frequently relied on child acting techniques that were inappropriate for an adult character.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} while the issues of {{increasing}} public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city's economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than 168million dollars for 2005, and a highly skilled workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by access roads and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> harm to the surrounding communities.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} portrays this scene, although {{as usual}} with Matejko's work, it sacrifices some historical reality for <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> presentation. It {{serves as an}} allegory for all three Partitions of Poland (1772, 1793, 1795) and portrays {{a number of major}} historical figures of this era. Rejtan is the most visible, occupying the entire right side of the painting, {{in the midst of his}} dramatic pose which has been compared to Liberty Leading the People. His position on this painting exemplifies the golden ratio.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 2 {{found several}} types of tectonic {{features}} on Enceladus, including troughs, scarps, and belts of grooves and ridges. Results from Cassini suggest that tectonics is the dominant mode of deformation on Enceladus, including rifts, one of the <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> types of tectonic features that were noted. These canyons can be up to 200km long, 5–10km wide, and 1km deep. Such features are geologically young, because they cut across other tectonic features and have sharp topographic relief with prominent outcrops along the cliff faces.|$|E
5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship of morality and human interaction. In this sense he tended to portray <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E
5|$|A notable machinima {{production}} is the comedy series Red vs. Blue created by Rooster Teeth Productions. It has achieved an unparalleled {{level of success}} in Halo machinima in specific, and machinima in general; it is credited with bringing attention to the genre. Red vs. Blue generated annual revenues of US$200,000, and special promotional episodes were commissioned by Bungie. The first series, The Blood Gulch Chronicles, ended on June 28, 2007, after 100 regular episodes and numerous promotional videos. Subsequent series include The Recollection, which contains <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> elements than its comedic predecessor, Project Freelancer, The Chorus Trilogy, and Anthology, the most recent series. Other machinima series include Fire Team Charlie, The Codex, and the in-game interview show This Spartan Life.|$|E
50|$|The opera is {{darker and}} <b>more</b> {{intensely}} <b>dramatic</b> than Meyerbeer's previous works.

Among solo arias, the final aria for the heroine Emma (Il dì cadrà) with solo cor anglais, flutes, clarinets and horns, is especially notable.|$|R
50|$|Nanxi {{started as}} {{combinations}} of Song plays and local folk songs and ballads, using colloquial language and {{large numbers of}} scenes. As with Western operetta, spoken passages alternated with verses (qu) set to popular music. Professional companies of actors performed nanxi in theatres that could hold thousands of spectators. Nanxi developed into the later and <b>more</b> complex <b>dramatic</b> form known as chuanqi, and later still into kunqu.|$|R
50|$|Lauri-Volpi's {{most notable}} {{appearances}} outside Italy also included two seasons at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden—in 1925 and 1936. By the latter date, he had broadened his repertoire, progressing from lyric roles to <b>more</b> taxing <b>dramatic</b> parts. His voice {{began to show}} consequent signs of wear in the 1940s, losing homogeneity. His thrilling top notes remained remarkably intact, however, right through until the 1950s.|$|R
5|$|All beetle larvae {{go through}} several instars, {{which are the}} {{developmental}} stages between each moult. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; it occurs in the Meloidae, Micromalthidae, and Ripiphoridae. The blister beetle Epicauta vittata (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the triungulin, has longer legs to go {{in search of the}} eggs of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the larva of a carabid beetle. In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a scarabaeid larva – the scarabaeidoid stage. Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate larva, which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.|$|E
5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, he secured his {{breakout}} television role as Adam Williams in Cold Feet, {{a character}} he played until 2003. In {{that time he}} also appeared in the film Waking Ned Devine, two series of Playing the Field, Touching Evil, his feature film lead debut Lucky Break, and Paul Greengrass's controversial television film Bloody Sunday, as Ivan Cooper. After Bloody Sunday, Nesbitt started to take on <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> roles, appearing in five series of Murphy's Law (2003–2007), the two-part television film Passer By (2004), Steven Moffat's Jekyll (2007), and the Iraq War drama Occupation (2009). He has also furthered his feature film career by taking roles in Woody Allen's Match Point (2005), the Troubles drama Five Minutes of Heaven (2009), the thriller Outcast (2010), Nadia Tass's Matching Jack (2010), and Emilio Estevez's The Way (2010).

50|$|With Tueur sans gages {{translated}} as The Killer (1959; his second full-length play, the first being Amédée, ou Comment s'en débarrasser in 1954), Ionesco began to explore <b>more</b> sustained <b>dramatic</b> situations featuring <b>more</b> humanized characters.

5000|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews, Film Daily calling it, [...] "A commonplace and inadequately motivated yarn ...", while Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times {{enjoyed it}} somewhat better, applauding the acting, directing and story, describing it as [...] "... a smooth and rather attractive entertainment, remarkable chiefly for its generally adult outlook on things {{and for a}} certain quiet restraint in its <b>more</b> tempestuously <b>dramatic</b> moments." ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Nativity Drama" [...] {{is used by}} Wellesz in his {{discussion}} of the troparion hymns in the Christmas liturgy of Byzantine Rite Churches, from Sophronius in the seventh century.
