5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing {{risk for the}} importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E

5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status. In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|Lactuca sativa is {{a member}} of the Lactuca (lettuce) genus and the Asteraceae (sunflower or aster) family. The species was first {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum. Synonyms for L.sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa, L.scariola var. integrata and L.scariola var. integrifolia. L.scariola is itself a synonym for L.serriola, the common wild or prickly lettuce. L.sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups, subspecies and varieties, which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce. Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia; the closest relationship is to L.serriola, an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{government}} was headed by two consuls, elected annually by the citizens and advised by a senate composed of appointed magistrates. As Roman society was very hierarchical by modern standards, {{the evolution of}} the Roman {{government was}} heavily influenced by the struggle between the patricians, Rome's land-holding aristocracy, who traced their ancestry to the founding of Rome, and the plebeians, the far more numerous citizen-commoners. Over time, the laws that gave patricians exclusive rights to Rome's highest offices were repealed or weakened, and leading plebeian families became full members of the aristocracy. The leaders of the Republic developed a strong tradition and morality requiring public service and patronage in peace and war, making military and political success inextricably linked. Many of Rome's legal and legislative structures (later codified into the Justinian Code, and again into the Napoleonic Code) can still be observed throughout Europe and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in modern nation states and international organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> still does not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.|$|E
5|$|After being {{admitted}} to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion. While the sport's lack of a following in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> was a factor, more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather. Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players, but the effort failed. Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature {{a significant number of}} MLB participants. The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.|$|E
