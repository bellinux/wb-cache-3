40|$|Campylobacter spp. {{are still}} the major {{bacterial}} cause of infectious diarrheal illness in Belgium and in many other countries. In 2003, the Superior Health Council of the Belgian Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment initiated a risk assessment of Campylobacter spp. contamination in poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> The limitation in data for the local situation in Belgium in consumer behaviour and also the semi-quantitative nature of concentration of Campylobacter spp. due to presence/absence testing was identified as an important information gap. The {{aim of this study}} is to refine and update with recently collected data the previous retail to fork quantitative risk assessment model for poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> to estimate the risk for campylobacteriosis for the Belgian consumer. In the proposed risk assessment model, data were included from a 2007 national baseline study providing quantitative Campylobacter data in Belgian poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> Survival data describing effects of undercooking, cooling and freezing on Campylobacter spp. in poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparation</b> are also introduced in the model. Detailed data on poultry consumption and food handling and preparation practices by Belgian consumers are included in the model. A probabilistic model was developed in Excel and @Risk. The risk estimate of the model relates to the incidence of illness (campylobacteriosis) in the Belgian population due to consumption of poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> The model predicts a yearly incidence of 0. 09 % due to the consumption of poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> and current retail to fork practices. By scenario and sensitivity analysis, possible risk mitigation strategies were evaluated. Setting an action limit and rejecting highly contaminated (> 100 CFU/g) poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> before distribution to the market would lead to a fifty-percent reduction of incidence of illness. Recommendation to consumers to freeze poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> could result in a fourfold reduction, indicating the importance of home freezing. The results also indicate that good kitchen hygiene could reduce the risk of illness with major impact of prevention of cross-contamination (91 % reduction of illness). Only a minor contribution of undercooking (~ 0. 01 %) was estimated out of the scenario analysis...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether Döner kebabs sold in Italy comply with legal {{labelling}} requirements. A checklist of EU labelling requirements was drawn up and nine labels of Döner kebab marketed in the province of Modena were collected to evaluate the mandatory information laid down in article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1169 / 2011 together with the mandatory requirements of Regulation (EC) 853 / 2004 for <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> The study showed that different additives are commonly used in Döner kebabs, including E 621 (monosodium glutamate). This additive is not included among the ingredients authorized for the <b>meat</b> <b>preparation</b> food category. Eight frozen Döner kebab samples were taken and a visual assessment and a histologic examination were performed to verify potential changes in the meat’s inner muscle fibre structure that could allow the product to be considered among <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> or <b>meat</b> products. The Döner kebab labels showed several systematically deficient regulatory requirements in both extrinsic defects (not related to food composition) and aspects concerning the protection of consumers’ health. Histological examination showed that the tissue was moderately swollen, but the muscle fibre structure was intact. Kebab can be reasonably classified as a <b>meat</b> <b>preparation</b> thereby precluding the use monosodium glutamate (E 621) as an ingredient...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain insight into {{processing}} practices in the poultry sector contributing to the variability in Campylobacter contamination in Belgian chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> This was achieved by company profiling of eleven food business operators, in order to evaluate variation of processing management, in addition to statistical modelling of microbiological testing results for Campylobacter spp. contamination in 656 end product samples. Almost half (48 %) of chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparation</b> samples were positive for Campylobacter spp. Results revealed a statistically significant variation in Campylobacter contamination between 11 chicken meat producers across Belgium at both quantitative and qualitative detection levels. All producers provided Campylobacter-positive samples, but prevalence ranged from 9 % up to 85 % at single producer level. The presence or addition of skin during production of chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> resulted in almost 2. 2 -fold increase in the probability of a sample being positive for Campylobacter, while chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> made from frozen meat, or partly containing pre-frozen meat, had a significant (Odds Ratio= 0. 41; CI 95 % 0. 18 : 0. 98) lower probability of being positive for Campylobacter.

40|$|Ascorbic acid is a commonly-used food {{additive}} {{permitted in}} prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations.</b> Consequently, {{the addition of}} this antioxidant is subject to a specific packaging authorization. In this survey 180 samples of not prepacked fresh <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> have been analyzed in order to evaluate the diffusion of not authorized ascorbic acid additions. The ascorbic acid has been determined by a high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection method, validated according to the European Legislation. Quantifiable concentrations of ascorbic acid (> LOQ = 20. 1 mg · kg- 1) were registered in 33 samples confirming a wide diffusion of not authorized additions. Moreover, low concentrations not attributable to a additives additions were detected in 14 samples. Ascorbic acid sources (tomato) were declared on the label of these samples.

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} instrument comprising {{a combined}} assessment of core control and assurance activities and a microbial assessment instrument {{were used to}} measure the performance of current food safety management systems (FSMSs) of two poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparation</b> companies. The high risk status of the company's contextual factors, i. e., starting from raw materials (poultry carcasses) with possible high numbers and prevalence of pathogens such as Campylobacter spp., requires advanced core control and assurance activities in the FSMS to guarantee food safety. The level of the core FSMS activities differed between the companies, and this difference was reflected in overall microbial quality (mesophilic aerobic count), presence of hygiene indicators (Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli), and contamination with pathogens such as Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter spp. The food safety output expressed as a microbial safety profile was related to the variability in the prevalence and contamination levels of Campylobacter spp. in poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> found in a Belgian nationwide study. Although a poultry meat processing company could have an advanced FSMS in place and a good microbial profile (i. e., lower prevalence of pathogens, lower microbial numbers, and less variability in microbial contamination), these positive factors might not guarantee pathogen-free products. Contamination could be attributed to the inability to apply effective interventions to reduce or eliminate pathogens in the production chain of (raw) poultry <b>meat</b> <b>preparations...</b>|$|R

40|$|From February to November 2007, chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> (n = 656) were sampled at 11 {{processing}} companies across Belgium. All {{samples were}} tested for Campylobacter by enrichment culture and by direct plating according to standard methods.

The study revealed a statistically significant variation in Campylobacter contamination levels between companies; processors with a wider frequency distribution range of Campylobacter counts provided chicken <b>meat</b> <b>preparations</b> with higher Campylobacter incidences and concentrations. There was no significant difference between the counts of Campylobacter spp. in various preparation types. However, the Campylobacter counts and incidences in chicken wings were the highest and portioned-form products (legs, wings, and breasts) showed a higher probability of being Campylobacter positive compared to minced-form products (sausages, burgers, and minced meat). The proportion of Campylobacter-positive samples was significantly higher in July than in other months. Recovery of Campylobacter spp. recovery by direct plating was higher (41. 0 %) compared to detection after enrichment (24. 2 %). Statistical modeling of the survey data showed that the likelihood of obtaining a positive result by enrichment culture increases with an increase in the Campylobacter concentration in the sample.

As the same somatic mutations occur in sporadic adenomas and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) -related adenomas, similar exogenous factors may play a role in the development of both types of adenoma. In a case control study among 57 sporadic colorectal adenoma cases and 62 adenoma cases from HNPCC families (and 148 adenoma-free controls) from the Netherlands, we examined whether <b>meat</b> {{consumption and}} <b>preparation</b> are similarly associated with sporadic and suspected HNPCC colorectal adenomas. Frequency of meat consumption was not significantly associated with adenoma risk in our population of sporadic and HNPCC family cases and controls (Odds Ratios (OR) for high versus low consumption were 1. 0 and 0. 6, respectively). Interestingly, consumption of red <b>meat</b> and specific <b>preparation</b> methods (i. e., “not adding any water” and “ closed lid with most meat types”) slightly, but non-significantly, increased the risk of adenomas in the sporadic group only (OR, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 4. 1, 0. 7 – 23. 0, 2. 0, 0. 6 – 6. 5 and 2. 6, 0. 9 – 7. 2, respectively). This is the first study to examine possible differences or similarities in risk factors for sporadic and HNPCC colorectal carcinogenesis.
