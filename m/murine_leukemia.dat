25|$|There {{is concern}} that insertional {{mutagenesis}} due to {{integration into the}} host genome might lead to cancer or leukemia.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that receptors for retroviral gp 70 share structural elements with the antigen-binding sites of anti-retroviral gp 70 antibodies was investigated. A monoclonal antibody (1416) was produced that reacted with the gp 70 of a cloned recombinant leukemogenic retrovirus, termed P 1. An antiidiotypic antiserum raised to 1416 was tested {{for its ability}} to bind to the thymic leukemia induced by P 1 (P 1 Thy). A membrane structure was identified on the surface of P 1 Thy that reacted with the antibody against the idiotypic determinant of 1416. A similar structure was identified on the surface of several different, independently derived <b>murine</b> <b>leukemias</b> of T cell, B cell, and erythroid lineage. The expression of the idiotype-like determinant on these leukemia cells was independent of the serological relatedness of their expressed retroviral envelope glycoproteins to P 1 gp 70. The determinant recognized by the antiidiotype was not detected on normal lymphoid cells. The recognition by the anti-(anti-gp 70) idiotype of determinants on unrelated <b>murine</b> <b>leukemias</b> suggests that receptors for different leukemogenic viruses may share common structures...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{heterogeneity}} of cancer influences {{the trajectory of}} tumor progression and may underlie clinical variation in therapy response. To model such heterogeneity, we produced genetically and pathologically accurate mouse models of common forms of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and developed methods to mimic standard induction chemotherapy and efficiently monitor therapy response. We see that murine AMLs harboring two common human AML genotypes show remarkably diverse responses to conventional therapy that mirror clinical experience. Specifically, <b>murine</b> <b>leukemias</b> expressing the AML 1 /ETO fusion oncoprotein, associated with a favorable prognosis in patients, show a dramatic response to induction chemotherapy owing to robust activation of the p 53 tumor suppressor network. Conversely, <b>murine</b> <b>leukemias</b> expressing MLL fusion proteins, associated with a dismal prognosis in patients, are drug-resistant due to an attenuated p 53 response. Our studies highlight the importance of genetic information in guiding the treatment of human AML, functionally establish the p 53 network as a central determinant of chemotherapy response in AML, and demonstrate that genetically engineered mouse models of human cancer can accurately predict therapy response in patients...|$|R

Germ-free mice are therefore not virus-free.
