It is designed to damp bunches for 7 vertical damping times while operating at a repetition rate of 360 Hz. Because of these requirements on the emittance and the damping per bunch, the ring operates at 1. 8 GeV and is relatively large, allowing more bunches to be damped at once...|$|E

This additive is a long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon and termed as S in this study. The properties evaluated included the rheological properties of the modified bitumen. The properties were evaluated using dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), rolling thin film oven (RTFOT), pressure aging vessel (PAV), and Viscometer, Penetro <b>meter,</b> <b>Ring</b> and Ball test. Results from the study indicated {{that the effect of}} S on the binder depends on the quantity of the additive used and test temperature. The general trend is with an increase in the additive the binder viscosity decreases at high temperature, however at low temperature the binder becomes more stiffen, this results in considerable reduction of the penetration and increasing the softening point. Adding S to the binder showed considerable increase in complex modulus and decrease phase angle of the modified bitumen at both medium and high temperatures, with minimal effect on the aging of the binder...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the smart}} {{metering}} systems which can monitor {{the amount of}} the gas or the electric power at each home in real time are being developed broadly. In these systems, each meter has a communication function and forms a wireless network with each other. Since these meters are usually driven by the small battery by which capacity is restricted, it is important to control the power consumption and to prolong the operating time of such a smart metering system. In cases where such a smart <b>meter</b> <b>ring</b> system is installed in a large-scale apartment house, the allocation density of meter becomes high and a wireless multi-hop network with very many adjacent nodes will be constructed. In the wireless multi-hop network where installation density is high, since many detours are obtainable, {{in the case of a}} method which performs intermittent operation, it is expectable to control power consumption by reduction of waiting time. On the other hand, application of the simple routing protocol only based on the number of hop from a sink node will generate the problem that the difference of the power consumption between the nodes with the same number of hop to the sink node will become large. For example, at a node located in the location close to the sink node, since there are mor...|$|E

The treatments were arranged using randomized complete block design (RCBD) in triplicate. For sowing, hand drill was used to maintain row to row distance of 40  cm. After a week, plant to plant distance (30  cm) was maintained by thinning. The recommended rate of N and K (25 and 25  kg ha− 1) were applied in control using urea and sulfate of potash (SOP). Remaining N and P were applied through urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP) after analysis and calculations for available N and P in treatments where RP-EC was applied. Rhizobia and PSM inoculum were prepared using standard methods as described above and were applied in all the treatments. The inoculated seeds were sown in respective plots (1.5  ×  1.5  m 2). Similar standard methods as described in pot experiments were adopted for the estimation of agronomic and yield parameters at maturity and P contents from grain and straw samples (Olsen et al. 1954; Ryan et al. 2001).

40|$|Taenia solium, a {{parasitic}} cestode {{that affects}} humans and pigs, {{is the leading}} cause of preventable epilepsy in the developing world. T. solium eggs are released into the environment through the stool of humans infected with an adult intestinal tapeworm (a condition called taeniasis), and cause cysticercosis when ingested by pigs or other humans. A control strategy to intervene within high-risk foci in endemic communities has been proposed as an alternative to mass antihelminthic treatment. In this ring strategy, antihelminthic treatment is targeted to humans and pigs residing within a 100 meter radius of a pig heavily-infected with cysticercosis. Our aim was to describe the roaming ranges of pigs in this region, and to evaluate whether the 100 <b>meter</b> radius <b>rings</b> encompass areas where risk factors for T. solium transmission, such as open human defecation and dense pig activity, are concentrated. In this study, we used Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to track pig roaming ranges in two rural villages of northern Peru. We selected 41 pigs from two villages to participate in a 48 -hour tracking period. Additionally, we surveyed all households to record the locations of open human defecation areas. We found that pigs spent a median of 82. 8 % (IQR: 73. 5, 94. 4) of their time roaming within 100 meters of their homes. The size of home ranges varied significantly by pig age, and 93 % of the total time spent interacting with open human defecation areas occurred within 100 meters of pig residences. These results indicate that 100 <b>meter</b> radius <b>rings</b> around heavily-infected pigs adequately capture the average pig's roaming area (i. e., home range) and represent an area where the great majority of exposure to human feces occurs...|$|R

CHALLENGER'S echo sounder, it has, until now, beem an interesting matter for many marine scientists and fishermen. The author had some observations of DSLs {{in the southern}} area off Kyushu and the Philippine Sea by the fish finder, NEC 1620 type, and 6 -feet Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl (IKMT) net (see Fig. 1 and 3). All over the above mentioned area the DSLs showed remarkable diurnal migration and always there appeared, on echogram, thick lines near the surface during night and at about 400 m or 700 m depth during daytime, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. As the DSLs usually moved up to about 100 m depth one hour after sunset, the author carried out 20 hauls of 6 -feet Isaacs-Kidd net (19 h 00 m- 20 h 00 m; 15 hauls, daytime; 5 hauls) from 16 th June to 11 th July 1963 for collecting organisms of the DSLs. Beside this, the author carried out tuna longline 10 hauls to clarify the relation between tuna food and the net collection, but {{there was very little}} primary collection. The details of the catch with IKMT net are shown in Table 1 (number of catch per each haul) and, in Table 2 (the diurnal variation of catch) and organisms contained in tuna stomach are shown in Table 3.

This {{was part of a}} larger, game fishery enhancement study (Lake Mead Fertilization Project), designed to assess feasability of increasing survivorship of larval/juvenile shad by boosting phosphate levels, thereby increasing algal and zooplankton biomass, during the shad spawning period. Shad are the primary forage base for the striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and black bass (Macropterus salmoides) fisheries. Weekly samples were taken by night surface trawl with a 1 <b>meter</b> diameter <b>ring</b> net, from early June to mid-August, at 12 stations in 1988 and 21 stations in 1989. To examine vertical distribution, depth series samples were taken with a Tucker Trawl at some stations and dates. Chlorophyll a concentrations and Daphnia pulex egg/adult female ratios, used as indicators of resource availability, were also determined for some stations and dates. Patterns of abundance were analyzed with log-log regressions of shad abundance on resource availability and more complex models including large-scale geographic factors with chlorophyll a. In 1988 shad abundance was not significantly correlated (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) with chlorophyll a concentration, or Daphnia egg ratios, but was significantly higher in west-side coves. Conversely, in 1989 abundance correlated significantly with chlorophyll a and Daphnia egg ratios, and the west-side effect was insignificant. Abundance was not correlated with distance from inflow, independent of chlorophyll a, in either year. To conclude, there was an apparent link between resource availability and young shad abundance, with evaluation of this relationship being confounded in 1988 by lowered predation in the west-side coves. There was little temporal or spatial variation in mean length from 20 millimeters total length, possibly due to a combination of net bias and selective predation upon larger fish.

40|$|Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) is {{upgrading}} the Proton Storage Ring (PSR) for the Short Pulse Spallation Source, to deliver 200 microamperes (m A) of beam current {{to a new}} target assembly [1]. Previous operation had been limited to 70 m A, partly {{as a consequence of}} the peak radiofrequency (RF) voltage available from the h= 1 buncher. After an extensive series of performance tests in 1996, an upgrade was proposed to the 2. 8 Megahertz (MHz) cathode-follower RF amplifier system and the ferrite-loaded gap assembly. A new intermediate power amplifier (IPA) was designed and installed at the ring, to eliminate a troublesome oscillation which occurred when the final power amplifier (FPA) was operated in class A. This also increased the drive to the FPA to raise the gap voltage. The cathode-follower FPA was modified to accept the direct connection of a pair of short transmission line feeders from the IPA. The beam gap was replaced with one having larger ceramic insulating sleeves in a simplified mechanical configuration. A new RF coupling loop/ferrite bias conductor was designed to tightly couple the two halves of the ferrite-loaded resonant circuit connected to the gap, to improve waveform symmetry and to reduce the effects of gain differences in the amplifiers. Improvements were made to the amplitude feedback controller and a phase controller was designed and installed. Changes to the utility systems, the controls, and the power supplies completed this upgrade in 1998. A description of the circuit modeling and the hardware changes in the equipment will be presented. As demonstrated, the upgraded RF buncher has delivered the specified performance at LANSCE [2]. 1 ORIGINAL RF BUNCHER The PSR utilizes a RF barrier system to control longitudinal beam distribution. The 90. 2 <b>meter</b> circumference <b>ring</b> has a rotational frequency of 2. 79513 MHz, hereafter referred to as 2. 8 MHz. With a bunch length of 250 nanoseconds (ns), there is a 107 ns longitudinal space kept clear to allow for beam extraction. The original h= 1 RF system has been providing up to 13 kilovolts (kV) of 2. 8 MHz voltage at the buncher gap...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spindle {{speed is}} an {{important}} parameter {{for the production of}} jute yarn [1]. An Apron Draft spinning frame was modified in to ring system by incorporating rings and travelers instead of flyers. The experiments were performed for investigating the effect of spindle speed on textile properties and productivity of jute yarn of 103 tex. The spindle speed was varied from 5000 rpm to 9000 rpm. The experiments were performed with Bangla White B (BWB) grade jute sliver of finisher drawing of linear density 2415 tex (70 lb/spy). The draft ratio and the twist used in the experiments were 23 and 240 tpm (turns per <b>meter)</b> respectively. The <b>ring</b> size was KW (4) 76 mm Ø. Steel travelers number 1, Type G, semicircular in shape were used in the experiment. Ten runs were performed for the experiment at the standard atmospheric condition, 20 + 2 ˚C, and relative humidity 65 % + 2 %. The nominal count of the yarn produced was 103 tex. The yarns produced through the experiments were tested for different textile properties. Analysis of the test results shows that the spindle speed greatly influences the textile properties, such as strength, elongation, yarn breakage, productivity, quality ratio etc. of produced yarn. In consideration of the productivity, quality and other textile properties of the yarn, the optimum spindle speed was determined for the production of fine jute yarn of 103 tex...|$|R
40|$|The Antwerp {{ring road}} has a traffic density of 300, 000 {{vehicles}} {{per day and}} borders the city center. The 'Ringland project' aims to change the current 'open air ring road' into a 'filtered tunneled ring road', putting the entire urban ring road into a tunnel and thus filtering air pollution. We conducted a health impact assessment (HIA) to quantify the possible benefit of a 'filtered tunneled ring road', {{as compared to the}} 'open air ring road' scenario, on air quality and its long-term health effects. We modeled the change in annual ambient PM 2. 5 and NO 2 concentrations by covering 15 kilometers of the Antwerp ring road in high resolution grids using the RIO-IFDM street canyon model. The exposure-response coefficients used were derived from a literature review: all-cause mortality, life expectancy, cardiopulmonary diseases and childhood Forced Vital Capacity development (FVC). Our model predicts changes between - 1. 5 and + 2 μg/m³ in PM 2. 5 within a 1, 500 meter radius around the ring road, for the 'filtered tunneled ring road' scenario as compared to an 'open air ring road'. These estimated annual changes were plotted against the population exposed to these differences. The calculated change of PM 2. 5 is associated with an expected annual decrease of 21 deaths (95 % CI 7 to 41). This corresponds with 11. 5 deaths avoided per 100, 000 inhabitants (95 % CI 3. 9 - 23) in the first 500 <b>meters</b> around the <b>ring</b> road every year. Of 356 schools in a 1, 500 meter perimeter around the ring road changes between - 10 NO 2 and + 0. 17 μg/m³ were found, corresponding to FVC improvement of between 3 and 64 ml among school-age children. The predicted decline in lung cancer mortality and incidence of acute myocardial infarction were both only 0. 1 per 100, 000 inhabitants or less. The expected change in PM 2, 5 and NO 2 by covering the entire urban ring road in Antwerp is associated with considerable health gains for the approximate 352, 000 inhabitants living in a 1, 500 meter perimeter around the current open air ring road...|$|R
