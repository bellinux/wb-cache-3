50|$|This {{species has}} {{confused}} British entomologists for years. Since its discovery in Britain {{it has been}} {{thought to be a}} form or a subspecies of the brown argus (Aricia agestis) and as well as a species in its own right. Since 1967 all brown arguses in the north of England and Scotland have been classified as this species. In the last few years genetic studies have shown that some of the colonies along the border of the two species ranges are still being wrongly classified and some colonies in the north of England are now thought to be A. agestis. So far as is known their ranges do not overlap in the UK. The Scottish form is visually quite distinct from the brown argus. It usually has a small white dot in the centre of the upperside forewing and the black spots on the underside are missing leaving larger white spots on the light brown background. The northern English populations belong to a form called salmacis (called the Durham argus in English) and are very similar to the brown argus including the presence of black spots on the under-wing (see photo) hence all the confusion. In Europe where it is known as the <b>mountain</b> <b>argus,</b> it is widespread in Scandinavia and mountainous regions of central, southern and eastern Europe. The species is considered locally rare in Britain, and the UK has established a detailed Biodiversity Action Plan to conserve this species along with a small number of other butterfly species.|$|E

50|$|Darwin Creek {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{perennial}} streams in three million-acre (12,000 km²) Death Valley National Park. Darwin Falls and Creek are fed by the Darwin Wash, which is in turn fed by the volcanic tableland of the Darwin Bench between the Inyo <b>Mountains</b> and the <b>Argus</b> Range. The small, narrow valley where the creek and falls are located features a rare collection of riparian greenery in the vast desert and is home to indigenous fauna such as quail. The falls themselves support several small fern gullys.|$|R
40|$|This {{dictionary}} {{is primarily}} of the Death Valley variety {{of what has}} come to be known in the linguistic and anthropological literature in recent years as Panamint (e. g., Freeze and Iannucci 1979; Lamb 1958 and 1964; McLaughlin 1987; Miller 1984), or sometimes Panamint Shoshone (Miller et al. 1971). In the nineteenth century and up to the middle of this century, it was often called Coso (sometimes spelled Koso) or Coso Shoshone (e. g., Kroeber 1925; Lamb 1958). In aboriginal times and even well into this century, Panamint was spoken by small bands of people living in southeastern California and extreme southwestern Nevada in the valleys and mountain ranges east of the Sierra Nevada. Thus, Panamint territory included the southern end of Owens Valley around Owens Lake, the Coso Range and Little Lake area, the southern end of Eureka Valley, Saline Valley and the eastern slopes of the Inyo <b>Mountains,</b> the <b>Argus</b> Range, northern Panamint Valley and the Panamint Mountains, northern and central Death Valley, the Grapevine Mountains and Funeral Range, the Amargosa Desert and area around Beatty, Nevada (see Maps, pp. x-xi; also Kroeber 1925 : 589 - 90 and Steward 1938 : 70 ff).

50|$|Most of the galliform {{birds are}} more or less resident, but some of the smaller {{temperate}} species (such as quail) do migrate over considerable distances. Altitudinal migration is evidently quite common amongst montane species, and a few species of subtropical and subarctic regions must reach their watering and/or foraging areas through sustained flight. Species known to make extensive flights include the ptarmigans, sage-grouse (Centrocercus), crested partridge, green peafowl, crested <b>argus,</b> <b>mountain</b> peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron inopinatum), koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), Reeves's pheasant and (Syrmaticus reevesii). Other species—most of the New World quails (also known as the toothed quails), the enigmatic stone partridge (Ptilopachus petrosus) of Africa, guineafowl, and eared pheasants (Crossoptilon)—are all notable for their daily excursions on foot which may take them many miles in a given day.|$|R
40|$|Inversion of 4036 P wave {{travel time}} {{residuals}} from 429 local earthquakes using a tomographic scheme provides information about three-dimensional upper crustal velocity {{variations in the}} Indian Wells Valley-Coso region of southeastern California. The residuals are calculated relative to a Coso-specific velocity model, corrected for station elevation, weighted, and back-projected along their ray paths through models defined with layers of blocks. Slowness variations in the surface layer reflect local geology, including slow velocities for the sedimentary basins of Indian Wells and Rose valleys and relatively fast velocities for the Sierra Nevada and <b>Argus</b> <b>Mountains.</b> In the depth range of 3 – 5 km the inversion images an area of reduced compressional velocity in western and northern Indian Wells Valley but finds no major velocity variations beneath the Coso volcanic field to the north. These {{results are consistent with}} a recent study of anomalous shear wave attenuation in the Coso region. Between 5 and 10 km depth, low-velocity areas (7 % slow) appear {{at the southern end of}} the Coso volcanics, reaching east to the Coso Basin. Numerical tests of the inversion's resolution and sensitivity to noise indicate that these major anomalies are significant and well-resolved, while other apparent velocity variations in poorly sampled areas are probably artifacts. The seismic data alone are not sufficient to uniquely characterize the physical state of these low-velocity regions. Because of the Coso region's history of Pleistocene bimodal volcanism, high heat flow, geothermal activity, geodetic deformation, and seismic activity, one possibility is to link the zones of decreased P velocity to contemporary magmatic activity...|$|R
