50|$|Several {{newspapers}} were published weekly in Bundaberg between 1880 and 1900, with two tri-weeklies, The Star and The Mail settling {{the market in}} the early 20th century. A third newspaper, the Daily News, was launched in 1907 amid local political rivalries. In 1908, the Bundaberg Star was incorporated with the Bundaberg Daily News and, in 1925, the Bundaberg Daily News and The <b>Mail</b> <b>merged</b> <b>to</b> become the Bundaberg News and Mail. In 1942, the abbreviated NewsMail masthead replaced the original name.|$|R
50|$|Locoscript version 1, {{which was}} bundled with the PCW 8256 and 8512, had no spell checker or <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> facilities. Version 2, which was bundled with the PCW 9512, {{included}} a spellchecker and could provide <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> by interfacing <b>to</b> other products from Locomotive Software, such as LocoMail and LocoFile. Locoscript 2 also expanded the character set to 400.|$|R

The [...] "Full Screen" [...] mode (introduced in Mac OS X Lion) hides the menubar and toolbars, allowing users to focus on a single document without being distracted by other windows on the screen. Earlier versions featured <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> which automatically populated custom fields with contact data from Address Book or from Numbers to create personalized documents. For example, if a user wanted to send one letter to three different people, <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> allowed him <b>to</b> create a single document with placeholder fields that were populated when printing. The <b>Mail</b> <b>Merge</b> feature was completely removed in version 5. Tables and charts pasted from Numbers are automatically updated if the original spreadsheet is changed.|$|R

5000|$|While its utility {{for larger}} {{organizations}} {{is limited by}} its use of proprietary native [...]WKS (spreadsheet), [...]WDB (database), and [...]WPS (word processor) file formats, the simplicity and ease of integrating database/spreadsheet data into word processor documents (e.g., <b>mail</b> <b>merge)</b> allow it <b>to</b> remain an option for some small and home-based business owners. Version 4.5a is particularly noted in this respect. The database management system, while a [...] "flat file" [...] (i.e., non-relational) allows the novice user to perform complex transformations through formulas (which use standard algebraic syntax and can be self-referential) and user-defined reports which can be copied as text to the clipboard.

40|$|This paper explores one of {{the current}} {{innovation}} waves within computing technology, that of the application of Autonomic Computing (AC) to the marketing domain – termed ―Autonomic Marketing‖, the result being an adaptive, highly effective marketing strategy set to significantly change target marketing and a company’s relationship with customers. Marketing has often {{been at the forefront}} of business adoption and utilization of the latest computing technologies and functionality. Indeed, the marketing function is interlinked with technology and has been proactively using the capabilities of new technologies from the earliest databases and <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> functionality <b>to</b> sophisticated Customer Relationship Management systems and intelligent behavioural marketing systems. The Autonomic Computing paradigm provides a framework in which marketing systems could become self-configuring and context-aware, using a variety of learning and decision-making techniques, providing the potential of even more refined targeting of marketing information to customers. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Autonomic Marketing and outline some of the research issues involved in the implementation of such a system that will, indeed revolutionize the marketing world...|$|R

40|$|Financial companies, {{engineering}} {{firms and}} even scientists create increasingly larger spreadsheets and spreadsheet programs. The creators of large spreadsheets make errors and must track them down. One common {{class of errors}} concerns unit errors, because spreadsheets often employ formulas with physical or monetary units. In this paper, we describe XeLda, our tool for unit checking Excel spreadsheets. The tool highlights cells if their formulas process values with incorrect units and if derived units clash with unit annotations. In addition, it draws arrows to {{the sources of the}} formulas for debugging. The tool is sensitive to many of the intricacies of Excel spreadsheets including tables, matrices, and even circular references. Using XeLda, we have detected errors in some published scientific spreadsheets. 1 Spreadsheet Programming End users program. They program when they write database queries, when they design a style sheet for a word processor, or when they use a <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> program <b>to</b> send a letter to a large group of people. Spreadsheet programming is {{the most common form of}} end user programming. People use spreadsheets for accounting, for financial modeling, for analysis and rapid prototyping in engineering, for teaching at all levels, and for many other purposes. As people have become comfortable with spreadsheets, the complexity of spreadsheet programs has grown significantly. Whereas early spreadsheet programs consisted of a single worksheet for a simple accounting task, today financial experts, engineering firms and even scientists routinely use spreadsheets that consist of numerous worksheets encompassing hundreds and thousands of formulas. Indeed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Mail</b> <b>merge</b> is {{a process}} to create personalised letters and pre-addressed {{envelopes}} or mailing labels for mass mailings from a form letter. The feature is usually employed in a word processing document which contains fixed text (which is the same in each output document) and variables (which act as placeholders that are replaced by text from the data source). The feature dates back to early word processors on personal computers, circa 1980. WordStar was perhaps the earliest to provide this, originally via an ancillary program called <b>Mail</b> <b>merge.</b> WordPerfect also offered this capacity for CP/M and MS-DOS systems, and Microsoft Word added it later on.|$|R
50|$|Four add-on {{utilities}} were included: LocoSpell (a spell checker), LocoMail (a <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> program), LocoFile (a database program), and a Printer Support Pack, but (unlike in {{the earlier}} Locoscript versions) these utilities were no longer sold separately.|$|R
50|$|Besides basic word {{processing}} functionality, Pages includes templates designed by Apple to allow users to create {{various types of}} documents, including newsletters, invitations, stationery, and résumés, along {{with a number of}} education-themed templates for students and teachers, such as reports and outlines. Pages 5, a complete redesign, removed more than 100of the features of Pages 4.x, including bookmarks, <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> linked text boxes, multiple section capability, ability to set default zoom. It has been slowly adding some back in subsequent 5.x releases (default zoom, for example, can now be set, but still no linked text boxes, multiple select, <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> book marks, and more than 90 other features that were present in version 4.3).|$|R
40|$|The Main Document is {{the generic}} Word {{document}} {{that will serve}} as a template for your customized merged documents.

50|$|Simple {{examples}} include printf format strings, {{found in many}} programming languages, and snippets, found {{in a number of}} text editors and source code editors. In word processors, templates are a common feature, while automatic filling in of the templates is often referred <b>to</b> as <b>mail</b> <b>merge.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the vendor, LocoScript 4 added a {{wider range}} of fonts, support for colour printing, a label-printing facility, and (with the {{optional}} Printer Support Pack) supported hundreds of printers (excluding those that required Microsoft Windows). Version 4 also supported the <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> program, LocoMail, and the LocoFile database program.|$|R
50|$|The {{data source}} is {{typically}} a spreadsheet or a database {{which has a}} field or column for each variable in the template. When the <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> process is run, the word processing system creates an output document for each row in the database, using the fixed text exactly as it appears.|$|R
50|$|VBA code {{written in}} Microsoft Access can {{establish}} {{references to the}} Excel, Word and Outlook libraries; this will allow creating an application that runs a query in Access, exports the results to Excel, formats the text, then writes a <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> document in Word that it automatically e-mails to {{each member of the}} original query through Outlook.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{a web-based}} service where a user can upload a {{document}} and a corresponding mailing list. The document {{can be sent to}} everyone on the mailing list. The web service currently only handles bulk mailing (where every letter is identical apart from the address), not true <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> (where every letter is customised for each recipient).|$|R
50|$|Child pages {{use those}} ContentPlaceHolder {{controls}}, {{which must be}} mapped to the place-holder of the master page that the content page is populating. The rest of the page {{is defined by the}} shared parts of the master page, much like a <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> in a word processor. All markup and server controls in the content page must be placed within the ContentPlaceHolder control.|$|R
50|$|Word Online lacks two ribbons {{that exist}} in Word 2013: References and Mailings. Mailing allows users to print {{envelopes}} and labels, and manage <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> printing of Word documents. References contains features needed for more advanced documents e.g. table of contents, citations and bibliography, captions, index, and table of authorities. Word Online cannot change the orientation of a document or insert section breaks.|$|R
50|$|In an age before PCs, when typing {{was still}} done {{primarily}} only by clerical staff, the OS/6 {{was intended for}} what IBM envisioned as centralized word processing centers at large organizations. It included features like <b>mail</b> <b>merge,</b> very high print quality with lots of formatting options and printers that could feed envelopes or sheets from two drawers, usually referred to within IBM as letterhead and second sheet.|$|R
50|$|It {{included}} all the basic features common to most word processors of the day, including automatic word wrapping, spell checking, copy and paste, underlining, and boldfacing; {{and it also}} boasted {{a few of the}} most-commonly-used advanced features, such as <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> and few others. The product was considerably easier to both learn and use than its far more fully featured and expensive DOS word processing competitors, WordPerfect, Microsoft Word and XyWrite.|$|R
40|$|Note: I {{hesitate}} somewhat {{to propose}} this session {{due to the}} general disdain that many feel toward word processors, so you should feel free to reject it or accept it {{if you need to}} fill out the program or find it particularly interesting. Confronted with the task of producing a large appendix to a report that involved a page of tables and 3 graphs for each of 186 panels, the author discovered an approach to automate this process using Stata combined with the <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> facilities of a word processor. A Stata do file produces all 558 graphs and writes an ascii file of data that also includes the graph file names for each panel. A one page <b>mail</b> <b>merge</b> document is set up in the word processor and the Stata output is used as the data source to automatically create the entire 186 page appendix with all tables and graphs placed as desired. This session will outline how to employ this approach for such otherwise daunting tasks. ...|$|R
