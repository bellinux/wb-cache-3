Results showed a large diversity within the isolates, with eight different blaOXA- 51 -like genes, seven novel sequence types and only 28 % similarity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All three acquired class-D carbapenemases (OXA- 23, OXA- 40 and OXA- 58) were also identified among these strains correlating with resistance to carbapenems. In addition, we report the first identification of ISAba 2 upstream of blaOXA- 51 -like contributing to high-level carbapenem resistance. This indicates the presence of several clones of A. baumannii in the hospitals and illustrates the large genetic and epidemiological diversity found in Egyptian strains...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sepsis is a {{continuous}} disease which begins with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), seen {{in association with}} a large number of clinical conditions. These include infectious insults that produce SIRS, such as pancreatitis, ischemia, multiple traumas and tissue injury, hemorrhagic shock, immunemediated organ injury, and the exogenous administration of such putative mediators of the inflammatory process as tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines. A frequent complication of SIRS is the development of organ system dysfunction, including such well-defined clinical conditions as acute lung injury, shock, renal failure, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Hence, this study was conducted to identify the pathogen profile that often causes sepsis. Methods: A retrospective study was performed to 152 medical records of patients diagnosed as sepsis from Internal Medicine Department Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital from January 2013 to December 2013. The variables observed from the medical records were age, sex, comorbidity, main infection, culture sample, type of gram bacteria, resistant bacteria, and antibiotic susceptibility test. After data collection was completed, the data were analyzed using computer. The data were presented in percentage. Results: Sepsis in male was higher than female.

40|$|ABSTRACTCorynebacterium urealyticum, {{formerly}} known as coryneform CDC group D 2, was first recognized {{to be involved in}} human infections 30 years ago. It is a slow-growing, lipophilic, asaccharolytic and usually <b>multidrug-resistant</b> <b>organism</b> with potent urease activity. Its cell wall peptidoglycan, menaquinone, mycolic and cellular fatty acid composition is consistent with that of the genus Corynebacterium. DNA–DNA hybridization studies and 16 S rDNA sequencing analysis have been used to determine the degree of relatedness of C. urealyticum to other corynebacterial species. The genome of the type strain consists of a circular chromosome with a size of 2 369 219 bp and a mean G + C content of 64. 2 %, and analysis of its genome explains the bacterium's lifestyle. C. urealyticum is a common skin colonizer of hospitalized elderly individuals who are receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is an opportunistic pathogen causing mainly acute cystitis, pyelonephritis, encrusted cystitis, and encrusted pyelitis. More infrequently, it causes other infections, but mainly in patients with urological diseases. Infections are more common in males than in females, and treatment requires administration of antibiotics active against the organism in vitro, mainly glycopeptides, as well as surgical intervention, the latter mostly in cases of chronic infection. Mortality directly associated with infection by this organism is not frequent, but encrusted pyelitis in kidney-recipient patients may cause graft loss. The outcome of infection by this organism is reasonably good if the microbiological diagnosis is made and patients are treated appropriately...|$|E

As a result, the infection status of prior room occupants and roommates {{may play a role}} in HAI transmission. We performed a systematic review of the literature evaluating the association between patients’ exposure to infected/colonized hospital roommates or prior room occupants and their risk of infection/colonization with the same organism. A PubMed search for English articles published in 1990 – 2014 yielded 330 studies, which were screened by three reviewers. Eighteen articles met our inclusion criteria. Multiple studies reported positive associations between infection and exposure to roommates with influenza and group A streptococcus, but no associations were found for Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, or Pseudomonas cepacia; findings were mixed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Positive associations were found between infection/colonization and exposure to rooms previously occupied by patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, but no associations were found for resistant Gram-negative organisms; findings were mixed for C.  difficile, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and VRE. Although the majority of studies suggest a link between exposure to infected/colonized roommates and prior room occupants, methodological improvements such as increasing the statistical power and conducting universal screening for colonization would provide more definitive evidence needed to establish causality.
