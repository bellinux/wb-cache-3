As an application, there is no polynomial time computable graph parameter nested between the fractional chromatic number χ ∗ (·) and χ(·) unless P = NP. Moreover, based on the Motzkin–Straus formulation for α(G), we give (quadratically constrained) quadratic and copositive programming formulations for χ(G).

40|$|Acute-phase {{reactants}} are liver proteins whose synthesis {{is positively}} or negatively regulated during inflammation. The main mediators {{of this phenomenon}} are glucocorticoids and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), a pleiotropic cytokine that also controls hematopoiesis. Functional analysis of several acute-phase reactant promoter regions has identified two major DNA motifs used by IL- 6 -regulated genes. The first one corresponds to a CTGG(G/A) AA sequence, {{and the other is}} a binding site for members of the C/EBP family of nuclear proteins. We have previously shown that the human beta fibrinogen (beta Fg) promoter contains an IL- 6 -responsive region, located between bp - 150 and - 67 (P. Huber, <b>M.</b> <b>Laurent,</b> and J. Dalmon, J. Biol. Chem. 265 : 5695 - 5701, 1990). In this study, using DNase I footprinting, mobility shift assays, and mutagenesis, we demonstrate that at least three subdomains of this region are necessary to observe a full response to IL- 6. The most distal contains a CTGGGAA motif, and its mutation inhibits IL- 6 stimulation. Another, which is able to interact with several distinct nuclear proteins, among them members of the C/EBP family, is dispensable for IL- 6 induction but {{plays an important role in}} the constitutive expression of beta Fg. Finally, a proximal hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding site, already described as the major determinant of beta Fg tissue-specific expression, is also required for IL- 6 stimulation. These results indicate a complex interplay between nuclear proteins within the beta Fg IL- 6 -responsive region and suggest a tight functional coupling between the tissue-specific and inducible elements...|$|R

The key issue in order to properly predict various combustion regimes and pollutant formation is to accurately describe the interaction between the carrier gaseous phase and the polydisperse evaporating spray produced through atomization. For this purpose, we rely on the EMSM (Eulerian Multi-Size Moment) Eulerian polydisperse model. It is based on a high order moment method in size, with a maximization of entropy technique in order to provide a smooth reconstruction of the distribution, derived from a Williams-Boltzmann mesoscopic model under the monokinetic assumption [O.

We also provide a novel algorithm for an accurate resolution of the evaporation.
