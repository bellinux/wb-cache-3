40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} inter-district variations in <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> in India in 1981. Three significant patterns emerge. First, <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> in India bear no significant relation with urbanization or poverty. Second, there is a negative association between literacy and criminal violence. Third, <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> in India are highly correlated with the female-male ratio in the population: districts with higher female-male ratios have lower <b>murder</b> <b>rates.</b> Alternative hypotheses about the causal relationships underlying this connection between sex ratios and <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> are scrutinized. One plausible explanation is that low female-male ratios and high <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> are joint symptoms of a patriarchal environment. This study also suggests that gender relations, in general, have a crucial bearing on criminal violence. Copyright 2000 by The Population Council, Inc [...] ...|$|R

5|$|For {{the year}} of 2007, Norfolk had a total crime index of 514.7 per 100,000 residents. This was above the {{national}} average of 320.9 that year. For 2007, the city experienced 48 homicides, for a <b>murder</b> <b>rate</b> of 21.1 per 100,000 residents.

50|$|The {{question}} of whether or not the death penalty deters murder usually revolves around the statistical analysis. Studies have produced disputed results with disputed significance. Some studies have shown a positive correlation between the death penalty and <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> - in other words, they show that where the death penalty applies, <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> are also high. This correlation can be interpreted in either that the death penalty increases <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> by brutalizing society, which is known as the brutalization hypothesis, or that higher <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> cause the state to retain or reintroduce the death penalty. However, supporters and opponents of the various statistical studies, on both sides of the issue, argue that correlation does not imply causation. There is evidence that some of the major studies of capital punishment and deterrence are flawed due to model uncertainty, and that once this is accounted for, little evidence of deterrence remains.|$|R

5|$|The {{city has}} had struggles: {{a series of}} scandals in the 1990s plagued the police department, {{including}} underreporting of crime. The Street administration was plagued with scandal, with administration people being accused of awarding contracts based on campaign donations for Street's 2003 reelection campaign.

40|$|This study uses multivariate econometric {{and time}} series {{analysis}} techniques to examine historical trends in the felonious killing of law enforcement officers in the United States from 1947 to 1998.

We also focus on the ability of economic deprivation, deterrence, and social disorganization theories to explain trends in police <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> across time. The findings of this study indicate (a) that police <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> in the United States are characterized by distinct historical periods (1947 to 1971, 1972 to 1998) in which the structural correlates of police murder vary and (b) that both economic deprivation and deterrence theories are relevant for understanding trends in police murder although the effects of the latter are historically specific...|$|R
40|$|This study compares two {{versions}} of the use of capital punishment. Texas rigor-ously implements the death penalty. California reluctantly executes capital pun-ishment. The study examines similarities and differences in the two approaches. Execution rates, death penalties imposed by juries, implementation of death, the cost of capital punishment, <b>murder</b> <b>rates,</b> and the reciprocal effects of execu-tion <b>rates</b> and <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> were viewed in light of posed research questions. The study revealed that Texas was signifi cantly higher in the rate of executions, jury imposed death sentences, and the implementation of capital punishment than California. The cost of capital punishment was also substantially higher in Texas than in California. Despite the differences in the practice of capital punishment, the <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> of Texas and California were remarkably similar. There was a strong correspondence in year-to-year changes and no signifi cant difference in the rates of the two states. An examination of execution <b>rates</b> and <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> over time via a cross-lagged panel analysis, unfortunately, produced no clear fi ndings. However, this study did illustrate the value of the Heilbrun (2006) challenge to examine states that rigorously versus reluctantly implement their death-penalty sentences...|$|R
5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's <b>murder</b> <b>rate</b> ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest <b>murder</b> <b>rate,</b> saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt did not fare as well {{in state}} politics. He ardently {{supported}} Jacksonian principles, and wielded his veto against bills critical of President Jackson's land policy. He supported Jackson's desire to dissolve the Second Bank of the United States. Instead, he favored opening a number of state banks, but faced with a Whig majority in the legislature, he succeeded only in chartering the Louisville Bank of Kentucky. He also favored completion of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, and supported a $300,000 loan from the state Board of Internal Improvements for that purpose. In 1833, a loan for half the amount was approved, and the railroad was not completed until 1851. Breathitt was {{also part of the}} temperance movement in Kentucky. In an 1832 address, he blamed consumption of alcohol for the high <b>murder</b> <b>rate</b> in the state. When the Kentucky Legislative Temperance Society was formed at a meeting in the state house on January 13, 1834, Breathitt was chosen as its president and Lieutenant Governor Morehead served as one of five vice-presidents.|$|E

50|$|Development of <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> {{over time}} in {{different}} countries is often used by both supporters and opponents of capital punishment and gun control. Using properly filtered data, {{it is possible to}} make the case for or against either of these issues. For example, one could look at <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> in the United States from 1950 to 2000, and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a moratorium on death sentences was effectively imposed in the late 1960s. This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and, as such, it is morally justified. Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher <b>murder</b> <b>rates</b> than Canada and most European Union countries, although all those countries have abolished the death penalty. Overall, the global pattern is too complex, and on average, the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social, economic, and cultural.|$|R
