5|$|Flanders {{began writing}} {{early in his}} career. His {{published}} articles on machine tool technology led to {{a job as an}} editor of Machine magazine in New York City. This job, which he held between 1905 and 1910, required him to cover developments in the <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>industry.</b> He traveled widely to visit the companies that he wrote about, which provided him many valuable contacts with leaders in the industry. As editor, he wrote articles on gear tooth systems, gear cutting machinery, hobs, the manufacture of cans, and of motor cars, including Machinery’s reference series on the subject.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>industry,</b> enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{was born}} oldest of nine {{children}} in Barnet, {{a town in}} Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont, and {{spent much of his}} childhood in Rhode Island. In his autobiography, Senator from Vermont, Flanders described life on his family’s subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, before he left to work in the <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>industry</b> for most of his career. In his first years as a machinist and draftsman, he spent his vacations traveling by bicycle over country roads between Rhode Island and Vermont and New Hampshire. Later, he lived for a time in New York City where he edited a machine tool magazine, but after five years decided to move back to Vermont. In 1911, he married Helen Edith Hartness, daughter of inventor and industrialist James Hartness. They made their home in Springfield, Vermont, where Flanders became president of the Jones & Lamson Machine Company. Flanders and his wife had three children: Elizabeth (born 1912), Anna (also known as Nancy—born 1918), and James (born 1923).|$|E

25|$|A <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>industry</b> {{developed}} and machinery {{became a major}} industry. Sewing machines began being manufactured. The shoe industry became mechanized. Horse drawn reapers became widely introduced, significantly increasing the productivity of farming.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{machinery}} was made mostly of wood with iron parts. By the mid century machines were being increasingly of all iron, which {{allowed them to}} operate at higher speeds and with higher precision. The demand for machinery created a <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>industry</b> that designed and manufactured lathes, metal planers, shapers and other precision metal cutting tools.|$|E
25|$|The {{mid-19th century}} {{was a period}} of {{transition}} toward industrialization, particularly in the Northeast, which produced cotton textiles and shoes. The population of the West (generally meaning from Ohio to and including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri and south to include Kentucky) grew rapidly. The West was primarily a grain and pork producing region, with an important <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> <b>industry</b> developing around Cincinnati, Ohio. The Southern economy was based on plantation agriculture, primarily cotton, tobacco and sugar, produced with slave labor.|$|E

30|$|Based on this context, we {{have studied}} the {{development}} of the NC (numerically-controlled) <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> <b>industry</b> in Japan during the period from 1975 to 2015, i.e. the period during which the transformation of the <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> <b>industry</b> using digital technologies was realized. Based on our research, we will demonstrate here that technology fusion and convergence are not isolated phenomena, but are inter-related in a dynamic and organic manner. Moreover, we will demonstrate the following transformational sequences occurred in <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> technological development, with the publication dates in parenthesis: disruptive technology (1997), technology fusion (1992), open innovation (2003) and, digital convergence (1996). We will argue with reason why this sequence differs from the chronological sequence of publications.|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Knowledge-Based Performance ImprovementInternational audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{unplanned}} negative effects, which may result from implementation of lean management. Using as the basis empirical evidence from European <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> <b>industry</b> it is argued, that in majority of cases targeted effects (mostly cost savings, production and utilization increase) are followed, with a delay, by negative side effects (mostly unplanned increased costs, quality issues, customer dissatisfaction). It is suggested, that using the controlling framework as management tool may enable to avoid these unlikely effects. Its relevant adoption, to support multi-perspective assessment of lean management implementations is presented within the paper...|$|R
