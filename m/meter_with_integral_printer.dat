25|$|Full-keyboard machines, {{including}} motor-driven ones, {{were also}} built until the 1960s. Among the major manufacturers were Mercedes-Euklid, Archimedes, and MADAS in Europe; in the USA, Friden, Marchant, and Monroe were the principal makers of rotary calculators with carriages. Reciprocating calculators (most {{of which were}} adding machines, many <b>with</b> <b>integral</b> <b>printers)</b> were made by Remington Rand and Burroughs, among others. All of these were key-set. Felt & Tarrant made Comptometers, as well as Victor, which were key-driven.|$|R
50|$|Second {{generation}} : A self-contained, electronic and/or microprocessor-controlled fuel island {{control systems}} {{which has an}} ID reader (key, card, RFID etc.) to identify the vehicle and driver, a means of controlling a pump, a means of measuring the fuel delivered, and usually, a means of reporting fuel drawn by vehicle. The fleet list is usually input using an integral keypad or an office based console. These systems were either fitted <b>with</b> <b>integral</b> <b>printers</b> or permanently hard wired to back office consoles that provided simple reporting and printouts, these system types were superseded by the proliferation of low cost PC's.|$|R

50|$|Nelson was an {{outstanding}} {{track and field}} athlete, and won a national AAU championship in the 400 meters as a 10-year-old. In 2003, his senior year at Riley County High School, he won the state titles in Class 3A in the: 100 <b>meters,</b> <b>with</b> a time of 10.63 seconds; 200 <b>meters,</b> <b>with</b> a time of 21.64 seconds; 400 <b>meters,</b> <b>with</b> a time of 48.79; and long jump, with a leap of 7.00 meters.|$|R

Clearly, these ranges were well below the possibilities of cannons which reached 26000 meters.|$|R
40|$|The study aims is {{to define}} {{bathymetry}} based on General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) and Nautical Map using GIS technique. The methods {{used in this}} study are the kriging method which combines the spatial correlation among the data using GIS and Remote Sensing software. The result shows that bathymetry at research area can be divided into five classes, these are: (1) 0 - 2 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 1. 797, 61 hectare, (2) 2 - 5 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 2. 059, 06 hectare, (3) 5 - 10 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 1. 184, 02 hectare, (4) 10 - 25 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 3. 025. 00 hectare, (5) 25 - 200 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 5. 648. 62 hectare. The spatial pattern of bathymetry dispersed from the shallow water at the edge of beach and more deep at the offshore, except at the eastern side of Wangi-Wangi island which has barrier reef and created basin between them...|$|R

40|$|Kao Bay {{is located}} in the {{province}} of North Maluku between Regency of North Halmahera and West Halmahera. The study aims are to identify bay criteria according to UNCLOS and bathymetry based on Nautical Chart. The methods used in this study are the identification of the bay area under UNCLOS and spatial analysis using GIS software. The result shows that Kao Bay has a coast line length of 127. 7 km, a mouth bay cover line of 11. 1 km, total surface area of   964. 38  km 2, and total surface semi-circular bay cover area of 48. 4 km 2. The total surface area larger than the area of the semicircle bay cover area. It has been full compliance with the criteria required by UNCLOS. Spatial analysis, found that for the depth of water in Kao Bay can be divided into six classes, these are: (1) 0 – 100 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 964, 38 km 2, (2) 100 - 200 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 667. 25 km 2, (3) 200 - 300 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 556. 95 km 2, (4) 300 - 400 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 376. 89 km 2, (5) 400 - 500 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 202. 44 km 2, (6) 500 - 600 <b>meter</b> <b>with</b> area of 2. 22 km 2...|$|R
