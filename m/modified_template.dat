Methods: The study included 31 patients who underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. A <b>modified</b> <b>template</b> was used if retroperitoneal metastasis {{was limited to the}} areas below the level of the renal hilus and above the level of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Perioperative and postoperative courses and complications were reviewed as well as therapeutic outcomes. Results:Overall, 27 perioperative and postoperative complicationswere observed in 15 patients (48. 4 %). Superficial surgical site infection and paralytic ileus were seen most frequently. All of them were resolved without special additional treatments; however, patients who underwent retrocrural dissection had a tendency to have severe symptomatic complications such as chylothorax, phrenic nerve palsy and orthostatic hypotension. Antegrade ejaculation was preserved in 94. 1 % of patients with <b>modified</b> <b>template</b> dissection, whereas no patients with additional dissection below the level of the IMA had the function preserved. One patient (3. 2 %) developed a postoperative recurrent disease in the retroperitoneum, which was outside the dissection field, {{as well as in the}} mediastinum. Conclusions: Although RLND had high morbidity, most peri- and postoperative complications were manageable conservatively. <b>Modified</b> <b>template</b> dissection enabled patients to preserve antegrade ejaculation without compromising its therapeutic efficacy, if the disease extension allowed us to use the template.

The results showed the following optimum reaction conditions: The reaction ratio between luteolin and acryloyl chloride was 1 : 2 (0. 10 g/ 0. 20 g), adding 1. 0 g precursor; the feasible elution time was 12 h; when the molar quantity of <b>modified</b> <b>template</b> molecule was 0. 01 mol and ethenyltriethyloxy-silane (VTEO) was 0. 04 mol, the maximum yield reached 91. 6 %.

40|$|The {{publication}} of ‘The Gathering Storm’ by the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) contextualises the current landscape in England’s maternity workforce and services {{as one in}} which demonstrating safety and effectiveness is compromised by rising levels of complexity in pregnancy, midwife shortages and financial constraints in the NHS (RCM, 2017). Despite these challenges, a Midwife in practice must demonstrate that they can practise safely and effectively and ‘live’ the standards set out within the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) ‘Code’; demonstration of this being achieved via the process of Revalidation (NMC, 2016). Preparing student midwives to have a critical appreciation of the complexities of midwifery care or the ‘real’ world of midwifery is a goal of the undergraduate curriculum. Learning in practice is a fundamental {{part of this process}} and is complemented by learning opportunities facilitated by academic staff in University settings. The challenge in the University environment is to provide teaching and learning opportunities which are ‘real’ or ‘authentic’ in nature and can be achieved, for example, through the use of simulation or analysis of case based scenarios drawn from practice. Central to this approach is the use of authentic means of assessment that encourages deep learning and this can be achieved using methods such as observation and work-situated assessment. Preparing a new undergraduate curriculum afforded the opportunity to address innovative means of authentically assessing final year student midwives in preparation for their future role. Subsequently, {{a modified version of the}} NMC professional revalidation process was proposed as an assessment method for a module of study addressing the care of women and families. The module aims to support students to integrate knowledge and skills, provide women-centred care, and foster a collaborative role in leading and managing women’s journeys. In addition, students are required to evaluate their own skills and abilities and produce strategies for advancing day-to-day practice. The <b>modified</b> <b>template</b> of the NMC Revalidation process is used as a vehicle for recording and integrating module learning with reflective analysis of cases drawn from practice. The process culminates in the presentation of evidence of learning, practice hours, service user feedback, reflective accounts and developmental plans mirroring the ‘real world’ requirement of the safely practicing midwife. Where the <b>modified</b> <b>template</b> and process differs, is in the requirement for students to critically appraise the evidence and research and personal skills commensurate with module outcomes. There is recent evidence from the National Nursing Research Unit to suggest that although the research evidence base around continuing professional development (CPD) is relatively limited and weak, some conclusions can be drawn suggesting that CPD does not appear to be regarded as being part of development but rather maintenance of health professionals’ standards of practice (Rafferty, Xyrichis, Caldwell, 2015). Using the <b>modified</b> <b>template</b> for NMC Revalidation as ‘transitioning’ tool is hoped not only to prepare students to maintain competency but to continue to develop ‘safe and effective in practice’ skills, preparing them for the turbulence of contemporary midwifery practice...|$|E

40|$|Summary The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} fertility after different types of post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). During 1980 – 1994, 192 patients with metastatic testicular cancer underwent post-chemotherapy RPLND with a gradual shift from <b>modified</b> bilateral <b>template</b> RPLND to nerve-sparing RPLND. <b>Modified</b> bilateral <b>template</b> RPLND was done in 92 % of the patients operated during 1980 – 1984 as compared to 16 % during 1989 – 1994. Pre- and post-treatment fertility was assessed by microscopic sperm analysis, determination of serum FSH and information on ejaculation and paternity. There was no significant difference of the survival rates between the three treatment periods. Antegrade ejaculation was preserved in 11 % of the patients after <b>modified</b> bilateral <b>template</b> RPLND as compared to 89 % after the nerve-sparing operation technique. The median ejaculatory volume decreased post-operatively, serum FSH increased and sperm density remained unchanged. Fifty-six patients attempted fatherhood after their treatment, and 27 fathered at least one child after an observation-time of 55 months, nine of them by assisted fertilization. Patients with initially advanced testicular cancer but limited residual retroperitoneal masses after induction chemotherapy can safely undergo limited post-chemotherapy RPLND as a part of multimodality treatment. After nerve-sparing RPLND antegrade ejaculation is preserved in 89 % of the patients though the ejaculatory volume decreases after RPLND.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Y-Family DNA polymerases {{specialize}} in translesion syn-thesis, bypassing damaged bases {{that would otherwise}} block the normal progression of replication forks. Y-Family polymerases have unique structural features {{that allow them to}} bind damaged DNA and use a <b>modified</b> <b>template</b> base to direct nucleotide incorporation. Each Y-Family polymerase is unique and has different preferences for lesions to bypass and for dNTPs to incorporate.

Recruitment of these specialized polymerases to replication forks is therefore regulated. The catalytic center of the Y-Family polymerases is highly conserved and homologous to that of high-fidelity and high-processivity DNA replicases.

30|$|A template-assisted {{method is}} a common {{technique}} {{that has been used}} {{for more than two decades}} to fabricate favorable nanostructures. Some nanostructures involving nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, nanoflowers, and nanopeapods have been produced by alumina template method [1 – 3]. It is a versatile cost-effective procedure employed to fabricate various nanostructures using polymer solution or melt [4, 5]. The wetting process of the alumina template to fabricate nanostructures deploys infiltration of solution into the nanochannels of the template through several methods such as immersion, spin-coating, and dip-coating methods [6 – 8]. Employing these processes, several nanostructures have been successfully grown. For instance, nanotubes and nanorods have been produced by simple immersion and spin-coating methods [9, 10]. Apart from the fabrication processes, there are many other parameters that influence morphology of the nanostructures such as molecular weight, solution concentration, solvent properties, viscosity of polymer and immersion time, etc. [10 – 13]. However, some reports conclude that some of these parameters produce little effect on the fabricated nanostructures; rather, solution-template interaction plays a key role in determining morphology [14]. Moreover, it is also suggested that morphology of nanostructures produced by <b>modified</b> <b>templates</b> differ from those fabricated in commercial prototype templates [15].|$|R
