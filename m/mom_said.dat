Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00am, but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the Toluca valley, about 40miles (65km) west of Mexico City.

He thought the whole thing was a hoax". He was awarded the prize on December 10. In his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: [...] "When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the 'green revolution', they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production {{in a world that is}} hungry, both for bread and for peace". His speech repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of population. [...] "The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.|$|E

The idea for the show originated from a show that Wade watched in the 1970s about a school teacher who turned into Isis, after she found an amulet. As the goddess, she performed feats of heroism. SheZow was targeted to 6- to 11-year-old children. It was funded by Film Victoria and launched by DHX Media on ABC Australia.

5000|$|Learning: Learning can be {{social or}} nonsocial. Consider {{the example of}} a child {{learning}} about bees. If is child is exploring and playing with no one else around, the child may see a bee and touch it (out of curiosity). If the child is stung by the bee, the child learns that touching bees is associated with pain. This is nonsocial learning, since no one else was around. In contrast, a child may benefit from social learning about bees. If the child is with mom, dad or anyone else, the child's inquisitive approach to a bee may lead to some kind of social intervention. Maybe Aunt Emy sees the child reaching for a bee and simply points the child in another direction, saying [...] "Look at that pretty butterfly." [...] Maybe Uncle Ed would say, [...] "Don’t touch the bee, because it can hurt you and make you cry." [...] Maybe <b>Mom</b> would have <b>said,</b> [...] "Honey, stay away from bees because they sting."

Olivia Spencer was in dire need a heart transplant and when Gus died Natalia (Rafe's mother) made the painful decision to give Gus's heart to Olivia. We later learn that a young driver hit Gus in an accident that proved to be fatal. Natalia wanted the courts to go easy on him since Gus was speeding on his way to be with Olivia in the hospital as she was very weak.

Later, Gus's old partner (Gus was a cop) Mallet (Harley's ex) was digging around and some stuff came up about Gus's case files. It turns out Gus was transferring money so that Olivia could be up higher on the donor list. Mallet told Rafe that his dad might be a dirty cop. Mallet didn't know the full story about why Gus was transferring money. Rafe who had only known his dad for a little while as a well-respected man was upset by this and the day of the press conference to talk about Gus, Rafe took his dad's gun and shot the district attorney, Jeffrey O'Neill.
