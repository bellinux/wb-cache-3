25|$|The {{curriculum}} at Ward Island had {{many of the}} same topics at the three ARM Secondary Schools, but with a number of notable differences. The Navy’s airborne equipment was physically much smaller than shipboard and land-based electronics, and had to use the power generated by the carrying vehicle. Also, it was often designed to be operated by either the aircraft pilot or a crew member who had other primary duties; thus, it was necessarily easier to adjust – often including automatic tuning; therefore, lecture instruction included topics to support these requirements. Most airborne radios operated in VHF bands, and the associated antennas and their placement were important topics. Microwave radar, which required less physical space than its VHF predecessor, soon became the dominant feature in airborne applications; this required considerable attention be given to dish antennas and their <b>mechanical</b> <b>drives.</b> Sonar was not included, but there was more attention given to recognition (IFF), direction-finding, and LORAN radio-navigation systems. There were also special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight, the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), and the Target Drone Denny (TDD-1).|$|E

40|$|Combined cycles applied on {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} installations could be an attractive technology on the Norwegian continental shelf to decrease costs related to CO 2 emissions. Current power plant technology prevailing on {{offshore oil}}- and gas installations is based on simple cycle gas turbines for both electrical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>drive</b> applications. Results based on process simulations showed that net plant efficiency improvements of 26 – 33 % (10 – 13 %-points) compared to simple cycle gas turbines can be achieved when the steam bottoming cycles are designed for compactness and flexibility. The emitted CO 2 could be decreased by 20 – 25 % by opting for a combined cycle rather than a simple cycle gas turbine. A clear disadvantage for offshore applications is that the weight-to-power ratio was 60 – 70 % higher for a compact combined cycle than for a simple cycle gas turbine based on results in this study. Once-through {{heat recovery steam generator}} technology can be an attractive option when designing a steam bottoming cycle for offshore applications. Its flexibility, the avoidance of steam drums, and, with the right material selection, the possibility to avoid the bypass stack while allowing for dry heat recovery steam generator operation are all advantages for offshore applications. All process models, that were developed for offshore installations in the study presented, included once-through technology. A combined cycle plant layout for an offshore installation with both <b>mechanical</b> <b>drive</b> and generator drive gas turbines was included in the study. This setup allows for flexibility related to changes in demand for both <b>mechanical</b> <b>drive</b> and electricity.
