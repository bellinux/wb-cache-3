25|$|The plan's {{immediate}} {{results were}} spectacular: the <b>monthly</b> <b>rate</b> of inflation fell close to zero, economic growth surged upward, {{and the foreign}} accounts remained under control. However, {{by the end of}} 1986 the plan was in trouble. The wage adjustments were too large, increasing aggregate demand excessively and creating inflationary pressures. Moreover, the price freeze was maintained for too long, creating distortions and leading to shortages {{of a growing number of}} products. Inflation accelerated again and there was a return of indexation. The country imposed a moratorium on its foreign debt service on February 20, 1987.|$|E
25|$|Preoccupation with {{inflation}} was natural enough, after the steep rise of 1989 and the months immediately preceding {{the change of}} government. The <b>monthly</b> <b>rate</b> of inflation ranged between 25 percent and 32 {{percent in the second}} half of 1989, exceeded 40 percent in June 1990, and amounted to 78 percent by July. The deficit of the central government increased from 4 percent of GDP in January 1990 to 9 percent by May. The money supply of the country increased six times over from January to the end of July. The new government had to act quickly, and did.|$|E
25|$|The new {{policies}} helped greatly {{to bring down}} the rate of inflation, although they fell short of accomplishing full stabilization. Against an inflation rate that had reached approximately 2,300 percent for the twelve months to June 1990, the rate of 139 percent for the twelve months to December 1991 {{can be seen as a}} dramatic improvement. But the latter was still more than double the government's intended ceiling for 1991 and still extremely high relative to outside world rates of inflation. The last quarter of 1991 looked more promising, with the <b>monthly</b> <b>rate</b> down to 4 percent, but it had risen to 7 percent by March 1992. Inflationary dangers clearly remained troublesome, especially in view of two factors that should have stopped inflation more decisively: a deeply depressed level of domestic demand and an unintended increase in the real exchange rate, making dollars cheaper.|$|E

25|$|Travelcards {{for seven}} days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel {{at any time of}} the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a paper ticket with a {{magnetic}} stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata <b>monthly</b> <b>rate</b> for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime tax increase in American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% <b>monthly</b> <b>rate</b> in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and earned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E

5000|$|Trends {{in annual}} {{inflation}} rates mask variations in <b>monthly</b> <b>rates,</b> however. In 1994, for example, the government managed to reduce <b>monthly</b> <b>rates</b> from 21% in January to 4% in August, but rates climbed once again, to 16.4% by December and 18% by January 1995. Instability in Russian monetary policy caused the variations. After tightening {{the flow of}} money early in 1994, the Government loosened its restrictions in response to demands for credits by agriculture, industries in the Far North, and some favored large enterprises. In 1995 the pattern was avoided more successfully by maintaining the tight monetary policy adopted {{early in the year}} and by passing a relatively stringent budget. Thus, the <b>monthly</b> inflation <b>rate</b> held virtually steady below 5% {{in the last quarter of}} the year. For the first half of 1996, the inflation rate was 16.5%. However, experts noted that control of inflation was aided substantially by the failure to pay wages to workers in state enterprises, a policy that kept prices low by depressing demand.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND To {{determine}} the extent to which variations in monthly Mental Health Emergency Department (MHED) presentations in South Australian Public Hospitals are associated with the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) <b>monthly</b> unemployment <b>rates.</b> METHODS Times series modelling of relationships between monthly MHED presentations to South Australian Public Hospitals derived from the Integrated South Australian Activity Collection (ISAAC) data base and the ABS <b>monthly</b> unemployment <b>rates</b> in South Australia between January 2004 –June 2011. RESULTS Time series modelling using <b>monthly</b> unemployment <b>rates</b> from ABS as a predictor variable explains 69 % of the variation in monthly MHED presentations across public hospitals in South Australia. Thirty-two percent of the variation in current month’s male MHED presentations can be predicted by using the 2 months’ prior male unemployment rate. Over 63 % of the variation in monthly female MHED presentations can be predicted by either male or female prior <b>monthly</b> unemployment <b>rates.</b> CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study highlight that even with the relatively favourable economic conditions, small shifts in <b>monthly</b> unemployment <b>rates</b> can predict variations in monthly MHED presentations, particularly for women. <b>Monthly</b> ABS unemployment <b>rates</b> may be a useful metric for predicting demand for emergency mental health services.
