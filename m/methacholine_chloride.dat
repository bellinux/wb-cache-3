40|$|AbstractMethacholine {{chloride}} bronchoprovocation {{challenges are}} performed for {{the diagnosis and}} investigation of hyperreactive airways. Over the last 20 yrs various formulations and pH values for the preparation of solutions of methacholine have been described. To determine the stability of <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions prepared {{in a variety of}} buffers with differing pH values and under varying storage temperatures, we measured methacholine concentrations at intervals from 1 to 5 weeks. It was found that <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions rapidly decompose if the pH is greater than 6 and that decomposition is more rapid as the pH is raised; solutions at pH 9, i. e. bicarbonate buffer, and stored at 27 °C have degradation up to 36 % after only one week. Solutions of the same pH but prepared in different buffers can have both varied rates of deterioration and different absolute amounts of methacholine hydrolysed, e. g. solutions prepared in pH 9 borate buffer and stored at 27 °C have up to 60 % degradation after 1 week. Solutions prepared in saline are stable probably because methacholine solutions are weakly acidic. The results emphasise the importance of preparing <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> in the proper buffers for use in the accurate assessment of airway responsiveness...|$|E

40|$|In {{pheochromocytoma}} pharmacologic agents which provoke paroxysms {{of hypertension}} [i. e., histamine (1), <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (2), and tetraethylammonium chloride (3) ] {{have come to}} be widely employed as clinical diagnostic tools. Although the usual effects of these drugs, namely fall in blood pressure, tachycardia and vasodila-tation, are well recognized, the mechanism by which they induce hypertension in the pheo-chromocytoma patient remains unclarified. This study was designed to evaluate the circu-latory and metabolic responses induced by hista-mine, <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (hereafter referred to as Mecholyl®) and tetraethylammonium chlo-ride (TEAC) in the presence of measured amounts of circulating epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. Atropine has been included as a test drug in an effort to determine the role which tachy-cardia may play in the observed responses, and also because Littman and co-workers (4, 5) have reported augmentation of nor-epinephrine's pres-sor effects by pretreatment with atropine.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of L-arginine, D-arginine and L-lysine on airway smooth muscle responsiveness to spasmogens in vitro. Both L-arginine and D-arginine (100 mM) significantly reduced the contractile potency and maximal contractile response to histamine but not to <b>methacholine</b> or potassium <b>chloride</b> in guinea-pig epithelium-denuded isolated trachea. Similarly, the contractile response to histamine was significantly reduced by L-arginine (100 mM) in rabbit epithelium-denuded isolated bronchus. The amino acid L-lysine (100 mM) failed to significantly alter the contractile potency of histamine in guinea-pig isolated trachea (P> 0. 05). In guinea-pig isolated trachea precontracted with histamine, both L-arginine and D-arginine produced a concentration-dependent relaxation which was not significantly altered by epithelium removal or {{by the presence of}} the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 50 µM). Thus, at very high concentrations, arginine exhibit a non-competitive antagonism of histamine-induced contraction of isolated airway preparations that was independent of the generation of nitric oxide and was not dependent on charge. These observations confirm previous studies of cutaneous permeability responses and of contractile responses of guinea-pig isolated ileal smooth muscle. Taken together, the data suggest that high concentrations of arginine can exert an anti-histamine effect...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation is abnormal in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Background. Multiple investigations, both in experimental models and in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, demonstrate impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Decreased availability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide {{may contribute to the}} high prevalence of vascular disease in diabetes. Methods. Vascular reactivity was measured in the forearm resistance vessels of 21 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 23 matched healthy control subjects. No patient had hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. Each subject was protreated with aspirin to inhibit endogenous production of vasoactive prostanoids. <b>Methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (0. 3 to 10 μg/min) was administered through a brachial artery cannula to assess vasodilation to endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Sodium nitroprusside (0. 3 to 10 μg/min) was infused to evaluate vasodilation to an exogenous nitric oxide donor. Verapamil (10 to 300 μg/min) was administered to distinguish impaired nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation from general dysfunction of vascular smooth muscle. Forearm blood flow was determined by venous occlusion plethysmography, and dose-response curves were generated for each agent. To assess the role of vasoconstrictor prostanoids, a subset of eight diabetic subjects were reexamined in the absence of aspirin treatment. Results. Basal forearm blood flow in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects was comparable. The forearm blood flow responses to both <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> and nitroprasside were significantly attenuated in diabetic compared with nondiabetic subjects (p 0. 50). The forearm blood flow responses to these agents were not significantly affected by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Conclusion. Nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation is impaired in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Vasoconstrictor prostanoids do not contribute significantly to vascular dysfunction. The attenuated response to exogenous as well as endogenous nitric oxide donors suggests that the abnormality is due to increased inactivation of nitric oxide or to decreased reactivity of the vascular smooth muscle to nitric oxide...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} suppressing sinus rhythm on {{initiation}} {{and maintenance of}} atrial fibrillation was studied in 17 thoraeotomized and artificially ventilated dogs. Atrial fibrillation was evoked by <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> applied to the right atrium followed by light mechanical stimulation. Episodes of fibrillation were compared before and after sinus rhythm had been suppressed by injection of absolute alcohol or concentrated sodium pentobarbital into the sinus node artery. Sixty-nine control episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting 6. 00 ± 0. 36 (SE) minutes were easily initiated while the heart was in sinus rhythm. The response to methacholine application plus mechanical stimulation depended {{on the type of}} escape rhythm obtained after suppression of sinus rhythm. In ten dogs with no sign of supra A-V junctional pacemaker activity, only 50 $ of the attempts to initiate fibrillation were successful.

40|$|Endothelium-dependent {{vasodilation}} is impaired in hypercholesterolemia, {{even before}} the development of atherosclerosis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether infusion of L-arginine, the precursor of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor, nitric oxide, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in hypercholesterolemic humans. Vascular reactivity was measured in the forearm resistance vessels of 11 normal subjects (serum LDL cholesterol = 2. 76 +/- 0. 10 mmol/liter) and 14 age-matched patients with hypercholesterolemia (serum LDL cholesterol = 4. 65 +/- 0. 36 mmol/liter, P < 0. 05). The vasodilative response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride,</b> was depressed in the hypercholesterolemic group, whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation, induced by nitroprusside, was similar in each group. Intravenous administration of L-arginine augmented the forearm blood flow response to methacholine in the hypercholesterolemic individuals, but not in the normal subjects. L-arginine did not alter the effect of nitroprusside in either group. D-arginine had no effect on forearm vascular reactivity in either group. It is concluded that endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in hypercholesterolemic humans. This abnormality can be improved acutely by administration of L-arginine, possibly by increasing the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor...|$|E
40|$|We {{delivered}} controlled radiofrequency (RF) {{energy to}} the airways of anesthetized, ventilated dogs to {{examine the effect of}} this treatment on reducing airway narrowing caused by a known airway constrictor. The airways of 11 dogs were treated with a specially designed bronchial catheter in 3 of 4 lung regions. Treatments in each of the 3 treated lung regions were controlled to a different temperature (55 °C, 65 °C, and 75 °C); the untreated lung region served as a control. We measured airway responsiveness to local <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (MCh) challenge before and after treatment and examined post-treatment histology to 3 years. Treatments controlled to 65 °C as well as 75 °C persistently and significantly reduced airway responsiveness to local MCh challenge (p ≤ 0. 022). Airway responsiveness (mean percent decrease in airway diameter following MCh challenge), averaged from 6 months to 3 years post-treatment, was 79 % ± 2. 2 % in control airways vs. 39 % ± 2. 6 % (p ≤ 0. 001) for airways treated at 65 °C, and 26 % ± 2. 7 % (p ≤ 0. 001) for airways treated at 75 °C.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that obesity/insulin resistance impairs both endothelium-dependent vasodilation and insulin-mediated augmentation of endothelium-dependent vasodilation, we studied leg blood flow (LBF) responses to graded intrafemoral artery infusions of <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (MCh) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) during saline infusion and euglycemic hyperinsulinemia in lean insulin-sensitive controls (C), in obese insulin-resistant subjects (OB), and in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). MCh induced increments in LBF were approximately 40 % and 55 % lower in OB and NIDDM, respectively, as compared with C (P < 0. 05). Euglycemic hyperinsulinemia augmented the LBF response to MCh by - 50 % in C (P < 0. 05 vs saline) but not in OB and NIDDM. SNP caused comparable increments in LBF in all groups. Regression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between the maximal LBF change in response to MCh and body fat content. Thus, obesity/insulin resistance is associated with (a) blunted endothelium-dependent, but normal endothelium-independent vasodilation and (b) failure of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia to augment endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Therefore, obese/insulin-resistant subjects are characterized by endothelial dysfunction and endothelial resistance to insulin's effect on enhancement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This endothelial dysfunction could contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerosis in obese insulin-resistant subjects...|$|E
40|$|Background—Insulin {{resistance}} is {{strongly associated with}} obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome (MS). The relative importance of these components in the determination of endothelial function is unknown. Furthermore, there is conflicting evidence about whether ethnic differences exist in {{the relative importance of}} these components in regard to other cardiovascular outcomes. We evaluated the contributions of insulin resistance, obesity, and the other components of the MS to impaired endothelial function. Methods and Results—The relationships of the MS components (as defined according the National Cholesterol Education Program) and insulin resistance (estimated using the homeostasis model) with endothelium-dependent vasodilation were examined in 42 white and 55 black subjects. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed as the increment in leg blood flow (measured by thermodilution) after exposure to <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride.</b> Waist circumference, glucose, blood pressure, and insulin resistance distributions did not differ between ethnic groups; blacks in our sample had higher HDL cholesterol (1. 31 versus 1. 09 mmol/L; P 0. 001) and lower triglyceride levels (1. 01 versus 1. 37 mmol/L; P 0. 005) than white subjects. In the absence of the MS, black subjects exhibited reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation compared with white subjects (P 0. 005), and both groups demonstrated significantly worse endothelial function when the MS was present (maximal increase in leg blood flow: blacks: 1079 % MS absent, 5316 % MS present; whites...|$|E
40|$|Background Bronchial Thermoplasty, a {{procedure}} that applies thermal energy to the airway wall {{has been shown to}} impair the ability of airway to contract in response to <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (Mch). The technique has been advocated as an alternative treatment for asthma that may permanently limit airway narrowing. In previous experimental studies in dogs and humans, it was shown that those airways treated with bronchial thermoplasty had significant impairment of Mch responsiveness. Methods In the present study, we investigated the ability of canine airways to close completely with very high concentrations of Mch after bronchial thermoplasty. Bronchial thermoplasty was performed on dogs using the Alair System, comprising a low power RF controller and a basket catheter with four electrodes. A local atomization of Mch agonist was delivered directly to the epithelium of the same airway locations with repeated challenges. Airway size was measured with computed tomography, and closure was considered to occur in any airway where the lumen fell below the resolution of the scanner (< 1 mm). Results Our results show that, while treated airways still have the capacity to close at very high doses of Mch, this ability is seriously impaired after treatment, requiring much higher doses. Conclusions Bronchial thermoplasty as currently applied seems to simply shift the entire dose response curve toward increasing airway size. Thus, this procedure simply serves to minimize the ability of airways to narrow under any level of stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Background—We {{recently}} reported endothelial dysfunction as a novel cardiovascular risk factor associated with insulin resistance/obesity. Here, we tested whether hyperandrogenic insulin-resistant women with {{polycystic ovary syndrome}} (PCOS) who {{are at increased risk}} of macrovascular disease display impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and whether endothelial function in PCOS is associated with particular metabolic and/or hormonal characteristics. Methods and Results—We studied leg blood flow (LBF) responses to graded intrafemoral artery infusions of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (MCh) and to euglycemic hyperinsulinemia in 12 obese women with PCOS and in 13 healthy age- and weight-matched control subjects (OBW). LBF increments in response to MCh were 50 % lower in the PCOS group than in the OBW group (P, 0. 01). Euglycemic hyperinsulinemia increased LBF above baseline by 30 % in the PCOS and 60 % in OBW group (P, 0. 05 between groups). Across all subjects, the maximal LBF response to MCh exhibited a strong inverse correlation with free testosterone levels (r 520. 52, P, 0. 007). This relationship was stronger than with any other parameter, including insulin sensitivity. Conclusions—PCOS is characterized by (1) endothelial dysfunction and (2) resistance to the vasodilating action of insulin. This endothelial dysfunction appears to be associated with both elevated androgen levels and insulin resistance. Given the central vasoprotective role of endothelium, these findings could explain, at least in part, the increased risk for macrovascular disease in women with PCOS.

40|$|Care {{guidelines}} for the delivery of aerosol agents such as <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (MC) for bron-choprovocation testing {{require the use of}} pneumatic jet nebulizers that have well-defined droplet size and mass output. A recently developed disposable, breath-actuated nebulizer (AeroEclipse) may offer bronchoprovocation testers an alternative to existing devices. METHODS: We studied the performance of 5 AeroEclipse nebulizers with regard to mass of MC delivered with various MC solution concentrations and numbers of inhalations, using a model of adult tidal breathing. Each nebulizer was operated with compressed air (8 L/min at 50 psig) and an initial fill of 2 mL. MC solutions with mass concentrations of 0. 25, 0. 98, 3. 85, and 15. 70 mg/mL were tested. The total mass of MC delivered was determined after 5, 10, and 15 complete breathing cycles, by assaying the MC collected on a filter placed at the nebulizer mouthpiece. The aerosol droplet size distribution, fine droplet fraction (FDF) (percentage of droplets < 4. 8 m diameter), and fine droplet mass (FDM) (mass of droplets < 4. 8 m diameter) were determined by laser diffractometry, using physiologi-cally normal saline as a surrogate for MC solution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether insulin's effect to vasodilate {{skeletal}} muscle vasculature is mediated by endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO). N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of NO synthase, was administered directly into the femoral artery of normal subjects at a dose of 16 mg/min and leg blood flow (LBF) was measured during an infusion of saline (NS) or during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (HIC) designed to approximately double LBF. In response to the intrafemoral artery infusion of L-NMMA, LBF decreased from 0. 296 +/- 0. 032 to 0. 235 +/- 0. 022 liters/min during NS and from 0. 479 +/- 0. 118 to 0. 266 +/- 0. 052 liters/min during HIC, P < 0. 03. The proportion of NO-dependent LBF during NS and HIC was approximately 20 % and approximately 40 %, respectively, P < 0. 003 (NS vs. HIC). To elucidate whether insulin increases EDNO synthesis/release or EDNO action, vasodilative responses to graded intrafemoral artery infusions of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (MCh) or the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were studied in normal subjects during either NS or HIC. LBF increments in response to intrafemoral artery infusions of MCh but not SNP were augmented during HIC versus NS, P < 0. 03. In summary, insulin-mediated vasodilation is EDNO dependent. Insulin vasodilation of skeletal muscle vasculature most likely occurs via increasing EDNO synthesis/release. Thus, insulin appears to be a novel modulator of the EDNO system...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Occupational {{exposures}} to inhalative irritants {{have been associated}} with an increased reporting of respiratory symptoms in previous studies. Methacholine responsiveness represents a continuous measure of airway responsiveness. As such, it may be less subject to recall bias and more sensitive to detecting effects of occupational exposure on airways. Such effects may be stronger among atopic persons. The objective {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between self-reports of occupational exposure to dusts, gases, vapors, aerosols, and fumes and methacholine responsiveness. METHODS: A sample was studied of never smokers (N= 3044) chosen randomly from 8 areas in Switzerland. Atopy was defined as any positive skin test to 8 inhalative allergens. Nonspecific bronchial reactivity was tested using <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> and quantified by calculating the slope of the dose-response. RESULTS: The methacholine slopes were 19 % [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 6 - 32] higher for never smokers with exposure to dusts, fumes, vapors, gases, or aerosols than for the unexposed group. When only atopic never smokers were examined. the increase was larger (37 %, 95 % CI 7 - 75), and for persons with > 2 positive skin prick tests the effect was still higher (42 %, 95 % CI - 1. 5 - 104). Exposure to vapors and aerosols was strongly associated with increased methacholine slopes among the atopic subjects.

The {{objective of the}} current study was to investigate naphthalene-induced toxicity and to iden-tify and quantify DNA double-strand breaks in a murine naphthalene model of airway epithelial damage. Male C 57 /BL 6 mice were injected with 200 mg/kg naphthalene and culled at 12 -, 24 -, 48 - and 72 -h time points. Lung function and bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and the lungs were dissected for histological analysis and for quantitation of DNA double-strand breaks using gH 2 AX as a molecular marker. Mice injected with naphthalene had increased epithelial denudation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cellularity and reactivity to neb-ulized <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> as compared to corn oil vehicle controls. Histological changes were most pro-nounced at the 12 - and 24 -h time points. DNA double-strand breaks, quantitated as the number of gH 2 AX foci per cell, were highest at the 24 - and 48 -h time points.

Our findings indicate a time-dependent accumula-tion of gH 2 AX foci in mouse airway epithelial cells following administration of naphthalene.

Secretion was collected from male 2. 2 -kg New Zealand rabbits in 5 -min intervals for 3 h under basal conditions or constant stimulation with cholecystokinin (CCK; 0. 1 microgram per kg per h i. v.) or <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (MCh; 40 micrograms per kg per h i. v.). Both CCK and MCh produced an 8 -fold stimulation of protein output. Enzymes {{were separated by}} SDS/PAGE and quantitated by densitometry of Coomassie blue-stained gels. Under both basal conditions and constant MCh infusion, rapid neurosecretory-like 12 -min cyclic changes occurred in the proportions of amylase, lipase I, chymotrypsinogen, and trypsinogen. During constant infusion their percentages changed as much as 10 -fold, and their ratios cycled {{by as much as}} 30 -fold. The mean percentage for the entire infusion period for lipase I declined > 25 % with CCK or MCh, for amylase it rose approximately 30 %, and for chymotrypsinogen and trypsinogen it doubled (for all, P < 0. 05). CCK and MCh elicited subtly but significantly different mean enzyme percentages and enzyme ratios (P < 0. 05) for amylase, chymotrypsinogen, and trypsinogen; these differences were also confirmed by regression and correlation analyses. The changes in enzyme percentages and ratios were explicitly consistent with secretagogue-caused shifts in the intrapancreatic enzyme secretory sources.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the correlation of HOARSI grades 3 / 4 with the characteristics of RAO and of HOARSI- 2 with the characteristics of inflammatory airway disease. Further, to test whether there are phenotypic differences in the manifestation of lung disease between families. METHODS: Seventy-one direct offspring of 2 RAO-affected Warmblood stallions (33 from the first family, 38 from the second) were graded as HOARSI- 1 - 4 and underwent a clinical examination of the respiratory system, arterial blood gas analysis, endoscopic mucus scoring, cytology of tracheobronchial secretion (TBS) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and clinical assessment of airway reactivity to <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride.</b> RESULTS: HOARSI- 3 / 4 animals in clinical exacerbation showed signs consistent with RAO: coughing, nasal discharge, abnormal lung sounds and breathing pattern as well as increased numbers of neutrophils in TBS and BALF, excessive mucus accumulation and airway hyper-responsiveness to methacholine.

Many studies associate the increase of the airways reactivity with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Aim- In this study we have evaluated {{the effect of the}} intraluminal exposition to gastric juice of trachea on the reactivity to methacholine from rats submitted to a pulmonary allergic inflammation. Methods- Group of rats were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. After 24 hours the animals were sacrificed, and their tracheae were removed to be cultured with gastric juice. The gastric juice was obtained from a donor rat. Subsequently the segments were placed into plastic plates with RPMI- 1640 for incubation, under suitable atmosphere and time. After the period of incubation the segments were put into chambers for the analysis of the contractile response to methacholine. Results-We observed reduction in the contractile response of trachea cultured with gastric juice from allergic rats. This result was confirmed by the pharmacological treatments with compound 48 / 80 and dissodium cromoglicate (mast cells blockade), L-NAME (nitric oxide inhibitor, NO), capsaicin (neuropeptides depletion) and indomethacin (ciclooxigenase inhibitor). Conclusions- Our results highlight to the existence of a complex interaction between pulmonary allergy and gastric juice in the airways. The involvement of the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic system, NO, prostanoids and mast cells are directly related to this interaction. We suggest that the reduced contractile response observed in vitro may represent a protector mechanism of the airways. Despite its presence in the human body it can not be observed due to the predominant effects of excitatory the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic system. HEADINGS- Gastroesophageal reflux. Asthma.

After sensitization, guinea pigs were exposed to aerosols of 0. 1 mg/ml salbutamol solution twice a week (OVA + S 2 x, N = 7) or five times a week (OVA + S 5 x, N = 8). We studied allergen-specific (OVA inhalation time) and -nonspecific (response to methacholine) respiratory system responsiveness. Seventy-two hours after the last OVA challenge, guinea pigs were anesthetized and tracheostomized, respiratory system resistance and elastance were measured and a dose-response curve to inhaled <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> was obtained. Specific IgG 1 was also quantified by the passive cutaneous anaphylactic technique. OVA-sensitized guinea pigs (N = 8) showed reduction of the time of OVA exposure before the onset of respiratory distress, at the 5 th, 6 th and 7 th exposures (P < 0. 001).

After 2 h of infusion of Intralipid plus heparin, FFA levels increased from 562 +/- 95 to 1, 303 +/- 188 micromol, and from 350 +/- 35 to 3, 850 +/- 371 micromol (P < 0. 001) vs. saline for both low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Mch-induced vasodilation relative to baseline was reduced by approximately 20 % {{in response to the}} raised FFA levels in both groups (P < 0. 05, saline vs. FFA, ANOVA). In contrast, similar FFA elevation did not change leg blood flow responses to sodium nitroprusside. During the 2 -h SRIF infusion, insulin levels fell, and FFA levels rose from 474 +/- 22 to 1, 042 +/- 116 micromol (P < 0. 01); Mch-induced vasodilation was reduced by approximately 20 % (P < 0. 02, saline vs. SRIF, ANOVA). Replacement of basal insulin levels during SRIF resulted in a fall of FFA levels from 545 +/- 47 to 228 +/- 61 micromol, and prevented the impairment of Mch-induced vasodilation seen with SRIF alone. In conclusion, (a) elevated circulating FFA levels cause endothelial dysfunction, and (b) impaired endothelial function in insulin-resistant humans may be secondary to the elevated FFA concentrations observed in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} shown that lipopolysaccharide (LIPS) exposure in sensitised animals 18 h after ovalbumin (OVA) challenge inhibits OVA-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). In the present study, we investigated {{the effect of}} LPS on OVA-induced acute and late-phase allergic responses in sensitised rats when challenged with OVA. Methods: Rats were sensitised with OVA and 11 days later challenged with 1 % OVA in {{the presence or absence}} of LPS (0. 5 - 50 mug/ml) given in the same nebulizer. Acute responses to OVA were measured each minute for 30 min after challenge. In a separate group of animals, late-phase responses to OVA were determined at 24 h. At the end of each study, Evans blue dye was injected and animals sacrificed 30 min later. Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained to monitor inflammatory cell migration and microvascular leakage. Results: OVA challenge in sensitised animals produced an acute response with changes in lung mechanics peaking 10. 0 +/- 0. 9 min after OVA and returning to baseline within 30 min. This was followed 24 h later by increased responses to <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (MCh), inflammatory cell influx and increased Evans blue leakage into the lungs. Presence of 5 or 50 mug/ml LPS in the nebulizer during OVA challenge altered the kinetics of the acute-phase response, with an immediate decrease in lung function (time to peak decreased from 10. 3 +/- 1. 2 to 1. 8 +/- 0. 2 and 2. 2 +/- 0. 3 min, respectively: p < 0. 001, n = 6) and a dose-dependent attenuation of late-phase AHR, cellular influx (n = 5, p < 0. 001) and Evans blue leakage (n = 5, p < 0. 001) at 24 h. Conclusions: In summary, co-administration of OVA with LPS modifies both the acute and late-phase responses to the allergen, inducing an earlier acute change in lung function and a dose-dependent inhibition of late-phase responses to the allergen.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University. This {{study used}} the {{procedures}} of classical conditioning {{to investigate the}} possibility of producing asthmatic bronchospasm as a conditioned response. In order {{to carry out this}} study equipment was developed which permitted the experimental operations to be carried out while disguising the purpose of the experiment from the subjects. 	In the experiment, bronchospasm, induced by inhaled acetyl beta <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride,</b> and shown to be highly similar to the condition of the lungs in asthma, was paired with auditory or visual stimuli. Similarly, Isuprel-induced relief of bronchospasm was paired with another exteroceptive stimulus in an attempt to condition the end of the attack. Subjects, on the average, received ten to fifteen conditioning trials depending on their cooperation and availability. 	Of four subjects who completed the necessary trials evidence for conditioning appeared in two. Magnitude of the conditioned responses is not great, producing, on the average, reduction of about 8 % of the vital capacity in five minutes. Both of these subjects show conditioning to the experimental situation; one of the two, conditioning to the exteroceptive stimuli presented by the experimenter. 	The fact that conditioning did not automatically result from the experimental procedure and the complexity of the conditioning process apparent from detailed examination of the individual cases, led to discussion concerning the nature of conditioning, with special emphasis on the new area of interoceptive conditioning. The author takes the viewpoint that a central emotional-expectancy is an important aspect of conditioned visceral responses, and rejects connectionism between an external stimulus and a response. 	In addition, one peculiarity of the conditioning done in this experiment is noted. The unconditioned stimulus, rather than acting on the sensory nervous system, produces direct local change in the lungs. The resulting lack of representation of the UCS in the central nervous system is discussed in the reference to classical Pavlovian theory. 	The writer sees the application of interoceptive conditioning techniques as a fruitful method for further exploration of psychosomatic disorders. [TRUNCATED...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityWith the {{attention}} of many physiologists, pharmacologists, biochemists, and microbiologists focused upon the cell, the quantitation of the responses of single cell effectors is of current interest. This thesis {{is devoted to the}} consideration of methods of quantitating the melanophore responses of frogs and fish to drugs and hormones. Color changes of animals have been studied since the time of Aristotle. For many years the melanophore responses of various species of animals were studied with respect to changes in environmental background. In the earlier part of this century the responses of melanophores to drugs and hormones, isolated from the endocrine glands, especially the pituitary and adrenal gland, were observed and quantitated, for the most part, subjectively. More recently the demonstration of the melanophore stimulating activity of preparations of ACTH has greatly increased interest in the responses of melanophores. A controversy of whether ACTH has intermedin activity or whether intermedin is a contaminant of ACTH preparations has increased the need for objective quantitative methods for measuring melanophore responses. Demonstration of the melanophore stimulating principle in the blood of patients under stress, patients with Addison's disease, and in pregnancy increases the importance of quantitation of the melanophore responses. Similarity between the pigment cells of the retina of many animals and the pigment cells present in the skins, fascia, and mesenteries of animals has been another stimulus for this study. Both morphology and the mechanism of melanin pigment migration are considered in the thesis. Photographs which confirm the theory that the melanophores of Fundulus heteroclitis are fixed stellate processed cells whose pigment migrates {{into and out of the}} processes and the body of the cell in response to epinephrine and an adrenergic blocking drug N- 9 -Fluorenyl-N-ethyl- 2 Chlorethylamine HCl (SY- 21) are presented. The reason for the changes in color of animals with the migration of pigment within the melanophores was demonstrated by measuring the areas covered by single melanophores with their pigment in the dispersed and concentrated states. The melanophore with dispersed pigment was found to cover approximately six times more area than with pigment in the concentrated state. A critical review of the previously reported methods of recording and quantitating melanophore responses is presented. Methods of quantitating melanophores are discussed under two large categories: subjective and objective. Subjective methods are those which use an arbitrary index by which the various stages of the melanophores are characterized by numbers. Together with the subjective eiement of such methods, the statistical treatment of such indices as measurement data is criticized on the ground that there is no mathematical reaction of the various subdivisions. The originators of the method expressed the fact that the indices were arbitrary designations. Criticisms of the objective quantitative methods developed up to the present time are discussed. It is concluded that only an objective quantitative method for measuring melanophore responses to which valid statistical procedures can be applied should be used for assay of the melanophore stimulating principle. An objective quantitative method of measuring melanophore responses in the intact frog is presented. This method consists of series of measurements of the light reflected from the dorsal surface of intact light adapted frogs before and at various time intervals after the administration of an Armour ACTH preparation. An extensive analysis of the data is presented and discussed. A slight dependence of the peak and one-hour responses on the starting reflectances of the frogs was calculated by means of covariance analysis. No dependence of the responses on the vreight of the animals was found. The arbitrary practice of administering the hormone on the basis of animal weight is criticized on the grounds that previous workers did not establish the dependence of the response on the weight of the animal. Dose-response regression lines are presented for the peak-response and the response one hour after administration of the ACTH. Analysis of these lines and comparison of the slopes, variances of error, and precision indices indicate the one-hour response has about the same degree of precision as the peakresponse. For purposes of assay, the one-hour-response is more convenient to use. This method fulfills the three criteria for quantitating responses set forth by Gaddum in that there is a linear relationship over a hundred fold range of doses; the standard deviation is independent of the response; and the precision index, lambda, has a small value. The reliability of the photoelectric method for quantitating melanophore responses was demonstrated by means of the assay of unknown solutions of the standard Armour ACTH preparation. An average error of 14 % for the unknowns was found. This method was employed in the assay of the melanophore stimulating activity of anterior pituitary preparations provided by Dr. E. B. Astwood. Most of the melanophore stimulating activity of the preparations was found to be present in the acetic acid fraction produced by fractionation of Corticotrophin between butanol and acetic acid. We are unable to confirm the 400 fold purification of the ACTH (butanol fraction) reported by Astwood and coworkers. Results of the assay of an alkali-treated preparation of Corticotrophin indicate a potentiation reported previously by other workers. Assay of the melanophore stimulating activity of posterior pituitary preparations indicated that almost all the intermedin activity is present in the Vasopressin fraction of posterior pituitary powder. Pitocin, or the oxytocic fraction of posterior pituitary powder, was found to have very little melanophore stimulating activity. Comparison of the slopes, standard deviations and precision indices of the standard preparation over a period of seven months indicated a stability of the assay method. It is concluded, therefore, that the photoelectric method of measuring melanophore responses is reliable. A study of the effects of a number of drugs on the melanophores of the intact frog and the response of the melanophores to a dose of 0. 4 µg/frog was presented. Dimethylaminoethyl benzhydryl ether HCl (Benadryl), atropine sulfate, epinephrine in a dose of 0. 1 mg/frog, <b>methacholine</b> <b>chloride,</b> and a drug produced by the condensation of an alkoxyphenylamine with formaldehyde (48 / 80) were found to disperse the pigment within the melanophores of the intact light adapted frogs. Histamine diphosphate, epinephrine - 1 mg/frog, and tetraethylammonium did not disperse the pigment within the melanophores at one half hour. None of the drugs studied blocked the responses to the standard dose of ACTH. A method of quantitating the melanophore responses of isolated frog skins was described and compared with the in vivo method. When the results were expressed in the same way as that of the originators of the method, there was an increase in the variability of the responses and heterogeneity of the variances was revealed. The responses expressed as the light transmission measurement forty minutes after administration of the ACTH was variable. A log dose-response regression line was presented with its statistical analysis. The precision index of the in vitro photoelectric method was found to be greater than that of the in vivo photoelectric method. The sensitivity of the intact animal was greater than isolated pieces of frog skin. An attempt to quantitate the melanophore responses of isolated Fundulus heteroclitis melanophores was presented. The method, similar to that reported by Smith consists of the measurement of changes in light transmission through the scales after the administration of piperidine methyl- 3 -benzodioxane (Benodaine), and in another series, epinephrine. Statistical analysis indicated variability of the responses and a precision index of 0. 96. Because of the great variability of the responses no significant differences were produced by changing the temperature at which the experiments are conducted. The response to epinephrine was also variable and in this series no significant regression was found. In conclusion, a method of quantitating melanophore responses of the intact frog has been developed. This method has the advantages of sensitivity, reliability and accuracy. The data permit the application of statistical procedures which give the results a known degree of confidence that is unobtainable with the in vivo methods that have been reported to date...|$|E
