40|$|Tungsten halogen lamps {{are widely}} used as sources of radiant {{intensity}} because of their compactness and long life. Little is known, however, about their usefulness as secondary standards of radiant intensity. What is unknown is the polar distribution of the emitted light. If it is irregular in space, {{it may be possible}} to use a frosting as a means of providing for a more uniform distribution. In addition, use of a black sleeve over the lamp may be used to control emitted light, and also control the temperature of the lamp. To perform the experiment, a lampholder was designed and constructed, which allows the lamp to be moved on its horizontal and vertical axis. The lampholder was set up on an optical bench along with a foot-candle meter, for lamp testing. Using this set up a clear lamp, and lamps frosted by mechanical buffing and acid treatement were tested for direction characteristics. A black sleeve was designed and constructed and tested with the <b>machine</b> frosted <b>lamp.</b> Experimentation shows favorably tward the fact that a <b>machine</b> frosted <b>lamp</b> can be used as a secondary standard...|$|R

40|$|This paper summarises some {{findings}} of a book titled 'Consumer Product Innovation and Sustainable Design'. The book {{was inspired by the}} author's archive of the (UK) Consumers’ Association publication, Which? that provides a unique written and pictorial record of the technological and design evolution of consumer products marketed in Britain from 1957 to the present. The core of the book comprises case studies of six consumer product classes – bicycles, washing <b>machines,</b> electric <b>lamps,</b> television equipment, vacuum cleaners and mobile (cell) phones. The chosen product classes were based on selecting for different levels of technological complexity, rates of technological and design change and the relative importance of engineering, aesthetic, human and environmental factors in design. The case studies track the technological and design evolution of these products from their invention to the present day. The case studies also examined when, why and how environmental criteria became part of their specification; the influence of socio-economic and cultural factors on their evolution; and their impacts on the environment and society. The paper also draws on the case studies to provide conclusions about patterns of technological and design change and to provide lessons for designers, engineers, managers, marketers and educators – for example, on what makes some consumer products successful and others market failures, and how to design for sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Copper-antimony {{sulphide}} {{thin films}} were successfully deposited on glass substrates at different dip time using solution growth technique. Optical {{studies of the}} grown films are presented. Transmittance and reflectance measurements were obtained from an AVASPEC- 2048 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200 - 900 nm. The thickness of the films was obtained by surface profile analysis using a Dektak Veeko- 150 stylus surface profiler. The thickness obtained for the films were {{in the range of}} 1. 0 µm to 1. 45 µm depending on the dip time. Results show that the film exhibited poor transmittance and high reflectance of solar radiation in the Infra-Red (IR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum respectively. A high absorption coefficient in the range of 3. 11 x 10 6 m- 1 to 4. 35 x 10 6 m- 1 was obtained for the film in the Ultra-Violet (UV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum depending on the dip time. Other properties studied include optical conductivity, dielectric function, extinction coefficient and refractive index respectively. Optical studies reveal that this material could be exploited for various purposes which include being used as an absorber material for the construction of solar cells, for the fabrication of optical devices and for the manufacture of highly reflective mirrors commonly found in desktop scanners, photocopy <b>machines,</b> halogen <b>lamps,</b> astronomical telescope and car head lamps. The material was observed to have a direct band gap between 2. 05 eV and 2. 85 eV depending on the dip time...|$|R
40|$|Artifacts tell an {{important}} story. While researching this topic for my master’s thesis, I discovered twenty-two cloth-covered books in museum collections. Dirty, stained, and sometimes badly faded, the fabric had been overlooked, {{assumed to be}} sail cloth. Cotton, most of it brightly-printed, plain weave fabric, had been sewn around the covers of books purchased on shore just as we see in this picture. Several other images of the cloth covering these books will be shown. These are the fabrics that went to sea, procured from slop chests and sewn by hand onto leather or cardboard-bound journals and account books. These examples {{are part of the}} evidence presented here proving that cloth sold or bartered during a whaling voyage played {{an important}} role in the social and economic structure of whaling during the peak of America’s participation in the industry. This presentation gives a brief look at the use of trade cloth by the captain and crew members of American whaling ships and by Native populations of the Pacific, demonstrating how fabric was used in place of any kind of legal tender. There are so many wonderful stories that I’ve had to leave out! Research is focused on ships whaling in the Pacific Ocean between 1820 - 1870, a time when whales provided oil for <b>machines</b> and <b>lamps,</b> and whalebone, used as a stiffener in articles such as corsets and parasols. Ships studied sailed from the ports of New Bedford and Nantucket, Massachusetts and New London, Connecticut.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that {{there had not been}} many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how [...] "crummy" [...] the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how [...] "crummy" [...] and [...] "dismal" [...] Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot <b>machines</b> and the <b>lamps</b> in the ceiling. The [...] "way they radiate out" [...] had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided {{to put it in the}} clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular".|$|R
40|$|Diabetes is {{a disease}} that interferes with the body's ability to use and store sugar, which can cause many health problems. Over time, {{diabetes}} affects the circulatory system including the retina. As diabetes progress, {{the vision of a}} patient may start to deteriorate and then leading to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) which further will cause blindness. So, early detection of the disease is important to avoid blindness. There are several ways to diagnose DR and slit – lamp examination is one of the traditional method used by the ophthalmologist. This method requires the clinician to see directly into patient’s eye through an ophthalmoscope or the slit <b>lamp</b> <b>machine</b> {{to determine whether or not}} the eyes contain any abnormal features that indicate DR. However, this is not the most effective method yet. Any human can get tired and drowsy including doctors. This natural flaws of human being can affect the diagnosis and then causing false result analysis. Besides, every individuals doesn’t hold same opinion and judgment. Therefore, this project is proposed to assist the clinicians in identifying DR. There are two main abnormal features that are formed in the retina of a diabetic retinopathy’s patient. They are hemorrhage and exudates. Hemorrhage are formed as a result due to leakage of retinal blood vessel which has similar red colour to the vessel. Whereas exudates are yellow-white deposits structure on the retina that is formed due to leakage of blood from abnormal vessels. This thesis mainly focuses on developing a Fundus Image Analysis (FIA) system that extracts the anatomical and both the abnormal features of the retina in order to diagnose the disease. This research is carried out in three phases. In the first phase, an automated system is developed to distinguish the anatomical features of the retina from the abnormal features. This phase is called the Masking Phase. This phase involved combinations of several image processing techniques including Specify Polygonal Region of Interest (ROIPOLY), Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), Morphological Opening and Structuring, Median Filtering and Thresholding. The second phase is the Haemorrhage Extraction phase. In this phase, Saturation Adjust Method, Morphological operations and Regional Minima technique is proposed. The third and the last phase is the Exudates Extraction phase. In this phase, Edge Detection, Gradient Magnitude and Region Of Interest techniques are combined to form a complete working algorithm. The experimented images in this project are the retinal fundus images that was taken from a public database (diaretdb 1 - Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database). It is a public database for benchmarking diabetic retinopathy detection from digital images. By using this database and the defined testing protocol, the results between different methods can be compared. At the end of this project, the result shows that the method applied is able to detect exudates features and capable of detecting and distinguishing hemorrhage from blood vessels. Final result shows the accuracy of 48. 3...|$|R
