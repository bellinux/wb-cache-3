50|$|Druas were sacred canoes in {{the sense}} that only aristocrats could own one. Their main role was as war ships, taking part in naval battles and {{transporting}} warriors during raids. They also had a representative role, and were used to collect taxes. Following Fijian custom, it was an insult to cross her bows, or to sail to her windward, where the <b>mast</b> <b>stay</b> could be easily cut bringing down the sail. It was also custom to paddle and not to sail in sight of another chief's territory. Launching a drua required a bloody ritual, including human sacrifices.|$|E

5000|$|Because the Impulse {{class rules}} allow for {{variations}} in the rotating mast's bracing and rigging including {{variations in the}} rigging attachment points at both the mast and the hull, this allows the Impulse sailor the option of tailoring the rig to better suit their weight and common sailing conditions.

50|$|Stays are ropes, wires, or rods on sailing {{vessels that}} run fore-and-aft along the {{centerline}} from the masts to the hull, deck, bowsprit, or to other masts which serve {{to stabilize the}} masts. On a ship with a single <b>mast,</b> <b>stays</b> that run aft are called backstays and stays that run forward are called forestays. Along with shrouds, they form the primary stabilization for the standing rigging.|$|R

5000|$|Gaff rig is a sailing rig (configuration of sails, <b>mast</b> and <b>stays)</b> {{in which}} the sail is four-cornered, fore-and-aft rigged, {{controlled}} at its peak and, usually, its entire head by a spar (pole) called the gaff. Because of {{the size and shape}} of the sail, a gaff rig will have running backstays rather than permanent backstays.|$|R

25|$|On 20 December 1960, Bon Jour {{departed}} Copenhagen {{bound for}} Stockholm, Sweden. During the voyage, {{some of the}} <b>mast</b> <b>stays</b> worked loose and the ship was anchored off Gotska Sandön whilst the mast was made secure. On 23 December, Bon Jour ran into a storm. The fishing vessel Danette located her {{the next day and}} on 25 December the crew abandoned Bon Jour as they feared the mast would collapse. They were taken to Sandhamn by pilot boat. On 26 December, the salvage tug Neptune took the crew back to Bon Jour. The next day, Neptune towed Bon Jour to Sandhamn. It was suggested that the ship should be taken to Lidingö for repairs, but on arrival there it was discovered that the shipyard had closed six months previously. Repairs were carried out by the Crichton-Vulcan shipyard, Turku, Finland. The work had to be done offshore as the Finnish Government applied pressure on Crichton-Vulcan not to fulfil the job.|$|R

Triangular cross-cut sail panels are designed to meet the <b>mast</b> and <b>stay</b> at an angle from either the warp or the weft (on the bias) to allow stretching along the luff, but minimize strutting on the luff and foot, where the fibers are aligned with the edges of the sail.|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on time inconsistency has studied the external commitment devices that individuals use to address their self-control problems: tying oneself to the <b>mast,</b> <b>staying</b> away from temptation, holding illiquid assets, or “asking for controls ” from others. This paper, by contrast, focuses on internal commitment mechanisms or personal rules (diets, exercise regimens, resolutions, moral or religious precepts, etc.) through which people attempt to achieve self— discipline. The basic idea, which builds on Ainslie (1992), is that rules cause lapses to be interpreted as precedents, resulting in a loss of self—reputation which has an adverse impact on future self— control. We thus model the behavior of individuals who are unsure of their willpower (ability to delay gratiÞcation) in certain states of the world, and characterize feasible rules as (Markovian) self—reputational equilibria where impulses for immediate gratiÞcation are held in check by the fear of “losing faith in oneself ” —which would lead to a further collapse of self—discipline. We then examine how equilibrium conduct reßects {{the extent to which the}} individual’s self—monitoring is subject to opportunistic distortions of memory or inference, such as selectively recalling or Þnding excuses for one’s past behavior...|$|R

60|$|The sailor now {{told him}} {{the names of the}} <b>masts</b> and <b>stays,</b> giving him a general idea of the work aloft, and {{presently}} asked him whether he would like to return to the deck now, or to mount a bit higher. Although Reuben was now becoming accustomed to the position, he would, had he consulted his inner feelings, have rather gone down than up; but he thought it was better to put a good face on it, and to accustom himself, at once, to what he would probably have to do sooner or later.|$|R
5000|$|On many warships, sails {{above the}} {{fighting}} top (a platform {{just above the}} lowest sail) were mounted on separate masts ("topmasts" [...] or [...] "topgallant masts") held in wooden sockets called [...] "tabernacles".

50|$|Conventional sails {{comprise}} panels, {{which are}} most often stitched together, at other times adhered. There are two basic configurations, cross-cut and radial.

2500|$|In the Comus class, the bow {{above the}} {{waterline}} was nearly straight, {{in contrast to}} that of wooden sailing ships. [...] The corvettes had stern galleries, similar to older frigates, but the ports were false, {{and there were no}} quarter galleries. [...] Boats were carried both amidships and at the stern. [...] The ships flew a barque or ship rig of sail on three masts, including studding sails on fore and mainmasts. The <b>masts</b> were <b>stayed</b> by shrouds which were anchored to chainplates affixed {{to the inside of the}} gunwales, rather than the exterior as in wooden sailing ships. [...] Their sailing rigs enabled them to serve in areas where coaling stations were rare, and to rely on their sails for propulsion.|$|R
50|$|Propulsion {{systems for}} ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, sailing, and {{mechanical}} propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, {{which was used}} even on large galleys. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect <b>mast,</b> supported by <b>stays</b> and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the turbosails, rotorsails, and wingsails have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.|$|R

50|$|The No. 14 {{started as}} the No. 50 when A. J. Foyt began fielding NASCAR teams in 1973 part-time, driving the Purolator-sponsored Chevrolet. He drove {{for the team}} on a very limited {{schedule}} throughout the seventies, picking up one pole and nine top-tens. Ron Hutcherson was the first driver besides Foyt to drive the car, and later Johnny Rutherford drove for the team in 1978. In the 1980s, Foyt was almost the sole driver of the team, and switched to the No. 14 with a Valvoline sponsorship in 1983, and posted his final career Top 5 at Talladega two years later in the Copenhagen-sponsored car. In 1989, Tracy Leslie drove for the team {{in a pair of}} races, finishing 20th at Michigan International Speedway. Foyt did not drive in the 1991 season. Instead, he allowed Mike Chase to drive for him. This driver finished no better than 25th. Foyt, afterwards, did not field a team until the inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994, when he qualified 40th and finished 30th in the No. 50. Foyt would attempt the Brickyard in 1995 and 1996, but did not qualify for either race, forcing his permanent retirement. During the 1999 season, rumors began spreading that Foyt would revive his defunct operation to compete in the Cup Series. After several months, it was announced that Foyt would hire rookie Mike Bliss as driver of the No. 14 Conseco-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix. Bliss qualified for the Daytona 500, but after failing to do so for the next three races, he was released and briefly replaced by Dick Trickle. After getting an offer from another team, Trickle would leave as well. He would be replaced by Rick Mast after he and several crew members left the bankrupt Larry Hedrick Motorsports team. <b>Mast</b> <b>stayed</b> with the team {{for the rest of the}} season, and had two Top 10's at Pocono and Bristol. In 2001, Ron Hornaday, Jr. was selected as the team's driver, but he only posted only one Top 10 at Las Vegas and was dismissed at the end of the season.|$|R

40|$|Chronic hypoxia {{results in}} {{pulmonary}} hypertension due to vasoconstriction and structural remodelling of peripheral lung blood vessels. We hypothesize that vascular remodelling is initiated {{in the walls}} of prealveolar pulmonary arteries by collagenolytic metalloproteinases (MMP) released from activated mast cells. Distribution of mast cells and their expression of interstitial collagenase, MMP- 13, in lung conduit, small muscular, and prealveolar arteries was determined quantitatively in rats exposed for 4 and 20 days to hypoxia as well as after 7 -day recovery from 20 -day hypoxia (10 % O 2). Mast cells were identified using Toluidine Blue staining, and MMP- 13 expression was detected using monoclonal antibody. After 4, but not after 20 days of hypoxia, {{a significant increase in}} the number of mast cells and their MMP- 13 expression was found within walls of prealveolar arteries. In rats exposed for 20 days, MMP- 13 positive mast cells accumulated within the walls of conduit arteries and subpleurally. In recovered rats, MMP- 13 positive mast cells gathered at the prealveolar arterial level as well as in the walls of small muscular arteries; these <b>mast</b> cells <b>stayed</b> also in the conduit part of the pulmonary vasculature.

Although a falling stay cable cut through a local church and across the transmitter site buildings, no one was injured. It completely disabled the BBC2 UHF transmitter and the ITV VHF transmitter, leaving several million people without service. BBC1 VHF television transmissions continued from Holme Moss. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) owned a collapsible emergency mast, 61 m tall, which was moved to Emley from the Lichfield transmitting station so that some service could be restored. ITV signals were restored to 2.5 million viewers within four days. The BBC provided a mobile mast on an outside broadcast van to restore a restricted BBC2 colour service within two days. The ITA bought a larger temporary mast from a Swedish company. A crew of Polish riggers were hired, and a 204 m mast was erected in under 28 days {{at a cost of}} £100,000. This mast could hold only one set of antennas, so many viewers in outlying areas still could not receive colour programmes. The taller mast was brought into service on 16 April. Some weeks later, the BBC erected a 91 m mast, improving coverage.|$|R
