5000|$|A steam separator, {{sometimes}} referred to as a <b>moisture</b> <b>separator,</b> is a device for separating water droplets from steam. The simplest type of steam separator is the steam dome on a steam locomotive.

50|$|The {{two-phase}} fluid (water and steam) above the core enters the riser area, {{which is the}} upper region contained inside of the shroud. The height of this region may be increased to increase the thermal natural recirculation pumping head. At {{the top of the}} riser area is the <b>moisture</b> <b>separator.</b> By swirling the two-phase flow in cyclone separators, the steam is separated and rises upwards towards the steam dryer while the water remains behind and flows horizontally out into the downcomer or annulus region. In the downcomer or annulus region, it combines with the feedwater flow and the cycle repeats.|$|E
50|$|Saturated steam at 600 psi is channeled {{from each}} steam {{generator}} {{to a common}} header, where the steam is then sent to the main engine, electrical generators, aircraft catapult system, and various auxiliaries. There are two main propulsion turbines, one high pressure turbine and one low pressure turbine, with a <b>moisture</b> <b>separator</b> in place between the two. The Low Pressure main propulsion turbine is double-ended, whereby the steam enters at the center and divides into two streams as it enters the actual turbine wheels, expanding and giving up its energy as it does so, causing the turbine to spin at high speed. The main shaft enters a reduction gear in which the high rotational velocity of the turbine shaft is stepped down to a usable turn rate for propelling the ship. The expended steam from the main engine and other auxiliaries enters condensers to be cooled into liquid water and recycled to the feed system.|$|E
50|$|The {{feedwater}} {{enters into}} the downcomer or annulus region and combines with water exiting the <b>moisture</b> <b>separators.</b> The feedwater subcools the saturated {{water from the}} <b>moisture</b> <b>separators.</b> This water now flows down the downcomer or annulus region, which is separated from the core by a tall shroud. The water then goes through either jet pumps or internal recirculation pumps that provide additional pumping power (hydraulic head). The water now makes a 180-degree turn and moves up through the lower core plate into the nuclear core, where the fuel elements heat the water. Water exiting the fuel channels at the top guide is saturated with a steam quality of about 15%. Typical core flow may be 45,000,000 kg/h (100,000,000 lb/h) with 6,500,000 kg/h (14,500,000 lb/h) steam flow. However, core-average void fraction is a significantly higher fraction (~40%).

40|$|The Reactor Recirculation System {{has been}} {{designed}} to perform the following functions: a. To provide forced circulation of reactor water through the core to overcome the power density limitation of the fuel. b. To provide a variable moderator (coolant) flow through the core to control reactor power without manipulation of the control rods. The Reactor Recirculation System has been sized to provide a total flow capacity equal to the required flow at rated load. The design pressure of the recirculation pumps is 1300 psig, with a design temperature of 575 0 F. The system piping and valves have been designed for a pressure of 1200 psig and a temperature of 570 °F. 5. 4. 1. 2 System Description The system consists of the reactor vessel and five piping loops, as shown in Drawing GE 237 E 798. Each loop comprises one motor driven pump, a motor generator (M-G) set, suction and discharge valves, a bypass valve around each discharge valve, pipe support hangers, piping, and associated system controls and instrumentation. Recirculated coolant enters the lower head of the reactor through vessel nozzles, passes through the diffuser and orifices {{at the bottom of the}} core and flows upward through the core where bulk boiling produces steam. The steam-water mixture enters the <b>moisture</b> <b>separators</b> and then the steam dryers. The water separated from the steam flows downward across the top of the plenum, where it mixes with the incoming feedwater, and enters the downcomer annulus between the shroud and the vessel wall. The coolant flows through the downcomer region, through the outlet nozzles, and into the recirculation pumps suction piping. The coolant is then returned to the vessel via the pumps and discharge piping. The continuous circulation ensures that hot spots are not created by steam bubbles, which would result in steam blanketing around fuel rods and in reduction of the heat removal capability of the coolant. To control reactor power level, the system makes use of the boiling water reactor large negative power coefficient. A power level increase is achieved b...|$|R
40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane (PEM) fuel cells, {{with low}} operating temperatures and high power density, are a reasonable candidate {{for use in}} mobile power generation. One large drawback to their use is that their fuel reformer requires not only fuel but also water, thereby requiring two separate reservoirs to be available. PEM fuel cells exhaust enough water in their oxidant stream to potentially {{meet the needs of}} the fuel reformer. If this water could be recovered and routed to the fuel reformer it would markedly increase the portability of PEM fuel cells. 	The goal of this research was to test a previously designed axial flow <b>moisture</b> <b>separator.</b> The separator was employed in a test bed which utilized compressed, heated air mixed with steam to simulate the oxidant exhaust conditions of a 25 kW PEM fuel cell. The simulated exhaust was saturated with water. The mixture was expanded through the turbine side of an automotive turbocharger, which dropped the temperature and pressure of the mixture, causing water to condense, making it available for separation. The humid air mixture was passed over an axial flow centrifugal separator and water was removed from the flow. 	The separator was tested in a variety of conditions with and without passing chilled water through the separator. The axial separator was tested independently, with a flow straightener preceding it, and with a commercially available centrifugal <b>moisture</b> <b>separator</b> in series following it. It was shown that cooling makes a significant impact on the separation rate while adding a flow straightener does not. Separation efficiencies of 19 % on average were experienced without cooling, while efficiencies of 50 % were experienced with 3. 1 kW of cooling. The separation efficiency of the two moisture separators combined was found to be 31. 7 % which is 165 % that of the axial separator alone under uncooled conditions. M. S.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various pH agents on the {{corrosion}} behavior of carbon steel was investigated under a simulated secondary water chemistry condition of a {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) in a laboratory, and the steel's corrosion performance was compared with the field data obtained from Uljin NPP unit 2 reactor. All tests were carried out at temperatures of 50 °C – 250 °C and pH of 8. 5 – 10. The pH at a given temperature was controlled by adding different agents. Laboratory data indicate that the corrosion rate of carbon steel decreased as the pH increased under the test conditions and the highest corrosion rate was measured at 150 °C. This high corrosion rate {{may be related to}} high dissolution and instability of Fe oxide (Fe 3 O 4) at 150 °C.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, steam {{generator}} (SG) thermal performance degradation has led to decreased plant efficiency and power output at numerous PWR nuclear power plants with recirculating-type SGs. The authors have developed and implemented methodologies for quantitatively evaluating the various sources of SG performance degradation, {{both internal and external}} to the SG pressure boundary. These methodologies include computation of the global fouling factor history, evaluation of secondary deposit thermal resistance using deposit characterization data, and consideration of pressure loss causes unrelated to the tube bundle, such as hot-leg temperature streaming and SG <b>moisture</b> <b>separator</b> fouling. In order to evaluate the utility of the global fouling factor methodology, the authors performed case studies for a number of PWR SG designs. Key results from two of these studies are presented here. In tandem with the fouling-factor analyses, a study evaluated for each plant the potential causes of pressure loss. The combined results of the global fouling factor calculations and the pressure-loss evaluations demonstrated two key points: (1) that the available thermal margin against fouling, which can vary substantially from plant to plant, has an important bearing on whether a given plant exhibits losses in electrical generating capacity, and (2) that a wide variety of causes can result in SG thermal performance degradation...|$|E
40|$|This section {{describes}} the capabilities to control, collect, process, handle, {{and dispose of}} the gaseous radioactive waste generated {{as a result of}} normal operation and anticipated operational occurrences. The systems addressed in this section are the off-gas system, the turbine gland seal exhaust system, and the mechanical vacuum pump system. The effects of hydrogen addition for hydrogen water chemistry are also addressed in this section. The off-gas system collects, contains, and processes the radioactive gases extracted from the steam condenser. The gases are exhausted by the steam jet air ejectors and flow through a preheater to a catalytic recombiner where all of the hydrogen is recombined with oxygen to form steam. All steam, from recombination booster jets and dilution is condensed for return as condensate and the noncondensible gases flow to a holdup pipe. The gas flow continues through a cooler condenser, a <b>moisture</b> <b>separator,</b> electric reheaters, a prefilter, activated charcoal adsorber vessels, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and then to the 310 -foot chimney for discharge to the environment.

40|$|A new {{non-destructive}} evaluation (NDE) method {{has been developed}} for metal pipes for the detection wall thinning. The method has been showed to be suitable for applications to electric power generation plants where flow accelerated corrosion (FAC) of carbon steel piping is a significant cause of increased maintenance and plant personnel casualty. The wall thinning screening system (WalSS) was developed in two major phases. In the first phase, the equipotential switching direct current potential drop (ES-DCPD) method was developed for piping wall (Ryu et al., 2008 a, 2010). In the second phase, in this paper, a quantitative detection criteria was developed. The relative ES-DCPD change of 3. 8 % {{has been defined as}} the screening criteria for wall thinning schematization. This criteria means that the component with measured ES-DCPD change greater than 3. 8 % is called for a more comprehensive examination. In the criteria development, all variables were taken into consideration based on commercial plant piping inspection data such as initial thickness distributions, wall thinning shape and nominal thickness. The developed WalSS based on ES-DCPD was applied to a <b>moisture</b> <b>separator</b> reheater (MSR) drain line of a commercial nuclear power plant (NPP) during a scheduled overhaul. The measured ES-DCPD change was 2. 16 %, which is lower than the ES-DCPD criteria, identifying the pipe having adequate wall thickness.

40|$|Moisture {{recovery}} {{is important in}} the operation of many fuel cell systems, especially proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The exhaust of a PEM fuel cell is a moderate temperature, pressurized humid air stream. A system that recovers liquid water condensate from the pressurized humid exhaust stream of a PEM fuel cell would markedly increase the effectiveness of such a system. The recovered water could be used to hydrate the fuel cell membrane, and it could supply a hydrocarbon reformer used for generating hydrogen. 	This project investigated and documented moisture recovery from the simulated humid exhaust stream of a 25 kW fuel cell with an improved axial flow separator. An axial flow centrifugal separator design was chosen as the best candidate due to its high efficiency and low pressure drop and a prototype was designed and constructed. The separator was then integrated into an experimental test system. First, the stream was simulated by heating compressed air and then humidifying it with superheated steam. Then, after expanding through the turbine section of an automotive turbocharger, the humid stream was passed through the <b>moisture</b> <b>separator</b> where liquid water condensate was removed from the flow. Results are presented for varying turbine inlet conditions at three separate separation lengths. It is shown that the separation efficiency for the improved design was 40 % higher and the pressure drop was only 1 / 3 that of the conventional separator. M. S. Committee Co-Chair: Said I.

This study aimed thus at the prediction and optimization of the mentioned treatment time in order to improve the efficiency of the plant itself and to achieve, in turn, the minimization of produced wastes. To the purpose an experimental campaign was carried out by analysing several samples, i. e. taken along the main steam piping line. Smear tests as well as metallographic analyses were carried out in order to determine respectively the radioactivity distribution and the crud composition on the inner surface of the components.

The decomposition method and Seild's multilevel iterative process were used to solve the problem.

40|$|Problems {{continue}} to be encountered concerning the traditional vacuum preloading method in field during the treatment of newly deposited dredger fills. In this paper, an improved multiple-vacuum preloading method was developed to consolidate newly dredger fills that are hydraulically placed in seawater for land reclamation in Lingang Industrial Zone of Tianjin City, China. With this multiple-vacuum preloading method, the newly deposited dredger fills could be treated effectively by adopting a novel <b>moisture</b> <b>separator</b> and a rapid improvement technique without sand cushion. A series of model tests was conducted in the laboratory for comparing {{the results from the}} multiple-vacuum preloading method and the traditional one. Ten piezometers and settlement plates were installed to measure the variations in excess pore water pressures and moisture content, and vane shear strength was measured at different positions. The testing results indicate that water discharge–time curves obtained by the traditional vacuum preloading method can be divided into three phases: rapid growth phase, slow growth phase, and steady phase. According to the process of fluid flow concentrated along tiny ripples and building of larger channels inside soils during the whole vacuum loading process, the fluctuations of pore water pressure during each loading step are divided into three phases: steady phase, rapid dissipation phase, and slow dissipation phase. An optimal loading pattern which could have a best treatment effect was proposed for calculating the water discharge and pore water pressure of soil using the improved multiple-vacuum preloading method. For the newly deposited dredger fills at Lingang Industrial Zone of Tianjin City, the best loading step was 20  kPa and the loading of 40 – 50  kPa produced the highest drainage consolidation. The measured moisture content and vane shear strength were discussed in terms of the effect of reinforcement, both of which indicate that the multiple-vacuum preloading method has a better treatment effect not only in decreasing the moisture content and increasing the bearing capacity, but also in increasing the process uniformity at different depths of foundation...|$|E
40|$|Scoping {{studies for}} a power {{conversion}} {{system based on}} a direct-cycle supercritical water reactor have been conducted. The electric power range of interest is 5 - 30 MWe with a design point of 20 MWe. The overall design objective {{is to develop a}} system that has minimized physical size and performs satisfactorily over a broad range of operating conditions. The design constraints are as follows: Net cycle thermal efficiency {ge} 20 %; Steam turbine outlet quality {ge} 90 %; and Pumping power {le} 2500 kW (at nominal conditions). Three basic cycle configurations were analyzed. Listed in order of increased plant complexity, they are: (1) Simple supercritical Rankine cycle; (2) All-supercritical Brayton cycle; and (3) Supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating. The sensitivity of these three configurations to various parameters, such as reactor exit temperature, reactor pressure, condenser pressure, etc., was assessed. The Thermoflex software package was used for this task. The results are as follows: (a) The simple supercritical Rankine cycle offers the greatest hardware simplification, but its high reactor temperature rise and reactor outlet temperature may pose serious problems from the viewpoint of thermal stresses, stability and materials in the core. (b) The all-supercritical Brayton cycle is not a contender, due to its poor thermal efficiency. (c) The supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating affords acceptable thermal efficiency with lower reactor temperature rise and outlet temperature. (d) The use of a <b>moisture</b> <b>separator</b> improves the performance of the supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating and allows for a further reduction of the reactor outlet temperature, thus it was selected for the next step. Preliminary engineering design of the supercritical Rankine cycle with feedwater preheating and moisture separation was performed. All major components including the turbine, feedwater heater, feedwater pump, condenser, condenser pump and pipes were modeled with realistic assumptions using the PEACE module of Thermoflex. A three-dimensional layout of the plant was also generated with the SolidEdge software. The results of the engineering design are as follows: (i) The cycle achieves a net thermal efficiency of 24. 13 % with 350 / 460 C reactor inlet/outlet temperatures, {approx} 250 bar reactor pressure and 0. 75 bar condenser pressure. The steam quality at the turbine outlet is 90 % and the total electric consumption of the pumps is about 2500 kWe at nominal conditions. (ii) The overall size of the plant is attractively compact and can be further reduced if a printed-circuit-heat-exchanger (vs shell-and-tube) design is used for the feedwater heater, which is currently the largest component by far. Finally, an analysis of the plant performance at off-nominal conditions has revealed good robustness of the design in handling large changes of thermal power and seawater temperature...|$|E
