40|$|During {{cryopreservation}} {{of human}} embryos, ice crystal {{formation in the}} embryos or in surrounding media may cause cryodamage to them and can be lethal. A strategy to avoid this is the vitrification procedure when the embryo and the surrounding medium undergo the transition to glassy state rather than a crystalline one during cooling. Similarly, recrystallization in the embryo <b>or</b> the <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> be avoided during the warming process. The necessary conditions for this are rapid cooling and warming rates. We assess the cooling and warming rates in the Rapid-i™ device for vitrification and cryostorage of human embryos from Vitrolife Sweden AB with help of numerical simulations. We demonstrate that the fast cooling and warming rates necessary for safe vitrification and warming are achieved in the device. We also determine safe margins for the warming procedure...|$|R

25|$|The {{pressure}} transmitting {{medium is}} an important component in any high-pressure experiment. The medium fills the space within the sample 'chamber' and applies the pressure being transmitted to the medium onto to the sample. In a good high-pressure experiment, the medium should maintain a homogeneous distribution of pressure on the sample. In other words, the <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> stay hydrostatic to ensure uniform compressibility of the sample. Once a pressure transmitting medium has lost its hydrostaticity, a pressure gradient forms in the chamber that increases with increasing pressure. This gradient can greatly affect the sample, compromising results. The <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> also be inert, as to not interact with the sample, and stable under high pressures. For experiments with laser heating, the medium should have low thermal conductivity. If an optical technique is being employed, the medium should be optically transparent and for x-ray diffraction, the medium should be a poor x-ray scatterer – as to not contribute to the signal.|$|R
