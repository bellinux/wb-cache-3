5|$|Channel 4 has {{expressed}} an interest in moving some activities to MediaCityUK. The BBC has stated that either BBC One or BBC Two could move to MediaCityUK by 2015 if the confirmed <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{dates of}} the <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> not known exactly. The Wichita {{move from the}} Arkansas to the Red {{occurred}} at some time between 1768 and 1772. The Osages occupied the former Pawnee-Wichita hunting grounds on the Arkansas in 1774, indicating that the Pawnees had left by then; in 1777, a Spanish report {{indicated that they were}} in Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} combat <b>move</b> <b>is</b> the taunt. If this <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{executed in}} full without the opponent striking, the opponent loses advantage.|$|R
50|$|The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> {{planned to}} {{have been done in}} 2014, but after {{construction}} delays the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> delayed by three years, to 2017.|$|R
50|$|The Daihatsu <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> a kei car, {{produced}} by Japanese automaker Daihatsu since August 1995. The <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> {{designed to be}} as tall as compact cars like the Suzuki Wagon R. Daihatsu successfully sold 500,000 Moves during its {{first three years of}} production. The <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> built upon the chassis of the Daihatsu Cuore but with a taller body.|$|R
5|$|These <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} {{to be used in}} flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch into the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E
5000|$|In Young Justice, the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{performed}} several times. It's {{referred to}} as [...] "maneuver seven", which <b>is</b> what the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> originally known as in the comics.|$|R
50|$|Each pawn <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{defined by}} the new square {{occupied}} by the pawn. For example, if player 1 moves from square e9 to e8, player 1’s <b>move</b> <b>is</b> e8.|$|R
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 2013-2014 season, Crawford <b>was</b> linked a <b>move</b> to Cove Rangers {{after the}} <b>move</b> <b>was</b> agreed. However, the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> broken down for unknown circumstances.|$|R
5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|The CAMS {{attack in}} set patterns, and their next <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> {{indicated}} by visual and aural cues. The player avoids these attacks via evasive spins, rolls and other maneuvers. Vanessa cannot move while attacking, {{and so the}} player must often use the environment as cover. Defeated enemies sometimes drop items that replenish health and energy or that trigger a combo timer, which multiplies the points earned from enemies destroyed consecutively. Each mission {{takes place in a}} series of rooms that contain a fixed number of enemies and may include a boss robot. At the end of a mission, the player receives a score {{based on the number of}} rooms explored and enemies destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> also the same between each character.|$|E
50|$|The second version, now simply called <b>Move,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in October 2004. Hardware support and stability have seen much improvement. <b>Move</b> <b>is</b> now superseded by Mandriva One and Mandriva Flash.|$|R
50|$|The Representative Body {{found itself}} to be the centre of media {{attention}} at the Spring 2017 when it announced the moving of its Head Quarters to Callaghan Square. Some parishioners felt the <b>move</b> <b>was</b> quite an expense, while the Representative Body maintained its current buildings were unfit for purpose and a <b>move</b> <b>was</b> necessary. The <b>move</b> <b>is</b> planned to go ahead in September 2017.|$|R
50|$|The type I <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} <b>move</b> {{that affects the}} writhe of the diagram. The type III <b>move</b> <b>is</b> the only one which {{does not change the}} {{crossing}} number of the diagram.|$|R
5|$|The {{levels in}} And Yet It <b>Moves</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} such that spinning {{the world at}} certain moments is required to progress. Because the character will tear into pieces if he falls from too high a distance, the player must often spin the world such that the character can safely surmount or descend from large obstacles. Other hazards such as wild beasts, fire and boulders, or falling into the black void that borders the playing field will tear the character. However, the player has unlimited lives and will reappear at the last checkpoint he passed prior to being torn.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider is {{presented}} in third-person perspective. Players {{take control of the}} series lead character Lara Croft. The game uses an interconnected hub-and-spoke model that combines action-adventure, exploration, and survival mechanics. Players can traverse between the camps and across the island using footpaths, improvised or already-available ziplines and climbable tracks. Many of the players <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> carried over from the previous games created by Crystal Dynamics, with some tweaks added, such as incorporating elements of stealth gameplay. Quick Time Events are scattered at regular intervals throughout the game, often appearing at crucial or fast-moving points in the game's plot, such as extracting a shard of metal, and escaping a collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then {{figure out a way to}} help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E
50|$|To use premove, {{a player}} makes a {{move in the}} same way they would <b>move</b> if it <b>was</b> their turn. After their {{opponent}} moves, the original player's <b>move</b> <b>is</b> immediately made, assuming that the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> still legal. Premove is not available in over-the-board chess.|$|R
5000|$|If that <b>move</b> <b>is</b> the disk's [...] "natural" [...] move, {{then the}} disk has not <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> {{since the last}} disk 0 move, and that <b>move</b> should <b>be</b> taken.|$|R
30|$|This paper uses a λ-interchange {{mechanism}} to move trains between routes to generate neighborhood {{solution for the}} problem (for more details see[Ghoseiri and Ghannadpour (2010])). In one version of the algorithm called global best, the whole neighborhood is explored, and the best <b>move</b> <b>is</b> selected. In the other version, first best, the first admissible improving <b>move</b> <b>is</b> selected if one exists; otherwise, the best admissible <b>move</b> <b>is</b> implemented.|$|R
5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. <b>Moves</b> <b>are</b> classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 {{version of}} Flow {{features}} enhanced visuals and three additional playable organisms: {{one that can}} move with a short burst of speed, one that can paralyze other creatures, and one that lunges toward its prey's weak point. The worm creature from the original game was given {{the ability to move}} faster, while the jellyfish may now create a vortex to attract small creatures. These special <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> activated by hitting any button on the controller. When the player reaches the bottom plane with each creature, the next creature type is unlocked and becomes selectable {{at the beginning of the}} game. The PlayStation 3 version features a multiplayer mode for up to four players; a game in progress can be joined at any time, players may play different creatures if they desire so. The PlayStation Portable version contains all of the features introduced by PlayStation 3 version, but reduces the size of each plane. On November 20, 2007, the PlayStation 3 version received an add-on pack that allows players joining a multiplayer game to select their creatures. The pack also includes new enemies, food types, and a playable creature with a shield ability.|$|E
5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition {{there is the possibility}} of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as having few weaknesses. In Gold and Silver, new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects of strategy.|$|E
5000|$|On July 17 {{parliament}} {{approved a}} major cabinet reshuffle. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> to [...] "optimize the government's work" [...] according to foreign minister Solomon Passy. The <b>move</b> <b>was</b> announced {{against the backdrop}} of sliding approval ratings.|$|R
2500|$|Such a <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{also called}} an intermezzo , {{intermediate}} move , or in-between move [...] When the intermediate <b>move</b> <b>is</b> a check, {{it is sometimes}} called an [...] "in-between check" [...] , [...] "zwischenschach" [...] , or [...] "zwischen-check" [...]|$|R
50|$|Alice Chess rules, {{except that}} a <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{permitted}} {{even though the}} square normally transferred to on the opposite board is occupied. (In that case, the transfer portion of the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> omitted.) By Michael O'Donohue (2003).|$|R
5|$|The {{player can}} use {{his or her}} Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player {{encounters}} a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a maneuver {{for his or her}} Pokémon to fight using one of four moves, use an item, switch his or her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive a certain number of experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon will level up. A Pokémon's level controls its physical properties, such as the battle statistics acquired, and the moves it has learned. At certain levels, the Pokémon may also evolve. These evolutions affect the statistics and the levels at which new <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> learned (higher levels of evolution gain more statistics per level, although they may not learn new moves as early, if at all, compared with the lower levels of evolution).|$|E
25|$|<b>Moves</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} numbered as in chess.|$|E
25|$|With {{the side}} with the queen to move, checkmate can be forced in at most ten moves from any {{starting}} position, with optimal play by both sides, but usually fewer <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> required. In positions in which a pawn has just promoted to a queen, at most nine <b>moves</b> <b>are</b> required.|$|E
5000|$|Such a <b>move</b> <b>is</b> {{also called}} an intermezzo , {{intermediate}} move , or in-between move [...] When the intermediate <b>move</b> <b>is</b> a check, {{it is sometimes}} called an [...] "in-between check" [...] , [...] "zwischenschach" [...] , or [...] "zwischen-check" [...]|$|R
50|$|A {{player that}} makes an illegal move suffers self-inflicted damage, the <b>move</b> <b>is</b> ignored, and the player must choose a {{different}} move. Should no legal <b>move</b> <b>be</b> possible, {{the board is}} reset/cleared, and both players lose all accumulated mana.|$|R
