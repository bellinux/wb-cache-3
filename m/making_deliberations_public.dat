5000|$|Nacirema is {{the name}} of a fictional country in Ronald M. Green's {{role-playing}} game aimed at explaining to undergraduate students the fundamentals of John Rawls's theory of justice as fairness. In [...] "The Rawls Game" [...] (1986), Green asks the students to take on the role of Nacireman citizens. Acting from unrestrained self-interest, the citizens vote on a series of public issues and attempt to find solutions that do not require anyone to be forced to act against their own will. The goal of the game is to show {{that the only way to}} obtain social fairness is to ignore one's own individual circumstances (race, sex, religion, income, etc.) when <b>making</b> <b>deliberations</b> that affect <b>public</b> life.|$|R

40|$|A {{contemporary}} {{vision for}} a democracy {{is that it}} involves {{those who wish to}} be involved; the highest expression of human rationality becomes reality when ordinary people speak and reason together on issues of common concern. <b>Public</b> <b>deliberation</b> is a structured dialogue around a challenging public problem. It is a means through which citizens can make tough choices about the basic purpose and direction of their communities and their country. Oklahoma State University and the Oklahoma Partnership for <b>Public</b> <b>Deliberation,</b> along with the University of Missouri, incorporated <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> into their <b>public</b> policy and community development work. To implement <b>public</b> <b>deliberation,</b> they conducted institutes and academies to prepare extension professionals and community leaders to use this practice in their public lives.

40|$|This study reinvestigates the {{argument}} that <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> promotes political efficacy. We analyse the distribution of changes in level of political efficacy, among participants in a <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> project {{on the issue of}} European social and economic policy, The European Citizens Consultations (ECC). ECC was a pan-European project involving over 1600 citizens from all EU-member states that participated in 28 deliberative conferences. The analysis shows that while most participants remain more or less unaffected by participating in <b>public</b> <b>deliberation,</b> these processes have both winners and losers. Some participants come strengthened out of participating while others lessen their beliefs in their capacity for political engagement. Our explanatory analysis indicates that prior political efficacy is the strongest determinant of strengthening one’s level of political efficacy in relation to <b>deliberation.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>deliberation</b> does seem to equalize political efficacy among participants, as those participants who had low levels of political efficacy were uninterested and not knowledgeable about politics at the outset, were strengthened by the process to a greater degree. Within this broader pattern we also find that a positive perception of one’s own performance in the deliberation is increasing the positive change...|$|R

Depending on their emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness, they produce four basic approaches to public sector general management: the directive approach, the reactive approach, the generative approach, and the adaptive approach. This paper explores the generative approach, in particular its use of <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> as an alternative way to establish public policy and set bureau direction. Two case studies help distill {{the basic elements of}} <b>public</b> <b>deliberation.</b> The first case documents the use of <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> in significantly reducing a school district budget.

On December 8, 2009 the MAPS3 proposal passed by a 54-46 margin, the same margin as the original MAPS election.|$|R
40|$|Power in {{communication}} takes two main forms. As ‘external’ power, it consists {{in the ability}} to acknowledge or disregard a speaker or a discourse. As ‘internal’ power, it is the ability of an argument to eliminate other arguments by demonstrating its superiority. A positive or negative value may be ascribed to these forms of power. Four ideal-typical positions are discussed – strategy, technocracy, constructionism, and <b>deliberation.</b> <b>Public</b> <b>deliberation</b> has three virtues – civic virtue, governance virtue and cognitive virtue. Deliberation lowers the propensity to, and the benefit of, strategic behaviour. It also increases knowledge, enhancing the quality of decisions. For Habermas, the unity of reason is expressed in the possibility of agreement on the most convincing argument. However, sometimes conflicts are deep-lying, principles and factual descriptions are profoundly different, and uncertainty is radical. The best argument cannot be found. There is no universal reason. The question is whether non-strategic agreement may spring from the incommensurability of languages. In search of an answer, Rawls’s concept of overlapping consensus, the feminist theory of the public sphere, and the idea of deliberation as co-operation are discussed. The argument developed is that the approach to deliberative democracy may be renewed by rethinking its motivational and cognitive elements. <b>Public</b> <b>deliberation</b> is grounded on a pre-political level of co-operation. Intractable controversies may be faced at the level of practices, looking for local, contextual answers...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores two {{different}} strategies {{that may be}} useful to give substance to Deweyan democracy’s claim that in order for democratic associations to develop into communities, citizens {{need to learn how to}} conduct inquiry in a social setting. The two strategies reflect a principal division among views of <b>public</b> <b>deliberation.</b> The first strategy, the separation strategy, closely resembles Rawls’ political liberalism by advocating the development of a separate sphere of <b>public</b> <b>deliberation,</b> guided by factual and normative assumptions that we need not accept anywhere outside that sphere. Comprehensive doctrines are to be held outside of <b>public</b> <b>deliberation,</b> a move which makes possible a rather straightforward application of Dewey’s theory of inquiry. The second strategy, the embeddedness strategy, stresses the fact that <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> is inevitably embedded in broader spheres of social life, and that the development towards community must be piecemeal, and go hand in hand with developments in social life as a whole. I argue that there are weighty reasons for doubting the feasibility of the separation strategy, and I also argue that these reasons are relevant for our evaluation of all versions of the separation strategy, including political liberalism. I conclude that one of Deweyan democracy’s most important assets, which deserves further examination, is its insight that reflection on <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> needs to take its embedded character into account...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I make some {{considerations}} {{about the nature}} of cognitive processes underlying the <b>public</b> <b>deliberation.</b> By <b>making</b> use of philosophical and psychological research in the field of cognitive science, I discuss the specific role of emotional processes. The topic of the <b>public</b> <b>deliberations</b> may be investigated in connection with a more general problem, that is, the relationship between emotions and rationality. In § 1 I shortly discuss the rationalist models and I explain why these models assign a negative role to emotions towards human deliberation. In § 2 I examine Marcus' theory of affective intelligence in order to acknowledge to the emotions a positive role in rationality. I conclude by arguing that such positive role can safeguard more areas of <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> in human society...|$|R

50|$|Participatory {{politics}} (or parpolity) is {{a long-range}} political theory that also incorporates {{many of the}} above and strives to create a political system that will allow people to participate in politics, {{as much as possible}} in a face-to-face manner. Pateman characterizes the participatory model as one where maximum input (participation) is required, and where output includes not only policies but also the development of the social and political capacities of each individual. The literature generally emphasizes this combination of influence on policy <b>making,</b> quality of <b>deliberation,</b> and citizen engagement based on what has been argued that a successful institution of citizen participation is one that (i) provides a channel of influence in policy making, (ii) engages citizens in a process of <b>deliberation</b> and <b>public</b> communication, which in return provides legitimacy to the institution, and (iii) is able to attract a constant or increasing number of participants.|$|R

50|$|Dryzek {{has also}} been {{influential}} in the related fields of international relations and international political theory. He was an early proponent of global democracy, helping to develop the concept and illustrating why the exercise of power beyond the nation-state requires democratization. Drawing on his work in deliberative (or discursive) democracy, Dryzek has depicted how contending discourses operate in world politics and the space this opens for reflexivity and democratization. Also in line with previous work, Dryzek has highlighted how highly complex issue areas - notably climate governance - can be democratized through <b>deliberation</b> and <b>public</b> reason. Drawing from his work on <b>deliberation</b> and <b>public</b> reason, Dryzek has argued that many critiques of deliberative democracy can be addressed through greater discursive representation. More generally, Dryzek has undertaken discipline-leading work on global civil society, non-state actors, and representation in world politics.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in various branches {{of political science}} underscore the importance of empirical investigation of impartial views. This paper proposes and tests an empirical model of impartiality, inspired by Adam Smith (1759), {{that is based on}} the moral judgments of informed third parties (or spectators). The model predicts that spectatorship produces properties widely considered desirable in both normative and descriptive political science research, namely, unbiasedness and consensus. This informs a vignette experiment that elicits moral judgments about real world political economy issues while varying the information conditions and roles of respondents (spectator and stakeholder) across treatments. The results indicate that spectator views are unbiased, and that relevant information reduces stakeholder bias to insignificance, whereas irrelevant information reduces bias but does not eliminate it. Relevant information also promotes a kind of consensus. I argue that this model can complement empirical and theoretical work on <b>deliberation,</b> <b>public</b> opinion and political behavior...|$|R

40|$|How do economists defme democracy? Such is the {{question}} this paper tries to deal with. We contrast two economists' views on democracy. First, we show how, {{within the framework of}} public choice theory, the use of the tools and methodology of mainstream economic analysis, the focus put upon rational choices impose a purely positivist and technical view on democracy. No room can be made to discussion and <b>deliberation.</b> <b>Public</b> choice theory evacuates deliberation from democracy. However, this should not lead to the conclusion that economists are not able to develop a consistent and useful approach of democratic institutions. It is possible to envisage an alternative economic approach to democracy based on the theory of human nature proposed by the founders of political economy, Hume and Smith. From their perspective, the limited rationality of human beings and their benevolence, the role of sympathy makes room for a theory of democracy different, richer and more subtle than that envisaged by the public choice theory. ...|$|R

The identification of a series of boundary objects in the consensus conferences led me to conclude that, on the one hand, the consensus conference is a boundary infrastructure that fosters the establishment of a community of participation and thereby facilitates diverse parties’ deliberation on sensitive issues. On the other hand, whereas a newly formed collective identity is emerging in <b>public</b> <b>deliberation,</b> boundary tensions and the differences between diverse social actors are managed and halted temporarily instead of eliminated permanently by boundary objects. That is, collaboration in <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> is always an achievement “in the making ” by all parties...|$|R

30|$|Scholars in Responsible Innovation {{have tried}} to {{overcome}} this problem of limited predictability {{of the consequences of}} innovations by turning to methods of <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> and <b>public</b> participatory decision making. The basic idea is that by involving the <b>public</b> in the <b>deliberation</b> and decision-making about an innovation project from the earliest stages on, and being “responsive” to their “concerns”, we can compensate for our limited predictive capabilities (Stilgoe et al. 2013). This way it would also be possible to evade David Collingridge’s well-known control dilemma, which holds that early on a new technology is not amenable to social control because at that stage the consequences are still unclear, while later on, when the consequences become manifest, the technology is so much entrenched that it can no longer be steered in a desirable direction (Collingridge 1980).|$|R

The second is that <b>public</b> <b>deliberation</b> - around the key questions of our times and our location in South Africa - is inhibited by the limited and biased archive available to us to pursue our deliberations. The third proposition is that every engagement with the archive is always inflected with power. In every society, including our own, there are strong motivations and indeed efforts to exert control over archive, to read it in singular ways, and to exclude alternative and multiple readings. Identity politics of all kinds typically play out their contests in relation to archive.
