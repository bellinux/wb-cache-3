50|$|QoS {{requirements}} can {{be based}} on either a delay or a delay and bandwidth requirement, or a packet loss requirement.

50|$|The {{administrative}} distance (AD) value is {{assigned by the}} router on a per-protocol basis. Routers, by design, should not install multiple routes into the routing table as this {{has the potential to}} cause routing loops. While a router may run <b>multiple</b> <b>routing</b> protocols on the same device, it is necessary for the router to implement a process to ensure that multiple routes, pointing to the same destination do not simultaneously exist in the routing table. Each process running on a router advertises its {{administrative distance}} value to the local router. The router uses this value to determine which route should be used. Once a route has been selected, the routing information database is updated. If two routes have the same administrative distance, the router uses its vendor-specific algorithm to determine which route should be installed. Cisco routers simply ignore the values and fall back to the default values, which are never the same.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} HTDM routing {{scheme is}} a kind of real <b>multiple</b> <b>routing</b> scheme; <b>multiple</b> <b>routing</b> paths are created among actors, which make up the difference of communication capacity between actors and sensor nodes. It can be seen from Figs.  16 and 17 that the throughput in the HTDM routing scheme is almost proportional to the number of creating routing paths. Therefore, the number of created routing paths can be identified according to the practical demand, which can offset the difference of communication ability between actors and sensor nodes. From experimental results, the throughput of multi-path routing scheme is smaller than that of HTDM scheme which creates two routing paths, and it is much smaller than that of HTDM scheme which creates three routing paths. Those results show HTDM scheme has a better throughput.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, two {{topology}} oriented multicast routing algorithms, MXYZ and AL+XYZ, {{are proposed}} to support multicasting in 3 D Networks on Chips (NoCs). In specific, MXYZ is a dimension order multicast routing algorithm that targets 3 D NoC systems built upon regular topologies, while AL+XYZ is applicable to NoCs with irregular topologies. If the output channel found by MXYZ {{is not available}} (i. e. in the same region), an alternative output channel is used to forward/replicate the packets in AL+XYZ. MXYZ is evaluated against a path based regular topology oriented multicast routing and AL+XYZ against an irregular region oriented <b>multiple</b> unicast <b>routing</b> algorithm. Our experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed MXYZ and AL+XYZ schemes have lower latency and energy consumption than the conventional path based multicast <b>routing</b> and the <b>multiple</b> unicast <b>routing</b> algorithms, meriting {{them to be more}} suitable for supporting multicasting in 3 D NoC systems...|$|R

In {{this paper}} we present an {{intelligent}} multi-topology IGP (MT-IGP) based intra-domain traffic engineering (TE) scheme that {{is able to}} handle unexpected traffic fluctuations with near-optimal network performance.
