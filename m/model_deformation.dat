With Time-series InSAR (TInSAR) methodology, the ground deformation time series {{can be derived}} from InSAR observations. One of the important ways to analyze the InSAR deformation time series is to parameterize the InSAR deformation time series with <b>deformation</b> <b>models.</b> The previous ways of <b>modelling</b> InSAR <b>deformation</b> time series are usually point-wise, i. e. they focus on the <b>deformation</b> <b>models</b> of single InSAR measurement points. The <b>deformation</b> <b>model</b> of each point is either assumed to be a linear function of time, or is selected from the predefined alternative models. The point-wise modeling methodologies can well interpret the deformation behavior of each point, but is limited on <b>modeling</b> the spatial <b>deformation</b> patterns. In this study, we design and implement methodologies to <b>model</b> the spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> patterns, based on given spatial smoothness information of the deformation. We introduce a work flow to digest the spatial smoothness information from external sources, and use the information to improve the functional and stochastic model. We also propose a model selection methodology based on hypothesis testing to select the the most probable spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> <b>model</b> from given potential <b>models.</b> The spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> <b>modeling</b> methodology is applied to the simulated data, as well as the real InSAR measurements. We apply the spatio-temporal deformation methodology to study the deformation in a hydrocarbon production field in California, and successfully detect the instantaneous uplifting and subsiding events. Based on the simulation and real case study, we conclude that given proper contextual information, spatio-temporal <b>deformation</b> <b>modeling</b> is able to derive the <b>deformation</b> <b>model</b> in both temporal and spatial domain, and has a good performance on parameterizing the non-linear deformation behavior in the temporal domain...|$|R
