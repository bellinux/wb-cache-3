5000|$|With {{precision}} ground surfaces, any oil film {{applied to the}} surface will lack the means {{to adhere to the}} surface, especially between two mating parts of exceptional finish. [...] The oil film will be swept away leaving nothing but bare metal and the risk of seizure. Carefully scraping the surface will leave the original high quality surface intact, but provide many shallow depressions where the oil film can maintain its depth and surface tension. When scraping is used for this purpose it is more accurately called [...] "frosting", [...] "spotting" [...] or [...] "flaking" [...] as opposed to fully scraping an accurate surface. Typically a scraped surface is scraped to highly accurate flatness and then [...] "frosting" [...] is applied over it for oil retention.

40|$|Abstract — A brake is {{a device}} {{by means of}} which {{artificial}} frictional resistance is applied to moving <b>machine</b> <b>member,</b> {{in order to stop}} the motion of a machine. Braking is a process which converts the kinetic energy of the vehicle into mechanical energy which must be dissipated in the form of heat. Here, the 3 D model of aircraft disc brake rotor was created by using CATIAV 5 R 20 with particular dimensions. The structural and thermal analysis of aircraft disc rotor was done in ANSYS 14. 5. The materials used for aircraft disc rotor are aluminium metal matrix and ceramic coating. The main aim of this project is validate the mathematical result with ansys results. The maximum stress developed is 26. 87 MPa for aluminium metal matrix composite (AMMC) and 21. 47 MPa for ceramic coated aircraft disc brake rotor. Finally, the analysis suggests that Mechanical and thermal properties of aluminium alloy may be improved through the addition of ceramic coatings on the surface which in contact with the brake pad...|$|E
