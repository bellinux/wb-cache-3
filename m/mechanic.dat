5|$|In 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood cinematographer who {{had been}} an auto <b>mechanic</b> and early aviator. Fleming had become {{involved}} in the film industry when a friend, Marshall Neilan, recommended Fleming to film director Allan Dwan as a good <b>mechanic.</b> (Fleming impressed Dwan by quickly fixing both his car and a faulty film camera.) By 1916, Fleming had become a cinematographer.|$|E
5|$|Josephine Ledesma, from Austin, Texas, was 24 {{when the}} war broke out and worked as an {{airplane}} <b>mechanic</b> from 1942 to 1944. When her husband, Alfred, was drafted she decided to volunteer to work as an airplane <b>mechanic.</b> Even though the army waived her husband's duty, she was sent to train at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, where {{she was the only}} Mexican-American woman on the base. After her training, she was sent to Bergstrom Air Field. There were two other women, both non-Hispanic, at Bergstrom Air Field, and several more in Big Spring, all working in the sheet metal department. At Big Spring, she was the only woman working in the hangar. She worked as a <b>mechanic</b> between from 1942 to 1944.|$|E

On 1 April 1914 he was promoted to Air <b>Mechanic</b> First Class.|$|E

25|$|In physics, {{classical}} <b>mechanics</b> (also {{known as}} Newtonian <b>mechanics)</b> {{is one of}} two major sub-fields of <b>mechanics.</b> The other sub-field is quantum <b>mechanics.</b> Classical <b>mechanics</b> is concerned with the set of physical laws describing the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces. The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical <b>mechanics</b> {{one of the oldest and}} largest subjects in science, engineering and technology. though textbook authors often consider Newtonian <b>mechanics,</b> along with Lagrangian <b>mechanics</b> and Hamiltonian <b>mechanics,</b> as the three main formalisms of classical <b>mechanics.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 16 June 1944, while 8./JG 1 {{was moving}} from Le Mans to Essay, France {{came under attack}} by the P-51s of 354th Fighter Wing, near Alençon.

The <b>mechanic</b> was Uffz. Herbert Redlich. Also lost were two other {{aircraft}} without loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 2014, the {{phenomenon}} of indie games produced several variations of the genre. The game Jungle Rumble uses a <b>mechanic</b> where players drum on a touch screen to control the game.

50|$|Hamiltonian <b>mechanics</b> is {{a theory}} {{developed}} as a reformulation of classical <b>mechanics</b> and predicts the same outcomes as non-Hamiltonian classical <b>mechanics.</b> It uses a different mathematical formalism, providing a more abstract understanding of the theory. Historically, {{it was an important}} reformulation of classical <b>mechanics,</b> which later contributed to the formulation of statistical <b>mechanics</b> and quantum <b>mechanics.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{theoretical}} physics and mathematical physics, analytical <b>mechanics,</b> or theoretical <b>mechanics</b> {{is a collection}} of closely related alternative formulations of classical <b>mechanics.</b> It was developed by many scientists and mathematicians during the 18th century and onward, after Newtonian <b>mechanics.</b> Since Newtonian <b>mechanics</b> considers vector quantities of motion, particularly accelerations, momenta, forces, of the constituents of the system, an alternative name for the <b>mechanics</b> governed by Newton's laws and Euler's laws is vectorial <b>mechanics.</b>|$|R
5|$|Studio {{executives}} <b>Mechanic</b> and Ziskin planned {{an initial}} budget of US$23million {{to finance the}} film, but {{by the start of}} production, the budget was increased to $50million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to US$67million. New Regency's head and Fight Club executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least US$5million. The director refused, so Milchan threatened <b>Mechanic</b> that New Regency would withdraw financing. <b>Mechanic</b> sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of dailies from Fight Club. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing. The final production budget was $63million.|$|E
5|$|The {{high school}} was the first new high school {{to be built in}} Saint Paul or Minneapolis since the 1970s. The school {{district}} was also not expecting to build another high school for 40 years after. As a result, the competition to name the school was fierce. The name Arlington High School was eventually chosen from a list of 85 suggestions. Two names, Arlington and <b>Mechanic</b> Arts, were quickly favored. <b>Mechanic</b> Arts was the initial favorite after alumni of the former school campaigned for the name to be reused after the first <b>Mechanic</b> Arts High School was closed down in 1976 after operating for 86 years. The alumni created a lobbying group and even enlisted the help of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a 1925 graduate of <b>Mechanic</b> Arts. However, the school board's policy of naming schools after local neighborhoods and street names eventually won out with the name Arlington being chosen in a 5-2 vote. The chosen school colors, blue and white, were the colors of <b>Mechanic</b> Arts.|$|E

50|$|Quantum <b>mechanics</b> and {{classical}} <b>mechanics</b> are usually treated with entirely different formalisms: quantum theory using Hilbert space, {{and classical}} <b>mechanics</b> using a representation in phase space.

5|$|The game {{does not}} have a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, but it has a cooperative multiplayer mode that pits four players together to complete a nine-mission campaign based on the campaign of the original Syndicate games. Players face enemies that become increasingly difficult to deal with as the game progresses. They can choose from four character classes: Medic, Spec Ops, Assault and Generic, each with different abilities. The breaching <b>mechanic</b> is also present in the mode for defensive and offensive purposes. For instance, they can hack into a turret to disable its armor or heal team-mates using this <b>mechanic.</b> Players receive points as they progress through the game's levels; these points can be used to research new weapons.|$|E
