5|$|The UCLA Bruins {{became an}} Oregon rival {{in track and}} field as the two {{powerhouse}} programs battled each other in a series of dual meets. Oregon's program was ranked in the top 3 nationally in dual meets by Track & Field News thirteen times between 1970 and 1996 and was ranked No. 1 three times. The UCLA squad achieved a No. 1 ranking from the same publication eleven times within the same time frame. In 1966, the two programs met head to head for the first time. The Bruins displayed their dominance at the dual <b>meet</b> and won nine straight against the Ducks. Oregon head coach Bill Bowerman in 1971 called the Bruins team the best dual <b>meet</b> team in the country. It wasn't until 1978 that Oregon earned its first victory in the series, which ended UCLA's 34 dual <b>meet</b> winning streak. Oregon won the next three meets and the series ended in 1985 with a UCLA win. The dual <b>meet</b> event was fading out of favor in collegiate track and field and the Oregon-UCLA dual <b>meet</b> was discontinued with UCLA holding the advantage over the Ducks 10â€“4. In 1994, the Pepsi Team Invitational which included Oregon, UCLA and Washington was scored as a dual <b>meet,</b> which UCLA won. In 2008, the dual <b>meet</b> series between the two schools restarted and Oregon won the first three meets. Although the location of the <b>meet</b> had alternated between Eugene and Los Angeles between 1966 and 1976, subsequent meets have been held at Hayward Field in Oregon until 2011 where the two teams battled to a tie at UCLA. The dual <b>meet</b> was discontinued in 2012 due to scheduling difficulties in an Olympic year.|$|E
