5000|$|The {{simplest}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>correction</b> is to {{only use}} the non-biased {{portions of the}} data set, if any, and throw away {{the rest of the}} data. [...] Depending on the limiting magnitude selected, there may be a range of distances in the data set over which all objects of any possible absolute magnitude could be seen. As such, this small subset of data should be free of the Malmquist bias. This is easily accomplished by cutting off the data at the edge of where the lowest absolute magnitude objects would be hitting the limiting magnitude. Unfortunately, this method would waste a great deal of good data, and would limit the analysis to nearby objects only, making it less than desirable. (Looking at the figure to the right, only the first fifth of the data in distance could be kept before a data point is lost to the bias.) Of course, this method assumes that distances are known with relatively good accuracy, which as mentioned before, is a difficult process in astronomy.|$|E
50|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is an {{imaging modality}} {{that produces a}} 3-dimensional radiograph. A series of plain radiographs are taken in a spiral around the site of interest, and the individual 2-D radiographs are converted into a 3-D image by a computer. The image may be manipulated to view in different planes, such as cross-section, {{making it possible to}} see an injury from multiple perspectives and improving diagnostic capabilities when compared to plain radiographs. Like plain radiographs, CT is not as useful for soft tissue lesions when compared to boney lesions. However, CT requires general anesthesia, and is more costly and less available than plain radiographs, limiting its use in general practice. CT provides a large amount of data with exceptional speed, taking only seconds to minutes to complete. When compared to MRI, it is not only significantly faster (MRI takes 1-2 hours to produce an image), but also less expensive. Its combination of speed and imaging capabilities makes it beneficial for use prior to orthopedic surgery, {{especially in the case of}} complicated fractures, as it allows for visualization from all sides so that the surgeon may determine the best approach and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>correction</b> prior to cutting. Upon completion of the CT, the horse may be rolled straight into the surgery suite for immediate surgical treatment.|$|E
