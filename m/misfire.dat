5|$|The evening draw also {{consisted}} of skins play. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott {{played in the}} women's skins game, in which Jones dominated, scoring four skins and winning four points for Team North America. Glenn Howard and Thomas Ulsrud played in the men's skins game. Ulsrud played a fairly open game, forcing carryovers for five ends until a <b>misfire</b> from Ulsrud led to Howard making the cup-winning shot, scoring three points with a tap for two points. Ulsrud won the remaining points in the game on a draw to the button. A mixed team of Kevin Martin, Heather Nedohin, Marc Kennedy, and Laine Peters played Eve Muirhead, Greg Drummond, Vicki Adams, and Michael Goodfellow in the mixed skins game. Martin skipped against Muirhead and controlled most of the game, securing four points on four skins before Muirhead took the last skin. Team North America took a 10½–4½ point edge {{in the second round}} of skins play, giving them a CAD$13,000 bonus for winning the skins rounds.|$|E

This paper presents an algorithm based improved neural network which is used for <b>misfiring</b> fault. It calculates the memberships of inputs and initializes the weights and thresholds of the neural network by {{genetic algorithm}} firstly, and then trains the improved neural network and uses it for diagnosis. By applying GUI function of MATLAB, a new man-machine interaction interface was designed. The results of experiment indicate that this algorithm can effectively carry out <b>misfiring</b> fault diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} detect and localize intermittent <b>misfiring</b> default on a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) inverter supplying a squirrel cage induction machine. The proposed method {{is based on the}} Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique to analyse stator current signals. The intermittent <b>misfiring</b> detection is performed thanks to the Daubechies wavelet mother in high frequency bands of the stator current signal. The localisation of the phase where the intermittent <b>misfiring</b> occurs is determined by a statistic approach. This approach is based on the computing of mean power characteristics of the detail signals which are obtained from the stator current wavelet decomposition...|$|R

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{conducted}} research {{to determine whether}} the total elapsed delay time for blasting bituminous coal in underground mines could be safely expanded beyond the present 500 -ms limitation without igniting a methane or methane-coal dust atmosphere. The results indicated that the increase of total delay from 500 to 1, 000 ms had no detectable effect on safety relative to incendivity as long as permissible practices were observed in all other aspects. Research was also conducted to evaluate the safety of 18 -in hole spacing for delay blasting in coal relative to <b>misfires.</b> For a variety of permissible explosives, <b>misfires</b> were observed for about 50 pct of the holes at 18 -in spacing. Based on this observation, the Bureau has recommended that the new regulations prohibit hole spacings of less than 24 inches in underground coal mines. <b>Misfires</b> were also observed for 24 -in spacing, but the number of <b>misfires</b> and test shots was too small to sup- port any firm conclusions...|$|R

25|$|The wheellock took {{around a}} minute to load, prepare and fire. Many {{contemporary}} illustrations of a wheellock pistol in action show the gun held slightly rotated (about 45 degree angle from the horizontal) rather than vertically as with a hand cannon, {{to ensure that the}} priming powder in the pan lay against the vent in the barrel, and avoid a 'flash in the pan' or <b>misfire.</b> This was not the case for the flintlock, where the sparks had to fall vertically a certain distance on to the pan.|$|E

25|$|Four-stroke {{reciprocating}} {{engines are}} not very suitable for use with hydrogen fuel. The hydrogen can <b>misfire</b> on hot parts like the exhaust valve and spark plugs. Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines. In a Wankel engine, this problem is circumvented by using a ceramic apex seal against a ceramic surface, {{so that there is}} no oil film to suffer hydrogenate attack. The piston shell must be lubricated and cooled with oil. This substantially increases the lubricating oil consumption in a four-stroke hydrogen engine.|$|E
25|$|Despite that {{legislative}} <b>misfire,</b> in {{the summer}} of 2001 the city of Minneapolis became quite serious about the warehouse district site for a ballpark, after selecting the Twins' preferred riverfront site to house the new Guthrie Theater. Though no deal was struck to purchase the Rapid Park land at that time, an initial valuation of $10 million was assumed by the city for a roughly 10 acre parcel. Though not a realistic amount, it did fall conveniently within the restrictions of the 1997 referendum. The Twins were not involved in these discussions, and still exhibited no public interest whatsoever in the warehouse district location.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} the {{conversion}} was completed, BAVG-1 was transferred to and commissioned in the Royal Navy {{as part of the}} Lend-Lease program. On 23 December 1941, three US Navy Grumman F4F Wildcats landed on Archer for trials to the launch accelerator. The accelerator misfired, causing the first aircraft to dive into the sea as sufficient airspeed had not been gained. The remaining two aircraft were successfully flown off. Archer put into the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 24 December 1941 for repairs to the accelerator, which had been damaged in the <b>misfire.</b> On 2 January 1942, Archer successfully completed her sea trials. On 9 January, she sailed down the Delaware River bound for Norfolk, Virginia where she was to load aircraft for ferrying to the United Kingdom. Her gyro compass failed near Goose Island and then her engines developed problems. After repairs were effected she arrived at Norfolk and on 12 January she embarked eleven Grumman Martlets.|$|E
25|$|Toyota F1 {{made their}} Formula One debut in 2002, with McNish and Salo driving the Toyota TF102, {{designed}} by Gustav Brunner. Despite reportedly {{having one of}} the biggest budgets in Formula One, Toyota scored only two points all year. Their first point was scored in their first race, the Australian Grand Prix, when half the field was eliminated by a first corner accident caused by Ralf Schumacher colliding with Rubens Barrichello. The team could have scored another point in the next race at the Malaysian Grand Prix, but Salo suffered an electrical <b>misfire</b> and the team fumbled McNish's pit stop. The Scot thus lost ground, and finished seventh, just out of the points, behind Sauber's Felipe Massa. The Brazilian Grand Prix, third race of the season, yielded Toyota's second and final point, once again scored by Salo. McNish endured a huge crash during practice for the end-of-season Japanese Grand Prix and missed the race on medical advice. Neither McNish nor Salo were offered a race seat for 2003.|$|E
25|$|Pre-set hybrid {{triggers}} {{are similar}} to a DA/SA trigger in reverse. The first pull of the trigger is pre-set. If the striker or hammer fail to discharge the cartridge, the trigger may be pulled again and will operate as a double-action only (DAO) until the cartridge discharges or the malfunction is cleared. This allows the operator to attempt a second time to fire a cartridge after a <b>misfire</b> malfunction, {{as opposed to a}} single-action, in which the only thing to do if a round fails to fire is to rack the slide, clearing the round and recocking the hammer. While this can be advantageous in that many rounds will fire on being struck a second time, and it is faster to pull the trigger a second time than to cycle the action, if the round fails to fire on the second strike, the user will be forced to clear the round anyway, thus using up even more time than if they had simply done so in the first place. The Taurus PT 24/7 Pro pistol (not {{to be confused with the}} first-generation 24/7 which was a traditional pre-set) offered this feature starting in 2006. The Walther P99 Anti-Stress is another example.|$|E
50|$|Current {{medical science}} doesn't {{precisely}} understand {{the cause of}} dystonia. <b>Misfiring</b> of neurons in the sensorimotor cortex, {{a thin layer of}} neural tissue that covers the brain, is thought to cause contractions. This <b>misfiring</b> may result from impaired inhibitory mechanisms during muscle contraction. When the brain tells a given muscle to contract, it simultaneously silences muscles that would oppose the intended movement. It appears that dystonia interferes with the brain's ability to inhibit those surrounding muscles, leading to loss of selectivity.|$|R
