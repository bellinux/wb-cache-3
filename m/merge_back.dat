5|$|In Lansing, {{the highway}} travels splits {{to follow the}} one-way streets of Saginaw (eastbound) and Oakland (westbound) near the Sparrow Specialty Hospital. BL I-69/M-43 then crosses the Grand River and passes Marshall Park. The {{trunkline}} then passes over US127 just before the paired one-way streets <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> together on Grand River Avenue. After the merge, M-43 heads southeast through East Lansing, passing the main campus of Michigan State University and Spartan Stadium. The road continues on its southeast path, traveling by the Meridian Mall as it enters Meridian Township. From here the road travels through Williamston before terminating at an interchange with I-96 just south of Webberville at exit122.|$|E
5|$|Continuing east, M-102 intersects M-39 (Southfield Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) {{south of}} the Southfield campus of Oakland Community College and the Northland Center Mall. As the highway {{approaches}} M-1 (Woodward Avenue), there are a pair of service drives that split from the main roadway in each direction to provide access through the interchange with M-1. The main lanes of M-102 pass under M-1 and its ramp connections before the service drives <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> in on the other side. This interchange is located adjacent to the Michigan State Fairgrounds, former site of the now-defunct Michigan State Fair, and Woodlawn Cemetery. East of the fairgrounds, the highway crosses a line of the Canadian National Railway that also carries Amtrak passenger traffic; the line is south of a rail terminal in Ferndale. Further east, M-102 meets I-75 before intersecting Dequindre Road. Dequindre is the boundary between Oakland and Macomb counties.|$|E
5|$|North of the {{intersection}} with Metropolitan Parkway, Gratiot Avenue splits into a one-way pairing of Northbound and Southbound Gratiot avenues as it crosses into Mount Clemens near the Clinton River. The two separate streets are one, two, or even three blocks apart through the city's downtown area. North of the Patterson Street intersections, the two streets cross back into Clinton Township and <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> together in four-lane {{street with a}} center turn lane. North of M-59 (Hall Road). M-3 clips the southeastern corner of Macomb Township near Selfridge Air National Guard Base. The highway continues into Chesterfield Township. M-3 parts from Gratiot Avenue at {{the intersection}} with 23Mile Road, turning eastward along that roadway to an intersection with I-94. At exit243, M-3 terminates at this interchange and 23Mile Road continues easterly as M-29.|$|E
50|$|In 1295, the duchy was {{partitioned}} in Pomerania-Wolgast and Pomerania-Stettin. In 1368/72, Pomerania-Stolp {{was split}} from Pomerania-Wolgast. In 1376, Pomerania-Barth was split from truncated Pomerania-Wolgast. In 1402, Pomerania-Rügenwalde was briefly split from Pomerania-Stolp for three years.

5|$|The U.S. Route 1 {{interchange}} {{is followed}} by an intersection at Paulus Boulevard before separating into a local/express configuration and paralleling the Raritan River, passing the former New Brunswick city docks. Local exits include New Jersey Route 172 (the southern terminus of George Street), the Rutgers University boathouse and Elmer B. Boyd Park, Commercial Avenue, New Street, and New Jersey Route 27 (Albany Street), after which the express and local lanes <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> together and cross under the Raritan River Bridge carrying Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. The freeway continues with exits for George Street, Rutgers (for access to the College Avenue Campus) and Easton Avenue before exiting New Brunswick on the John A. Lynch, Sr. Memorial Bridge over the Raritan River.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just north of the border, the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> together; the fork to the west is for cars, and the fork to the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. From here to I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through the Sonoran Desert and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth stage saw {{the race}} begin {{to enter the}} smaller {{mountains}} within the Dolomites. The day's breakaway formed on the climb of San Valentino. As the riders approached the finish, Pascal Richard edged Oliverio Rincón for the stage victory. The following stage featured a summit finish to Val Senales after a twenty kilometer climb. With eight kilometers to go, Berzin, Rominger, Ugrumov, and Rincón were in the leading group together. Rincón attacked and was allowed to ride solo to victory. Ugrumov attacked shortly after and Rominger was only able to follow initially; however, Berzin was able to <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> with the two riders and the trio then rode to the finish together. Casagrande lost {{a large amount of}} time during the stage. Mariano Piccoli won the fifteenth leg after being a part of the day's breakaway that managed to survive until the finish. On the descent of the second to last climb, Berzin attacked in an attempt to join the breakaway. Berzin was caught {{before the start of the}} stage's final mountain pass. Ugrumov and Berzin repeatedly attacked Rominger on the final climb, but Rominger was able to neutralize each attack.|$|E

5|$|Business Spur Interstate 75(BS I-75) is a {{business}} spur running through Bay City following {{a section of the}} current routing of M-25 through town. Formerly a full business loop numbered Business Loop Interstate75 (BL I-75), it followed what is now M-84 back to end at I-75/US23 at exit160 south of downtown. The business route also follows streets that previously were numbered Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23). The spur starts at exit162 on I-75/US23 at the same interchange where M-25 and US10 end. BS I-75 runs concurrently along M-25, and for about the first , the spur is a four-lane freeway bounded by residential subdivisions on either side. In Bangor Township, the freeway ends and BS I-75/M-25 splits into a one-way pairing of Thomas Street (eastbound) and Jenny Street (westbound). These two three-lane streets continue along a residential area {{on the west side of}} Bay City. East of intersections with Henry Street, the opposing sides of traffic <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> together near Veterans Memorial Park to cross the Saginaw River on the four-lane Veterans Memorial Bridge. On the eastern side of the river, BS I-75/M-25 splits again into the one-way pairing of the three-lane McKinley Street (westbound) and 7th Street (eastbound). Just three blocks east of the river, BS I-75 ends at the intersections with M-84 (Washington Avenue) in downtown Bay City. On average each day in 2013, 11,678vehicles use the business loop east of the M-13 junction, and 29,391vehicles do so west of the M-84 junction, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
5|$|East of US131, M-6 crosses over Division Avenue {{and enters}} Gaines Township {{through a series}} of sound barrier walls as the freeway ramps <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> into the main lanes. This area had the highest traffic counts in 2011 at 55,236vehicles per day. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, the freeway passes through an area with retail {{businesses}} and movie theaters {{on each side of the}} interchange; to the northeast is East Kentwood High School. On the approach to the East Paris Avenue underpass, M-6 curves first to the northeast and then back to the southeast, passing near one of Steelcase's office buildings, the pyramid-shaped Corporate Development Center. The freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into Caledonia Township, with an interchange for M-37 (Broadmoor Avenue) and an overpass for 60th Street. M-6 curves around the southeast side of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Cascade Township. As the South Beltline nears I-96, it crosses 48th Street next to the Thornapple Pointe Golf Course. The carriageway splits into ramps for each direction of I-96, the ramps to eastbound I-96 crossing over the Thornapple River in the process. This interchange marks the eastern terminus of the Paul B. Henry South Beltline Freeway. The entire length of the freeway is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E

25|$|Beard and Seton did not {{get along}} with West. Seton had {{different}} goals for the program and views of how Scouting should develop. Both Seton and Beard saw West as a city lawyer and administrator. Seton often challenged West's authority, often to his own detriment. The National Executive Board did not re-elect Seton as Chief Scout in 1915, and he soon stopped publishing in Boys' Life. By early 1916, Seton was officially out of the BSA program, {{and most of his}} contributions were removed from the 1916 edition of the handbook. West also clashed with the BSA's founder, William D. Boyce, who eventually left the BSA in January 1915 to found the Lone Scouts of America (LSA). LSA initially flourished but had to <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> into the BSA in June 1924. West even had Boyce's name erased from BSA records for years. Competition from the ABS caused West to seek a federal charter for the BSA, granted on June 15, 1916.|$|E
25|$|Montrose Road was {{straightened}} out at Cabin John Creek when its {{bridge across the}} new Washington National Pike (now I-270) was built in 1956. The county highway temporarily served as US 240 between 1958 and 1960 while Washington National Pike was under construction from Montrose Road south to Rockville Pike. Montrose Road's interchange with the freeway was originally a six-ramp partial cloverleaf. Between 1988 and 1991, {{in conjunction with the}} expansion of I-270 to 12 lanes, the junction was reconstructed as a full cloverleaf interchange plus ramps with Tower Oaks Boulevard. Montrose Road was extended west from Seven Locks Road to MD 189 in 1989. Montrose Parkway was conceived as an expansion of MDSHA's plans to construct an interchange between MD 355 and Montrose Road and Randolph Road. In the original plans, which were to be implemented by MDSHA, {{the west side of the}} interchange would connect directly with Montrose Road at Hoya Street. Randolph Road would head east from the interchange, cross Nebel Street and the railroad north of Randolph Road's existing grade crossing, and <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> into Randolph Road west of Parklawn Drive.|$|E

500|$|Players can split {{their cell}} into two by {{pressing}} , {{and one of}} the two evenly divided cells will be flung {{in the direction of the}} cursor (a maximum of 16 split cells). This can be used as a ranged attack to shoot a cell in order to swallow other smaller cells, to escape an attack from another cell, or to move more quickly around the map. Split cells eventually <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> into one cell. Aside from feeding viruses, players can eject (release) a small fraction of their mass to feed other cells, an action commonly recognized as an intention to team with another player. This can be done by pressing the [...] key. A player can also eject mass to trick enemies into coming closer to the player. Once an enemy cell is close enough, the player can split his/her cell to eat the baited enemy.|$|E
500|$|M-99 heads north through {{farmland}} to {{the village}} of Springport where it turns eastward along Main Street as it passes through the town. The highway continues easterly on Eaton Rapids Road before turning northward to cross into Eaton County. Shortly after crossing the county line, M-50 comes in from the southwest to meet up with M-99. The two highways travel together into Eaton Rapids. Together they form Main Street in the city before they separate {{on the north side of}} town. M-50 leaves to the northwest as Dexter Road, and M-99 continues to the northeast as Canal and Michigan streets. For the next few miles, the trunkline splits into a divided highway and runs parallel to the general course of the Grand River. M-99 crosses the river southeast of Diamondale after the opposing directions <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> together as an undivided highway. [...] North of the river crossing, M-99 meets I-96 at the latter's exit101 on the southern border of Lansing.|$|E
500|$|After the {{junction}} with M-40, the highway then enters Kalamazoo County {{and has an}} interchange with US Highway 131 (US131) just before entering the city of Kalamazoo on Main Street near {{the north side of}} the campus of Western Michigan University. Through downtown, M-43 runs concurrently with both of the city's business loops for I-94 and US131. Eastbound traffic along the combined highway is routed on Michigan Avenue, while westbound traffic uses Kalamazoo Avenue. Business US 131 (Bus. US131) turns north at Park Street and BL I-94/M-43 [...] continues east. After the two traffic directions <b>merge</b> <b>back</b> together and cross the Kalamazoo River, BL I-94 turns to the southeast, and M-43 follows Riverview Drive to an intersection with Gull Road. There M-43 begins to head northeast out of the city. The highway passes in front of the Borgess Medical Center and along a row of retail and commercial properties next to Gull Road. The trunkline then travels through a rural area for a brief period before entering the community of Richland where it merges with M-89.|$|E
