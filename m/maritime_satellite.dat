Both in-harbor and at-sea radiometer measurements were made that indicated a steady background, antenna-noise temperature value slightly less than 70 degrees kelvin (K) at elevation angles of 5 °, and greater, at 1. 6 GHz. A comparison of theoretical and measured values indicate excellent agreement within about 5 K for at-sea data.

40|$|Position {{surveillance}} {{using one}} active ranging/communication satellite and the time-of-arrival of signals from an independent satellite {{was shown to}} be feasible and practical. A towboat on the Mississippi River was equipped with a tone-code ranging transponder and a receiver tuned to the timing signals of the GOES satellite. A similar transponder was located {{at the office of}} the towing company. Tone-code ranging interrogations were transmitted from the General Electric Earth Station Laboratory through ATS- 6 to the towboat and to the ground truth transponder office. Their automatic responses included digital transmissions of time-of-arrival measurements derived from the GOES signals. The Earth Station Laboratory determined ranges from the satellites to the towboat and computed position fixes. The ATS- 6 lines-of-position were more precise than 0. 1 NMi, 1 sigma, and the GOES lines-of-position were more precise than 1. 6 NMi, 1 sigma. High quality voice communications were accomplished with the transponders using a nondirectional antenna on the towboat. The simple and effective surveillance technique merits further evaluation using operational <b>maritime</b> <b>satellites...</b>|$|R
40|$|Geostationary <b>maritime</b> <b>satellites,</b> {{one over}} the Pacific and {{one over the}} Atlantic Ocean, are planned to make {{available}} high-speed communications and navigation (position determination) services to ships at sea. A shipboard satellite terminal, operating within the authorized maritime L-band, 1636. 5 to 1645. 0 MHz, will allow ships to pass voice, teletype, facsimile, and data messages to shore communication facilities {{with a high degree}} of reliability. The shore-to-ship link will also operate in the maritime L-band from 1535. 0 to 1543. 5 MHz. A significant number or maritime/commercial ships are expected to be equipped with an L-band satellite terminal by the year 1980, and so consequently, there is an interest in determining electromagnetic compatibility between the proposed L-band shipboard terminal and existing, on-board, shipboard communications/electronics and electrical systems, as well as determining the influence of shore-based interference sources. The shipboard electromagnetic interference survey described was conducted on-board the United States Line's American Leader class (15, 690 tons) commercial container ship, the "American Alliance" from June 16 to 20, 1974.
