30|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve this issue, some of the <b>percentage</b> <b>{{biodegradation}}</b> results were recalculated. A number of phase 2 biodegradation results reached over 100 % biodegradation, as discussed this was partly due to an underestimation of the TOC left in the system when calculating the theoretical gas production (using Equation one from Bendt and Willing [5]). The solution suggested involved calculating the remaining TOC after phase 1 and adding it to the TOC introduced to the system in phase 2. A brief exercise was carried out where possible to test whether using an altered TOC value in the theoretical gas production calculation would offer more realistic <b>biodegradation</b> values. The <b>percentage</b> <b>biodegradation</b> {{at the end of}} phase 1 was read from the original results and used to calculate the TOC non-degraded in phase 1. The remaining TOC from phase 1 was then added to the TOC added to phase 2. This value was then used in Equation one to calculate the theoretical gas production. As informed by Equation two, a higher theoretical gas production results in a lower phase 2 <b>biodegradation</b> <b>percentage</b> for the same net gas production.|$|R

Hence, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate the occlusal characteristics of patients who have undergone non-extraction or all first premolars extraction treatment for class I malocclusion using the peer assessment rating (PAR) index. METHODS: The pre-treatment and post treatment dental casts of 94 subjects with class-I malocclusion were retrospectively screened. The sample was distributed into two groups, i. e., nonextraction and all first premolars extraction groups. The Mann Whitney-U test was used to compare the <b>mean</b> <b>percentage</b> improvement in the PAR scores between the two groups. A p-value of ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The <b>mean</b> <b>percentage</b> improvement in the non-extraction group was 74. 28 % in the non-extraction group and 74. 5 % in the all first premolars extraction group.
