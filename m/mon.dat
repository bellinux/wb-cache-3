5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} <b>Mon</b> Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by <b>Mon</b> Calamari due to the ships' <b>Mon</b> Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of <b>Mon</b> Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although <b>Mon</b> Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the <b>Mon</b> Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, <b>Mon</b> Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
