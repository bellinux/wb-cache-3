40|$|The complexity, image quality, {{bandwidth}} efficiency and robustness issues of a <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> <b>telephone</b> scheme for personal communications networks (PCN) are addressed. Our motion-compensated 55 Kbit/s subband codec (SBC) using seven non-uniformly spaced active bands with band specific scanning and runlength coding achieves image peak {{signal to noise}} ratios (SNR) of around 38 dB associated with good communications quality for monochrome common intermediate format (CIF) images sampled at 10 frames per second. The motion dependent bitrate fluctuations are smoothed out by buffering with adaptive quantiser control feedback. The video bits are then sorted into two sensitivity classes and error protected by a twin-class binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) scheme. The separately BCH-encoded more significant bits (MSB) and less significant bits (LSB) are transmitted via separate subchannels of the 16 -level quadrature amplitude modulator (16 -QAM), having different integrity. The overall signalling rate becomes 22 KBd, sufficiently low for typical microcells to fulfil the narrowband channel condition. Clearly, no equaliser has to be used, which considerably reduces the system’s complexity, yet unimpaired image quality is achieved for channel SNRs in excess of 20 dB...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) schemes are {{attractive}} {{in terms of}} bandwidth efficiency and offer a numbcr of subchannels with dil'erent integrities via both Gaussian and Rayleigh-fading channels, Specifically, the 16 -QAM phasor constellation has two, while the 64 -QAM possesses three such subchannels, which become dramatically different via Rayleigh-fading channels. The analytically derived bit error rate (BER) formulae yield virtually identical curves with simulation results, exhibiting adequate BERs for the highest integrity subchannels of both 16 -QAM and 64 -QAM to be further reduced by forward error correction coding (FEC). However, the BERs of the lower integrity subchannels require fading compensation to reduce their values for FEC techniques to become effective. This property creates ground {{for a variety of}} carefully matched, embedded mobile transmission schemes of diRerent complexities. The practical implementation of such an embedded scheme is demonstrated by a low-cost, low-complexity and lowconsumption 50 KBd <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> <b>telephone</b> scheme offering adequatc spccch and image quality Tor channel SNRs in excess of about 20 dB via Rayleigh-fading channels. key words: QAM theorq; modularion for microcellular fading channel...|$|E

However, these codecs are generally quite complex [1][2][3], whereas our work is influenced by the need for a low-complexity and low-cost hardware solution. In the context of hardware implementation and integration with the H. 263 low bitrate video standard [4], several bottlenecks are investigated, such as computational power and memory access bandwidth. Different solutions are proposed that make the discrete wavelet transform competitive with existing DCT intra frame coding schemes. An algorithm is developed that combines the Two-Ten wavelet transform with a Telenor block-based H. 263 run length and variable length encoder [5].

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the first study of the uses of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> {{telephony}} based on the collection and analysis of naturally occurring <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> telephony. We show how a characteristic feature of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> telephony, which makes it differ from any other kind of mediated interaction, is that: a) the participants may orient the camera at will to shoot almost any feature within their environment; and b) what they actually show at a given moment may be (and usually is) inspected by the recipient for its relevance to the ongoing interaction, and is produced with an orientation towards such scrutiny. A specific concern of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> call users at any time is therefore what they should or should not show.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> has {{attracted much attention}} from both industry and researchers. To satisfy users and to facilitate the usage of <b>mobile</b> <b>video,</b> providing optimal quality to the users is necessary. As a result, quality of experience (QoE) becomes an important focus in measuring the overall quality perceived by the end-users, from the aspects of both objective system performance and subjective experience. However, due {{to the complexity of}} user experience and diversity of resources (such as <b>videos,</b> networks and <b>mobile</b> devices), it is still challenging to develop QoE models for <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> that can represent how user-perceived value varies with changing conditions. Previous QoE modelling research has two main limitations: aspects influencing QoE are insufficiently considered; and acceptability as the user value is seldom studied. Focusing on the QoE modelling issues, two aims are defined in this thesis: (i) investigating the key influencing factors of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> QoE; and (ii) establishing QoE prediction models based on the relationships between user acceptability and the influencing factors, in order to help provide optimal <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality. To achieve the first goal, a comprehensive user study was conducted. It investigated the main impacts on user acceptance: video encoding parameters such as quantization parameter, spatial resolution, frame rate, and encoding bitrate; <b>video</b> content type; <b>mobile</b> device display resolution; and user profiles including gender, preference for video content, and prior viewing experience. Results from both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed the significance of these factors, as well as how and why they influenced user acceptance of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality. Based on the results of the user study, statistical techniques were used to generate a set of QoE models that predict the subjective acceptability of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality by using a group of the measurable influencing factors, including encoding parameters and bitrate, content type, and mobile device display resolution. Applying the proposed QoE models into a <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> delivery system, optimal decisions can be made for determining proper video coding parameters and for delivering most suitable quality to users. This would lead to consistent user experience on different <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> content and efficient resource allocation. The findings in this research enhance the understanding of user experience in the field of <b>mobile</b> <b>video,</b> which will benefit <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> design and research. This thesis presents a way of modelling QoE by emphasising user acceptability of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality, which provides a strong connection between technical parameters and user-desired quality. Managing QoE based on acceptability promises the potential for adapting to the resource limitations and achieving an optimal QoE in the provision of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> content...|$|R

The shift from fixed television viewing to mobile usage does not simply result in a transfer of the same experience to a greater range of places.

To satisfy the considerable amount of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> requests, video service providers have been pushing their content delivery infrastructure to edge networks [...] from regional CDN servers to peer CDN servers (e. g., smartrouters in users' homes) [...] to cache content and serve users with storage and network resources nearby. Among the edge network content caching paradigms, Wi-Fi access point caching and cellular base station caching have become two mainstream solutions. Thus, understanding the effectiveness and performance of these solutions for large-scale <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> delivery is important. However, the characteristics and request patterns of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> streaming are unclear in practical wireless network.
