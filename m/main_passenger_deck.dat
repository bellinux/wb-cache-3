5000|$|MV Cardiff Castle {{was built}} in 1964 for the River Dart Steamboat Co Ltd (RDSC) by Bolson's of Poole. She was a near sister of Conway Castle and was built to replace Totnes Castle. She was {{originally}} fitted with Totnes Castles wheelhouse on a flying bridge structure above her <b>main</b> (open) <b>passenger</b> <b>deck.</b> She also had a lounge on the lower <b>deck.</b> She operated <b>passenger</b> services on the Dart until 1977; by this time she was the last passenger vessel owned by RDSC. [...] In 1977 she was sold to Millbrook Steamboat & Trading Co Ltd, which {{at that time was}} the largest operator of cruises from Plymouth. They rebuilt her to her current condition, with a large deckhouse on the main deck, and open deck seating above, behind a new wheelhouse. The bar is still located on the lower deck. In 1980 the Millbrook Company, and all of its vessels were bought by Dart Free Houses Ltd, parent company of Dart Pleasure Craft Ltd. In 1985 the Millbrook operation was wound up and there were various transfers of vessels between the fleets of different south Devon companies. Cardiff Castle returned to the Dart, and can now be seen operating regularly on her original route from Dartmouth to Totnes.|$|R

40|$|Growing {{passenger}} {{dimensions and}} the demand for more comfort in the economy class cabin is a trend that is becoming more important during aircraft conceptual design. Based on recent investigations, it is known that current aircraft seat dimensions are not suitable and safe for {{a large part of the}} world population. Therefore, a change in aircraft conceptual design thinking, by taking human anthropometry into account, is required. This thesis investigates the opportunity to change the aircraft during conceptual design as well as the opportunity to change current aircraft in order to provide a higher level of passenger comfort and safety. To measure the latter, a comfort model is created, based on scientific research and human dimensions, allowing for the measurement of comfort related to seating configurations, seat characteristics, and cabin dimensions. By establishing the ideal seat dimensions, it is shown that conceptual aircraft designs for the worldwide 95 percentile passenger require wider, but shorter, fuselages. Using the Initiator as a conceptual design tool, four short-haul and four long-haul aircraft are modeled for a range of seat dimensions. Based on an inside-out aircraft design approach, it is shown that similar aircraft performance characteristics are obtained when designing for the worldwide 95 passenger percentile. Moreover, a similar level of direct operating costs, and hence profitability, is attained. However, designing for the worldwide 99 passenger percentile yields considerably higher fuel burn rates and operating costs. An average increase of 3. 9 % among all modeled aircraft is seen for the harmonic fuel burn, leading to an increase of 4. 2 % in direct operating costs. Considering existing aircraft, use is made of an outside-in aircraft design approach to assess a set of performance characteristics. Based on an average utilization of 37 % of the cargo space in commercial transport aircraft, a potential is shown for a different utilization of the aircraft lower deck, allowing the airline to provide more passenger comfort while retaining a similar level of profitability. Using the Airbus A 340 - 300 as reference aircraft, it is shown that the placement of passengers in the lower hold is feasible from a regulatory, ergonomical, economical, and structural point of view. Based on a reference three-class layout with 267 passengers, it is shown that a lower deck seating compartment provides an increase of 14. 6 % in the number of passengers when similar seat properties are used as on the <b>main</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>deck.</b> The installment of additional furnishing and required structural reinforcements results in a decrease of 12 % in maximum structural payload weight. Nevertheless, it is shown that the placement of passengers in the lower deck yields higher profitability rates for the airline when compared to the carriage of additional freight. Secondly, the placement of lavatories and galleys in the aircraft lower deck is investigated, allowing for a maximum increase of 13 % in passenger seats. To allow for the installment of galley lift systems, staircases, and required safety measures, a decrease of 6. 27 % in maximum structural payload is attained. By subsequently increasing seat characteristics on the main deck, an increase of 12 % in passenger comfort is achieved for the worldwide 95 passenger percentile. The airline profitability level associated to this comfort layout in turn relates to an average carriage of 5300 kg of freight during the aircraft service life, being equal to the current average. For both the lower deck seating and service utilization, it is concluded that the flying experience of the passenger is increased, while a similar level of airline and manufacturer profitability is obtained. Aircraft lower deck utilization can therefore be seen as a feasible replacement for conventional aircraft configurations. Flight Performance and PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

2500|$|The Fairmile is {{a wooden}} hulled {{passenger}} vessel. Her hulls-form is very fine for a vessel of her type; {{it is based}} on a destroyer hull, albeit much smaller, as her original speed was some 20 knots. The hull is split into watertight compartments, the midships compartment is the engine room, housing twin Gardner diesels, and an aft compartment contains the toilet facilities. The main deck has a forward open <b>passenger</b> <b>deck.</b> Aft of this, the forward deckhouse contains a chart room. [...] In the centre of the main deck is a raised open deck area, surrounding the funnel, and with the open flybridge above the chartroom. [...] Aft of the funnel is the <b>main</b> <b>passenger</b> lounge, originally the sick-bay, now named [...] "Churchill's", in honour of Winston Churchill. [...] The saloon is decorated with memorabilia of Churchill, including his profile etched on the side windows, and contains a bar. Both of the deckhouses are surrounded by an open <b>passenger</b> promenade <b>deck.</b> [...] At the stern of the vessel, the former open deck has been enclosed with an awning.|$|R

This allowed foot passengers to remain separate from the car deck which was level with the lower <b>passenger</b> <b>deck.</b> The upper <b>passenger</b> <b>deck</b> consisted of a small coffee cabin and games machines, with stairs leading down to the lower deck. The lower deck lounge had a ticket office (which closed following new regulations in 2005) and toilets aft, with doorways leading to the car deck. Juno had her accommodation renovated in 1993. The following year, her lifeboats were replaced by smaller life rafts to allow for more deck space.|$|R

The gun room was in the stern area of the gun <b>deck,</b> to which <b>passengers</b> had no access due to it being the storage space for powder and ammunition for the ship's cannons and any other weapons belonging to the ship. The gun room might also house a pair of stern chasers, small cannons used to fire out the stern of the ship. Forward on the gun deck in the bow area was a windlass, equipment similar in function to the capstan in steerage, which was used to raise and lower the ship's main anchor. [...] There were no stairs for the passengers on the gun deck to go up through the gratings to the main deck. [...] To get up to the <b>main</b> <b>deck,</b> <b>passengers</b> were required to climb a wooden or rope ladder.|$|R
