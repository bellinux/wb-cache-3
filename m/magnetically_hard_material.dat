40|$|The {{onset of}} the Younger Dryas (YD) climactic event at ~ 12. 9 ka coincides with the {{extinction}} of Pleistocene megafauna and drastic changes in human subsistence patterns in the Americas, changes whose cause/s remain a geologic mystery. Firestone et al. (2007) proposed a bolide impact to explain these dramatic environmental changes, citing elevated concentrations of magnetic spherules (MSp) picked from magnetic extracts as key evidence. This study uses a comprehensive suite of highly sensitive rock magnetic measurements to evaluate continuously sampled soil profiles from two well-dated early human archeological sites that span the YD boundary and investigate magnetic evidence for an impact. Rock magnetic techniques {{are one of the}} most sensitive means for detecting subtle changes in grain size, sedimentation rate, or pedogenic development. We expect that the environmental changes (wildfires, vegetation loss, erosion/deposition rates) associated with an impact or airburst event of this magnitude would be preserved in the magnetic record. Hysteresis loops and frequency dependence of susceptibility measurements are used to evaluate the concentration, grain size, and composition of magnetic material, while low-temperature magnetic properties, SEM images and EDS spectra speak to magnetic mineralogy. We observe gradual decreases in the amount of magnetic material and shifts towards smaller, more magnetically hard (high-coercivity) minerals with depth at both sites. These trends are consistent with a history of uninterrupted soil development rather than a catastrophic impact event. Magnetic extracts were also prepared from bulk soil collected at one site, following the methods of previous investigators in order to explore the possibility of sampling bias during magnetic extraction. Extracted magnetic grains are larger and more magnetically hard than in-situ magnetic material, and are predominantly detrital ilmenites with varying degrees of alteration to high-titanium products. Many grains exhibit hematite exolution lamellae, which gives rise to lamellar magnetic coupling. Pedogenesis dominates the magnetic properties at both sites, producing profiles with near-surface enrichment of fine-grained <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> <b>material</b> that is progressively oxidized with depth...|$|E

For example, residual stress (strain) and defects are studied for their influence on magnetization, in order to produce <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> <b>materials</b> etc., as opposed to studying the influence of magnetic properties of materials on their mechanical behavior or as a means of investigating micro-mechanical behavior. A few exceptions are studies of macro-mechanical behavior under very high magnetic fields [1], the “delta E” [2] and Barkhausen effect [3 – 5]. These are directed towards understanding mechanical behavior but usually use intrusive means, by perturbing the material with a magnetic field to produce measurable changes.

In recent years, research into exchange spring systems has flourished, with potential for application in high-performance permanent magnets, GMR spin devices, magnetic MEMS technology, and in magnetic data storage. We investigate the magnetic properties of MBE grown superlattices with alternating layers of <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> rare earth-iron (DyFe 2, ErFe 2) and soft yttriumiron (YFe 2) compounds. They are ideal model systems to study exchange spring phenomena. We develop numerical {{models of the}} investigated systems and apply micromagnetic simulations. The simulation code OOMMF is extended and used to solve Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert and Brown’s equations. This allows us to determine the microscopic configuration of the magnetisation that is not directly accessible by experiment. Magnetic field-sweep measurements of a multilayered DyFe 2 /YFe 2 system show an unexpected triple switching of the <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> DyFe 2 layers. The magnetisation of the hard magnetic layers reverse before the soft magnetic layers. We reproduce the experimental hysteresis loops of the net and compound-specific magnetisation by means of simulations and explain the switching behaviour. Using similar numerical methods, we interpret experimental data on ErFe 2 /YFe 2 multilayers. At sufficiently high fields, applied perpendicular to the multilayer film plane, the energy is minimised by a multilayer spin flop. This is a particular spin configuration where the magnetisation aligns with a direction perpendicular to the applied field. Taking the preceding findings further, we investigate multilayers of ErFe 2 /YFe 2 / DyFe 2 /YFe 2. We gain insight in the complex spin configurations in systems of different <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> <b>materials,</b> with a pre-strung domain wall in the soft YFe 2 layers.

40|$|In {{practice}} x-ray {{studies of}} ferromagnetic materials require circularly polarized radiation if the weak momentum-dependent signal {{is to be}} separated from the dominant charge scattering in either elastic (diffraction) experiments or inelastic (Compton scattering) studies. In both methods it is necessary to modulate the photon's helicity or the sample's magnetisation. The former method is the more desirable because it is effective in <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> <b>materials,</b> but it is more difficult to achieve than the latter. To date inelastic Compton scattering, which is solely sensitive to the spin moment, is the better developed technique. It has benefited from the availability of high fluxes of high energy x-rays (60 - 300 keV) at third generation synchrotron sources. This has led to an improvement of a factor of two in resolution, but further improvements are flux limited. In the 3 d elemental and compound ferromagnets the method has been used to establish the validity not only of the electronic structure calculation but also the underlying approximations.

40|$|The {{areal density}} in {{magnetic}} recording has surpassed ~ 50 Gbit/in 2 in products and ~ 100 Gbit/in 2 in laboratory demonstrations. These densities {{have been achieved}} with recording media comprised of Co-alloy nanostructured materials with horizontal orientation of the magnetization (longitudinal recording). Grain sizes are 8 – 10 nm and grain size distributions are near 20 % (sigma over mean). Going much beyond 100 Gbit/in 2 requires <b>magnetically</b> <b>harder</b> <b>materials</b> with smaller, thermally stable grains (5 – 8 nm) and tighter distributions (< 15 %). Experiments indicate {{that this may be}} possible in perpendicular recording, where a soft magnetic imaging layer is used to enhance the write field, enabling such grains to be recorded on. Basic technology demonstrations of 170 Gbit/in 2 have already been reported and modeling suggests that extensions to about 1 Tbit/in 2 should be possible using that technology. Going much beyond Tbit/in 2, however, will require more drastic changes of heads and media. One of the fundamental limitations relates to the media sputter fabrication process, which may not allow the tight grain size and magnetic dispersions required in models. So called self-organized magnetic arrays (SOMA) of chemically synthesized FePt nanoparticles are being explored as alternatives.

30|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} and widely utilized magnetic materials, the spinel ferrite system consists of both <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> and soft <b>materials.</b> For example, cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4) is <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> with a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant K[*]>[*] 106  erg/cm 3 [5, 6].

Due to the same crystallographic structure and almost negligible lattice mismatch among these spinel ferrites, it should be markedly controllable to epitaxially grow a uniformed shell over a core.

40|$|Traditional {{magnetic}} {{data storage}} devices are reaching {{the limits of}} their capabilities,and new technologies must be sought if the remarkable pace of improvement in performance and storage capacity seen over the last 60 years is to continue. Bit-patterned media (BPM) has the potential to continue this development and significantly increase the storage densities of magnetic hard disks, but developing a cost-effective route to manufacture this technology has so far remained elusive. This work takes inspiration from nature, to develop a bioinspired and green approach to forming magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) on surfaces, as a novel approach to BPM. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) form highly uniform MNPs of the magnetic material of magnetite inside specialised lipid organelles called magnetosomes, under mild aqueous conditions. Control over the magnetite crystal formed is exerted through the use of biomineralisation proteins. One of these proteins from the MTB Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB- 1, termed Mms 6, has been shown to control the formation of magnetite nanoparticles in vitro. In this work, {{a modified version of the}} Mms 6 protein, engineered to contain an N-terminal cysteine, is patterned and immobilised onto gold surfaces to biotemplate the growth of MNP arrays of magnetite. Furthermore, different patterning methods are explored to control the location of Mms 6, with the aim of producing MNP arrays that are suitable for BPM. Magnetite is a magnetically soft material that is unlikely to ever be used for data storage, but Mms 6 has been shown to biotemplate the <b>magnetically</b> <b>harder</b> <b>material</b> of cobalt-doped magnetite and this is also explored as an alternative. This approach is also highly adaptable, and could be used for the production of a wide range of different nanomaterials on surfaces through the use of alternative biomolecules. The patterning approaches developed in this work are also used to pattern artificial biomolecules to biotemplate materials that are more technologically relevant and not found in nature, such as L 10 phase CoPt, as a route to developing an environmentally friendly, scalable and bioinspired approach to the challenge of BPM...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} two {{new technologies}} for producing magnetic materials {{which have been}} successfully developed in recent years at the Institute of Physics of the Czestochowa University of Technology and discusses properties of the materials obtained {{with the use of}} these methods. Design/methodology/approach: In this research the arc-plasma deposition of Nd 2 Fe 14 B powders onto a substrate either cooled with water or heated up to a temperature in the range from 773 to 1023 K was applied. In the second method the suction of an arc-melted alloy to a water-cooled copper mould (the suction-casting method) was introduced. Moreover, microstructure, magnetic properties and domain structure of the produced samples were determined. Findings: It has been found that thin Nd 2 Fe 14 B strips obtained by the plasma method possess magnetic properties. It has also been demonstrated that the suction-casting method makes it possible to obtain both amorphous magnetically soft materials (e. g. Fe-Co-W-Zr-B), as well as <b>magnetically</b> <b>hard</b> nanocomposites (e. g. (Fe-Co) -(Pr-Dy) -B-Zr). Research limitations/implications: The main problem in the suction-casting method is to reduce the critical cooling rate required for the production of amorphous alloys and to increase the geometrical dimensions of amorphous specimens. Practical implications: Thin-layered Nd-Fe-B magnets produced by means of arc-plasma deposition can be applied directly onto the surface of electromagnetic equipment parts. Magnets with isotropic magnetic properties were obtained by applying layers onto the water-cooled copper substrate. Whereas, anisotropic magnets were obtained {{as a result of the}} arc-plasma deposition of powders onto the copper substrate heated up to 873 K. The most advantageous properties were achieved for the microcrystalline structure of a grain size close to the single-domain particle size (approx. 0. 3 μm).

Randomly mixed solids of small and large semiconducting CdSe NPs revealed enhancement of photoluminescence intensity of large semiconductor particles accompanied by quenching of photoluminescence of the small particles because of long-range resonant transfer of electronic excitations from the more electronically confined small particles to higher excited states of the large particles.
