5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{diffusion}} damping produces {{its effects}} {{independent of the}} cosmological model being studied, thereby masking the effects of other, model-dependent phenomena. This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping, scientists cannot judge {{the relative merits of}} cosmological models, whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data, this data being obscured by damping effects. For example, the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping. This deamplification of the power spectrum hides features of the curve, features that would otherwise be <b>more</b> <b>visible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Insectivorous insects, or {{insects that}} feed on other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs feed on aphids, {{and can be used}} as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|Oguchi's ensemble, Osuwa Daiko, {{incorporated}} these alterations {{and other}} drums into their performances. They also devised novel pieces that were intended for non-religious performances. Several other groups emerged in Japan through the 1950s and 1960s. Oedo Sukeroku Daiko {{was formed in}} Tokyo in 1959 under Seidō Kobayashi, and {{has been referred to}} as the first taiko group who toured professionally. Globally, kumi-daiko performance became <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> during the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when it was featured during the Festival of Arts event.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{generally}} compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline {{with his}} later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much weaker {{than that for}} Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of Romeo and Juliet have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> character.|$|E

At launch, Aston Martin planned to build between 1,400 and 1,500 DB9s per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Drusus {{elevated}} Sejanus, {{at least in}} Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as his 'Socius Laborum' (Partner of my labours). Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city, and Sejanus became more and <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD26, Sejanus was left {{in charge of the}} entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.|$|E

T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less obvious wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri and has <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> spotting on its breast.|$|E

5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the hose and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of}} the top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E

5|$|Delay issues aside, the {{development}} team encountered further {{challenges in the}} creation of the game. Implementing the top-down perspective became a particular issue and resulted in a lot of trial and error. With a true top-down view, players would be unable to see characters' faces and bodies. To circumvent this issue, objects in the world were tilted at an angle so that they were <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> in the top-down view. Mouri requested that the game run at sixty frames per second instead of thirty to stabilise the stereoscopic 3D and smoothen movement animations. While doubling the frame rate increased the processing load, it allowed the developers to implement a feature where players could select items by dragging and dropping them from their inventory using the Nintendo 3DS's touchscreen and stylus; at thirty frames per second this feature felt too sluggish for the stylus's movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, {{in the hope of}} reducing the risk of being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E

5|$|Peace on Earth is {{the first}} Christmas album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns. Produced by Mark Hall and Mark A. Miller, it was {{released}} on October 7, 2008. Intended by Hall {{to bring out the}} worshipful aspect of Christmas, the album does not have songs relating to secular Christmas traditions, instead featuring a mix of traditional Christmas carols and original songs. As co-producer, Hall attempted to differentiate the album from their previous ones by attempting to use creative ideas they had not tried before, and he also wanted to utilize the band's female members in a broader and <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> role on the album.|$|E
5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is <b>more</b> <b>visible</b> on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 3DS version {{features}} stereoscopic 3D graphics with optional cel-shaded outlines to {{make the}} characters <b>more</b> <b>visible.</b> The game also features two exclusive modes; Smash Run and StreetSmash. Smash Run, based on the City Trial mode from Kirby Air Ride, has players navigate an open environment, fighting computer-controlled enemies to earn stat-increasing power-ups, before facing {{each other in a}} randomly selected match, such as vertical or horizontal races against each other or battles with various special rules. StreetSmash is a StreetPass-based game in which players control a disc on a top-down board and attempt to knock their opponents out of the arena. The 3DS version supports the additional controls featured on the New Nintendo 3DS, such as using the C-Stick to trigger Smash Attacks, but is not compatible with the Circle Pad Pro peripheral because of hardware limitations.|$|E
