5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN. The eastern green mamba is, however, a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, habitat destruction and deforestation <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a possible threat to this species.|$|E
5|$|In the Tosco-Emilian Apennines, P.fluviatile is {{only found}} {{south of the}} watershed, in {{contrast}} with the crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, which occurs on both sides on the mountains. Although their ranges overlap, the two species do not inhabit the same water courses, apparently because the crab outcompetes the crayfish, which is therefore forced to live in less favourable locations where the crab cannot survive. Non-indigenous crayfish <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a greater threat to P.fluviatile than native crayfish, although the greatest threats remain pollution, overfishing and the draining of wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} can be {{afflicted by}} psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). The viral infection causes feather loss and beak malformation {{and reduces the}} bird's overall immunity. Particularly prevalent in sulphur-crested cockatoos, little corellas and galahs, it has been recorded in 14 species of cockatoo to date. Although unlikely to significantly impact on large, healthy populations of birds in the wild, PBFD <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a high risk to smaller stressed populations.|$|E

5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} radioactive materials, and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a risk to the blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have {{only one or two}} seconds, depending on the context, to audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds. This research project was funded by the National Federation of the Blind.|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, the Yunnan hare {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it has been reported by residents to be commonly found. Although the current state of its population trend is unclear, the Yunnan hare population is likely to be secure as it occurs in remote areas in southwestern China. However, agricultural activities on mountainous regions <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a threat to the species by isolating its mountain populations. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, nearly meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. It occurs in protected areas and also in the Changshanerhai, Daweishan, Gaoligongshan, Jinpingfenshuiling, Nujiang, Shilin, and Tongbiguan Nature Reserves.|$|E

5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> some threat {{to life on}} the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, caution should be {{exercised}} if it begins to perform a threat display. This species {{is regarded as a}} game fish and offers a respectable fight on light tackle (a more delicate fishing line). It is also of regional commercial importance, being taken intentionally and as bycatch via gillnets and surface longlines across its range, most significantly off southwestern Florida, Venezuela, and Brazil; the meat is sold dried and salted. Large numbers of blacknose sharks are also caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers, which <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a greater threat to its population, as many of the sharks taken are immature.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural events <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{protected}} areas totalling 21,800 hectares, {{but there has}} been no management and these areas are threatened by agricultural encroachment, illegal logging, and fire. Trapping for food and introduced rats <b>may</b> also <b>pose</b> a threat.|$|R
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} {{is one of}} the most important components of Pacific artisanal shark and ray fisheries, comprising around a tenth of the total annual catch. Its significance is likely underestimated, as Mexican fishery reports frequently suffer from misidentifications and a lack of species-specific data. It is mainly caught during summer and fall, being the most common ray landed in Bahía Magdalena, and second most common ray landed off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the main fishing gear employed; both adult and juvenile rays easily become entangled in the mesh by their tail spines, with juveniles known to have comprised most of the Bahía Magdalena catch in 19982000. This species is also often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. In the future, habitat degradation from increasing numbers of shrimp farms <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> an additional threat to this species in the region. As a result of these pressures, the IUCN has assessed the diamond stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No management schemes have yet been enacted for this species.|$|E
5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and <b>may</b> <b>pose</b> a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E
