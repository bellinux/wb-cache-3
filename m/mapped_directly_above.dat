40|$|The von Recklinghausen {{neurofibromatosis}} 1 (NF 1) locus {{has been}} previously assigned to the proximal long arm of chromosome 17, and two NF 1 patients have been identified who have constitutional balanced translocations involving 17 q 11. 2. We have constructed a cosmid library from a chromosome-mediated gene transfectant, KLT 8, that contains approximately 10 % of chromosome 17, including 17 q 11. 2. Cosmids isolated from this library have been mapped across a panel of somatic cell hybrids, including the hybrids from the two patients, and have been localized to seven small regions of proximal 17 q. We have 5 cosmids that <b>map</b> <b>directly</b> <b>above</b> the two NF 1 translocations, and 11 cosmids that <b>map</b> <b>directly</b> below. Of these, 2 cosmids in each region {{are linked to the}} disease locus and 3 of these cosmids show no recombination. One distal cosmid, 2 B/B 35, detects the two NF 1 translocations by pulsed-field gel analysis and has been used to produce a long-range restriction map that covers the translocations...|$|R
