50|$|Brokenhillite (Brokenhillit Brokenhillita) is an earth mineral {{that exists}} in small quantities. It is only found in the far-western regions of New South Wales in Broken Hill, Australia. Although it {{has been given a}} name and {{chemical}} formula, it has not been approved by the International Mineralogy Association primarily because it is a <b>manganese</b> <b>silicate</b> of the pyrosmalite group which means the compositional similarities are too great to be an approved mineral. Brokenhillite structure is either composed of iron or manganese with the formula (Mn+2, Fe+2)8Si6O15(OH,Cl)10, and has either a hydroxide or a chloride rotation. The actual components inside Brokenhillite can be determined using a diffractometer. The structural basis of this mineral is determined to be phyllosilicate within the pyrosmalites due to the octahedral structure, with one perfect cleavage, a hardness of about 4.5, and a streak of light brown. The area of Broken Hill has a very diverse spreading of deposits with a sporadic layering of minerals. Due to the large region of deposition, few mineralogists have attempted to study its environment which is why there is a greater opportunity for further study despite the small amount of publications presented over the years.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{manganiferous}} amphibole juddite {{has been}} reported {{by a number of}} workers from metamorphosed manganese formations of India. The mineral is developed at the contact of pegmatite and gondite, and associated characteristically with blanfordite (manganoan aegirine-augite) and winchite (manganoan richterite-tremolite). The range of the refractive indices of the mineral and the orientation of the optic axial plane normal to (oIo) suggest the mineral to be of magnesioriebeckite composition. The loo Mn~+:(Mn~++Mg+Fe 2 +) and ioo Fe 3 +:(Fe 3 ++AFI+Ti) ratios plotted in the glaucophane-magnesioriebeckite diagram show that eight out of nine analyses (eight new) are grouped under magnesioriebeckite composition range. It may thus be concluded that the juddites generally refer to (manganoar 0 magnesioriebeckite compositions. In some cases, however, the com-position of juddite shows considerable departure from ideal magnesioriebeckite composition and the juddite and winchite (manganoan tremolite-richterite) show evidences ofcompositional transition, indicating partial miscibility. The juddites have been formed by the interaction of pegmatitic fluid on manganese ore, gondite, and other country rocks such as mica schists and diopside-forsterite marble.

The evaluation of the vertical facies sequences, their lateral distribution and their contact relationships renders a spatial reconstruction of the environmental setting for the manganese ores possible. The development of facies from a near-shore clastic regime to manganese-bearing hemipelagic sediments and ultimately to pelagic manganostones and iron...|$|E
40|$|The optical {{spectrum}} of Mn 2 + in octahedral coordination for sursassite {{is characterized by}} well resolved bands at 580, 515, 470, 390, 340, and 295 nm (17240, 19420, 21280, 25640, 29410 and 33900 cm- 1). Crystal field parameters evaluated from the observed bands are Dq = 690, B = 680 and C = 2800 cm- 1. A broad band centred around 13000 cm- 1 attributed to Fe(III) ion is an impurity in sursassite confirmed from EDX analysis. Vibrational spectra have been investigated both by IR and Raman spectroscopy. The correlation between vibrational modes and the structural properties of the <b>manganese</b> <b>silicate,</b> sursassite, is made and compared with other silicates. Two vibrational modes of CO 32 - observed; the antisymmetric stretching mode (￮ 3) at 1420 cm- 1 (IR active) and the out-of-plane bending mode (￮ 2) (IR and Raman active) at ~ 875 cm- 1. This confirms the Mn rich phases in sursassite as observed from SEM probably a Mn carbonate-rhodochrosite...|$|E
40|$|Three {{kinds of}} {{silicate}} phosphor thin films, emitting in the red-green-blue (RGB) primary colors, were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition: manganese and lead doped calcium silicate (CaSiO 3 :MnPb) for red color, <b>manganese</b> doped zinc <b>silicate</b> (Zn 2 SiO 4 :Mn) for green color, and cerium doped yttrium silicate (Y 2 SiO 5 :Ce) for blue color. A good correlation {{was found between}} photoluminescence intensity and film crystallinity and surface morphology. Introduction Phosphors are widely used in emissive displays. However, all currently used phosphors still need considerable improvement such as in lower current saturation, high efficiency, and better chromaticity [1]. Oxide phosphor (including silicate phosphor) is more chemically stable than sulfide phosphors under high Coulomb loading. As a matter of fact, silicate phosphors such as Zn 2 SiO 4 :Mn {{have been used in}} CRTs. Electroluminescence (EL) device have also been made from these same silicate [2]. In all the display application [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of {{progressive}} depletion of groundwater reservoir and water quality deterioration of the Independence aquifer, an investigation on chemical data of dissolved major and minor constituents in 246 recent groundwater samples was performed. The main objective was the detection of processes responsible for the geochemical evolution and mineralization throughout the area. Multivariate techniques revealed different sources of solutes (a) dissolution of calcium and magnesium carbonate minerals, (b) weathering of acid volcanic minerals, (c) alteration of <b>manganese</b> containing alkaline <b>silicates,</b> (d) leaching of halite deposits of meteoric origin, (e) contamination from agricultural and urban wastewaters, and (f) evaporative effects due to intensive irrigation. Although nitrate contamination is associated with pollution from intensive cultivated areas, natural contamination {{plays an important role}} in the study area. The investigation reveals that weathering of acid volcanic rocks (rhyolite) and oxidation of arsenic bearing sulfide minerals are the responsible processes for high fluorine (up to 16 mg/l) and arsenic (up to 0. 12 mg/l) contents, respectively, exceeding the Mexican maximum admissible concentration for drinking water. Except for kaolinite, all recharge processes are dissolution oriented (CO 2, calcite, dolomite, K-feldspar, plagioclase). Silicate precipitation (amorphous silica and chalcedony) is of growing importance in discharge zones. Cation exchange is not an important issue in the whole study area...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the usage of manganese dioxide ore as a bio-filter media to remove metabolites in aquaculture closed system, and to determine whether manganese toxicity would at the same time represent a risk to fish. Initial work investigated the physical properties of manganese dioxide and its chemical interaction with ammonia and nitrite in the absence of biological activity. Subsequently, two pilot-scale pressurised filters were installed in a commercial scale hatchery in order to compare the metabolite removal performance of <b>manganese</b> dioxide against <b>silicate</b> sand in the presence of biological activity commonly found in aquaculture conditions. The investigation suggests that Mn medium is more reliable in converting ammonia to nitrate without producing a residual output of nitrite. The superior performance ofMn media compared with sand appears to be mainly related to the physical structure of the manganese ore. Furthermore, the Mn medium {{did not appear to be}} soluble in the ambient conditions normally found in aquaculture-closed system. From the design point of view, due to the higher ammonia and nitrite removal rates, a shorter retention time and a lower volume of media are required in the case of manganese dioxide technology compared with sand media. As a result, it is much easier to size a biofilter with Mn media. Manganese systems have a comparable total costs to conventional sand media, but using the Mn technology provides a more reliable control of toxic nitrite, thereby reducing risks offish loss and hence with reduced expected prod...|$|R
