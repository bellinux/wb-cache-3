5|$|She {{was then}} buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Her {{skeleton}} was identified during renovations {{of the chapel}} in 1876, in the reign of Queen Victoria, and Anne's resting place is now marked in the <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E

25|$|The {{church was}} rebuilt on medieval {{foundations}} between 1905 and 1937. The <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> of the Lady chapel depicts the Tree of Jesse {{made in the}} Abbey's own workshops in Byzantine style mosaic.|$|E
25|$|The high altar, located {{under the}} tower {{crossing}} since 1960, is on a raised white <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b> The gilded reredos, a reworking of the 15th-Century rood screen presents {{the figures of}} twelve saints. To {{the left of the}} sanctuary is the long brass plaque listing the rectors of Great Berkhamsted from 1222 to the present day. Brass memorials on the walls commemorate Rev JW Cobb and his wife.|$|E
25|$|At 17:00 on 24 July 1943 the 28 {{members of}} the Grand Council met around a massive U-shaped table in the parrot room (the {{anteroom}} of the globe saloon, the office of Mussolini) in Palazzo Venezia. The Duce’s seat was a high chair, and his table was decorated with a red drape with the fasces. From the ceiling was hanging an enormous wrought iron luster. The walls were decorated with blue velvet tapestries and large paintings, and in the <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> were etched inscriptions with {{the date of the}} restoration, Year VII of the Fascist calendar.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} with any {{certainty}} whether this symbol {{was placed in the}} <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> at Wewelsburg before or during the National Socialist Regime. There remains speculation as to whether the symbol was placed in the hall by the Nazis or whether it was there previously but there is no definitive proof either way. The book sold by the Wewelsburg museum {{on the history of the}} castle from 1933 to 1945 makes no mention of who put it there. The plans for the North Tower by SS architect Hermann Bartels make no mention of it. Scholars today are reluctant to say with any certainty why it was put there, or by whom.|$|E
25|$|Over {{six hundred}} Old Newingtonians enlisted during World War I {{and the loss}} of life was appalling. By war's end, 109 Old Boys had died for God, King and Country. Prior to 1920 the walls of the {{vestibule}} {{at the entrance to the}} Founders Wing had been hung with sporting teams photographs. In 1921 this space was transformed by the installation of white marble tablets, encased in Queensland maple, upon which were inscribed the names of Old Boys who had served. Those who had made the supreme sacrifice are listed on the central panels below the words: These Nobly Strining, Nobly Fell. With a black and white <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> and stained glass door panels this space takes on the feel of a small chapel.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: {{the light from}} the left, the <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b> (A. Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.|$|E

25|$|The bishops {{apartment}} {{consisted of}} two antechambers, bedroom-study and a study. The antechamber adjacent {{to the dining room}} area was once decorated with a plafond depicting the scene of the 1634 treaty ending the Polish-Muscovite War (Treaty of Stuhmsdorf), while its walls were covered with a gilded cordovan. Among the elements of the original furnishing the most important are black marble fireplace topped with the Korab coat of arms and the remnants of <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b> The framework Venetian ceilings, patterned after such in the Palazzo Ducale, appeared in Poland in the early 17th century initially in the interiors of royal residences (Wawel Castle). Such decoration soon become the main feature of the representative chambers of the noble residencies, town halls and even merchant houses. Among a dozen ceilings documented in sources only two preserved - in Gdańsk and Kielce.|$|E
25|$|The house {{underwent}} a major renovation starting in 1999, including {{work on the}} exterior wood, tile, and terra cotta brick, and rebuilding the purple slate roofs. Restoration and preservation brought the house and grounds back to the state {{that they were in}} between 1881 and 1891, when the Clemenses most loved the house. The <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> in the front hallway {{underwent a}} historic restoration, and specialists re-stenciled and painted the walls and ceilings and refinished the woodwork to recover the Tiffany-decorated interiors. Restoration was funded in part by two federal Save America’s Treasures grants totaling $3 million. Scanning computers were also used in the restoration. The home today contains 50,000 artifacts: manuscripts, historic photographs, family furnishings, and Tiffany glass. Many of the original furnishings remain at the house, including the Clemens' ornate Venetian bed, an intricately carved mantel from a Scottish castle, and a billiard table.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of Boldt Castle ceased abruptly in early 1904 {{after the death}} of Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt. Boldt never returned to Heart Island, leaving this structure as a monument of his love. For 73 years, the castle and other stone structures were left exposed to the harsh winter weather and occasional vandals. The Thousand Islands Bridge Authority acquired Heart Island and the nearby yacht house in 1977, for one dollar, under the agreement that all revenues obtained from the castle operation would be applied towards restoration, so that the island would be preserved for the enjoyment of future generations. In the two decades after acquiring the property, the Thousand Islands Bridge Authority spent some $15 million for restoration and improvements here, and work continues annually. The initial goal of the restoration of Heart Island was not to finish what had not been completed, but to restore the island to the state it was in when construction was halted. Improvements have gone beyond that stage, however; a stained glass dome, <b>marble</b> <b>floor,</b> and grand staircase woodwork, for instance, now seen in the main hall, were not original but are modern innovations.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white <b>marble</b> <b>floor,</b> her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A chair with a blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E
500|$|The {{ground floor}} holds the main banking room (the Portland branch of U.S. Bank), and a grand room {{measuring}} [...] with [...] ceilings. [...] The interior is extensively decorated with highly textured materials. Square columns of polished marble topped by Corinthian capitals that incorporate an eagle motif line all four {{sides of the}} main public space. The coffered ceiling is intricately detailed. The <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> is patterned, and the teller windows are divided by Hauteville-marble pillars detailed with bas reliefs. A recessed mezzanine floor runs along {{the north and south}} sides, behind the columns. The bank vaults are in the basement, where the public space also has a <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Argentine {{government}} took elaborate measures to make Perón's tomb secure. The tomb's <b>marble</b> <b>floor</b> has a trapdoor {{that leads to}} a compartment containing two coffins. Under that compartment is a second trapdoor and a second compartment. That is where Perón's coffin rests. Biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write that the claim is often made that her tomb is so secure that it could withstand a nuclear attack. [...] "It reflects a fear", they write, [...] "a fear that the body will disappear from the tomb and that the woman, or rather the myth of the woman, will reappear." ...|$|E

All other floors are wooden parquet, {{with the exception of}} tile in the kitchen. Some of the doors retain their original Gorham knobs. Many of the original artwork and finishes also remain.|$|R
500|$|Ma {{initially}} {{kept the}} Red Guards {{out of the}} museum by organizing his employees as fake Red Guards, and protected the relics by painting Maoist slogans over the display cases. However, {{some of his own}} staff were soon swept by the revolutionary fervour. The extremist faction of the museum workers seized Ma along with other senior officials, and imprisoned him in a storage room for nine months. Trying to coerce the officials into confessing that they were [...] "traitors", the extremists repeatedly lifted them up and dropped them onto the <b>marble</b> <b>floor.</b> Several of Ma's colleagues died. Ma survived the torture, and was sent to a labour camp in Hubei province for five years.|$|E
