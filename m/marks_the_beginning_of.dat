5|$|According to Hermann Weyl, Fischer was an {{important}} influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her {{to the work of}} David Hilbert.

5|$|The Dry Salvages is {{the third}} poem of T. S.

The title comes from the name of a rock formation near a town he spent time at as a child, which reflects Eliot's references to his own past throughout the poem.|$|E

Nevertheless, the Christianisation was a long and arduous process, {{as most of the}} Polish population remained pagan until the Pagan Reaction during the 1030s.|$|E
5|$|David's time as Prince of the Cumbrians and Earl <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> {{his life}} as a great {{territorial}} lord. His earldom probably began in 1113, when Henry I arranged David's marriage to Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon, who was the heiress to the Huntingdon–Northampton lordship. As her husband, David used the title of earl, and there was the prospect that David's children by her would inherit all the honours borne by Matilda's father Waltheof. 1113 is the year when David, for the first time, can be found in possession of territory in what is now Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Different Germanic Neopagan groups {{celebrate}} different festivals {{according to}} their cultural and religious focus. The most widely observed Heathen festivals are Winter Nights, Yule, and Sigrblót, {{all of which were}} listed in his Heimskringla and are thus of ancient origin. The first of these marks the start of winter in Northern Europe, while the second marks Midwinter, and the last <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> summer. Additional festivals are also marked by Heathen practice throughout the year. These often include days which commemorate individuals who fought against the Christianization of Northern Europe, or who led armies and settlers into new lands. Some Heathen groups hold festivals dedicated to a specific deity.|$|E

In February 2003, with 12 volumes released, Konno began to publish more short stories in Cobalt, with illustrations by Hibiki.

5|$|In Saginaw, the two {{parallel}} streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The {{distance between the}} {{two parallel}} streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the connections to the exit3 interchange along {{a bend in the}} I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is not {{provided}} with special organs of respiration such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, a cross-section of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles uncoil, and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; their function having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E

She later grows closer to Chuck Bass (which initially occurred in the series' television adaptation), who she'd previously known for years, which leads them to briefly date one another.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad gained few early {{followers}}, and met hostility {{from some}} Meccans. To escape persecution, Muhammad sent some followers to Abyssinia before {{he and his}} followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622. This event, the Hijra, <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Islamic calendar, {{also known as the}} Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent conflict with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. Before his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.|$|E
5|$|Rudra's {{evolution}} from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (400–200 BC), according to Gavin Flood. Prior to it, the Upanishadic literature is monistic, and the Shvetashvatara text presents the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva {{is identified as}} {{the creator of the}} cosmos and liberator of souls from the birth-rebirth cycle. The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Shaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali's Mahābhāṣya (2nd-century BC) and in the Mahabharata. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.|$|E
