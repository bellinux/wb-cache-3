According to our calculations, Mn 4 Si 7 is an intrinsic semiconductor and a nonmagnetic material, while Mn 11 Si 19 and Mn 15 Si 26 are metals and half-metallic weak ferromagnets, in agreement with recent experimental findings. The role of intrinsic lattice defects, namely vacancies, common for such open crystal structures, is clarified. The vacancies in Mn 4 Si 7 lead to a metallization of the electronic spectrum and to a magnetic state of half-metallic nature. In Mn 11 Si 19 and Mn 15 Si 26 an effect of vacancies is that the average magnetic moment per Mn atom is almost four times larger than that in stoichiometric higher <b>manganese</b> <b>silicides.</b> The origin of this magnetic moment enhancement is explained by the variation of the Mn coordination numbers.

Although the specific parent bodies of IDPs are unknown, the anhydrous chondritic-porous IDPs (CP-IDPs) subset has been potentially linked to a cometary source. The CP-IDPs are extremely primitive materials based on their unequilibrated mineralogy, C-rich chemistry, and anomalous isotopic signatures. In particular, some CP-IDPs escaped the thermal, aqueous and impact shock processing that has modified or destroyed the original mineralogy of meteorites.

In order to achieve insight into epitaxial growth of such films on Si(001), total-energy calculations are presented using density-functional theory and the full-potential augmented plane wave plus local orbital method. For adsorption of a single Mn atom on Si(001), we find that binding at the subsurface sites below the Si surface dimers is ~ 0. 9 eV stronger than on-surface adsorption. There is an energy barrier of only 0. 3 eV for adsorbed Mn to go subsurface, and an energy barrier of 1. 2 eV for the reverse process. From the calculated potential-energy surface for the Mn adatom, we conclude that the most stable site on the surface corresponds to the hollow site where Mn is placed between two Si surface dimers. For on-surface diffusion, both along and perpendicular to the Si dimer rows, the Mn atoms have to overcome energy barriers of 0. 65 eV. For deposition of 0. 5 monolayers (ML) or more, {{we find that the}} Si dimers of the Si(001) surface are broken up, and a mixed MnSi layer becomes the energetically most favorable structure. For coverages above 1 ML, the lowest-energy structure changes to a full Mn subsurface layer, capped by a layer of Si adatoms. We identify this transition with the onset of Mn-silicide formation in an epitaxially stabilized CsCl-like crystal structure. Such MnSi films are found to have sizable magnetic moments at the Mn atoms near the surface and interface, and ferromagnetic coupling of the Mn magnetic moments within the layers.

In this work electron diffraction technique was applied for the fist time to reveal the HMS phase growing in thin MnSi 1. 7 films. The obtained results suggest {{the presence of the}} shortest in c-axis length HMS phase, namely Mn 4 Si 7, within our experiments. It has been shown that growth of epitaxial Mn 4 Si 7 grains can be achieved by the template technique. In particular, the influence of the template thickness on the silicide layer quality has been investigated. It has been found that deposition of a thin Mn layer of 0. 8 nm nominal thickness at room temperature prior to the Mn/Si codeposition at 550 °C causes the formation of a silicide template that leads to the preferred epitaxial Mn 4 Si 7 growth with (110) [4 - 41]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si. Silicide crystallites of two additional orientation relations, (3 - 38) [- 443]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si and (001) [110] Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [110]Si, were present at the same template thickness to a lesser extent. Due to the crystal symmetry of Mn 4 Si 7 and Si the epitaxial Mn 4 Si 7 growth on (001) Si leads to the formation of a number of Mn 4 Si 7 domains for each observed orientation. Additional experiments were carried out using the reactive deposition process. It has been shown that the deposition of Mn onto (001) Si at substrate temperatures higher then 600 °C leads to the formation of large silicide islands growing with the major part of their elongated grains parallel to Si. XRD investigations show the observed silicide grains to exhibit the following texture: (110) Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) Si. The found island morphology of Mn 4 Si 7 films can be modified by the deposition of about one monolayer of Sb (surfactant) onto (001) Si prior to the Mn-deposition. This process results in an increase of the silicide island density by about two orders of magnitude and decrease of the silicide grain dimensions to nanometer range. Furthermore, in the presence of Sb the silicide layers grow with the preferential orientation: (100) [010]Mn 4 Si 7 || (001) [100]Si. The observed changes in the morphology and orientation of the Mn 4 Si 7 layers {{can be explained by the}} reduced diffusion of Mn and Si atoms in the presence of the Sb overlayer.

Bei jeder gefundenen Orientierungsbeziehung treten beim Wachstum von Mn 4 Si 7 auf (001) Si mehrere Domäne auf. Zusätzliche Experimente wurden unter Verwendung der reaktiven Schichtabscheidung durchgeführt. Sie verdeutlichen, dass bei reaktiver Abscheidung von Mn auf (001) Si ab einer Substrattemperatur von 600 °C ein Wachstum von Mn 4 Si 7 -Inseln entlang den [110]-Richtungen des Siliciums erfolgt.

40|$|The {{electronic}} and structural properties of thin epitaxial Mn films on Si(111) -(7 × 7) and their silicide reaction are studied {{by means of}} low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and photoemission spectroscopy (PES). The deposition of Mn at room temperature initially results {{in the growth of}} islands. The metal–silicon reaction already occurs at this temperature, which is further enhanced by annealing up to 400 °C, leading to the formation of <b>manganese</b> <b>silicide</b> and turning islands into nearly closed films at higher coverage. A pseudo-(1 × 1) phase develops for Mn films of up to 1 monolayer (ML) thickness. For films of higher thicknesses of up to 5 ML, a (√(3) ×√(3)) R 30 ° phase is observed. STM images show that then the silicide film is almost closed and exhibits a strain relief network reflecting an incommensurate interface structure. PES reveals that the (1 × 1) phase is semiconducting while the (√(3) ×√(3)) R 30 ° phase is metallic. For both phases, Si 2 p core level photoemission data indicate that the surface is probably terminated by Si atoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{deposition}} of Mn atoms onto the Si(001) -(2 x 1) reconstructed surface {{has been studied}} using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and first-principles electronic structure calculations. Room-temperature {{deposition of}} 0. 1 ML (monolayer) of Mn {{gives rise to a}} disordered surface structure. After in situ annealing between 300 and 700 °C, most of the Mn is incorporated into three-dimensional <b>manganese</b> <b>silicide</b> islands, and Si dimer rows reappear in the STM images on most of the substrate surface. At the same time, rowlike structures are visible in the atomic-scale STM images. A comparison with calculated STM images provides evidence that Mn atoms are incorporated into the row structures in subsurface interstitial sites, which are the lowest-energy position for Mn on Si(001). The subsurface Mn alters the height and local density of states of the Si dimer atoms, causing them to appear 0. 6 Å higher than a neighboring Si dimer with no Mn below. This height difference that allows the detection the subsurface Mn results from a subtle interplay of geometrical and electronic effects...|$|E
40|$|Brownleeite is a <b>manganese</b> <b>silicide,</b> ideally {{stoichiometric}} MnSi, {{not previously}} observed in nature until its discovery within an interplanetary dust particle (IDP) that likely originated from a comet [1]. Three discrete brownleeite grains in the IDP L 2055 I 3 (4 microns in size, hereafter IDP I 3) were identified with maximum dimensions of 100, 250 and 600 nm and fully analyzed using scanning-transmission electron microscopy (STEM) [1]. One of the grains (100 nm in size) was poikilitically enclosed by low-Fe, Mn-enriched (LIME) olivine. LIME olivine is epitaxial to the brownleeite with the brownleeite (200) {{parallel to the}} olivine c* [1]. LIME olivine is an enigmatic phase first reported from chondritic porous IDPs and some unequilibrated ordinary chondrites [2], that is commonly observed in chondritic-porous IDPs. Recently, LIME olivine has been also found in comet Wild- 2 (Stardust) samples [3], indicating that LIME olivine is a common mineral component of comets. LIME olivine has been proposed to form as a high temperature condensate in the protosolar nebula [2]. Brownleeite grains also likely formed as high-temperature condensates either in the early Solar System or in the outflow of an evolved star or supernova explosion [1]. The isotopic composition of the brownleeite grains may strongly constrain their ultimate source. To test this hypothesis, we performed isotopic analyses of the brownleeite and the associated LIME olivine, using the NASA/JSC NanoSIMS 50 L ion microprobe...|$|E
40|$|Silicides have {{attracted}} considerable attention {{for use in}} thermoelectric generators due mainly to low cost, low toxicity and light weight, in contrast to conventional materials such as bismuth and lead telluride. Most reported work has focused on optimizing the materials properties while little {{has been done on}} module testing. In this work we have designed and tested modules based on N-type magnesium silicide Mg 2 (Si–Sn), abbreviated MGS, and P-type Higher <b>Manganese</b> <b>Silicide,</b> abbreviated HMS. The main novelty of our module design is the use of spring loaded contacts on the cold side which mitigate the effect of thermal expansion mismatch between the MGS and the HMS. We report tests carried out on three modules at different temperatures and electric loads. At a hot side temperature of 405 °C we obtained a maximum power of 1. 04 W and at 735 °C we obtained 3. 24 W. The power per thermoelectric material cross section area ranged from 1 to 3 W cm− 2. We used the modeling tool COMSOL to estimate efficiencies at 405 and 735 °C and obtained values of 3. 7 % and 5. 3 % respectively – to our knowledge the highest reported value to date for silicide based modules. Post-test examination showed significant degradation of the N-type (MGS) legs at the higher hot side temperatures. Further work is underway to improve the lifetime and degradation issues...|$|E
40|$|The world {{energy crisis}} had {{increased}} {{the demand for}} alternative energy sources and as such {{is one of the}} topics at the forefront of research. One way for reducing energy consumption is by thermoelectricity. Thermoelectric effects enable direct conversion of thermal into electrical energy. Higher <b>manganese</b> <b>silicide</b> (HMS, MnSi 1. 75) is one of the promising materials for applications in the field of thermoelectricity. The abundance and low cost of the elements, combined with good thermoelectric properties and high mechanical and chemical stability at high temperatures, make it very attractive for thermoelectric applications. Recent studies have shown that Si-rich HMS has improved thermoelectric properties. The most interesting of which is the unusual reduction in thermal conductivity. In the current research, transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction methods were applied for investigation of the govern mechanisms resulting in very low thermal conductivity values of an Si-rich HMS composition, following arc melting and hot-pressing procedures. In this paper, it is shown that there is a presence of sub-micron dislocations walls, stacking faults, and silicon and HMS precipitates inside each other apparent in the matrix, following a high temperature (0. 9 [*]Tm) hot pressing for an hour. These are not just responsible for the low thermal conductivity values observed but also indicate the ability to create complicate nano-structures that will last during the production process and possibly during the application...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this project is the so called Edelstein effect. This {{recently}} discovered effect consists {{in the possibility of}} converting an electric field (a current) into a magnetization in materials that fulfill specific characteristics, more specifically materials where an effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling is present. The Edelstein effect is appealing to the scientific community from the fundamental physics point of view {{as well as from the}} technological point of view. In fact the possibility of efficiently converting an electric signal into a magnetic signal could revolutionize the current information storage technology. In this project, after a study of basic concepts of solid state physics: crystal structure, Bloch's theorem, spin-orbit coupling; we addressed the study of the basics of a powerful numerical tool, called density functional theory (DFT), for predicting the electronic properties of solids. This tool provides us with all the needed quantities for numerically calculating any kind of linear response, which we show that the Edelstein effect is a specific form of. Using a specific implementation of DFT, called augmented spherical wave (ASW), we calculate the Edelstein effect in iron and copper (where no effect is expected) and <b>manganese</b> <b>silicide</b> (where the effect is expected to appear). We also perform a systematic study on how the Edelstein effect depends on the symmetry of the material and the magnitude of the spin-orbit coupling. The calculations showed promising results from which we concluded that the numerical methods used could clearly distinguish between the presence of the Edelstein effect or not in mentioned materials...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{efficiency}} of thermoelectric (TE) materials {{is determined by}} the dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) defined as ZT = S 2 σT/κ where, S, σ, κ, and T are Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and absolute temperature, respectively. For weight-sensitive applications the specific figure of merit defined as ZT divided by mass density, should be emphasized. Since Mg 2 Si for n-type and higher <b>manganese</b> <b>silicide</b> (HMS, MnSi 2 -x, x= 0. 250 ~ 0. 273) for p-type TE alloys have low mass densities, they produce a TE module with a high specific power suitable for airborne applications. To improve ZT by reducing lattice thermal conductivity, nanostructures are formed by mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering techniques. Two TE module designs are made, (1) a segmented π-shape TE module and (2) a segmented linear TE module. The segmented π-shaped TE generator (TEG) is composed of higher temperature segments made of n-type Mg 2 Si and p-type HMS and lower temperature segments of n-type and p-type Bi-Te based compounds. The specific power density was measured as 42. 9 [W/kg] under 500 °C temperature difference, which has a good agreement with analytical predictions. The linear-shaped TEG is composed of AlN-Cu composite electrode integrated into the combustion chamber wall made of Fe based shape memory alloy (Fe-SMA) by shrink-fit joining. The power output of the linear TEG is found to be 7 % higher than that of the π-shaped TEG, and the specific power density is increased from 42. 9 [W/kg] to 89. 3 [W/kg] due to lighter weight of the linear design. The maximum shear stress of the linear TEG is reduced by 47 % compared with the π-shaped TEG. As a result, the linear TEG proposed gives rise to better performance in terms of the specific power density, while it is more robust...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis concerns experimental studies of thin <b>manganese</b> <b>silicide</b> and germanide layers, grown by solid phase epitaxy on the Si(111) 7 × 7 and the Ge(111) c(2 × 8) surfaces, respectively. The atomic and electronic structures, as well as growth modes of the epitaxial Mn-Si and Mn-Ge layers, were investigated by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES), core-level spectroscopy (CLS), and scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS). The magnetic properties of the Mn-Ge films were investigated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The Mn-Si layers, annealed at 400 °C, showed a √ 3 ×√ 3 LEED pattern, consistent {{with the formation of}} the stoichiometric monosilicide MnSi. Up to 4 monolayers (ML) of Mn coverage, island formation was observed. For higher Mn coverages, uniform film growth was found. Our results concerning morphology and the atomic and electronic structure of the Mn/Si(111) -√ 3 ×√ 3 surface, are in good agreement with a recent theoretical model for a layered MnSi structure and the √ 3 ×√ 3 surface structure. Similar to the Mn-Si case, the grown Mn-Ge films, annealed at 330 °C and 450 °C, showed a √ 3 ×√ 3 LEED pattern. This indicated the formation of the ordered Mn 5 Ge 3 germanide. A strong tendency to island formation was observed for the Mn 5 Ge 3 films, and a Mn coverage of about 32 ML was needed to obtain a continuous film. Our STM and CLS results are in good agreement with the established model for the bulk Mn 5 Ge 3 germanide, with a surface termination of Mn atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Mn-Ge films grown at a lower annealing temperature, 260 °C, showed a continuous film at lower coverages, with a film structure that is different compared to the structure of the Mn 5 Ge 3 film. XMCD studies showed that the low-temperature films are ferromagnetic for 16 ML Mn coverage and above, with a Curie temperature of ~ 250 K...|$|E
