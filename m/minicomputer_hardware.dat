50|$|By 1977, Atex had {{successfully}} connected {{reporters and editors}} via a paper-free system that allowed working on-screen instead of on typewriters. The system had a terminal-and-server paradigm, using modified DEC PDP-11 <b>minicomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> running a custom Atex multi-user operating system. Terminals {{were little more than}} keyboards, with the servers directly generating video signals for each terminal. The memory-mapped screen images were monochrome and not high resolution, but they could scroll quickly and fluidly without the constraints imposed by conventional serial data connections, which at the time were not very fast. The servers were paired for redundancy; each story saved to disk was written to two separate systems. The systems talked to each other across a high speed intersystem bus, making a set of up to 15 servers seem to their users to be one big system. A built-in messaging system provided email-like functionality among system users, greatly aiding collaboration. Wire stories were funneled into the system electronically rather than having to be re-keyboarded from teletype printouts. The workflow advantages of the system proved popular with staff and management of newspapers and large magazine publishers. The proprietary keyboards included a number of innovations which greatly facilitated text entry and editing.|$|E

50|$|Several notable technical, economic, and {{political}} attributes characterize minisupercomputers. First, they were architecturally more diverse than prior mainframes and <b>minicomputers</b> in <b>hardware</b> and less diverse in software. Second, advances in VLSI made them less expensive (mini-price). These machines were market targeted to be cost-effective and quickly manufactured. Third, it is notable {{who did not}} manufacture minisupercomputers: within the USA, IBM and the traditional mainframe makers, outside the USA: the Japanese supercomputer vendors and Russia (despite attempts to manufacture minicomputers).|$|R

This paper documents the installation of his equipment in two buildings, one using dedicated wire and the other power-line carrier communications. The systems provide dynamically optimized equipment performance based on actual and predicted energy loads, using stand-alone microcomputers that can communicate via telephone with a desktop <b>minicomputer.</b> This <b>hardware,</b> in combination with customized software, monitors documents cost savings and encourages good, overall facility maintenance practices, Although the buildings in which the systems were installed are nonindustrial, the EMS hardware and control strategies as related are directly applicable to industrial facilities...|$|R

Utilities function tasks which can benefit from ADP support are described. Results of a survey questionnaire sent to all sizable Public Works Departments are analyzed and Public Works Department utilities function existing ADP support and additional support requirements are profiled. Alternative sources for Public Works Department utilities ADP support are reviewed {{in light of the}} survey results. These alternatives are; Base Engineering Support, Technical (BEST) Program for software development to be used by large computer installations for Public Works Department utilities support, BEST Program for acquisition of <b>minicomputer</b> <b>hardware</b> and development of software support, Navy Regional Data ADP Center (NARDAC) batch processed and timeshare support, Shipboard Non-tactical ADP Program (SNAP) support and commercial timeshare service support. Recommendations are made for target Public Works Department criteria, utilities function support system ADP requirements and further study of ADP support sources. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|Configurations and Software: A Tutorial This paper, {{together}} with the preceding paper by Divilbiss, is intended to provide a background for the characteristics of minicomputers {{and the ways in}} which they can be configured to tackle library problems. As part of the discussion of minicomputer features, an attempt is made to compare and contrast them with larger, general purpose computers. An acquaintance with basic computer concepts is assumed. Concepts of a more technical nature are explained as they are introduced. The first section below discusses configurations; the second section covers <b>minicomputer</b> software. <b>Hardware</b> and architectural features are covered in the paper by Divilbiss. MINICOMPUTER CONFIGURATIONS Minicomputers and their associated peripheral devices can be combined in a great variety of ways, but this variety can be categorized into four basic configuration types: (1) stand-alone batch, (2) stand-alone on-line, (3) front end, and (4) remote concentrator. The first type, stand-alone batch, is the most familiar (see figure 1). In this configuration, the mini looks like and performs like larger batch computers. In most cases the mini will have a card reader and punch, a line printer, tape drives and disks. (The minis in all four configuration types will have operator consoles, but to avoid cluttering the figures, the consoles have been omitted.) The term stand-alone is part of the name of this configuration in order to stress the fact that the mini is not connected to a larger computer. The mini stands alone. The main use of the stand-alone batch configuration is the generation of printed products, e. g., serials lists, purchase orders, circulation lists and overdue notices. This configuration could also be used fo...|$|R
40|$|A computer-managed {{instructional}} (CMI) {{system is}} being developed for use in investigating a CMI environment for Air Force technical training using the PDP 11 / 20 <b>minicomputer.</b> Software and <b>hardware</b> interfaces are now available for 24 k core memory with an additional 128 k random access disc storage. Hardware interfaces are complete for the student key-readers, an interactive graphic terminal, a test form reader and a computer-controlled slide projector. The CMI system also uses the manufacturer's hardware such as the cathode ray tube terminal, card printer and line printer. Key reader devices, capable of reading data from a coded key, identify the user and his location to the system and monitor the use of instructional materials and media not controlled by the computer. Computer software to operate the,hardware is ready, {{and a series of}} short lessons is available which demonstrate how an instructional course can be managed using a sample adaptive model with pre-tests, lesson options based on student characteristics, course tests and feedback for students and instructors.
