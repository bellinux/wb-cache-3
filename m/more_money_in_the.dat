5|$|In April 2006, Ofotbanen {{declared}} {{that they were}} in severe financial difficulties. Accounts payable were giving liquidity problems, and Ofotbanen announced that they needed more capital, estimated at NOK 8 million. GB Group said they were not willing to invest <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> railway company. Ofotbanen had then been losing money continually since the start-up in 2001; in 2004, it had a deficit of NOK 4 million of a NOK 20 million revenue. At the extraordinary general meeting on 4 September 2006, the company was sold for NOK 1 million to Rail Management, a holding company for the London-based shipping owner Mons Bolin. In November, the Norwegian Rail Inspectorate threatened to withdraw the company's safety license, since they had failed to show proper maintenance of the rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The film grossed an {{estimated}} $4.7million {{on the first}} day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3million over the weekend, finishing in third place. Outside North America it earned $35.2million finishing second, and improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9million. China has proven to be its most successful territory where it earned $11.6million on its opening day, going on to earn a record-breaking $67million in its opening week and taking <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run. The reissue ultimately earned $343.4million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8million from Canada and United States.|$|E
5|$|At {{the battle}} of Naseby on 14 June 1645, Rupert's {{horsemen}} again mounted a successful charge against the flank of Parliament's New Model Army, but Charles's troops elsewhere on the field were pushed back by the opposing forces. Charles, attempting to rally his men, rode forward but as he did so, Lord Carnwath seized his bridle and pulled him back, fearing for the king's safety. Carnwath's action was misinterpreted by the royalist soldiers as a signal to move back, leading to a collapse of their position. The military balance tipped decisively in favour of Parliament. There followed a series of defeats for the royalists, and then the Siege of Oxford, from which Charles escaped (disguised as a servant) in April 1646. He put himself {{into the hands of}} the Scottish Presbyterian army besieging Newark, and was taken northwards to Newcastle upon Tyne. After nine months of negotiations, the Scots finally arrived at an agreement with the English Parliament: in exchange for £100,000, and the promise of <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, the Scots withdrew from Newcastle and delivered Charles to the parliamentary commissioners in January 1647.|$|E

25|$|Often, {{instead of}} declaring insolvency, the company negotiates a debt {{restructuring}} with its lenders. The financial restructuring might entail that the equity owners inject some <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{company and the}} lenders waive parts of their claims. In other situations, the lenders inject new money and assume the equity of the company, with the present equity owners losing their shares and investment. The operations of the company are not affected by the financial restructuring. Nonetheless, the financial restructuring requires significant management attention and may lead to customers losing faith in the company.|$|E

Lennon and McCartney thought they would own the whole company, but were given a 20 percent share each, Epstein 10 percent, and James and his partner, Charles Silver, 50 percent. Another company, Maclen Music—which published Lennon and McCartney's music in the US—was also controlled by Northern Songs. Both Northern Songs and Maclen Music were administered by Dick James Music. Northern Songs also published Harrison's early compositions, as well as Starr's.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom's {{struggle}} with France during the Napoleonic wars required the British Army to expand rapidly. Ordinary recruiting methods failed {{to supply the}} number of men required to fill the Army ranks. The main methods used for recruiting were: private individuals were recruited for their own interests, volunteers from the militia and placing obligations on communities to enlist. Generals called for conscription {{for the first time in}} British History, although this was never enacted for the regular army. During this period, Great Britain was at a disadvantage to her enemy, as due to the Industrial Revolution potential recruits were instead drawn to the cities to earn <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> many factories now being built in the country, while France was still largely an agrarian society.|$|E
25|$|But on August 8, {{the state}} of Virginia {{abandoned}} its plans and agreed to begin work on the northern route for Lee Boulevard. For nearly a year, state and county officials had disagreed whether the northern route rights-of-way were adequate to begin construction. The state disagreed, but Arlington County officials {{did not wish to}} spend <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depths of the Great Depression to acquire more rights-of-way. By actively reconsidering the southern route, however, {{the state of}} Virginia put pressure on Arlington County to fix the rights-of-way problems with the northern route. Agreement to begin construction on the northern route finally was reached on August 8. The state of Virginia agreed to provide $83,450 to purchase the remaining required rights-of-way. Arlington County provided another $21,122.|$|E
500|$|Word that Lakes had {{notified}} Cope of his finds galvanized Marsh into action. When Marsh {{heard from}} Union Pacific Railroad workers W.E. Carlin and W.H. Reed about a vast boneyard northwest of Laramie in Como Bluff, Marsh sent his agent, Samuel Wendell Williston, {{to take charge}} of the digging. Cope, in response, learned of Carlin and Reed's discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in the area. The two scientists attempted to sabotage each other's progress. Cope was described as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence, he easily made up for in connections—Marsh's uncle was George Peabody, a rich banker who supported Marsh with money, and a secure position at the Peabody Museum. Marsh lobbied John Wesley Powell to act against Cope and attempted to persuade Hayden to [...] "muzzle" [...] Cope's publishing. Both men tried to spy on the other's whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hopes of recruiting them to their own side. Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh. Cope and Marsh were extremely secretive as to the source of their fossils. When Henry Fairfield Osborn, at the time a student at Princeton, visited Cope to ask where to travel to look for fossils in the West, Cope politely refused to answer.|$|E

2500|$|The first diesel buses on the Papanui route were {{introduced}} on 10 September 1951 {{as a temporary}} measure when work commenced on re-laying the top end of the Papanui tramline, ironically {{with the intention of}} keeping the Papanui–Cashmere tram service running.

2500|$|Metro Toronto greatly {{expanded}} {{the ability to}} finance capital works projects and Gardiner followed three principles in the allocation of money. Gardiner chose under his chairmanship to negotiate {{the amount of money}} to go to local municipalities, but did not interfere in the actual ways the local municipalities spent the money. He also pursued a policy of balance between the city and the suburbs. He pushed for the Bloor-Danforth subway, located mostly in the City, but he also pushed for a uniform water rate, a policy that favoured the suburbs. His third principle was to limit demand. While in 1953, he claimed that [...] "there was nothing we could not afford", in 1954, he cautioned against the belief that [...] "Metro has <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aggregate than we all had individually." [...] Later in his term, Gardiner named $100 million as the upper limit of annual capital borrowing. He held onto the total figure [...] "it was a nice round number" [...] until 1961, when he agreed to a five per-cent increase.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s, Houston-based {{surgeons}} such as Michael E. DeBakey and Denton Cooley were pioneering new {{heart surgery}} techniques, attracting a high volume of medical residents {{who wished to}} study under their tutelage. Realizing that the city would soon be awash with cardiac surgeons, Hill looked at alternative surgical careers, eventually opting for plastic surgery. At the time, only ten certified plastic surgeons were practicing in Houston, and Hill believed he could make <b>more</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> profession. He was a popular member of the residency program, but almost had his medical career cut short after perforating a patient's bowel during a routine operation, then stitching the man up without repairing the damage. The patient later died of peritonitis, and Hill received a severe reprimand after an autopsy uncovered his mistake. Upon completing his residency, Hill was offered a partnership by Nathan Roth, a New York City-trained surgeon who had established himself in Houston, and he joined the practice in 1963. Hill's partnership with Roth {{got off to a}} difficult start after he failed to warn his first patient that a drill bit had broken off during a jaw repair operation, leaving it embedded in the patient's face. When challenged by Roth, Hill was apologetic about his error, saying he had been [...] "hesitant to mention this mistake on my very first case". Hill's brother, Julian, had committed suicide shortly before the incident, and Roth gave Hill {{the benefit of the doubt}} because of this. The partnership between Hill and Roth was dissolved in 1967 after Roth grew tired of the other surgeon's repeated requests that Roth cover for him so that he could give music recitals. Hill then established his own practice in the same building as his former business partner.|$|E
