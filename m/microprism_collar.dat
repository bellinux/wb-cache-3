5000|$|... <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> and 12 mm-diameter {{reference}} circle (indicates center-weighted metering area).|$|E
50|$|The CE-5 {{was shipped}} {{with a full}} ground glass screen along with a split image range finder and a <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> to aid focusing. Other screens were made available.|$|E
5000|$|Type P - Type L, {{but adds}} 1 mm <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> and fullscreen crosshair. Originally marketed as the [...] "Apollo P screen," [...] {{it was a}} screen favored by NASA on the bodies they {{acquired}} for their use.|$|E
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} {{also had}} a fixed focusing screen with Asahi Optical's standard split image rangefinder and <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> manual focusing aids. The split image rangefinder was a good indication of {{the width of the}} AF sensor field of view.|$|E
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} screen has a {{split image}} rangefinder center, {{surrounded by a}} <b>microprism</b> <b>collar,</b> whereas the Auto 110 had the split image rangefinder center only. The low light warning activates at 1/800 s (the Auto 110 activates at 1/30 s).|$|E
5000|$|Focusing screens: the {{standard}} focusing screen, ground-glass with split-image and <b>microprism</b> <b>collar,</b> {{can be replaced}} by any of five other screens for specialised tasks. For the Digital Modul R, an additional set of six screens marked with the Modul R's sensor crop area can be substituted.|$|E
5000|$|The FM has a [...] "full information" [...] viewfinder. In {{addition}} to the metering LEDs; the viewfinder also displays the set shutter speed and lens aperture to give context to the LEDs. A fixed K-type focus screen with 3 mm split-image rangefinder and 1 mm <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> is fitted.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Manual" [...] mode metered in {{the central}} <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> area only (roughly 2% of the field) - giving the spot {{metering}} in the camera's model name. Information on the spot metered value was provided on an LCD bar-graph version of the older match-needle system used on the OM2n MD. Both shutter speed and aperture were under the photographer's control.|$|E
50|$|The AE-1 was a {{battery-powered}} (one 4 LR44 or 4 SR44) microprocessor-controlled manual focus SLR. It supported either {{manual exposure}} control or shutter priority auto exposure. The exposure control system {{consisted of a}} needle pointing along a vertical f-stop scale {{on the right side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in light meter (center-weighted with a silicon photocell). The viewfinder used by the AE-1 was Canon’s standard split image rangefinder with <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing aids.|$|E
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} {{also has}} a focusing screen with a microprism spot focusing aid. The Pentax K1000 SE substitutes a split image rangefinder plus <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing screen. The K1000 SE is otherwise identical to the regular K1000, except that the SE's from {{the first two years}} of production in late 1977 to 1978 used a Black Diamond patterned leatherette (Pre 780XXX serial number) for approximately 2500 units and then a brown leather instead of black after that on the later early SE models.|$|E
50|$|The F2 {{also had}} {{interchangeable}} viewfinder focusing screens. Nippon Kogaku's standard Type K screen had central 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing aids on a matte/Fresnel background plus a 12 mm etched circle indicating {{the area of}} the meter centerweighting. There were 18 other screens available with a variety of focusing aids or etched guidelines choices, including none at all. Note that the screens for the F2 were interchangeable with the ones for the Nikon F, but not with later F-series SLRs.|$|E
50|$|The FM10 is a {{mechanically}} (springs, gears, levers) controlled manual focus SLR with {{manual exposure}} control. It is operable without batteries, which are only required (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) {{for the light}} metering information system. This consists of an internal 60/40 percent centerweighted, silicon photodiode light meter linked to a center-the-LED exposure control system using vertically arranged +/•/- light emitting diodes (LEDs) {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the meter versus the actual camera settings. The focusing screen also has 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing aids. Overall, the FM10 has the features of a typical late 1970s SLR.|$|E
5000|$|The FE has a [...] "full information" [...] {{viewfinder}} {{very similar}} to the Nikkormat EL. In addition to the metering shutter scale, the viewfinder also displays the set lens aperture through an optical [...] "eye" [...] (this particular feature missing on the Nikkormat EL) and has a flash [...] "ready" [...] LED to give context to the metering needles. The viewfinder also introduced interchangeable focusing screens to the compact F-series: the standard Nikon Type K screen (3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing aids plus 12 mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting) could be replaced by Type B (central 3 mm focusing spot plus 12 mm etched circle) and Type E (Type B plus a grid of five horizontal and three vertical lines; called the [...] "architectural screen") screens.|$|E
5000|$|The Nikkormat FT2, {{manufactured}} from 1975 to 1977, added a {{permanently affixed}} hot shoe {{to the top}} of the pentaprism cover, combined the two PC terminals into one and switched the light meter battery to a non-toxic silver cell, one 1.5 V S76 or SR44. ASA adjustment also featured a lock and an easier slider than previous models. The advance lever was more contoured with an added plastic grip. The FT2's viewfinder also switched to Nippon Kogaku's new standard Type K focusing screen with 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing aids plus 12 mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting. A final small touch was the addition of [...] "+" [...] and [...] "-" [...] symbols on the display of the top meter read-out. The numerous little improvements on the FT2 directly reflected customer suggestions for the FTn.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon EM {{formed the}} base of the new line. It was the {{smallest}} and cheapest SLR ever made by Nippon Kogaku. It was a battery-powered (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) electromechanically controlled manual focus SLR. The EM featured a lightweight and compact hybrid copper aluminum alloy body and fiberglass reinforced polycarbonate plastic top and bottom covers, plus aperture priority semiautomatic exposure control governed by a built-in 60/40 percent centerweighted, silicon photodiode light meter. A left side viewfinder galvanometer needle pointer indicated the exposure on a shutter speed scale. The viewfinder also had Nikon’s standard 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing aids, but the focus screen was fixed. The viewfinder is dimmer than those in the semi-professional Nikons since the expensive prisms of the latter were not used. The camera is also fitted with a low-light exposure warning {{in the form of an}} audible 'beep'.|$|E
5000|$|The A-1 is a {{battery-powered}} (one 4LR44 or PX-28) microprocessor-controlled manual-focus SLR with {{manual exposure}} control or shutter priority, aperture priority or programmed autoexposure. A fifth mode is [...] "stopped down AE", {{in which the}} aperture is closed and alterable by the photographer and the camera selects the shutter speed based on the actual light reading. This differs from aperture priority in which the aperture is not closed until a photograph is taken and the shutter speed {{is calculated based on}} the light measured through the fully open aperture. Stopped down AE existed so that old FL lenses could be used with at least some kind of AE. The A-1 is the first SLR to have all four of the now standard PASM exposure modes. It has a viewfinder exposure information system using a six-digit, seven-segment per digit, red alphanumeric LED display {{on the bottom of the}} viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in centerweighted, silicon photocell light meter. The focusing screen also has Canon's standard split image rangefinder and <b>microprism</b> <b>collar</b> focusing help.|$|E
