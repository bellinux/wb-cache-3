50|$|<b>Methylpentynol</b> (Methylparafynol, Dormison, Atemorin, Oblivon) is a {{tertiary}} hexanol with hypnotic/sedative and anticonvulsant {{effects and}} an exceptionally low therapeutic index. It {{was discovered by}} Bayer in 1913 and was used shortly thereafter {{for the treatment of}} insomnia, but its use was quickly phased out in response to newer drugs with far more favorable safety profiles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{drug was}} marketed {{again in the}} United States, Europe and {{elsewhere}} from 1956 well into the 1960s as a rapid-acting sedative; it was overshadowed at that point by benzodiazepines and the continued popularity of non-barbiturate sedatives such as meprobamate. [...] As of 2017, <b>Methylpentynol</b> has no accepted medical uses in any developed (first world country).|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} <b>methylpentynol</b> and <b>methylpentynol</b> {{carbamate}} on the perfused superior cervical ganglion {{of the cat}} was analysed. Both drugs, in doses of 1 to 5 mg., depressed the output of acetylcholine. If the acetylcholine output was reduced by more than about 50 %, transmission failed. Both drugs also reduced {{the response of the}} ganglion to injected acetylcholine. The carbamate, but not <b>methylpentynol</b> itself, had a transient stimulant action on the ganglion, unaccompanied by acetylcholine release...|$|E
40|$|Administration of <b>methylpentynol</b> {{to human}} {{subjects}} depressed their autonomic reactions to a difficult motor task and impaired their performance. Hexobarbitone affected neither autonomic reactions nor performance, though it impaired hand steadiness. The {{results suggest that}} the modes of action of <b>methylpentynol</b> and of hexobarbitone are different...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the estimation of}} <b>methylpentynol</b> and <b>methylpentynol</b> carbamate in body fluids and tissues. After intravenous administration, the distribution of these drugs throughout the body {{was found to be}} similar to that of ethanol. They entered cells, and crossed the blood-brain barrier and the placenta. They were excreted or secreted into the saliva, milk, gastric secretion, aqueous and vitreous humour, amniotic liquor, bile and urine. <b>Methylpentynol</b> was found in the expired air. Calculation of the volume of distribution and measurement of concentration in the tissues showed that both drugs were only slowly metabolized or excreted, suggesting the possibility that blood concentrations might rise cumulatively over a period of days...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methylpentynol,</b> paraldehyde, amylobarbitone and {{procainamide}} blocked transmission {{through the}} cat superior cervical ganglion, and antagonized the ganglion-stimulating actions of acetylcholine and carbachol injected intra-arterially to the ganglion. Comparison {{with the effects}} of tetraethylammonium indicated that the impaired response to acetylcholine could not wholly account for the failure of transmission, which suggested that an impaired release of transmitter substance was a contributory factor. <b>Methylpentynol,</b> paraldehyde and procainamide also blocked the ganglion-stimulating action of potassium chloride. In contrast, amylobarbitone and pentobarbitone did not block the stimulating action of potassium chloride, but antagonized specifically the actions of acetylcholine and carbachol. The anti-acetylcholine activities of the two barbiturate drugs at this site accord with their relative ganglion-blocking activities. It is concluded that the ganglion-blocking action of <b>methylpentynol,</b> paraldehyde and procainamide arises from a nonspecific depression of both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements in the ganglion, but that barbiturate compounds act more specifically on the acetylcholine receptor...|$|E
40|$|Several central {{depressant}} {{and other}} drugs have been examined for their effects upon acetylcholine release from the stimulated, perfused cat superior cervical ganglion and rat isolated phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. The acetylcholine released was assayed biologically. Amylobarbitone sodium, chloral hydrate, trichloroethanol, <b>methylpentynol,</b> <b>methylpentynol</b> carbamate, paraldehyde, procaine hydrochloride and troxidone reduced the presynaptic release of acetylcholine from the ganglion. They also exhibited a postsynaptic blocking action, this component of depressant activity being particularly prominent with paraldehyde and troxidone. Closely analogous findings were obtained at the neuromuscular junction with <b>methylpentynol</b> and its carbamate, paraldehyde, procaine hydrochloride, trichloroethanol and troxidone. At both sites the drug-induced depression, both of transmission and of acetylcholine output, was reversible. Whereas hexamethonium regularly blocked ganglionic transmission with no effect upon acetylcholine release, tetraethylammonium not only completely blocked ganglionic transmission but concomitantly augmented acetylcholine output. These results are discussed {{in relation to the}} electrophysiological and metabolic events associated with neuro-effector transmission...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{through the}} cat {{superior}} cervical ganglion was studied by recording {{the response of}} the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity) : amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, carbromal, benactyzine, mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, azacyclonol, <b>methylpentynol</b> carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, mephenesin, chlorbutol, troxidone, <b>methylpentynol</b> and barbitone. All were weaker ganglion-blocking agents than tetraethylammonium. The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, bemegride, amiphenazole and 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -enyl) - 5 -ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or bemegride did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone. The intra-arterial injection of pecazine and perphenazine, and the intravenous injection of barbitone, benactyzine, azacyclonol, hydroxyzine, mephenesin, <b>methylpentynol</b> and paraldehyde impaired {{the response of the}} nictitating membrane to both post- and preganglionic stimulation. The implications of these observations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacology}} of <b>methylpentynol</b> and <b>methylpentynol</b> carbamate {{has been}} studied. The drugs depressed monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes, and exerted weak ganglion and neuromuscular blocking actions. They also produced transitory hypotension, and increase of aortic blood flow. Perfusion of the coronary arteries with these drugs led to slowing of the heart, diminished systolic amplitude, dysrhythmias, and increased coronary flow. Respiration was stimulated with small and depressed with larger doses of both drugs. The two compounds diminished {{the response of}} the isolated guinea-pig ileum to drugs acting directly on muscle or through ganglia. The effect of the two substances was likened to that of other central nervous system depressants, particularly to that of ethanol...|$|E
40|$|Paraldehyde and <b>methylpentynol</b> blocked {{transmission}} of nerve impulses through the superior cervical ganglion {{of the cat}} when the drugs were administered intra-arterially to the ganglion or intravenously using the nictitating membrane as an indicator. Electrical studies showed that concentrations of <b>methylpentynol</b> and paraldehyde which blocked transmission in the isolated rat superior cervical ganglion were without action on the preganglionic nerve fibre. In amounts which blocked transmission in the isolated rat ganglion, paraldehyde had no depolarizing activity directly on the ganglion cells and did {{not interfere with the}} depolarizing activity of added acetylcholine. The results suggest that the block in {{transmission of}} the impulse could be accounted for by a decrease in the release of acetylcholine from the preganglionic nerve terminals. In both species the block was reversible...|$|E
40|$|By {{comparing}} {{the effects on}} ganglionic transmission and on the pre- and post-ganglionic nerves in the isolated superior cervical ganglion preparation of the rat, the selectivity of several drugs was assessed quantitatively. Hexamethonium, tetraethylammonium, nicotine and tubocurarine blocked transmission in concentrations which did not affect nervous conduction and {{were considered to be}} highly selective in action. Atropine, amylobarbitone and paraldehyde depressed nervous conduction appreciably in ganglion-blocking doses, but not enough to account wholly for the block in transmission and they were therefore considered as being moderately selective. The ganglion blocking actions of mephenesin, procaine, <b>methylpentynol,</b> <b>methylpentynol</b> carbamate and benactyzine were nonspecific, showing general depression of neuronal activity. Ganglion block with bretylium was nonselective in its site of depression of the postganglionic neurone in concentrations which only partly depressed the preganglionic nerve...|$|E

Fish handled but not anesthetized, and control fish which were neither anesthetized nor handled did not exhibit similar changes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} some centrally-active {{and other drugs}} on the {{transmission}} of single nerve impulses through the isolated superior cervical ganglion preparation of the rabbit has been studied by recording both preganglionic and postganglionic action potentials. Block of conduction in the axon could be distinguished from block of the synaptic mechanism. The drugs {{did not appear to}} exert any one characteristic form of blocking action. A continuous spectrum of drug action linked an agent such as meprobamate which acted predominantly on the synapse to benactyzine which acted mainly by blocking axonal conduction. The drugs have been divided into three groups. Group I: hexamethonium, meprobamate, paraldehyde, amylobarbitone, <b>methylpentynol</b> and azacyclonal; these acted relatively selectively at the ganglion. Group II: N 714 C (the cis-isomer of chlorprothixene), prochlorperazine, <b>methylpentynol</b> carbamate, pipradrol, promethazine, perphenazine and procaine; the action of these drugs on the ganglion could be accounted for entirely in terms of their axonal depressant action. Group III: chlorprothixene, promazine, N 720 (dihydrochlorprothixene), chlorpromazine, hydroxyzine and benactyzine; these drugs also blocked axonal conduction but in addition they appeared to exert a “facilitating” action at the ganglionic synapse. The actions of adrenaline, adrenochrome, iproniazid, ergotoxine, mescaline and lysergic acid diethylamide on transmission were also studied. The implications of the modifications of ganglionic transmission produced by these drugs is discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Methylpentynol</b> (" oblivon "), {{one of the}} vinyl-ethynl carbinols, was {{introduced}} into therapeutics by Margolin, Perlman, Villani, and McGavack (1951). Sears (1956) describes it as an important sedative producing mental relaxation and diminu-tion of anxiety. The interest of the substance resides {{in the fact that}} not only is it an alcohol used thera-peutically, but it is said to behave dissimilarly to the lower alcohols in that it is rapidly metabolized and is not cumulative in effect (Perlman and Johnson, 1952). The clinical evidence presented here argues against this and accumulation in animals has now been demonstrated by Marley and Vane (1958). Preliminary investigations suggested that methyl-pentynol was less noxious than the barbiturates, a supposition modified by Goodman and Gilman (1955) who considered it more potent for man than for animals. Even so, early reports were unanimous in emphasizing the drug's paucity of toxic complica...|$|E
