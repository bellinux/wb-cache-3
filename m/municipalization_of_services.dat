The 99 lines (or sections) explicitly identified in the proclamation included new lines, and the purchase of the network of the Wiener Tramwaygesellschaft, the employees of which were to be taken on as far as possible by the city. The lines were integrated into the Gemeinde Wien - Städtische Straßenbahnen service, which was entered on 4 April 1902 into the company register.

40|$|The <b>municipalization</b> <b>of</b> basic social <b>service</b> {{delivery}} in Brazil provides significant incentives for local public officials {{to have a}} better understanding of their constituents’ needs and requirements both to govern and for political purposes. The broadening of participatory venues under the 1988 Constitution allowed for the establishment of a broad number of public venues that civil society leaders could use to represent their associations. Government officials and civil society leaders have constant contact with each other as each seek to promote polices that advance their narrow and broader concerns. This article focuses on the establishment of three governing principles of five successive governments in Belo Horizonte: Social justice, popular participation, and interlocking institutions. The government and its allies in civil society redesigned citizen access points into the state as means to clarifying the signals sent from citizens to government officials, to allow civil society organization (CSO) leaders to act as intermediaries between citizens and public officials and to allow government officials’ to tap into CSO leaders and citizens’ attitudes on a wide range of pressing political issues. These interlocking venues are a key moment of interest mediation, which partially accounts for how Belo Horizonte produces robust social policy change in a context of a highly fragmented party system. Participatory governance is now the key mechanism that allows for constant dialogue among citizens and government officials. This article is part of a larger research project seeking to understand how and why the local Brazilian state was restructured in the 1990 s, how citizens are incorporated into state-sanctioned governance bodies, and importantly, how the new institutional environment has helped to transform state-society relations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>municipalization</b> <b>of</b> {{the water}} <b>service</b> in Los Angeles, in 1902, {{was the result}} of a (mostly implicit) {{compromise}} between the political, social and economic elites of the city: the economic elite (the « oligarchy ») accepted the idea of municipalizing the water service, and helped the Progressive politicians and citizens to put an end to the franchise of the private LA City Water Co, a corporation obsessed with financial profitability: a return of « 100 cents for every dollar invested » was how William Perry, the CEO, used to sum up his company's activity, and this very often led to under-investment and the construction of a network of relatively modest scope and efficiency. The « oligarchy » accepted to partake in the municipalization on the condition that the water service remain a « healthy business proposition », self-sustainable as far as investments and operating costs were concerned. Moreover, the oligarchy benefited hugely from the public investments that were made, for instance through land speculation in once-desert lands now made inhabitable thanks to giant water infrastructures (such as the 300 -mile-long Owens Valley aqueduct, completed in 1913). The idea of making profits was part of the reason why the business class accepted to infringe upon the dogma of free enterprise in Los Angeles. On the other hand, the Progressives, faithful to the motto of one of the leading figures of the movement, President Theodore Roosevelt, were aiming to achieve « the greatest good for the greatest number », in other words spread out the water service as much as possible, foster widespread access : they had a social and even a moral agenda (e. g. « civilizing » Mexican and African-American populations of the city through access to networked services), and were also trying to increase LA's political influence in Southern California (through compulsory annexation of territories wishing to benefit from LA's water projects, for instance). These conflicting views of what the municipal system should be and how it should operate were both present, from the start, and both exerted influence on the governance of the company and water network planning in LA...|$|R
