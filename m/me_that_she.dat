500|$|The New York Times quoted Wheeler Parker, {{a cousin}} of Till's, who said, [...] "I was hoping that one day she [...] would admit it, so it matters to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did, and it gives me some satisfaction. It's {{important}} to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, {{and a lot of}} black people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivier and Esmond {{married on}} 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, {{although}} within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded {{that the marriage}} was [...] "a pretty crass mistake. I insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings.... She had admitted to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish". Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be [...] "mere coincidence", unconnected to the nuptials.|$|E
500|$|In 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist. She was {{eighteen}} months younger than Yeats and later claimed {{she met the}} poet as a [...] "paint-stained art student." [...] Gonne admired [...] "The Island of Statues" [...] and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, {{and she had a}} significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, [...] "it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> [...] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes." [...] Yeats's love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.|$|E

500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, she said to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would like to know what a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E
500|$|In the Underworld, Proserpina, Queen of Hades, who {{has been}} deeply {{affected}} by Orfeo's singing, petitions King Plutone, her husband, for Euridice's release. Moved by her pleas, Plutone agrees on the condition that, as he leads Euridice towards the world, Orfeo must not look back. If he does, [...] "a single glance will condemn him to eternal loss". Orfeo enters, leading Euridice and singing confidently that on that day he will rest on his wife's white bosom. But as he sings a note of doubt creeps in: [...] "Who will assure <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is following?". Perhaps, he thinks, Plutone, driven by envy, has imposed the condition through spite? Suddenly distracted by an off-stage commotion, Orfeo looks round; immediately, the image of Euridice begins to fade. She sings, despairingly: [...] "Losest thou me through too much love?" [...] and disappears. Orfeo attempts to follow her but is drawn away by an unseen force. The chorus of spirits sings that Orfeo, having overcome Hades, was in turn overcome by his passions.|$|E

On July 6, Clark recorded [...] "The Indian woman informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been in this plain frequently and knew it well... She said we would discover {{a gap in the}} mountains in our direction..." [...] which is now Gibbons Pass. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea advised Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass. Later, this was chosen as the optimal route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.|$|E
2500|$|Although Hitchens {{thought he}} was the only witness called by the Vatican, Aroup Chatterjee (author of Mother Teresa: The Untold Story) was also called to present {{evidence}} opposing Teresa's beatification and canonisation; the Vatican had abolished the traditional [...] "devil's advocate", which served a similar purpose. Hitchens said that [...] "her intention was not to help people", and she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. [...] "It was by talking to her that I discovered, and she assured <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wasn't working to alleviate poverty", he said, [...] "She was working to expand the number of Catholics.

2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E

According to author Phillip Auslander, with this track Quatro [...] "aligned {{herself with a}} performance tradition of male boastfulness that includes Elvis".

2500|$|Everett married actress Shelby Grant in Tucson, Arizona, on May 22, 1966. Everett was on {{location}} in Tucson filming the 1967 movie, Return of the Gunfighter, {{at the time of}} their wedding. They had two daughters, Katherine and Shannon Everett. The couple remained married for 45 years until her death after a brain aneurysm on June 25, 2011. Everett credited his family with being a stabilizing force in his life, stating that even in the worst of times, Grant [...] "never threatened to leave. She would tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was there for me. If not for my family, I would have been in big trouble." [...] Grant noted his romanticism; he sent her so many flowers during their courtship that [...] "my balcony looked like a burial ground." [...] He also often wrote sentimental poems to Grant throughout their marriage, as well as to his daughters. The couple renewed their marriage vows every seven years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{television}} drama Medium, which aired from 2005 until 2011 on NBC and CBS {{is based}} on Allison DuBois's book, Don't Kiss Them Good-Bye. [...] The show was created by Glenn Gordon Caron, creator of Moonlighting and other television shows, who {{is also one of}} the writers for the series. [...] It is produced by CBS Television Studios (having acquired the TV production arm of original producer Paramount Pictures) and Grammnet, the production company owned by Cheers and Frasier alumnus Kelsey Grammer. [...] Patricia Arquette was cast to play the role of DuBois, at the suggestion of Caron's girlfriend. DuBois stated in the January 9, 2005 TV Guide that she initially thought Arquette was too liberal to play her, remarking, [...] "I mean, I have a gun, I have put people on death row. I wanted to make sure that was something that didn't bother her. But she assured <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> believed some people may have that coming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E

2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
