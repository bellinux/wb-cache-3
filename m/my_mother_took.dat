6000|$|... "O, I didn't {{want to stay}} at {{home and}} be abused. My father used to abuse me; but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> my part, and now I want to go and see her." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> no note of my exclamation, but {{her brow}} darkened. We were {{standing}} {{together on the}} lawn {{in front of the}} house and she was in the shadow of a tall cypress tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yis, I axed Father Burns about it; {{he said we}} mun {{pray for}} 'im. I bought him candles out o' my own pocket. He wor a rum feller, he wor!" [...] and again she shook her grey head mournfully. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> a step forward.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To England! But no, father, I did {{not even}} know it was intended. To England--to that Walwyn which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>takes</b> such pains to make us speak rightly. Are we then, going?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Josephus {{reported}} that Rebekah told Abraham's servant, [...] "my father was Bethuel, {{but he is}} dead; and Laban is my brother; and, together with <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>takes</b> care of all our family affairs, and is the guardian of my virginity." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{retelling of}} the story, Josephus {{reported}} that Rebekah told Abraham’s servant, “my father was Bethuel, {{but he is}} dead; and Laban is my brother; and, together with <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>takes</b> care of all our family affairs, and is the guardian of my virginity.” ...|$|R
60|$|On {{my mother}} {{appearing}} {{in a new}} bonnet, or an old one retrimmed, an event not unfrequent; for in these days <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> more thought than ever formerly for her appearance (you will understand, you women who have loved), she would step back in simulated amazement.|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> off her spectacles, looked calmly in the man's face, {{laid her}} hand on the Bible, and said, [...] "Because I have been a widow woman these three years, and never once in all that time have I gone a single day without a meal. When the usual hour came I put on my kettle to boil, for this Word tells me that `the Lord will provide.' I expect my tea to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a {{very dear}} fellow," [...] she {{answered}} with a soft gleam in her eyes that moved Foster. Then she smiled. [...] "You are forgiven--and I must confess that at first <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> the view I thought you hinted at. She said Lawrence ought to wait until all risk of the past's being brought to light was gone. But I suppose when you guessed the truth it {{was something of a}} shock?" ...|$|E
60|$|C. Last January twelvemonth. My aunt is married, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> has <b>taken</b> {{her place}} at home.|$|R
5000|$|The flood it <b>took</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> it <b>took</b> <b>my</b> brother too I thought I {{heard my}} father cry as I watched <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> go ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As well, please your Highness, as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> could <b>take</b> up {{a stitch}} in the nets she wove. The Milaner shall not know my work from his own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} having {{a fight with}} a city boy {{by the name of}} Barker," [...] said Victor, [...] "because he yelled at me 'sonova medium' till I stopped his mouth with my fist. It seems to me {{as if it were the}} very next day that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> me to Mirror Lake and put me in a boarding-school. That fight must have influenced her. Perhaps up to that moment our neighbors had let us alone. I can understand now why she always visited me and why she never offered to take me to the city." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{that same}} {{occasion}} I learned, {{for the first}} time, from Miss Abbot's communications to Bessie, {{that my father had}} been a poor clergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent: that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> the infection from him, and both died within a month of each other.|$|E
6000|$|My father's voice boomed out in protest; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> me {{into her}} arms to soothe and scold me; but long after the ruffled old lady had taken her {{departure}} I brooded on this affront. [...] "Away, away!" [...] a voice seemed to cry within; and I listened to it as if under a spell. All that day I nursed my wounded vanity, and the same evening, after candle light, I found myself for a moment alone in the kitchen. Pollie {{had gone to the}} wood-shed to fetch kindling, leaving the door into the garden ajar. The night air touched my cheek. Half beside myself with desire of I know not what, I sprang out from the doorstep into an inch or so of snow, and picking myself up, ran off into the darkness under the huge sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, {{tugging at}} a knot. [...] "Buckingham has been wanting a {{sacrifice}} {{ever since he}} killed Wettin, that he might slay <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>take</b> Victory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} anyone so shocked. He {{could not speak}} a word for full ten minutes. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>taken</b> ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" ...|$|R
60|$|This is {{too near}} the first hours {{of my life}} for me to relate {{anything}} of myself but by hearsay; {{it is enough to}} mention, that as I was born in such an unhappy place, I had no parish to have recourse to for my nourishment in my infancy; nor can I give the least account how I was kept alive, other than that, as I have been told, some relation of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>took</b> me away for a while as a nurse, but at whose expense, or by whose direction, I know nothing at all of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Years before, when I {{was only}} {{eight or ten}} years old, I had met your mother with your family at the seaside, where <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> me. I had seen {{a great deal of}} her, and knew all about her. I remembered well her {{habitual}} consideration for the nurses and servants in her employ. I knew her address in Boston, and I resolved {{to try to find a}} refuge in her family. And so there is my story. I left a note with my stepmother, saying that I was going to seek independent employment, and then went to Boston to your house. There I hoped to find a quiet asylum,--at least, till I could hear from my aunt in Scotland. The delay of hearing from her during those two years at your house often made me low-spirited." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Jim {{turned away}} with a clouded brow and strode into the smithy again. For my part, I slipped after {{him to try to}} console him, and to tell him all the {{wonderful}} changes which had come so suddenly into my life. But I had not got half through my story, and Jim, like the good fellow that he was, had just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good fortune, when my uncle called to me from without. The curricle with its tandem mares was waiting for us outside the cottage, and Ambrose had placed the refection-basket, the lap-dog, and the precious toilet-box inside of it. He had himself climbed up behind, and I, after a hearty handshake from my father, and a last sobbing embrace from <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>took</b> my place beside my uncle in the front.|$|E
60|$|Whenever my conduct was of such exaggerated impropriety that my mother's extemporary punishments were inadequate, {{she saved}} the matter up for Sunday, {{and made me}} go to church Sunday night--which was a penalty {{sometimes}} bearable, perhaps, but as a rule it was not, and I avoided it {{for the sake of}} my constitution. She would never believe that I had been to church until she had applied her test: she made me tell her what the text was. That was a simple matter, and caused me no trouble. I didn't have to go to church to get a text. I selected one for myself. This worked very well until one time when my text and the one furnished by a neighbor, who had been to church, didn't tally. After that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> other methods. I don't know what they were now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mary, {{you have}} done wonders," [...] said <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> as she <b>took</b> her place; [...] "your {{arrangements}} restore appetite to all of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must {{do without}} your help then! Your {{conditions}} are impossible. I will leave Rome {{at the time}} I have always intended--at the end of June. My rooms and <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> are <b>taken</b> till then; all my arrangements are made accordingly. Then, I will depart; not before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Willing? God forbid! I am simply {{amenable}} to force; if <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> chooses to <b>take</b> me, I won't resist. I can't! I {{have come to}} that!" ...|$|R
60|$|Young, gay, fascinating, and an ensign--I had {{completely}} won {{the heart of}} my Magdalen; and as for Miss Waters and her nasty uncle the Doctor, there was a complete split between us, as you may fancy; Miss pretending, forsooth, that she was glad I had broken off the match, though she would have given her eyes, the little minx, to have had it on again. But this {{was out of the}} question. My father, who had all sorts of queer notions, said I had acted like a rascal in the business; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> my part, in course, and declared I acted rightly, as I always did: and I got leave of absence from the regiment in order to press my beloved Magdalen to marry me out of hand--knowing, from reading and experience, the extraordinary mutability of human affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Signore, I {{unfortunately}} come {{of a race}} of brigands. For centuries {{my family}} has been lawless and it was natural that by education I, too, should become a brigand. In my youth my father {{was killed in an}} affray and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> his place, seizing many prisoners and exacting from them ransom. My mother you have seen, and you know of her sudden madness and of her death. She was always mad, I think, and by nature a fiend. She urged my elder brother to wicked crimes, and when he rebelled she herself cast him, in a fit of anger, into the pit. I became duke in his place, and did my mother's bidding because I feared to oppose her. But for years I have longed to abandon the life and have done with crime.|$|E
6000|$|... "From him my father, Kanau, got the {{collecting}} bee in his bonnet, and Hiwilani was likewise infected. But {{father was}} modern to his finger-tips. He believed neither in {{the gods of}} the kahunas" [...] (priests) [...] "nor of the missionaries. He didn't believe in anything except sugar stocks, horse-breeding, and that his grandfather had been a fool in not collecting a few Isaac Davises and John Youngs and brass carronades {{before he went to}} war with Kamehameha. So he collected curios in the pure collector's spirit; but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> it seriously. That was why she went in for bones. I remember, too, she had an ugly old stone-idol she used to yammer to and crawl around on the floor before. It's in the Deacon Museum now. I sent it there after her death, and her collection of bones to the Royal Mausoleum in Olokona.|$|E
6000|$|... "The truth is, that Lord Stapledean's {{message to}} her, and his conduct about the living, has quite upset her. I cannot blame Lord Stapledean. What {{he did was}} {{certainly}} kind. But I do blame myself. I never should have accepted the living on those terms--never, never. I knew it when I did it, and I have never since ceased to repent it." [...] And so saying {{he got up and}} walked quickly about the room. [...] "Would you believe it now; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>takes</b> upon herself to tell me in what way I should read the absolution; and feels herself injured because I do not comply?" ...|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. Daisy {{is one in}} a thousand. You can't {{think what}} she's done for me during <b>my</b> illness. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> couldn't have <b>taken</b> more care of me.|$|R
6000|$|She slowly {{lifted her}} eyes to him in vacant fear and surprise; she burst into no {{expression}} of delight; no overwhelming emotion made her sink fainting in his arms. The sacred associations which gather round the mere name of Mother were associations unknown to her; the man who held her to him so tenderly, the hero who had pitied and saved her, was father and mother both to her simple mind. She dropped {{her head on his}} breast; her faltering voice told him that she was crying. [...] "Will <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>take</b> me away from you?" [...] she asked. [...] "Oh, do promise to bring me back with you to the cottage!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of that sort, Clopper--no, no--'pon honor--little Bob Stubbs is no LIBERTINE; and {{the story}} is very simple. You see that my father has a small place, merely a few hundred acres, at Sloffemsquiggle. Isn't it a funny name? Hang it, there's the naval gentleman staring again,"--(I looked terribly fierce as I {{returned}} this officer's stare, and continued in a loud careless voice). Well, at this Sloffemsquiggle there lived a girl, a Miss Waters, the niece of some blackguard apothecary in the neighborhood; but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> a fancy to the girl, and had her up {{to the park and}} petted her. We were both young--and--and--the girl fell in love with me, that's the fact. I was obliged to repel some rather warm advances that she made me; and here, upon my honor as a gentleman, you have all the story about which that silly Dobble makes such a noise.|$|E
60|$|When we {{were quite}} well and tolerably free from pock-marks, {{my father took}} us to London with him, and there Eustace was sent to school at Westminster; while I, with little Berry, had a tutor to teach us Latin and French, and my mother's waiting-maid {{instructed}} me in sewing and embroidery. As I grew older I had masters in dancing and the spinnet, and my mother herself was most careful of my deportment. Likewise she taught me such practices of our religion as I had not learnt from my grandmother, {{and then it was}} I found that I was to be brought up differently from Eustace and the others. I cried at first, and declared I would do like Eustace and my father. I did not think much about it; I was too childish and thoughtless to be really devout; and when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> me in secret to the queen's little chapel, full of charming objects of devotion, while the others had to sit still during sermons two hours long, I began to think that I was the best off.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I went. But, oh! <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>took</b> long to die. Whole moons {{passed before}} I shut her eyes, {{and all this}} while she would not let me go; nor, indeed, did I wish to leave her whom I loved. At length it was over, {{and then came the}} days of mourning, and after those some more days of rest, and after them again the days of the {{division}} of the cattle, so that in the end six moons or more had gone by before I returned to the service of the Princess Nandie, and found that Mameena was now the second wife of the lord Saduko. Also I found that the child of the lady Nandie was dead, and that Masapo, the first husband of Mameena, had been smelt out and killed as the murderer of the child. But as all these things were over and done with, and as Mameena was very kind to me, giving me gifts and sparing me tasks, and as I saw that Saduko my lord loved her much, it never came into my head to say anything of the matter of the powder that I saw her sprinkle on the mat.|$|E
60|$|Thus was I {{received}} {{into the}} horde. Red-Eye paid no further attention to me, and I was {{at liberty to}} whimper and sob to my heart's content. Several of the women gathered curiously about me, and I recognized them. I had encountered them the preceding year when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had <b>taken</b> me to the hazelnut canyons.|$|R
60|$|From {{any other}} than Hal <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would have <b>taken</b> such a remark, made even in jest, as {{an insult to}} her sex. But Hal's smile was a coating that could sugar any pill.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hidge, Hodge, on my back, {{what time}} of day is it?' The poor little [...] bairn said, 'It is the time that <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> the hen-wife, <b>takes</b> up the [...] eggs for the queen's breakfast.' ...|$|R
