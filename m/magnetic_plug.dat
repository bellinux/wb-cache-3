50|$|Geomag is a {{magnetic}} construction toy. The original toy comprised bars with a magnet on each end (neodymium alloy) all attached by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>plug</b> (coated with polypropylene), and nickel-coated metal spheres. Magnetic forces hold {{the bars and}} spheres together, creating the possibility for many constructions. Invented and patented by Claudio Vincetelli in May 1998, production is currently undertaken by Geomagworld SA at the production facilities in Novazzano, Switzerland. Product lines {{have been added to}} the original model (now called Geomag PRO), growing the Geomag range of construction toys. Since the introduction of the 2009/48/EC law on 20 July 2013 restricted the content of nickel in toys, Geomag has re-modelled the spheres with a bronze alloy coating, in order to comply with the new regulations.|$|E

40|$|Present day {{microfluidics}} widely uses electrokinetic effects like eletrosmosis and electrophoresis {{to achieve}} flow control. These methods require extensive micromachining processes. Also, the fabrication of valves and valve-seats is difficult, which frequently leads to leakages and eventual {{breakdown of the}} system. This paper introduces the use of ferrofluids as an alternative for flow control in microchannels. Numerical simulation of flow through a microchannel using a ferrofluid {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field is performed by coupling the flow and magnetic phenomena. An additional term calculated from the ferrofluid magnetization equations, is introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations to account for the magnetic force. The maximum velocity in a magnetically driven flow is shown to be a linear function of magnitude of magnetization of the permanent magnet. Further, the insertion of micron-size magnetic particles (referred here as <b>magnetic</b> <b>plugs)</b> in the flow field has been discussed. These plugs can be used to provide appropriate barriers to the flow by controlling their movement externally. Using the combination of ferrofluid and <b>magnetic</b> <b>plugs,</b> flow control can be achieved by the variation of external magnetic field alone...|$|R
40|$|In {{experiments}} involving Bose condensed atoms {{trapped in}} <b>magnetic</b> bottles, <b>plugging</b> {{the hole in}} the bottle potential with a LASER beam produces a new potential with two minima, and thus a condensate order parameter (i. e. wave function) with two maxima. When the trapping potential is removed and the condensate explodes away from the trap, the two wave function maxima act as two coherent sources which exhibit amplitude interference. A simplified theoretical treatment of this experimental effect is provided by considering momentum distributions. Comment: 4 page...|$|R
40|$|The high-field {{permanent}} magnetic circuits of 1. 2 [*]T and 1. 5 [*]T with novel {{magnetic focusing}} and curved-surface correction are developed. The permanent magnetic circuit comprises a magnetic yoke, main magnetic steel, nonspherical curved-surface <b>magnetic</b> poles, <b>plugging</b> <b>magnetic</b> steel, and side magnetic steel. In this work, a novel shimming method is {{proposed for the}} effective correction of base magnetic field (B 0) inhomogeneities, {{which is based on}} passive shimming on the telescope aspheric cutting, grinding, and fine processing technology of the nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles and active shimming adding higher-order gradient coils. Meanwhile, the magnetic resonance imaging dedicated alloy with high-saturation magnetic field induction intensity and high electrical resistivity is developed, and nonspherical curved-surface magnetic poles which are made of the dedicated alloy have very good anti-eddy-current effect. In addition, the large temperature coefficient problem of permanent magnet can be effectively controlled by using a high quality temperature controller and deuterium external locking technique. Combining our patents such as gradient coil, RF coil, and integration computer software, two kinds of small animal Micro-MRI instruments are developed, by which the high quality MRI images of mice were obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to produce an injection device for precise dispensing of nanolitre volumes of fluid using a piston formed from superparamagnetic beads. A plug of Fe 2 O 3 beads is formed by applying a non-uniform magnetic field from a bullet magnet within {{close proximity to the}} fluid filled channel containing the beads. Once the plug is formed it can be moved through the micro channel by moving the magnet and thus, provide a plunger-like action. Fluid is displaced by moving the <b>magnetic</b> <b>plug,</b> providing a technique for fluid dispensing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel phase change microvalve using a paraffin-based ferrofluid plug (called “Ferro-Wax”). The Ferro-Wax plug is essentially leak-proof {{because of the}} phase change nature of the material; once the plug is solidified, it forms a solid seal. The meltable <b>magnetic</b> <b>plug</b> changes the phase from solid to liquid by an on-chip heating and moves remotely in a channel by a magnetic actuation. The reversible microvalve performed excellently up to 50 psi. The ease of fabrication and integration makes this microvalve invaluable for a next generation lab-on-a-chip device for on-chip sample preparation and label-free detection, which is currently underway...|$|E

50|$|Magnetic filters use a {{permanent}} magnet or an electromagnet to capture ferromagnetic particles. An advantage of magnetic filtration is that maintaining the filter simply requires cleaning the particles {{from the surface}} of the magnet. Automatic transmissions in vehicles frequently have a magnet in the fluid pan to sequester magnetic particles and prolong the life of the media-type fluid filter. Some companies are manufacturing magnets that attach to the outside of an oil filter or <b>magnetic</b> drain <b>plugs</b> -- first invented and offered for cars and motorcycles in the mid-1930s -- to aid in capturing these metallic particles, though there is ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of such devices.|$|R
40|$|Overheating {{of power}} {{electronic}} devices {{has become a}} significant issue due to their continued miniaturization and increased heat flux {{that needs to be}} dissipated. Microchannel heat sinks utilising two-phase flow are capable of very high heat transfer rates and represent a possible means of cooling such devices. In this paper, we focus on two-phase liquid-liquid plug flow using water-based ferrofluid (<b>magnetic</b> nanofluid) <b>plugs</b> as the dispersed phase and silicone oil as the continuous phase. An external magnetic field was applied to generate enhanced mixing of the microfluidic flow. We show that material properties of the ferrofluid plug influences heat transfer properties of the microfluidic flow, and demonstrate that cooling performance is further enhanced by the application of an external magnetic field which induces mixing. We also show that microchannel heat transfer using a ferrofluid is superior to that using de-ionized water as the dispersed phase for two-phase liquid-liquid plug flow...|$|R
40|$|Investigation {{showed that}} the pinion AHF- 12516 had failed by fatigue leading to {{subsequent}} damages to the main gearbox. The chips detected by the <b>magnetic</b> <b>plug</b> were resulted from the crushed fragments of the pinion teeth. Pinion AHF- 12516 had failed by tooth bending fatigue. Evidences suggest that tooth bending fatigue was caused due to misalignment in the assembly. The pinions were found to conform to design specification in terms of dimension, effective case depth, surface hardness, core hardness and microstructure. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were responsible for fatigue crack initiation and the fatigue was stress related. From the components provided for investigation, {{it was not possible}} to identify the cause(s) for misalignment in the pinion assembly. It is recommended that the affected MGB be subjected to detailed examination in an effort to establish as to what could cause the misalignment...|$|E

40|$|For mass limited samples, the {{residual}} sample volume outside the detection coil {{is an important}} concern, as is good base line resolution.

Mixed-epoxy glue and ultem tube plugs that have susceptibility values close to those of perfluorocarbon FC- 43 (fluorinert) and copper were used in small volume (0. 5 to 2 μL) and larger volume (15 to 20 μL) thin glass capillary sample cells. Using these plugs, the sample volume efficiency (i. e. ratio of active volume to total sample volume in the microcoil NMR cell) was improved by 6 to 12 fold without sensitivity and resolution trade-offs. Comparison with laser etched or heat etched microcoil sample cells is provided.

40|$|Conventional field-reversed {{configurations}} (FRC) face notable {{stability and}} confinement concerns, {{which can be}} ameliorated by introducing and maintaining a significant fast ion population in the system. This is the conjecture first introduced by Norman Rostoker multiple decades ago and adopted as the central design tenet in Tri Alpha Energy's advanced beam driven FRC concept. In fact, studying the physics of such neutral beam (NB) driven FRCs over the past decade, considerable improvements were made in confinement and stability. Next to NB injection, the addition of axially streaming plasma guns, <b>magnetic</b> end <b>plugs,</b> as well as advanced surface conditioning lead to dramatic reductions in turbulence driven losses and greatly improved stability. In turn, fast ion confinement improved significantly and allowed for the build-up of a dominant fast particle population. This recently led to the breakthrough of sustaining an advanced beam driven FRC, thereby demonstrating successful maintenance of trapped magnetic flux, plasma dimensions and total pressure inventory for times much longer than all characteristic system time scales and only limited by hardware and electric supply constraints...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a novel method to extract <b>magnetic</b> particles from <b>plugs</b> in plug-based microfluidic devices. In general, {{the extraction of}} particles from plugs is difficult as the high surface energy of an aqueous phase dispersed in a non-polar carrier liquid usually prevents the penetration of particles through this interface. Key to our approach is to achieve particle extraction by generating channel surface consisting of a hydrophilic patch in a hydrophobic surrounding: The interfaces of plugs contacting this patch, merge with the patch-interface enabling easy extraction. This approach lowers the limit of the concentration of particles, which can be still successfully extracted by more than three orders of magnitude compared {{to the state of}} the art...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a fast production of large 23 Na Bose-Einstein condensates in an optically <b>plugged,</b> <b>magnetic</b> quadrupole trap. A single global minimum of the trapping potential {{is generated by}} slightly displacing the plug beam {{from the center of}} the quadrupole field. With a dark magneto-optical trap and a simple rf evaporation, our system produces a condensate with N = 10 ^ 7 atoms every 17 s.

We find that, when gravity is neglected, there are two parameters in the problem namely, the angular velocity of the rotating field and its strength. We present the stability diagram in these parameters. We find the mode frequencies calculated from the time-averaged potential model used by the inventors of the TOP is an excellent approximation to our exact results. However, for other parameters, {{this may not be}} the case. 1 Introduction. The first observation of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) [1] was done in the so-called Time-averaged Orbiting Potential (TOP) trap.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{conceptual}} {{design for a}} novel continuous wave electron-linac based high-intensity high-brightness slow-positron production source with a projected intensity {{on the order of}} 10 $^{ 10 }$ e$^+$/s. Reaching this intensity in our design relies on the transport of positrons (T$_+$ below 600 keV) from the electron-positron pair production converter target to a low-radiation and low-temperature area for moderation in a high-efficiency cryogenic rare gas moderator, solid Ne. This design progressed through Monte Carlo optimizations of: electron/positron beam energies and converter target thickness, transport of the e$^+$ beam from the converter to the moderator, extraction of the e$^+$ beam from the magnetic channel, a synchronized raster system, and moderator efficiency calculations. For the extraction of e$^+$ from the magnetic channel, a <b>magnetic</b> field terminator <b>plug</b> prototype has been built and experimental results on the effectiveness of the prototype are presented.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{experimental}} investigations on ion production in plasma developed on SMIS 37 source at the Institute of Applied Physics of RAS (Nizhny Novgorod) is reported. Pulsed power gyrotron with emission frequency 37. 5 GHz {{was used for}} plasma creation and heating in the simple magnetic mirror trap.

40|$|Subdivision of the Maastrichtian chalk {{from the}} Danish North Sea {{has proven to}} be {{difficult}} because of the homogenous composition and appearance. A high-resolution subdivision of the chalk yields new information and better understanding of the depositional environment along with the possibility of an advantageous correlation. This new knowledge and possibility may be beneficial in reservoir geology where it can be exploited to enhance oil production from existing Danish oil fields. Petrophysical properties of a 34 m (well MFB- 7) and an 11 m (well M- 1 X) long successions of Maastrichtian chalk from the Dan Field were examined for cyclicity by spectral analysis (i. e. FFT and a new method developed in this study). <b>Magnetic</b> susceptibility <b>plug</b> measurements, together with the neutron porosity and the natural gamma radiation well log data were analysed, and all three properties contain a consistent cyclicity at c. 2 m wavelength. Further-more, the magnetic susceptibility carries spectral evidence for a shorter cyclicity at c. 0. 5 m cycle. The magnetic properties of the insoluble residue of the Maastrichtian chalk are primarily determined by the clay minerals (illite-smectites) and the existence of a detrital component in the insoluble residue suggests, that the cyclic variations in the bulk magnetic susceptibility and consequently of the composition of the chalk, are controlled by changes in the runoff from land into the basin. The cycle lengths in the chalk match Milankovitch cycles and therefore it is suggested that the deposition of the chalk was influenced by Milankovitch-driven climatic changes, which are reflected as variations in the clay mineral content. The cycles are inter-preted to be a result of the eccentricity (94. 5 ka) and the precession (22. 5 ka) Milankovitch cycles. The cycles in the neutron porosity logs and the magnetic susceptibility data from the two wells were used to correlate the two cores, and the correlation was corroborated by a biostrati-graphical marker.
