50|$|The {{foundation}} of the Reform Verein in Frankfurt am Main led to another agitation in German Jewry. Einhorn, Stein, Samuel Hirsch, and others deplored {{the rise of the}} Verein as a step toward schismatic separation. The obligatory character of the rite of circumcision was the focal issue discussed by no less than forty-one rabbis. Holdheim, in his Ueber die Beschneidung Zunächst in Religiös-Dogmatischer Beziehung (Schwerin and Berlin, 1844), takes the position that circumcision is not, like baptism, a sacrament of initiation, but is merely a command like any other. Nevertheless, he classifies it not as a national but as a Jewish law, and pleads for its retention. Indeed, he was not unreservedly an adherent of the program of the Frankfurt Reform Verein. This is clear from his Vorträge über die Mosaische Religion für Denkende Israeliten (Schwerin, 1844). While the Verein assumed unlimited possibilities of development, according to Holdheim the <b>Mosaic</b> <b>element,</b> after the elimination of the national, is eternal. Religion must be placed above all temporal needs and desires. To yield to the spirit of the age would make that spirit the supreme factor and lead to the production of a new 19th century Talmud as little warranted as was the Talmud of the 5th century.|$|E

In addition to the genes encoding a presumed regulatory protein (betI), the betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (betB), and the choline dehydrogenase (betA) enzymes also found in Escherichia coli, a new gene (betC) was identified as encoding a choline sulfatase catalyzing the conversion of choline-O-sulfate and, at a lower rate, phosphorylcholine, into choline. Choline sulfatase activity was absent from betC but not from betB mutants and was shown to be induced indifferently by choline or choline-O-sulfate as were the other enzymes of the pathway. Unlike what {{has been shown in}} other bacteria and plants, choline-O-sulfate is not used as an osmoprotectant per se in S. meliloti, but is metabolized into glycine betaine. S. meliloti also can use this compound as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur source for growth and that depends on a functional bet locus.

Various hypotheses to account for this bias are discussed and, where possible, evaluated. A need is identified for more systematic sampling strategies when performing chamber measurements in order to assess the extent to which subjectivity of chamber location may account for much of the observed bias.

40|$|The {{sequence}} (2, 700 bp) {{between the}} aldH and pspF genes of Escherichia coli was determined. The pspF gene encodes a sigma 54 transcriptional activator of the phage shock protein (psp) operon (pspA to pspE). Downstream of the pspF transcribed region are two open reading frames (ORFs), ordL and goaG, convergently oriented {{with respect to}} pspF. These two ORFs, together with the adjacent aldH gene, may constitute a novel operon (aldH-ordL-goaG). The goaG-pspF intergenic region contains a complex extragenic <b>mosaic</b> <b>element,</b> RIB. The structure of this RIB element, which belongs to the BIME- 1 family, is Y(REP 1) > 16 < Z 1 (REP 2), where Y and Z 1 are palindromic units and the central 16 bases contain an L motif with an ihf consensus sequence. DNA fragments containing the L motif of the psp RIB element effectively bind integration host factor (IHF), while the Y palindromic unit (REP 1) of the same RIB element binds DNA gyrase weakly. Computer prediction of the pspF mRNA secondary structure suggested that the transcribed stem-loop structures formed by the 3 '-flanking region of the pspF transcript containing the RIB element can stabilize and protect pspF mRNA. Analysis of pspF steady-state mRNA levels showed that transcripts with an intact RIB element are much more abundant than those truncated at the 3 ' end by deletion of either the entire RIB element or a single Z 1 sequence (REP 2). Thus, the pspF 3 '-flanking region containing the RIB element has {{an important role in the}} stabilization of the pspF transcript...|$|E
40|$|Montane grasslands are an {{important}} ecosystem type in Southwestern landscapes, occurring from the forest borders of piñon-juniper woodland to high elevation subalpine and alpine ecosystems. Thus, they often represent a <b>mosaic</b> <b>element</b> embedded in the forest landscape matrix, playing key roles in processing water and nutrients, and providing habitat for unique suites of species, often at higher levels of diversity than those found in surrounding uplands. Soils, local temperature and moisture gradients, and disturbance all play roles in determining the distribution and extent of montane grasslands. Of these factors, fire plays the most dynamic role in regulating the location and composition of the grassland-forest ecotone. In this project we undertook the first landscape-scale characterization of the historic fire regime {{of one of the}} major montane grassland-forest complexes in southwestern North America, the 36, 400 ha (90, 000 ac) Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP) {{in the heart of the}} Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. The VCNP is a post-volcanic landscape consisting of multiple forested resurgent domes within a matrix of high-elevation valle grasslands. Where forest meets grassland, an ecotonal zone occurs with moderate tree cover and high herbaceous productivity. We hypothesized that the ecotone represented the highest fire frequency and served as a pathway for fire spread among the valles. To test this idea we collected fire-scarred tree-ring samples from over 450 trees from the forest-grassland ecotone in all of the major valles in the VCNP, making this one of the most comprehensive landscape fire history collections in the United States. All sample locations were georeferenced to facilitate spatial as well as temporal patterns of historical fire occurrence. To allow stronger interpretation of the point fire-scar record as a proxy for fire spread, we modeled fire behavior in the same landscape using Minimum Travel Time (MTT) and other capabilities of the FlamMap system, using a model calibrated to local weather streams, ignitions, and fuels (Finney 2002). The resulting VCNP tree-ring record extends back to the early AD 1418, establishing a 591 -yr period of record. We dated more than 2000 fire scars, with the earliest dating to 1501, representing 468 years with fire occurrence. Our fire history analysis shows high fire frequency in the forest-grassland ecotone, with average mean fire interval (MFI) of 6. 9 yr in individual valles, and 1. 3 yr between fires in the VCNP as a whole. Fire frequencies were highest in the largest valles and MFI was significantly associated with valle area. Historically, fires occurred in years of significantly low Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI); the most widespread fire years represented contingent combinations of low fire-year PDSI preceded by 2 - 3 years of unusually high PDSI (cool-wet conditions), indicating climate control on fine fuel production. More than 20 instances of back-to-back fire years occurred in the VCNP landscape, generally entrained by sequential low-PDSI years as well as spatial separation of burned areas. Fire modeling simulations identified the forest-grassland ecotone as the optimal pathway for fire spread: both more mesic, upslope closed forest and the mesic internal wet meadow conditions of the grasslands impede fire flow, whereas the relatively drier conditions with abundant fine fuels facilitate rapid fire spread across the VCNP landscape. These findings are being provided to managers of the VCNP to informal ecosystem management, including their fire management program...|$|E

Events included excisions of a whole BIME- 1, expansion/deletion within a BIME- 2 and insertions of non-BIME sequences like the boxC repeat or a new IS element, named IS 1397. Remarkably, 14 out of 14 IS 1397 integration sites correspond to a BIME sequence, strongly suggesting that this IS element is specifically associated with BIMEs, and thus inserts only in extragenic regions.

A central fragment from the transposing virus D 108 allowed efficient Mu replication and was shown to contain a strong gyrase site. However, neither the strong gyrase site from the plasmid pSC 101 nor the major gyrase site from pBR 322 could promote efficient Mu replication, even though the pSC 101 site is a stronger gyrase site than the Mu SGS as assayed by cleavage in the presence of gyrase and the quinolone enoxacin. To look for SGS-like sites in the Escherichia coli chromosome which might be involved in organizing nucleoid structure, fragments of E. coli chromosomal DNA were substituted for the SGS: first, repeat sequences associated with gyrase binding (bacterial interspersed <b>mosaic</b> <b>elements),</b> and, second, random fragments of the entire chromosome.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) {{have been}} {{increasingly}} reported since the 1980 s. Despite {{the high number}} of published studies about VRE epidemiology, the dynamics and evolvability of these microorganisms are still not fully understood. A multilevel population genetic analysis of VREfm outbreak strains since 1986, representing the first comprehensive characterization of plasmid content in E. faecium, was performed to provide a detailed view of potential transmissible units. METHODS: From a comprehensive MeSH search, we identified VREfm strains causing hospital outbreaks (1986 - 2012). In total, 53 VanA and 18 VanB isolates (27 countries, 5 continents) were analysed and 82 vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEfm) were included for comparison. Clonal relatedness was established by PFGE and MLST (goeBURST/Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure, BAPS). Characterization of van transposons (PCR mapping, RFLP, sequencing), plasmids (transfer, ClaI-RFLP, PCR typing of relaxases, replication-initiation proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, hybridization, sequencing), bacteriocins and virulence determinants (PCR, hybridization, sequencing) was performed. RESULTS: VREfm were mainly associated with major human lineages ST 17, ST 18 and ST 78. VREfm and VSEfm harboured plasmids of different families [RCR, small theta plasmids, RepA_N (pRUM/pLG 1) and Inc 18] able to yield <b>mosaic</b> <b>elements.</b> Tn 1546 -vanA was mainly located on pRUM/Axe-Txe (USA) and Inc 18 -pIP 186 (Europe) plasmids.

A second gene product, 500 bp downstream of the chvI-like gene in R. meliloti, was homologous to the A. tumefaciens ChvG protein. The homology between the R. meliloti and A. tumefaciens genes was confirmed, because the R. meliloti chvI and chvG genes complemented A. tumefaciens chvI and chvG mutants for growth on complex media. We were unable to construct chvI or chvG insertion mutants of R. meliloti, whereas mutants carrying insertions outside of these genes were readily obtained. A 108 -bp repeat element characterized by two large palindromes was identified in the chvI and chvG intergenic regions of both Rhizobium species. This element was duplicated in Rhizobium sp. strain NGR 234. Another structurally similar element with a size of 109 bp was present in R. meliloti but not in Rhizobium sp. strain NGR 234. These elements were named rhizobium-specific intergenic <b>mosaic</b> <b>elements</b> (RIMEs), because their distribution seems {{to be limited to}} members of the family Rhizobiaceae. A homology search in GenBank detected six more copies of the first element (RIME 1), all in Rhizobium species, and three extra copies of the second element (RIME 2), only in R. meliloti. Southern blot analysis with a probe specific to RIME 1 showed the presence of several copies of the element in the genome of R. meliloti, Rhizobium sp. strain NGR 234, Rhizobium leguminosarum, and Agrobacterium rhizogenes, but none was present in A. tumefaciens and Bradyrhizobium japonicum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial {{repetitive}} extragenic palindromes (REPs) {{compose a}} distinct group of genomic repeats. They usually occur in high abundance (> 100 copies/genome) {{and are often}} arranged in composite repetitive structures - bacterial interspersed <b>mosaic</b> <b>elements</b> (BIMEs). In BIMEs, regularly spaced REPs are present in alternating orientations. BIMEs and REPs {{have been shown to}} serve as binding sites for several proteins and suggested to play role in chromosome organization and transcription termination. Their origins are, at present, unknown. Results In this report, we describe a novel class of putative transposases related to IS 200 /IS 605 transposase family and we demonstrate that they are obligately associated with bacterial REPs. Open reading frames coding for these REP-associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs) are always flanked by two REPs in inverted orientation and thus constitute a unit reminiscent of typical transposable elements. Besides conserved residues involved in catalysis of DNA cleavage, RAYTs carry characteristic structural motifs that are absent in typical IS 200 /IS 605 transposases. DNA sequences flanking rayt genes are in one third of examined cases arranged in modular BIMEs. RAYTs and their flanking REPs apparently coevolve with each other. The rayt genes themselves are subject to rapid evolution, substantially exceeding the substitution rate of neighboring genes. Strong correlation was found between the presence of a particular rayt in a genome and the abundance of its cognate REPs. Conclusions In light of our findings, we propose that RAYTs are responsible for establishment of REPs and BIMEs in bacterial genomes, as well as for their exceptional dynamics and species-specifity. Conversely, we suggest that BIMEs are in fact a special type of nonautonomous transposable elements, mobilizable by RAYTs. </p...|$|R
