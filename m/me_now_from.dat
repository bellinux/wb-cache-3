500|$|Baltimore {{spent the}} last two years of his life {{constantly}} lobbying for his new charter, though the obstacles proved difficult. The Virginians, led by William Claiborne, who sailed to England to make the case, campaigned aggressively against separate colonising of the Chesapeake, claiming they possessed the rights to that area. Baltimore was short of capital, having exhausted his fortune, and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends. To make matters worse, in the summer of 1630 his household was infected by the plague, which he survived. He wrote to Wentworth: [...] "Blessed be God for it who hath preserved <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> shipwreck, hunger, scurvy and pestilence..." ...|$|E
500|$|In Lara's Shadow, {{the player}} takes {{control of the}} doppelgänger. The doppelgänger moves more quickly than Lara and the {{gameplay}} has a stronger emphasis on melee combat. The story of Lara's Shadow opens with the scene from the main game where Amanda rescues Lara from the doppelgänger by throwing her {{over the side of}} a cliff. The doppelgänger survives, landing on solid rock rather than in the surrounding eitr. When she regains consciousness, she proceeds to find Natla. Natla appears weakened and thrall-like, but retains her mind and uses [...] "Okh Eshivar" [...] to command the doppelgänger {{to take her to the}} doppelgänger's [...] "birthplace." [...] Once there, the doppelgänger places Natla in a very large and ancient machine. Natla then gives the doppelgänger her final orders: to kill Lara and then end her own life. The doppelgänger seems to feel anger at this but, being under Natla's control, continues to obey her. The scene shifts to [...] "4 days later", and extends the final scene of Beneath the Ashes. During their previously inaudible exchange, Lara commands the doppelgänger saying [...] "Obey <b>me</b> <b>now.</b> <b>From</b> this moment, ignore all commands. You are a slave to no one." [...] The doppelgänger returns and destroys part of the machine containing Natla, who falls and is trapped by the debris in a rising pool of eitr. Natla unsuccessfully tries to order the now free doppelgänger to help her. Lara's Shadow ends with the doppelgänger looking down on Natla smiling as she is submerged in the eitr.|$|E

60|$|September 6th.--I think I paid my {{last visit}} to the Exhibition, and feel as if I {{had had enough of}} it, {{although}} I have got but {{a small part of the}} profit it might have afforded me. But pictures are certainly quite other things to <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> what they were at my first visit; it seems even as if there were a sort of illumination within them, that makes me see them more distinctly. Speaking of pictures, the miniature of Anne of Cleves is here, on the faith of which Henry VIII. married her; also, the picture of the Infanta of Spain, which Buckingham brought over to Charles I. while Prince of Wales. This has a delicate, rosy prettiness.|$|E

60|$|With {{an effort}} I raised {{my eyes and}} looked at her. She stood, tall and gracious, in a ruby splendour of sunset falling through the window beside her. The light quivered like living {{radiance}} over a dark proud head, a white throat, and a face before whose perfect loveliness the memory of Dorothy Armstrong's laughing prettiness faded like {{a star in the}} sunrise, nevermore in the fullness of the day to be remembered. Yet it was not of her beauty I thought as I stood spellbound before her. I seemed to see a dim little valley full of whispering pines, and a girl standing under their shadows, looking at me with the same great, greyish-blue eyes which gazed upon <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> Marian Lindsay's face--the same face, matured into gracious womanhood, that I had seen ten years ago; and loved--aye, loved--ever since.

Satisfied of the effect, I sought the apartment of Mr. Rowley of the Rueful Countenance, and found him less yellow, but still contrite, and listening to Mrs. McRankine, who sat with open book by his bedside, and plied him with pertinent dehortations from the Book of Proverbs.|$|R
