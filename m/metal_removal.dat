The efficacy of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>removal</b> from sewage sludge varies from 83 % (Zn) up to 14 % (Cr) and follows the order: Zn> Mn> Cu> Ni> Co> Pb> Cr. The advantages of metals bioleaching process at heterotrophic metabolism were shown.

This process is based on enhancing vital ability of heterotrophic microorganisms by adding easily metabolized nutrients and synthesis of metabolites by growing sludge cenoses.

Based on the results, it shows pH, BOD 5, Cu, Zn, Fe and Pb tested comply with Standard B in Environmental Quality Act, 1979 but COD, Mn and Total Suspended Solid (TSS) were greater than Standard B. It was indicated that the concentrations of five heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Fe, Mn) in the wastewater were rather low. After the treatment with limestone and water hyacinth, all these stated parameters comply with Standard B with overall percentage removal were ranged from 30. 43 %, to 99. 39 %.
