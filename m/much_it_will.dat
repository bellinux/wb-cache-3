2500|$|The General Services Administration is {{the legal}} owner of the building, while the Department of Energy is the tenant. Every year, GSA {{estimates}} how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> cost to operate the building (light, heat, ventilation, air conditioning, water, sewage, etc.), and pays this amount to DOE so that DOE can operate the structure. [...] DOE purchases steam and chilled water for the HVAC system and drinking water from a nearby GSA plant.|$|E

Stilwell, head of {{the company}} legal department, was quoted in January 1904, at the annual banquet of the Automobile Club of Syracuse at the Yates Hotel as saying; [...] "The lawyer looks at automobiling from the {{standpoint}} of how many suits he can get out of it. The sportsman asks how fast will it go? The manufacturer asks how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> cost to make one and how many he can sell? The manufacturer has his troubles. The consumer complains and takes his troubles to the dealer, and the dealer shifts them back to the manufacturer. The manufacturer is all the time studying to improve the machine. It will not belong before {{the majority of the people}} who now use vehicles will own and operate automobiles, and good roads will follow and a recognition of the rights of automobilists." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2014, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga {{from using}} a TV advert that it said {{breached}} its code {{because of a}} claim that customers would save money. The authority said this {{was likely to be}} interpreted as a statement that Wonga’s loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a price comparison. It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: [...] "Adverts must be clear about what taking out a loan means and how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> cost. The consequences are really serious when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small loan balloons into a huge debt… both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways". It was the third Wonga advert to be banned by the ASA in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The shear {{strength}} and stiffness of soil determines {{whether or not}} soil will be stable or how <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> deform. Knowledge of the strength is necessary {{to determine if a}} slope will be stable, if a building or bridge might settle too far into the ground, and the limiting pressures on a retaining wall. It is important to distinguish between failure of a soil element and the failure of a geotechnical structure (e.g., a building foundation, slope or retaining wall); some soil elements may reach their peak strength prior to failure of the structure. Different criteria can be used to define the [...] "{{shear strength}}" [...] and the [...] "yield point" [...] for a soil element from a stress–strain curve. One may define the peak shear strength as the peak of a stress–strain curve, or the shear strength at critical state as the value after large strains when the shear resistance levels off. If the stress–strain curve does not stabilize before the end of shear strength test, the [...] "strength" [...] is sometimes considered to be the shear resistance at 15–20% strain. The shear strength of soil depends on many factors including the effective stress and the void ratio.|$|E
