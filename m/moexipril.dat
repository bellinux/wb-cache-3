50|$|<b>Moexipril</b> is {{available}} as a prodrug <b>moexipril</b> hydrochloride, and is metabolized in the liver to form the pharmacologically active compound moexiprilat. Formation of moexiprilat is caused by hydrolysis of an ethyl ester group. <b>Moexipril</b> is incompletely absorbed after oral administration, and its bioavailability is low. The long pharmacokinetic half-life and persistent ACE inhibition of <b>moexipril</b> allows once-daily administration.|$|E
50|$|As an ACE inhibitor, <b>moexipril</b> {{causes a}} {{decrease}} in ACE. This blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Blockage of angiotensin II limits hypertension within the vasculature. Additionally, <b>moexipril</b> {{has been found to}} possess cardioprotective properties. Rats given <b>moexipril</b> one week prior to induction of myocardial infarction, displayed decreased infarct size. The cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors are mediated through a combination of angiotensin II inhibition and bradykinin proliferation. Increased levels of bradykinin stimulate in the production of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide, which cause vasodilation and continue to exert antiproliferative effects. Inhibition of angiotensin II by <b>moexipril</b> decreases remodeling effects on the cardiovascular system. Indirectly, angiotensin II stimulates of the production of endothelin 1 and 3 (ET1, ET3) and the transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), all of which have tissue proliferative effects that are blocked by the actions of <b>moexipril.</b> The antiproliferative effects of <b>moexipril</b> have also been demonstrated by in vitro studies where <b>moexipril</b> inhibits the estrogen-stimulated growth of neonatal cardiac fibroblasts in rats. Other ACE inhibitors have also been found to produce these actions, as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moexipril</b> is {{generally}} well tolerated in elderly patients with hypertension.Hypotension, dizziness, increased cough, diarrhea, flu syndrome, fatigue, and flushing {{have been found}} to affect less than 6% of patients who were prescribed <b>moexipril.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Moexipril</b> {{is highly}} lipophilic, {{and is in}} the same {{hydrophobic}} range as quinapril, benazepril, and ramipril. Lipophilic ACE inhibitors are able to penetrate membranes more readily, thus tissue ACE may be a target in addition to plasma ACE. A significant reduction in tissue ACE (lung, myocardium, aorta, and kidney) activity has been shown after <b>moexipril</b> use.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} of the all-important dipeptide-like side chain involves alkylation of the tert-butyl ester of L-alanine (2) with ethyl 2-bromo-4-phenylbutanoate (1); the presominane of the desired isomer is attributable to asymmetric induction from the adjacent chiral center. Reaction of the product with hydrogen chloride then cleaves the tert-butyl group to give the half acid (3). Coupling of that acid to the secondary amine on tetrahydroisoquinoline (4) gives the corresponding amine. The tert-butyl ester in this product is again cleaved with hydrogen chloride to afford <b>moexipril</b> (5).|$|E
40|$|Three {{polyvinylchloride}} (PVC) membrane sensors for {{the determination}} of <b>moexipril</b> hydrochloride were prepared and characterized. The sensors {{are based on the}} use of the ion association complexes of <b>moexipril</b> cation with either ammonium reineckate (sensor 1) or tetraphenyl borate (sensor 2) or phosphotungistic acid (sensor 3) counter anions as ion exchange sites in the PVC matrix. The performance characteristics of these sensors were evaluated according to IUPAC recommendations, which reveal a fast, stable and linear response for <b>moexipril</b> over the concentration range of 10 - 6 to 10 - 2 M for the three sensors with cationic slopes of 29. 1, 30. 1 and 30. 2 mV per concentration decade for the three sensors, respectively. The direct potentiometric determination of <b>moexipril</b> hydrochloride using the proposed sensors gave recoveries % of 99. 64 ± 0. 34, 99. 34 ± 0. 56 and 99. 68 ± 0. 42 for the three sensors, respectively. The sensors were used for determination of <b>moexipril</b> hydrochloride in pharmaceutical formulations and in plasma. Validation of the method shows suitability of the proposed sensors for use in quality control assessment of <b>moexipril</b> hydrochloride. The obtained results were in a good agreement with those obtained using the reported spectrophotometric method...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{profile of}} the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor <b>moexipril</b> and its active diacid, moexiprilat, was studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, moexiprilat exhibited a higher inhibitory potency than enalaprilat against both plasma ACE and purified ACE from rabbit lung. Upon oral administration of <b>moexipril</b> (10 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats, plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased to undetectable levels, plasma ACE activity was inhibited by 98 % and plasma angiotensin I concentration increased 8. 6 -fold 1 h after dosing. At 24 h, plasma angiotensin I and angiotensin II concentrations had returned to pretreatment levels, whereas plasma ACE activity was still inhibited by 56 %. Four-week oral administration of <b>moexipril</b> (0. 1 - 30 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered blood pressure and differentially inhibited ACE activity in plasma, lung, aorta, heart and kidney in a dose-dependent fashion. Equidose treatment (10 mg/kg/day) with <b>moexipril</b> and enalapril over 4 weeks led to comparable decreases in blood pressure, inhibition of plasma ACE and reduction of plasma angiotensinogen and to a similar attenuation of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and potentiation of the depressor responses to bradykinin. In contrast, ACE inhibition in aorta, heart and lung was significantly greater with <b>moexipril</b> than with enalapril, whereas in the kidney both drugs inhibited ACE activity to a similar extent. In summary, <b>moexipril</b> is an orally active ACE inhibitor that is comparable to enalapril in potency and duration of antihypertensive activity. The {{results of the present}} study demonstrate that 1) the antihypertensive potency of a given ACE inhibitor cannot be predicted from its in vitro characteristics and 2) the degree of blood pressure reduction does not correlate with tissue ACE inhibition...|$|E
40|$|PDE 4 is one {{of eleven}} known cyclic {{nucleotide}} phosphodiesterase families and plays {{a pivotal role in}} mediating hydrolytic degradation of the important cyclic nucleotide second messenger, cyclic 3 ′ 5 ′ adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PDE 4 inhibitors are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, but their use in the clinic has been hampered by mechanism-associated side effects that limit maximally tolerated doses. In an attempt to initiate the development of better-tolerated PDE 4 inhibitors we have surveyed existing approved drugs for PDE 4 -inhibitory activity. With this objective, we utilised a high-throughput computational approach that identified <b>moexipril,</b> a well tolerated and safe angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, as a PDE 4 inhibitor. Experimentally we showed that <b>moexipril</b> and two structurally related analogues acted in the micro molar range to inhibit PDE 4 activity. Employing a FRET-based biosensor constructed from the nucleotide binding domain of the type 1 exchange protein activated by cAMP, EPAC 1, we demonstrated that <b>moexipril</b> markedly potentiated the ability of forskolin to increase intracellular cAMP levels. Finally, we demonstrated that the PDE 4 inhibitory effect of <b>moexipril</b> is functionally able to induce phosphorylation of the Hsp 20 by cAMP dependent protein kinase A. Our data suggest that <b>moexipril</b> is a bona fide PDE 4 inhibitor that may provide the starting point for development of novel PDE 4 inhibitors with an improved therapeutic window...|$|E

40|$|Aim: {{to study}} {{cerebral}} blood flow and cholesterol metabolism in menopausal women with arterial hypertension (AH); to evaluate dynamics of {{cerebral blood flow}} parameters and plasma lipid concentrations in these patients during 6 -month antihypertensive and hypolipidemic therapy. Material and methods: 24 women with AH of I and II grade were examined. They were in postmenopausal period of life during 7, 1 ± 0, 5 years. At {{the beginning of the}} study all women were prescribed <b>moexipril</b> as monotherapy, daily dose 7, 5 – 15 mg. Patients with initial dislipidemia were prescribed lipid reducing drug atorvastatin in 10 mg daily dose additionally to the antihypertensive therapy. Therefore all the patients were divided into two groups: I – monoteraphy with <b>moexipril</b> (13 people), II – combined therapy with <b>moexipril</b> and atorvastatin (11 people). At the beginning of the study and after 6 months all the patients passed through ultrasonic Dopplerography of vessels of head and neck, rheoencephalography, their lipoproteidogrammes were studied. Results: During 6 -month therapy all the patients showed proved decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, also positive dynamics of neuropsychological status, improvement in cerebral blood flow according to the results of Dopplerography of vessels and rheoencephalography. Normalization of plasma lipid spectrum was noted. More significant positive changes in cerebral hemodynamic parameters and plasma lipid spectrum were observed in patients, who received combined therapy with antihypertensive and lipid reducing drugs. Conclusion: Deterioration of cerebral hemodynamics is typical for women with long-lasting AH. The most positive influence on cerebral perfusion was received due to combined therapy with <b>moexipril</b> and atorvastatin. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{contrast}} to the vasculature, it remains unclear whether oestrogens also directly affect the myocardium. In this study, we addressed basic questions regarding oestrogen effects on the myocardium, including specificity, pathophysiological relevance and potential clinical implications, with a special focus on interactions between oestrogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in an established in-vivo model of cardiac hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were ovarectomized (OVX) or sham-operated and treated with 17 beta-oestradiol (2 microg/kg per day subcutaneously), the oestrogen receptor antagonist ZM- 182780 (250 microg/kg per day subcutaneously) and the ACE-inhibitor <b>moexipril</b> (10 mg/kg per day orally) alone or in combination for 3 months. Hormone replacement restored physiological oestradiol serum levels and prevented uterus atrophy. Whereas <b>moexipril</b> alone was ineffective in OVX rats, substitution of oestradiol restored the beneficial effect of <b>moexipril</b> on systolic blood pressure (- 30 +/- 5 mmHg) and relative heart weight (- 11 +/- 3 %) in OVX rats. Oestradiol upregulated alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA (+ 37 +/- 7 %) and protein expression (+ 43 +/- 6 %) in spite of increased blood pressure in OVX rats. Simultaneous treatment with oestradiol plus <b>moexipril</b> most effectively shifted the ratio of alpha-/beta-MHC mRNA and protein expression towards alpha-MHC in OVX animals. Oestradiol (10 nmol/l) also upregulated alpha-MHC mRNA and protein in cultured cardiac myocytes. The oestrogen receptor antagonist ZM- 182780 significantly inhibited the observed oestrogen effects. CONCLUSIONS: Oestrogen replacement is permissive for the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibition in female SHR rats. Oestrogen effects on the myocardium in vivo are specific (i. e. oestrogen receptor mediated) because they are inhibited by a pure oestrogen receptor antagonist and occur at physiological hormone levels...|$|E

40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and they are commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs especially in patients with renal failure. In this study, the relationships between several molecular properties of eight ACE inhibitors (enalapril, quinapril, fosinopril, ramipril, benazepril, perindopril, <b>moexipril,</b> trandolapril) and their renal elimination data, from relevant literature, were investigated. The ’molecular descriptors of the ACE inhibitors, which included aqueous solubility data (logS); an electronic descriptor, polar surface area (PSA);, a constitutional parameter, molecular mass (Mr); and a geometric descriptor, volume value (Vol), as well as lipophilicity descriptors (logP values), were calculated using different software packages. Simple linear regression analysis showed the best correlation between renal elimination data and lipophilicity descriptor AClogP values (R 2 = 0. 5742). In the next stage of the study, multiple linear regression was applied to assess a higher correlation between the ACE inhibitors’ renal elimination data and lipophilicity, AClogP, with one additional descriptor as an independent variable. Good correlations were established between renal elimination data from the literature and the AClogP lipophilicity descriptor using the constitutional parameter (molecular mass (R 2 = 0. 7425)) or the geometric descriptor (volume value (R 2 = 0. 7224)) as an independent variable.
