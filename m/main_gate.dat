5|$|The southernmost {{part of the}} Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, {{from south}} of DE 10 to north of Bay Road, was placed under {{construction}} in 1990 and opened along with the DoverSmyrna portion of DE 1 in 1993. US 113 traffic needed to use a temporary tie-in during construction, and after the new freeway opened, traffic on the U.S. Highway needed to use Exit 95 to transfer between the new freeway and Bay Road. The extension of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later due {{to the need to}} coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to remediate hazardous material sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new <b>main</b> <b>gate,</b> and reconstruct base housing {{on the west side of}} the highway. The <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> to Dover Air Force base was moved further east, and a diamond interchange was built between the <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> and the base housing area. The upgrade of US 113 and DE 1 through the military base was built in two phases, the first from 1996 to 1998 and the second in 1999 and 2000.|$|E

5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the <b>main</b> <b>gate,</b> and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the <b>main</b> <b>gate,</b> a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and the <b>main</b> <b>gate</b> were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building would have had a structure similar to the Casa Batlló or the porter's lodge of the Park Güell.|$|E
