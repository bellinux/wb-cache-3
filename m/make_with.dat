The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having independently evolved mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared to hypothetical intelligent extraterrestrials. Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and public aquariums.|$|E

Later, Effy's father, Jim (Harry Enfield), discovers his wife's infidelity when his boss, Steve (David Baddiel), arrives at the house, declaring his love for Anthea. Effy grows miserable after Jim leaves the family, and Pandora, desperate for some fun, throws a pyjama party. Effy and Katie Fitch (Megan Prescott) arrive with Pandora at her house for the party and meet her neurotic mother, Angela (Sally Phillips). Disappointed {{by the lack of}} boys, drugs and alcohol because of Angela's strict supervision, Katie spikes the brownies that they <b>make</b> <b>with</b> MDMA. As Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) and Katie's twin sister, Emily (Kathryn Prescott), arrive together, Naomi urges Emily to admit that she is gay, but Emily denies it. All of the girls indulge in the brownies and Pandora is unhappy to see her mother's behaviour grow increasingly erratic. After Angela is carried into a bedroom to sleep, Pandora locks herself in the bathroom, upset about Thomas's departure and angry with Effy, who she believes spiked the brownies.|$|E

5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills their character focuses on can either be left to the choices they <b>make</b> <b>with</b> a series of question, or by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option to modify their character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices.|$|E

25|$|Willis was {{the first}} to number the cranial nerves in the order in which they are now usually {{enumerated}} by anatomists. He noted the parallel lines of the mesolobe (corpus callosum), afterwards minutely described by Félix Vicq-d'Azyr. He seems to have recognised the communication of the convoluted surface of the brain and that between the lateral cavities beneath the fornix. He described the corpora striata and optic thalami; the four orbicular eminences, with the bridge, which he first named annular protuberance; and the white mammillary eminences, behind the infundibulum. In the cerebellum he remarks the arborescent arrangement of the white and grey matter and gives a good account of the internal carotids and the communications which they <b>make</b> <b>with</b> the branches of the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} for an individual to make contributions under an arrangement they themselves <b>make</b> <b>with</b> a provider (such as an insurance company). Similar tax advantages will usually be available as for occupational schemes. Contributions are typically invested during an individual's working life, and then used to purchase a pension at or following retirement. Various names are given to different types of individual arrangement, {{but they are not}} fundamentally different in nature. The generic term personal pension is used to refer to arrangements established since the rules were liberalised in the 1980s (earlier arrangements are usually called retirement annuity contracts), but can be subdivided into other types (such as the Self-invested personal pension, where the member is allowed to direct what their contributions should be invested in).|$|E
25|$|A rosé wine {{incorporates}} some of {{the color}} from the grape skins, {{but not enough to}} qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to <b>make</b> <b>with</b> the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the wort), saignée (removing juice from the must early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and blending (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling, or sparkling, {{with a wide range of}} sweetness levels from dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.|$|E

25|$|Following a {{completed}} tackle, {{all but two}} of the defending team (the markers, see below) must retreat at least ten metres from {{the point at which the}} tackle is made. This distance is marked by the referee. Following the play-the-ball, defenders are permitted to advance to try to put pressure on the attackers and to reduce the distance they can <b>make</b> <b>with</b> the ball. If a defender who has failed to retreat 10 metres interferes with play, then he will be deemed to have been offside and this will result in a penalty to the attacking team. Equally, if a defender advances too quickly before the ball is played, then this will also result in a penalty to the attackers. When a player kicks the ball their teammates must be behind them or they will be called for offside if they interfere with the play.|$|E
25|$|With optimal {{ripeness}} {{and balance}} between acidity and sugars {{being such a}} viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such {{as those in the}} Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers will look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerillé, where it could later be effected by noble rot. In areas that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could <b>make,</b> <b>with</b> the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and dry wine production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production.|$|E
