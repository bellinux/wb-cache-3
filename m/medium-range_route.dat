2500|$|... 1966 saw the {{introduction}} of the Douglas DC-9. This type developed into the backbone of the short- and <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes,</b> and, after convincing Douglas, on behalf of Swissair the Douglas Corporation offered a stretched variant: the DC-9-32. For the first time, Swissair was the launching customer of an aircraft type.|$|R
50|$|Based on the {{cancelled}} XB-42, {{the program}} began shortly {{after the end of}} World War II. It was intended to operate on short- and <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes,</b> carrying between 40 and 48 passengers in a then-novel pressurized cabin (which had been pioneered by the Boeing 307 in 1938, but was still not in standard airline use).|$|R
2500|$|The Latécoère 340 (sometimes written 34-0) was a three-engined {{flying boat}} {{designed}} to serve <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes,</b> {{such as those}} across the Mediterranean from France to her African colonies. [...] In general appearance it {{was similar to the}} Latécoère 21, with a parasol wing bearing two tractor and one central pusher engines, and used sponsons both for stability on the water and extra lift in the air. [...] It was smaller than the Latécoère 21, carrying only five passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The An-74 was {{initially}} an upgrade of the An-72 test aircraft, {{intended to be}} used in the Arctic and Antarctica; and had the designation An-72A [...] "Arctic". The aircraft's main purpose is to deliver cargo, equipment and personnel over short- and <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes</b> in any climatic conditions ranging from −60 °C to +45 °C and at any latitude, including the North Pole, and high altitudes. It can operate to and from low grade airstrips such as concrete, pebble, ice and snow aerodromes.|$|R
5000|$|Cubana had {{received}} it last three completely new IL-62Ms in late 1990 (CU-T1282)) and early 1991 (CU-T1283 and 1284), from the Kazan, USSR, factory that manufactured these aircraft. [...] Two other, also new, IL-62Ms had been delivered in 1988 and 1989. Cubana was therefore {{able to keep}} most of these aircraft in service long after the USSR's dissolution (in 1991) {{and the end of}} all IL-62M production in the mid-1990s. Its long experience with these aircraft made it possible to keep them flying, to sustain some of its long- and <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes</b> in the 1990s and beyond (Cubana's last IL-62M in regularly scheduled service was retired in 2011).|$|R
50|$|In December 1988, Saab {{decided to}} build a {{stretched}} derivative of its successful Saab 340 twin-turboprop regional airliner. The new aircraft was planned to meet a perceived demand for a high-speed 50-seat turboprop with good climb performance which could operate over short- and <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes</b> with similar block times to jet aircraft while retaining the efficiency provided by turboprop engines. The new airliner, called the Saab 2000, was formally launched in May 1989, with Saab already having firm orders for 46 aircraft and options for a further 147. The aircraft was assembled at Saab's Linköping factory, with major subcontractors including CASA, who built the aircraft's wings, Short Brothers, who built the rear fuselage and Valmet who built the aircraft's tail surfaces. The Saab 2000 first flew on 26 March 1992 and entered into scheduled airline service in September 1994, {{a few months after}} its certification by the Joint Aviation Authorities in March and the Federal Aviation Administration in April.|$|R
50|$|The 727 {{followed}} the 707, a quad-jet airliner, {{with which it}} shares its upper fuselage cross-section and cockpit design. The 727-100 first flew in February 1963 and entered service with Eastern Air Lines in February 1964; the stretched 727-200 flew in July 1967 and entered service with Northeast Airlines that December. The 727 became a mainstay of airlines' domestic route networks and was also used on short- and <b>medium-range</b> international <b>routes.</b> Passenger, freighter, and convertible versions of the 727 were built.|$|R
5000|$|The 727 {{proved to}} be such a {{reliable}} and versatile airliner that it came to form the core of many startup airlines' fleets. The 727 was successful with airlines worldwide partly because it could use smaller runways while still flying <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes.</b> This allowed airlines to carry passengers from cities with large populations, but smaller airports to worldwide tourist destinations. One of the features that gave the 727 its ability to land on shorter runways was its clean wing design. [...] With no wing-mounted engines, leading-edge devices (Krueger, or hinged, flaps on the inner wing and extendable leading edge slats out to the wingtip) and trailing-edge lift enhancement equipment (triple-slotted, fowler flaps) could be used on the entire wing. Together, these high-lift devices produced a maximum wing lift coefficient of 3.0 (based on the flap-retracted wing area). The 727 was stable at very low speeds compared to other early jets, but some domestic carriers learned after review of various accidents that the 40-degree flaps setting could result in a higher-than-desired sink rate or a stall on final approach. These carriers' Pilots' Operation Handbooks disallowed using more than 30° of flaps on the 727, even going so far as installing plates on the flap lever slot to prevent selection of more than 30° of flaps.|$|R
50|$|The airline's first jet aircraft, a Boeing 727-100C was {{acquired}} in 1971 {{to enable the}} airline to service longer-range international routes to Paris, Marseille and Casablanca. The 727 was joined not long after by a Boeing 737-100 for use on <b>medium-range</b> regional <b>routes</b> in Africa. By , Air Mali had 577 employees; at this time, the fleet included one Antonov An-24B, one Boeing 707-320C, one Boeing 727-100C, one Ilyushin Il-18 and two Twin Otters that flew international routes to Abidjan, Accra, Banjul, Brazzaville, Casablanca, Conakry, Douala, Freetown, Lagos, Libreville, Lome, Monrovia, Niamey and Paris, and domestic services to Gao, Goundam, Kayes, Kenieba, Mopti, Nara, Nioro, Timbuctou and Yelimane.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the {{airlines}} who ordered the MD-11 for their long-haul passenger flights had {{replaced it with}} Airbus A330, A340 and Boeing 777 aircraft {{by the end of}} 2004. Some carriers converted their MD-11s to freighters such as China Eastern Airlines and Korean Air. Korean Air announced as early as December 1994 its intention to convert its five-passenger MD-11s to freighters for <b>medium-range</b> cargo <b>routes.</b> [...] In 1995, American Airlines agreed to sell its 19 aircraft to FedEx, with the first MD-11 being transferred in 1996. Japan Airlines (JAL) announced the replacement of its 10 MD-11s in 2000; these aircraft were being converted into freighters and sold to UPS.|$|R
40|$|The present article {{discusses}} {{and analyses}} the major {{impacts of the}} Brazilian carriers fleet renewal regarding Brazilian airport infrastructure in the most important region of the country, the Southeast (SE). A brief historical overview of the country's airline fleet will be presented, demonstrating the need for its renewal (m fact, Brazilian carriers started a major fleet renewal program m the last five years), while analyzing the periods in which {{a new breed of}} aircraft was put into service by the major carriers operating in the SE region. The trend of operating the classic regional jets plus the forthcoming entry into service of the "large regional jets" (LRJ, 70 - 115 seaters) in several point-to-point routes are presented along with the country's carriers" reality of operating these former aircraft in several high-capacity and <b>medium-range</b> <b>routes.</b> The article will focus on the ability of four of the major Southeast's airports to cope with the fleet modernization, mainly {{due to the fact that}} the region studied is the most socioeconomic developed, by far, with the largest demand for air transportation, thus making the impacts much more perceptible for the communities and the airport management involved. With the emergence of these impacts, several new projects and investments are being discussed and pushed forward, despite budgetary constrains being a reality in almost every Brazilian city, even in the SE region. In view of this, the paper presents how the general planning could be carried out in order to adapt the airports' infrastructures in function of the proposed (and in some cases, necessary) fleet renewal. Ultimately, we will present the present picture and two future scenarios m order to determine the level of service in the existent passenger terminal facilities in the wake of the possible operation of several new aircraft.

5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, <b>medium-range,</b> transcontinental trunk <b>routes.</b> Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} four years, and under {{pressure}} from the EC authorities, most constraints on air transport prices in the European Community have been removed. This paper concentrates on the effects of increased competition on fare behaviour. It uses an unpublished 1990 dataset on eight fare categories adopted by Alitalia on <b>medium-range</b> international <b>routes</b> (Europe, North Africa, Middle East). Using an index of competitive pressure on Alitalia, we find that competition is stronger in the EC than elsewhere in the medium-range markets. Moreover, increases in the degree of competition cause average fares to fall, and fare variability to increase, as new lower fares are introduced, or passengers are allowed easier access to low fares which already exist. In non-EC medium-range (still regulated) markets, the determination of fares does not seem to depend on the number of carriers serving each route, as the presence of many `competitors' [...] who in fact collude [...] may even suggest the existence of a market where prices can actually increase.

5000|$|The A300B11, a {{derivative}} of the A310, was designed upon {{the availability of}} [...] "ten ton" [...] engines. It would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and {{have a range of}} 6000 nmi km. It was deemed the replacement for the less-efficient Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s still in service. The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engine at the time. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, <b>medium-range,</b> transcontinental trunk <b>routes.</b> The B9 would offer the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, but would use between 25% to 38% less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered the replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar.|$|R
