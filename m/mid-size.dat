5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on <b>mid-size,</b> high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new <b>mid-size</b> narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, Commodore sales were {{beginning}} to decline. Holden's six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more fuel-efficient or better performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by {{the time of}} the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own <b>mid-size</b> Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E
5|$|In its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus {{estimated}} {{the demand for}} 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA), with more than 400 seats : 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019. The market is estimated for two decades at more than 1,700 by Airbus and 700 by Boeing since 1999-2000, including freighters. In 2006, industry analysts Philip Lawrence of the Aerospace Research Centre in Bristol anticipated 880 sales by 2025 with Airbus having conducted the most extensive and thorough market analysis of commercial aviation ever undertaken, justifying its VLA plans to design the A380 by the spoke-hub distribution paradigm while Richard Aboulafia of the consulting Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia anticipated 400 {{with the rise of}} <b>mid-size</b> aircraft and market fragmentation reducing them to niche markets, making such plans unjustified in a point-to-point transit model.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar {{became the first}} {{generation}} of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its 727, the twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The <b>mid-size</b> 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.|$|E
40|$|Methods {{of entry}} and {{expansion}} 1. We asked the Large and <b>Mid-Sized</b> Operators to provide {{outlines of the}} methods by which they have expanded their services in their existing areas of operations and the methods by which they have entered new operating areas {{in the five years}} to spring 2010. 1 In the remainder of this appendix, we refer to expansion as expanding within an existing area of operation and entry as beginning operations in a new geographic area, although we note that entry into a new area may be followed by a period of expansion and so the distinction is not always clear-cut. In addition, we asked Large and <b>Mid-Sized</b> Operators to define their areas of operation, and so what they define as entry into a new area or expansion within an existing area will depend on these definitions, and there may be differences across the definitions used by different operators. Therefore, the figures on both entry and expansion should be read in parallel. The evidence from Small Operators is discussed in the next sections on: history of entry, expansion and exit; and incidence of entry and expansion. 2.

5|$|Rivalry came {{predominantly}} {{from the}} Ford Falcon—also locally built. Prior {{to the second}} generation Commodore of 1988, the Holden was positioned a full class below the full-size Falcon. To varying degrees, competition also came from <b>mid-size</b> offerings from Toyota Australia as well as Chrysler Australia, which morphed into Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Moreover, between 1989 and 1997, Australian federal government policy saw {{the launch of the}} Toyota Lexcen, which was a rebadged version of the second generation Commodore. With the introduction of the third generation in 1997, Holden implemented its largest export programs involving Commodore and its derivatives. In the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil, the Commodore sold as a Chevrolet. High-performance export versions followed in North America, sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet. HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall, in the Middle East as Chevrolet Special Vehicles (CSV) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 757 is a <b>mid-size,</b> narrow-body {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common type rating {{that allows them to}} operate both aircraft.|$|E

It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, Boeing's 747 {{became the}} first {{wide-body}} jetliner to enter service. The 747 was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies. To defray {{the high cost of}} development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a <b>mid-size,</b> transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.|$|E
5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a <b>mid-size</b> 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was {{the first stage of}} a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E
