30|$|The term {{encephalocele}} {{represents the}} herniation of cranial contents through a {{defect in the}} skull. If herniation of only cerebrospinal fluid and meninges exists, it is termed as meningocele. The herniation of the cerebrospinal fluid and meninges, along with the brain tissue, is termed as <b>meningoencephalocele</b> (Cote and Miller 2010). In Southeast Asia, the incidence of <b>meningoencephalocele</b> is one in 5000 live births (Creighton et al. 1974). The anaesthetic management of the airway may be challenging in neonates and young infants with large neck mass such as a huge occipital <b>meningoencephalocele.</b> Occipital <b>meningoencephalocele</b> poses challenges to an anaesthesiologist because of inadequate extension of the neck and inability to lay down the neonate in the supine position on the table, which makes the optimal position for intubation difficult.|$|E

30|$|So, in conclusion, the {{perioperative}} {{management of}} a case of occipital <b>meningoencephalocele</b> may pose challenges both for an anaesthesiologist and a neurosurgeon. In our case, a neonate with a huge occipital <b>meningoencephalocele,</b> the problems encountered were essentially because of its large size, positioning during induction and intubation and blood loss during resection of large amount of redundant skin. Thus, added attention should be paid to look for other congenital abnormalities along with proper positioning, perfect handling of airways and replacement of blood loss intraoperatively.|$|E

40|$|Sponsorships or {{competing}} interests {{that may be}} relevant to content are dis-closed {{at the end of}} this article. Objective. Sinonasal <b>meningoencephalocele</b> is a rare defect, with varying etiologies and treatment strategies. Here we present the largest published series from a single institution of patients with endoscopic repair. The primary goal is to examine rates of success with consideration to accompany-ing patient demographic data. The secondary goal is to report the results stratified by defect and reconstruction type. Design. Retrospective consecutive case series. Setting. Tertiary care academic center. Subjects and Methods. Consecutive patients with CPT codes for skull base <b>meningoencephalocele</b> repair between May 2000 and March 2013 were reviewed. Patients who specifi-cally had sinonasal defects were included. Results. During the study period, 149 cases of sinonasal meningoencephaloceles were managed in 133 patients. Mean follow-up was 21. 3 months (range, 0 - 116). There was a success rate of 88 % for initial repair, with mean recurrence time of 8. 3 months (range, 0 - 38), and a suc-cess rate of 93. 8 % for initial recurrence surgery, with 99. 3 % of ultimate successful repair. All cases were repaired endoscopically. Recurrence rate was not signifi-cantly related to location of defect (P =. 682), size of defect (P =. 434), particular reconstruction technique (P =. 163), or etiology (trauma, P =. 070). Overall complication rate was 11. 3 %. Conclusion. Endoscopic sinonasal <b>meningoencephalocele</b> repair has excellent long-term results and may be consid-ered as a primary approach.

40|$|Introduction - Prenatal {{counseling}} {{with regards}} to the prognosis of a cerebellar abnormality is hindered not only by the diverse clinical presentations but also by the presence of subtle findings. We present a case of a distinct combination of asymmetric cerebellar hypoplasia secondary to an anterior <b>meningoencephalocele</b> through a clival defect that caused a severe airway obstruction in the newborn. Case Description - A 21 -year-old gravida 4 para 0 mother with a dichorionic–diamniotic twin pregnancy was referred for a second trimester sonographic survey. An asymmetric cerebellar hypoplasia, mega cisterna magna, and a pharyngeal cystic mass were noted on twin A. Magnetic resonance imaging report confirmed posterior fossa abnormalities and shed no light on the differential diagnosis of the cystic mass. The pregnancy ended by Cesarean delivery at 32 weeksʼ gestation after a preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Twin A had a severe airway obstruction. Postnatal evaluation confirmed a midline anterior <b>meningoencephalocele</b> through a defect in the clivus. The microarray chromosomal analysis demonstrated a 5 q 15 variant with uncertain clinical significance. Conclusion - Antenatal recognition of the unique combination of a cerebellar hypoplasia with a pharyngeal cyst can impact the prenatal counseling as well as neonatal management...|$|E
40|$|A meningoencefalocele transesfenoidal é rara apresentação dos disrafismos do tubo neural. Caracteriza-se pela herniação do tecido neural através de uma falha óssea no osso esfenóide. A apresentação clínica é variável, podendo ser desde assintomática até obstrução das vias aéreas, rinorréia, meningite, disfunção hipotalâmica e anomalias ópticas. Seu tratamento cirúrgico é controverso. Descrevemos o caso de um menino de 7 anos que apresentava uma estrutura pulsátil preenchendo o teto da cavidade oral, disgenesia palatina e hipertelorismo. O diagnóstico de meningoencefalocele transesfenoidal transpalatina foi confirmado pela tomografia computadorizada e ressonância magnética. A criança foi operada com sucesso pela via transpalatal/transesfenoidal. Transspheinoidal <b>meningoencephalocele</b> {{is a rare}} {{presentation}} of dysraphism of the neural tube.

This study {{presents}} the techniques and results of endoscopic diagnosis and repair of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulae involving the anterior skull base and paranasal sinuses. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic repair of anterior skull base CSF fistulae. SETTING: Tertiary referral institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients underwent endoscopic repair of CSF fistula. Thirteen cases were traumatic in origin, 11 spontaneous {{not associated with}} <b>meningoencephalocele</b> and 12 with <b>meningoencephalocele.</b> Eleven were iatrogenic and five associated with transphenoidal pituitary surgery, two acute and three delayed following radiotherapy. The average age of patients was 43 and the male to female ratio was 2 : 1. A variety of techniques were used to repair the dural defect. In {{the majority of cases}} placement of a fat plug on the intracranial surface of the dura was performed. RESULTS: Forty-seven of the 52 patients had successful primary endoscopic repair of the CSF fistula and skull base defect. Five patients required a repeat procedure due to early failure of the repair. After an average follow-up of 27 months no patient has had any recurrence of leak giving a primary closure success rate of 90 % and secondary closure rate of 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic transnasal approach for repair of anterior skull base CSF fistula is a reliable technique and is now the procedure of choice for patients presenting with this problem. R.

40|$|A 6 -week-old boy {{presented}} with failure to thrive, pulmonary stenosis and stridor, which had worsened since birth. He also had undescended testes. On examination, he was noted to have facial asymmetry and his left eyelid did not close fully. He was noted {{to have a}} broad nose with a pit in {{the skin of his}} nose at the junction of the nasal bones and upper lateral cartilages in the midline from which hairs grew. His left ear was low set. He required laser laryngoplasty for severe laryngomalacia. Following investigations including computed tomography and MRI of the nose, brain and skull base, this pit was shown to continue up to the anterior skull base as a sinus tract. There was a defect in the skull floor anterior to the crista galli, and the crista galli itself was bifid. These clinical and radiological changes are consistent with the fibrous tract running from the nasal skin to the anterior cranial fossa floor being the embryological remnants of a nasal <b>meningoencephalocele.</b> Beneath the broad nasal bones was a widened nasal septum in the area enclosing the fibrous tract of the atrophied <b>meningoencephalocele.</b> The fibrous tract and nasal pit were removed from below and may require more extensive clearance if cysts or gliomas appear along the tract in the future.
