5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien (JTWC designation: 08S) was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that caused minor damage in Madagascar. Forming on December 30, 2001, Cyprien quickly strengthened {{in a slightly}} favorable environment. By January2, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) according to Météo-France and 95km/h (60mph) according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Later that day the storm made landfall in Morombe, at a weaker intensity, and dissipated early on January3. Throughout the affected areas, Cyprien destroyed 957 structures, leaving 1.16billion <b>Malagasy</b> <b>franc</b> (2002 MGF; US$181,000) in damages. No fatalities were reported; however two people were listed as missing.|$|E

Damages in the area amounted to 1.1billion <b>Malagasy</b> <b>franc</b> (2002 MGF; US$172,507). North of Morombe, the city of Morondava also sustained significant damage; roughly 1,000 people were affected and 661 homes were destroyed. Numerous homes were inundated by floodwaters. Officials reported that floodwaters persisted until January9. Damages in the city amounted to 60million MGF (2002 MGF; US$9,287).

The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion <b>Malagasy</b> <b>francs.</b> He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion <b>Malagasy</b> <b>francs,</b> and declared 77 million <b>Malagasy</b> <b>francs</b> in annual revenues.

50|$|In {{the area}} of education, an effort to {{increase}} the literacy of the rural population was undertaken, with the civic service's young conscripts playing a notable role. Primary education was available in most cities and villages. The expenditure on education exceeded 8 billion <b>Malagasy</b> <b>francs</b> in 1960 and was more than 20 billion by 1970 - a rise from 5.8% to 9.0% of GDP. This enabled the primary school workforce to be doubled from 450,000 to nearly a million, the secondary school workforce to be quadrupled from 26,000 to 108,000 and the higher education workforce to be sextupled from 1,100 to 7,000. Lycées were opened in all provinces, {{as well as the}} transformation of the Centre of Higher Studies of Tananarive into the University of Madagascar in October 1961. As a result of this increased education, Tsiranana planned to establish a number of Malagasy technical and administrative groups.|$|R

5000|$|Andrianarivo's {{trial began}} on December 22, 2003, and on December 24, {{he was convicted}} of {{embezzlement}} and usurping powers and was sentenced to 12 years of hard labor. He was also fined 42 billion <b>Malagasy</b> <b>francs,</b> about $7.6 million U.S. dollars: about $7.4 million to repay the allegedly embezzled money, and another $200,000 in damages. The prosecution argued that Andrianarivo was not legitimately the Prime Minister when he withdrew the money, and that he therefore did so illegally. Andrianarivo argued that, despite Ravalomanana's nomination of Sylla as Prime Minister, he remained legally Prime Minister until he was detained on 27 May 2002, due to the absence of a decree abrogating his nomination up to that point; he said that it had been necessary to withdraw the money for the payment of wages and other administrative purposes. According to Amnesty International, the trial was [...] "marred by irregularities". His health was also said to be poor at the time. In Ravalomanana's 2003 end of the year speech, he revealed that Andrianarivo was allowed to seek medical treatment abroad.|$|R
5000|$|The {{economic}} policy instituted by Tsiranana's administration incorporated a neo-liberal ethos, combining encouragement of (national and foreign) private initiative and tate intervention. In 1964, a five year plan was adopted, setting out the major government investment plans. These {{focused on the}} development of agriculture and support for farmers. For the realisation of this plan, it was envisaged that the private sector would contribute 55 billion <b>Malagasy</b> <b>francs.</b> To encourage this investment, the government set out to create a regime favourable to lenders using four institutions: the Institut d'Émission Malgache, the state treasury, the Malagasy National Bank, and above all the National Investment Sociey, which participated in some of the larger Malagasy and foreign commercial and industrial enterprises. To ensure the confidence of foreign capitalists, Tsiranana condemned the principal of Nationalisation: I am a liberal socialist. Consequently, the state should play its part in making the private sector free. We, we need to fill the gaps, because {{we do not want to}} create a lazy nationalisation, but on the contrary a dynamic one, which is to say that we must not despoil others and that the state should only intervene where the private sector is deficient.

5|$|Supporters among Ravalomanana's {{high-level}} Tiko staff {{established a}} group to promote his campaign, which he named Tiako Iarivo ("I Love Antananarivo"). The candidate spent over 700 million <b>Malagasy</b> <b>francs</b> on the campaign, drawn from the proceeds of his business and private donations. His campaign staff widely distributed promotional posters featuring the candidate's face, name and slogan, and handed out free Tiko yogurts and boxes of milk to the public. Ravalomanana's campaign posters often featured the Tiko logo and images of the candidate riding a bicycle laden with milk canisters to play on his image as a simple and poor farmer who, through intelligence, determination and responsible management, succeeded in developing a thriving business and would apply these same skills to develop the capital city. The Ravalomanana campaign received support {{on the basis of}} his evident success as a manager, his leadership in the Christian community and his non-alignment with Ratsiraka's AREMA party, as well as his relative youthfulness and physical attractiveness to female voters. The campaign opened on 2 November 1999, and by 8 November Ravalomanana held a led in the polls. In the 14 November municipal elections, Ravalomanana was elected mayor of Antananarivo with 45 per cent of the votes.|$|R
50|$|In theory, two {{countries}} currently use non-decimal currency: Mauritania (1 ouguiya = 5 khoums) and Madagascar (1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja). In practice, however, {{the value of}} the main unit in each case is so low (less than 1/1000 of a United States dollar) that the sub-unit is not of any practical use and is rarely seen in circulation. In the case of the iraimbilanja, this is a carryover of the Madagascar's previous currency, the <b>Malagasy</b> <b>franc,</b> which had the ariary as a super unit worth 5 francs, and iraimbilanja was an alternate term for the franc. The last major countries to use non-decimal currencies in practice were the United Kingdom (until 1971), Ireland (1971), Malta (1972) and Nigeria (1973).|$|E

50|$|Over {{the course}} of his life, Rakoto Frah was commemorated by fellow artists and by the {{government}} of Madagascar, which issued him numerous awards and commendations throughout his career. The design for the 1,000 <b>Malagasy</b> <b>franc</b> (200 ariary) banknote first printed by the Central Bank in 1983 depicted Rakoto Frah dressed in a traditional straw hat and lamba and playing the sodina. He is the only artist to have been featured on a Malagasy banknote. According to a representative of the Central Bank, the artist was selected because he was the most representative of the Malagasy identity. After the Rakoto Frah banknote design was discontinued in the 1990s it became a rare collector's item valued in 2011 at over 100,000 ariary, more than 500 times its face value. The artist was also invited by international filmmakers to feature in two French films: the Madagascar documentary L'Ile Rouge released in 1992 by French director Jean-Michel Carré, and an eponymous documentary about the artist himself, produced by director Camille Marchand in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|The sodina, an end-blown flute, is {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} oldest instruments on the island. [...] There exists the more common and well-known short sodina, about a foot long with six finger holes and one for the thumb, and another similar end-blown flute over two feet long with three holes at the far end. Both are open-ended and are played by blowing diagonally across the near opening. [...] The master of sodina performance, Rakoto Frah, was featured on the 1000 <b>Malagasy</b> <b>franc</b> (200 ariary) banknote after independence in 1960 and his death on September 29, 2001 prompted national mourning.The conch shell (antsiva or angaroa) is a similarly ancient instrument believed to have been brought over by early Indonesian settlers. Mainly played by men, it features a lateral blow hole in the Polynesian style and is typically reserved for ritual or spiritual uses rather than to create music for entertainment. [...] The fipple flute is a simple aerophone brought to Madagascar after 1000 CE by immigrants from Africa.|$|E
