50|$|The site {{supports}} {{a range of}} habitats which include unimproved calcareous grassland, woodland and scrub, cliff faces and scree slopes. The grassland is of major importance and it comprises a tall ungrazed sward. This is dominated by tor-grass, upright <b>brome,</b> <b>meadow</b> oat-grass, sweet vernal-grass and quaking grass. It is noted for its range of herbs which include salad burnet, common rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil. The quarry floors support wild thyme, dwarf thistle, yellow-wort and autumn gentian. The site supports many plants which are scarce at a national or county level. These include fly orchid, musk orchid and purple milk-vetch. It {{is one of a}} small number of sites which support meadow clary in the county.|$|R
50|$|Hunsdon Mead {{is located}} between the River Stort and the Stort Navigation. It is {{unimproved}} grassland which {{is subject to}} winter flooding. As {{a result of its}} location and traditional management it supports a number of uncommon plants. Notable grass species include <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> and the quaking grass briza media, and there are other unusual flora such as pepper saxifrage and green-winged orchid. Roydon Mead lies east of the Stort Navigation, and both have large flocks of over-wintering birds.|$|E

5000|$|Bromus {{species are}} {{generally}} considered to have little economic value to humans, at least in present times. The Tarahumara Indians in northern Mexico use the grains of some native Bromus species to aid fermentation in making one of their cultural beverages. As names like poverty brome (B. sterilis) and ripgut brome (B. diandrus) attest, some species are not very useful as fodder because their leaves sclerotize quickly and may even be harmful to livestock due to the high silica content. Others, such as <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus riparius), native to parts of Russia, are planted as forage in the Great Plains of North America. Brome grasses are not usually grown as ornamental plants due to most species' nondescript appearance. Some are useful to prevent erosion but such use must be cautiously controlled as most Bromus {{have the ability to}} spread, becoming invasive weeds. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is a particularly troublesome weed across much of western North America (from southern British Columbia to California.) ...|$|E
50|$|Tan spot {{is found}} {{primarily}} on wheat, {{but is also}} found to infect other cereals and grasses including triticale, barley, and rye, but are less frequently affected.Other grass species effected by the pathogen include Siberian wheat grass, sand bluestem, <b>meadow</b> <b>brome,</b> sheep fescue, June grass, little bluestem, green foxtail, needle and thread, and tall wheatgrass.While these are not necessarily agriculture crop hosts such as wheat, the pathogen is able to form and survive on many grass hosts, which can eventually venture into wheat fields. Other important grass susceptible hosts include smooth brome {{which can be found}} in pastures, as well as quack grass that is found in the environment and considered a weed in many agricultural crops. Lesions typically appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and initially are tan to brown specks. Eventually, the tan to brown specks expand to larger irregular, oval, lens-shaped, ellipse, tan blotches with a yellow ring around them. The yellow ring {{is often referred to as}} a halo, yellow discoloration as chlorosis, and browning/death of leaf tissue as necrosis. The development of a dark brown to black spot in the center the lesion is characteristic of the disease. If warmer temperatures and moist conditions persist, spores known as conidia will move up plant as secondary inoculum and can also infect head/spikes. Symptoms on the head are indistinct, but can cause brownish glumes, and grains can have a reddish appearance similar to the pathogen Fusarium.|$|E
5000|$|The site {{is thought}} to be the last {{remaining}} example of a Thames valley hay meadow in Surrey. It contains a range of lime-loving (calcicole) plants which are characteristic of this type of meadow. The grassland is dominated by rough-stalked meadow grass Poa trivialis, crested dog’s-tail grass Cynosurus cristatus, and lesser knapweed Centaurea nigra. Yellow rattle Rhinanthus minor, meadow-fescue grass Festuca pratensis, meadow barley Hordeum secalinum, smooth hawk’s-beard Crepis capillaris and common reed Phragmites australis are locally abundant, the last species being unusual in such dry situations. Other frequent species include <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> Bromus commutatus, a grass only recorded from one other Surrey location in recent years, meadow foxtail grass Alopecurus pratensis, Yorkshire-fog grass Holcus lanatus, pepper saxifrage Silaum silaus and meadow-sweet Filipendula ulmaria.

40|$|It {{produces}} good hay yields, both in monoculture and {{in mixtures}} with alfalfa (Medicago spp.), where its stiff stems tend to keep alfalfa from lodging. Intermediate wheatgrass has fairly slow re-growth following clipping and is best adapted to single crophaying conditions (where rainfall patterns or limited irrigation prevents multiple cuttings in a season). Intermediate wheatgrass responds {{very well to}} irrigation with initial production nearing the level of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) and <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus biebersteinii) and exceeding smooth brome (Bromus inermis) under full irrigation. <b>Meadow</b> <b>brome</b> and orchardgrass have much better regrowth characteristics and will normally produce more than intermediate wheatgrass for hay production in multiple cutting situations. Intermediate wheatgrass responds very well to limited irrigation. It is able to tolerate droughty conditions when irrigation ceases as long as about 12 - 14 inches or more total annual moisture is provided. It provides excellent spring, early summer, and fall pasture, but must be carefully managed to ensure maintenance of the stand and high production. Intermediate wheatgrass is palatable to all classes of livestock and wildlife. It is a preferred feed for cattle, sheep, horses, deer, antelope, and elk in spring, early summer and fall.

40|$|The {{practice}} of stockpiling forage {{for the fall}} and winter has become a popular feeding strategy used to extend the grazing season and maintain profitability of beef operation in the Canadian Great Plains Region. This thesis research was conducted in the field to determine the potential of perennial and annual species with the major focus on stockpiled forage dry matter yield and late fall forage quality. Five cultivars from four grass species and three cultivars from two legume species were seeded using grass-legume binary mixture or monocultures for the perennial forage trial, and managed under two different stockpile initiation treatments. Five cool-season and two warm-season species were selected for an annual forage stockpiling trial. Cool-season perennial stands yielded higher but had lower quality in a relatively dry and cool growing season compared with the stands that experienced a warm and wet summer. Early stockpile initiation resulted in longer accumulation period and significantly higher (P < 0. 05) regrowth yield compared with late stockpile initiation. Stockpiled dry matter yield ranged from 1. 5 to 3. 6 Mg ha- 1 with <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> [(Bromus riparius Rehm.) cv. Fleet], mixed with alfalfa [(Medicago sativa L.) cv. Algonquin] having the highest production. <b>Meadow</b> <b>brome</b> and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) in mixed stands with legumes had significantly higher production than pure stands of cicer milkvetch (Astragalus Cicer L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) as well as mixed stands of hybrid brome [(Bromus inermis Leyss. x Bromus riparius Rehm.) cv. Success (S) ] and cicer milkvetch (Astragalus Cicer L.). The latter three together with both pure alfalfa stands failed to meet the minimum stockpiled yield requirement for winter stockpiling of forage species. Tall fescue stands had the highest stockpiled yield among all pure stands. Late stockpile initiation provided more nutritious forage than the earlier initiation, however, the nutritive value of all species was adequate for a variety of grazing animals in different production stages regardless of the stockpile initiation date. Warm-season annuals generally exhibited higher stockpiled dry matter production than cool-season annuals. The overall results showed that many of the tested perennial and annual forage species provided adequate forage production and nutritive value for stockpiled grazing in the Great Plains region of western Canada...|$|E
40|$|Five {{irrigated}} forages {{in western}} Nebraska were evaluated under rotation grazing with yearling steers. Average daily gains, live weight gain/ha and grazing potentials were determined from 1977 through 1979. Three of the forages were evaluated during 1978 and 1979 for forage yield, forage disappearance per kg of live weight gain and forage quality. ^ Cumulative forage yield available prior to grazing during spring through late summer was determined for alfalfa, cicer milkvetch, and a grass mixture composed of smooth brome (Bromus inermis), <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus biebersteinii), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), and creeping foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus). Cumulative forage yields (14, 315, 15, 040, and 13, 634 kg/ha, respectively) were not different (P 3 ̆e. 05). ^ Forage disappearance per steer averaged 8. 78, 10. 73, and 6. 71 kg/day for alfalfa, cicer milkvetch, {{and the grass}} mixture, respectively.

40|$|Purpose. To assess {{introduced}} {{samples of}} drought-resistant species of perennial grasses, select a promising parent material and create on its base high-yielding varie­ ies with economic characters. Methods. Field experiment, laboratory testing. Results. The results {{of studies on}} introduction and breeding were given aimed to improve drought tolerance of non-traditional perennial grasses under {{the conditions of the}} Right-Bank Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine. Based on the selected parent material, varieties were created by the use of hybridization and ecotype breeding methods and then entered into the State Register of plant varieties suitable for dissemination in Ukraine, among them: intermediate wheatgrass (Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski) – ‘Hors’, crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.) – ‘Petrivskyi’; <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus riparia Rehm.) – ‘Boian’; slender wheatgrass (Roegneria trachycaulon (Link) Nevski) – ‘Co­umb’. As compared with conventional, relatively drought-tolerant species of smooth brome (Bromopsis inermis (Leyss.) Holub) – ‘Mars’, increment of dry matter content of these species in the extreme drought conditions of 2011 was increased by 1, 52 – 3, 73 t/ha. Under more sufficient moistening conditions of 2012, slender wheatgrass ‘Columb’ was {{at the level of the}} сheck variety in terms of this indicator. Other varieties exceeded it by 1. 44 – 3. 22 t/ha. The data was given including seed productivity and sowing quality indicators, after-ripening duration and economic fitness of seeds. Conclusions.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine optimal species combinations of binary grass-legume mixtures to improve forage production and pasture nutritive value in irrigated pastures of the Intermountain West. The study was conducted at the Utah State University Intermountain Pature Research Facility near Lewiston, UT. Tall Fescue (TF), Orchardgrass (OG), and <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> (MB) were grown with alfalfa (ALF), birdsfoot trefoil (BFTF), and cicer milkvetch (CMV) in legume-grass mixes and monocultures at planting ratios of 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25. Grass monocultures were fertilized with 0 (0 N), 67 (67 N), or 134 kg N ha- 1 (134 N). Forage was harvested four times each season during 2011 - 2012. Forage of the mixtures and monocultures from the first and third harvests was analyzed for crude protein (CP) and neutral-detergent fiber (NDF). Average forage production of the unfertilized TF, MB, and OG monocultures was 11. 03, 9. 76, and 8. 10 Mg ha- 1, respectively. TF-ALF, OG-ALF, and MB-ALF grass-legume mixes averaged 24. 0, 35. 0, and 41. 0 % higher forage production than their respective unfertilized grass monocultures. The grass-legume mixtures with the highest CP were MB-ALF 159, TF-ALF 159, and TF-OG- 159 g kg- 1 and average 59, 43 and 51 % higher than their respective unfertilized grass monocultures. Likewise, the mixtures with the lowest NDF were OG-ALF 453 g kg- 1, OG-BFTF 469 g kg- 1, and MB-ALF 480 g kg- 1. These mixtures had 10, 7, and 18 % lower NDF than their respective unfertilized grass monocultures. Individual harvests had similarly higher yields and CP, with lower NDF for the mixtures than the unfertilized grass monocultures. The grass-legume mixture with the 50 : 50 planting ratio were most productive and had high forage quality. The grass-legume mixtures had similar forage production as the grass monocultures at 134 kg N ha- 1. The grass-legume mixtures also had higher CP and lower NDF than the grass monocultures. Cicer milkvetch did not perform well in irrigated pastures. Grass-legume mixtures with ALF and BFTF can be used to replace commercial N while increasing forage nutritive value...|$|E
40|$|Consumer evaluation, {{proximate}} data, Warner-Bratzler {{shear force}} (WBSF), fatty acid (FA) composition and volatile compounds were analyzed from the Longissimus thoracis (LT), Tricep brachii (TB) and Gluteus medius (GM) muscles finished on conventional feedlot (FL) and forages, including a perennial legume, birdsfoot trefoil (BFT; Lotus corniculatus), and a grass, <b>meadow</b> <b>brome</b> (Bromus riparius Rehmann, Grass). Representative retail forage (USDA Certified Organic Grass-fed, COGF) and conventional beef (USDA Top Choice, TC) were investigated (n = 6) for LT. Additionally, {{the effects of}} diet on Gluteus medius (GM) and Tricep brachii (TB) muscles were explored. Forage-finished beef scored lower (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) {{in most of the}} affected sensory attributes except BFT which was similar to grain-finished beef. In forage-finished beef GM was more liked and in FL, TB was similar to GM except juiciness where it scored greater. The fat percent was found to be greatest (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in TC followed by BFT and FL. Nutritionally beneficial ratios of FAs were observed in forage-finished diet. Fatty acid concentrations were majorly affected (P ≤ 0. 046) by diet. Few long-chain PUFAs were affected (P ≤ 0. 015) by muscle type. No FA was a effected (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) by the interaction of muscle and diet. 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone, known to evoke a buttery sensation was affected (P = 0. 011) by diet with greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) concentration in GM across all diets. Strecker degradation products were affected (P ≤ 0. 014) by muscle type being prominent in GM. Meanwhile, 2 -ethyl- 3, 5 -dimethyl-pyrazine was greatest (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in BFT. All pyrazine compounds were (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) greater in GM. These results indicate that when consumer evaluated beef of finishing diets, FL beef was rated highly. Additionally, not all forages produce similar beef. There were similar ratings for BFT for all attributes except flavor having lower values compared with FL. The chemical composition of BFT beef was found to be intermediary and similar to both FL and Grass beef in many cases. Diet was found to interact with muscle for sensory and chemical measures. The GM and TB of FL did not differ (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), while within forage treatments sensory response and chemical composition varied. These results indicate the meat quality of secondary beef muscles is more greatly impacted by forage diets...|$|E
