Additionally, several artists tried to work with clothes design with varying success: Varvara Stepanova designed dresses with bright, geometric patterns that were mass-produced, although workers' overalls by Tatlin and Rodchenko never achieved this and remained prototypes. The painter and designer Lyubov Popova designed a kind of Constructivist flapper dress before her early death in 1924, the plans for which were published in the journal LEF. In these works, Constructivists showed a willingness to involve themselves in fashion and the mass market, which they tried to balance with their Communist beliefs.|$|E

30|$|The opening {{research}} on international entrepreneurship was alluded {{to as the}} Uppsala internationalization process (Johanson and Vahlne 1977). Based on the Uppsala school, it was discussed that companies try to internationalize on a systematic process by exporting their product/ services to the geographically close countries. After a long period, these ventures will then start going further away from the market and expand their activities beyond the borders. However, in the Uppsala’s model of internationalization demonstrated not as relevant asformerly contemplated due to some companies entering external markets in a prompt process.

The contributions of this article to the fledgling SMEs marketing literature are threefold. First, we show that a brand-oriented culture is positively associated with a service-oriented enterprise financial performance. Second, we provide empirical support that workforce motivation is a direct antecedent of both entrepreneurial orientation and financial performance of this set of service-oriented SMEs. Third, we show that the complementarity of brand-oriented culture and entrepreneurial orientation is a key predictor of SMEs financial performance. Our study equally shows that in terms of relative strength, the complementary effect of brand-oriented culture and entrepreneurial orientation exceeds the individual effects of both on SMEs financial performance.

We consider the GDP as a proxy for local economic characteristics and opportunities. There is a lack in the literature about labour market transition probabilities by age cohort based on the economic context in which an individual lives. This paper attempts to fill this gap. For example, a young individual who lives in an area with good economic characteristics should have <b>more</b> labour <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> than one who lives in an area with poor economic characteristics. We analyse the Italian labour market, characterised by low internal labour mobility due to frictional effects such as distance, transaction costs, and regional amenities (for further details, see for example Faini et al. 1997; Ward-Warmedinger and Macchiarelli 2013). Given the low worker mobility in Italy, we exclude from this analysis the transition probabilities of people who are moving during the analysed period.|$|R

30|$|Our study {{suggests}} {{that some of the}} distinctive advantages might become constraints in a later stage of internationalization of immigrant firms, unless the immigrant entrepreneurs build on their biculturalism to reach out to other ethnic ties and to drive product or service innovation. Many immigrant start-ups jump into foreign markets very quickly at their infant stage, but stay “small” over years. Although, the initial internationalization may be to a greater extent driven by either “internal” or “external” factors, but the home-based and host-based forces are interdependent one with another. Therefore, effective and successful international expansion needs a balance of both forces. One of the practical implications for the managers of international new ventures is to re-balance the forces in a later stage of firm development. Those in which the early international moves are driven by entrepreneurial mindset or new venture skillset need to accumulate network resources and explore <b>more</b> <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> in foreign markets, while those in which the first moves are primarily motivated by the “external” opportunities and resources should further develop competitive advantages that are embedded in the firms’ tacit knowledge. Unique knowledge on both home and host country makes immigrant new ventures “the bridge”, connecting different parts of the international supply chain, through internal growth or strategic alliances, both domestically or internationally.|$|E

The growth in power marketing {{has been a}} major development in the electric power industry during the last few years, and power marketers are expected to realize even <b>more</b> <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> as electric industry deregulation proceeds from wholesale competition to retail competition. This Topical Issues Brief examines the nature of the power marketing business and its relationship with renewable power. The information presented is based on interviews conducted with nine power marketing companies, which accounted for almost 54 % of total power sales by power marketers in 1995. These interviews provided information on various viewpoints of power marketers, their experience with renewables, and their respective outlooks for including renewables in their resource portfolios. Some basic differences exist between wholesale and retail competition that should be recognized when discussing power marketing and renewable power. At the wholesale level, the majority of power marketers stress the commodity nature of electricity. The primary criteria for developing resource portfolios are the same as those of their wholesale customers: the cost and reliability of power supplies. At the retail level, electricity may be viewed as a product that includes value-added characteristics or services determined by customer preferences...|$|E

This thesis analyses the relationship of these two actors in order to shed light on the effects of globalisation in the region. It shall then argue that the process of globalisation in Latin America should not be seen in a generalising perspective. Rather, as the circumstances in the region’s economic and political landscapes suggest, the relationships between Multilatinas and the regional economic blocs indicate the “lumpiness” of the movement of capital, that is, occurring at different levels of intensity and not happening at an increasing level of global cohesion believed to eradicate nation-states...|$|R

Marital status and the presence of children likely also affect participation in VR as well as employment outcomes (Allingham and Hyatt 1995; Aakvik et al. 2005).

The local system can create benefit by opening to international markets and it should be a good source of knowledge and technology. Nowadays, the concept of industrial district, usually characterized by the spatial proximity of the involved firms, may evolve into firms network; this may emphasize the advantages deriving from cooperation, without the need of spatial proximity. Firms networks may represent the evolution of industrial districts, where territoriality is overcome by the dissolution of borders. The importance of firms networks is increased since they intensify information exchange, continuous learning, stimulate economies of scale, allow economic development and give <b>more</b> <b>market</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Firms networks share different aims, resource, common interests and factors, like material and immaterial inputs and outputs. This new form of cooperation may allow to overcome physical distance and replicate knowledge and information. Firms networks may represent a success organizational forms that may give impetus to development in an economy. They are based on mutual trust between partners and are created over time to facilitate information circulation, knowledge dissemination and innovation. Trust reduces uncertainty and transaction cost and limits the opportunistic behaviour by free-rider agents. The aim of the paper is to assess the determinants for firms networks training in the Italian context using regional data. Particularly, the firms networks development needs key factors such as ICTs diffusion, high rate of social security, open capability, RxD activities. These factor constitute the basis for a new kind of capital, the so called “network capital”. It consists of collaborative practices in a network as the result of cooperation in the ICTs era. Network capital may be considered as social capital evolution in a globalized context. The entrance in the knowledge economy era, in which technological advancement runs very quickly and the pace of innovation is intensified, significantly reduces the exploitation of competitive advantages. Industrial districts, therefore, should develop, improve and change their shape in a new competitive environment, where the globalization of markets cancels the boundaries of many firms that collaborate beyond national boundaries. The paper analyzes the firms networks determinant for Italian regions and the role of network capital as pre-condition for their development. The multidimensional scaling analysis it the chosen methodology that allows us to identify the relations among Italian regions in terms of proximity/distance with respect to considered determinants, and to provide a spatial representation of them...|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of these studies in providing fundamental insights for policy-makers, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no evidence had been provided on patterns of labour market transitions based on GDP per capita at the region level or individual age, ceteris paribus (e.g. regulatory frameworks). This analysis is important for Italy mainly for three reasons: (a) the country is characterised by economic dualism, with a large disparity between north and south in terms of GDP per capita; (b) the country is characterised by low internal labour mobility due to the frictional effects of factors such as distance, transaction costs, and regional amenities (for further details, see for example Faini et. 1997; Ward–Warmedinger and Macchiarelli 2013); and (c) the issue of unemployment, especially among the youngest generations.

40|$|For {{companies}} in today s technological and advanced environment, {{it is of}} great importance to discover new market opportunities and to decide which opportunities to pursue, {{in order to stay}} competitive. Due to the importance and success of the local maritime clusters in Norway, as well as the authors interest in the industry, this thesis sought out to answer two research questions. The first is how maritime {{companies in}} a successful cluster discover new market opportunities, and the second is how these companies decide which opportunities to pursue. To answer these complex questions, an industry and literature review were conducted, and formed the foundation for the thesis. Academic literature on market orientation and strategic decision making were chosen to shed light on the two research questions, respectively. Theory on clusters was used as supportive literature. Together, these theoretical fields were used to develop theoretical propositions. A multiple case study approach has been utilized, and eleven semi-structured interviews with people from seven different companies formed the empirical data for the thesis. For this study, it has been chosen to focus on companies in the successful cluster in Møre. Through the interviews, knowledge and understanding of specific opportunities and decision making processes were obtained. Following the interviews, the empirical data was analyzed in relation to the theoretical propositions. The study finds that the maritime companies in Møre discover opportunities through their customer orientation. These opportunities occur when customers present their needs or when the companies actively search for new opportunities. Findings also indicate that the few companies that are competitor oriented, discover opportunities through their monitoring and analyzes of competitors. It has been found that most maritime companies in Møre have a long-term focus when they decide which opportunities to pursue, but that the decisions are made in different ways. Some companies behave rationally and perform structured processes intended to increase their information basis before making a final decision. Other companies base their decisions mainly on intuition, and these decisions are often based on top executives experience and judgement. The thesis has proposed that the maritime companies should focus more on their competitors to discover <b>more</b> <b>market</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Further, it is believed that a focus on customers, competitors and on being interfunctionally coordinated, while also becoming more proactively market oriented, can be ways to gain a competitive advantage in the future Norwegian maritime offshore industry. Already today, it is found that customer orientation is a necessity to compete in this industry. Based on the analysis, it is also identified that the shipowners, even though they make large investments, mainly base their decisions on intuition. From a theoretical standpoint the thesis has broadened the theoretical field of market orientation, as it investigates it in relation to opportunity discovery and strategic decision making. Further, the thesis has provided a discussion of how the concept of market orientation varies between companies with different sizes, and it shows support for cluster theory on the effects of being affiliated to a cluster...|$|E

Also, the composite materials have intrinsic properties that make them superior to other types of materials, thus <b>more</b> attractive <b>market</b> <b>opportunities.</b> For the Saudi case, they develop the petrochemical products, and export the raw materials as pellets and other sorts of base material shapes. Other developed countries with more advanced technologies use these derivatives to produce nonmetallic products. However, it is more advantageous for Saudi Arabia to acquire these technologies necessary to develop composite materials and market the composite products itself. This move can lead to creation of an economical wave that will result in diversification of the Saudi economy as well as creating more job opportunities. There are a lot of drivers within Saudi Arabia, and these drivers call for the development of composite materials locally. Such domestic drivers can help expedite the progress of the composite technology adoptions. All of the Saudi industries have needs that can be fulfilled with Composite materials, and such opportunities can attract foreign investors to invest in Saudi Arabia, which give them a <b>market</b> access <b>opportunity</b> not only to the Saudi markets, but also to the regional markets.

The emerging peri-urban camel production system (PUCPS) has potential livelihood benefits to households, but adapting herd {{management practices}} responsive to market demands is a challenge with implications for its sustained development. This study assessed marketing practices in PUCPS, guided by two research questions. To what extent are (i) camel keepers involved in trading of camel stock and milk? (ii) milk hygiene practices responsive to market demands? Data was obtained from cross-sectional surveys complemented by focus group discussions. Compared to the pastoral production system, the peri-urban system exhibited greater <b>market</b> integration with <b>more</b> milk <b>marketing</b> <b>opportunities,</b> 2.4 times <b>more</b> (25.8 % vs 62.8 %) steer sales and 2.2 times more heifer purchases for breeding (12.3 % vs 27.5 %).

On the other hand, PUCPS growth is facing market barriers from poor milk hygiene practices. Compared to the pastoral system, the peri-urban system exhibits greater market-oriented production of camel stock and milk. Existing milk hygiene and quality practices are unlikely to meet the safety and quality requirements for urban consumers. Development of organised marketing channels and strengthening of processes that add value to milk would enable camel producers to earn more from their stock and guarantee safety and quality to urban consumers.|$|R

Analysis of historical data from the U. S. Census IPUMS Samples shows that the gender gap in college completion has evolved differently for whites and blacks. Historically, the black female advantage in educational attainment is linked to <b>more</b> favorable labor <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> and stronger incentives for employment for educated black women. Males of both races have tended to delay completion of a college degree, but this pattern is disappearing as the striking educational gains of white women have caused the racial patterns of gender differences in college completion rates to grow more similar over time. Blacks in general and black males in particular continue to lag far behind whites in their rates of college completion. While some have linked the disadvantaged position of black males to their high risk of incarceration, our estimates suggest that incarceration has a relatively small impact on the black gender gap and the racial gap in college completion rates for males in the U.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of the paper is to identify the socio economic characteristics that affect {{the perception of the}} euro across the original 12 Euro Area countries by specifying and estimating a multilevel multinomial model for polytomous data. The analysis is based on the Flash Eurobarometer dataset that contains cross-country data augmented speci?c country macroeconomic and political series. The use of the multilevel multinomial logistic regression allows to estimate the model considering individuals features and countries characteristics in a single analysis with two-level structure. This structure takes into account dependence between individuals within the same country given a certain component of unobserved heterogeneity between countries. The attitudes towards the euro vary across individuals and across countries and are driven by personal considerations based on the bene?ts and costs of using a single currency within a common area. Individual features, as a high level of education and living in a metropolitan area, have a positive impact towards the perception of the euro, since people having these characteristics can bene?t <b>more</b> from new <b>markets</b> <b>opportunities</b> created by the common area. Moreover, a positive country economic context (low in?ation and high growth) can in?uence people attitudes. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} the NLSY 79, we {{structurally}} estimate a dynamic model {{of the life cycle}} decisions of young women. The women make joint and sequential decisions about school attendance, work, marriage, fertility and welfare participation. We use the model to perform a set of counterfactual simulations designed to shed light on three questions: (1) How much of observed minority-majority differences in behavior can be attributed to differences in labor <b>market</b> <b>opportunities,</b> marriage <b>market</b> <b>opportunities,</b> and preference heterogeneity? (2) How does the welfare system interact with these factors to augment those differences? (3) How can new cohorts that grow up under the new welfare system (TANF) be expected to behave compared to older cohorts?female life cycle behavior, labor <b>market</b> <b>opportunities,</b> marriage <b>market</b> <b>opportunities,</b> public welfare...|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurs play a {{fundamental}} role in bringing {{new technologies to}} market. Because technologies are often configurable to serve a variety of different markets, it is possible for entrepreneurs to identify multiple <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> prior to the first market entry of their emerging firms, and if they elect to do so, to therefore have a choice of which market to enter first. The empirical results presented in this paper offer three new insights regarding this important early-stage choice in new firm creation. First, they reveal that serial entrepreneurs have learned through prior start-up experience to generate a "choice set" of alternative <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> before deciding which one to pursue in their new firm creation. Second, the analysis indicates that entrepreneurs who identify a "choice set" of <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> prior to first entry derive performance benefits by doing so. Third, the positive relationship between the number of <b>market</b> <b>opportunities</b> identified prior to first entry and new firm performance is nonlinear and subject to decreasing marginal return. The research literature has yet to acknowledge the notion of multiple opportunity identification prior to entry, and the related idea of selecting the most favorable <b>market</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{for the creation of a}} new technology firm. <b>market</b> <b>opportunities,</b> serial entrepreneurs, technological commercialization, new firm creation...|$|R
