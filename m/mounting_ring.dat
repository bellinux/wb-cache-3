50|$|The Coolpix 9xx {{series of}} cameras is {{noteworthy}} for the swivel style body. This allowed {{the user to}} rotate the lens {{with respect to the}} LCD screen and controls providing comfortable viewing {{in a wide range of}} shooting positions. The swivel body also allowed a physically much larger lens to be packaged into the camera with a wide telephoto range and exceptional macro capabilities. The internal lens does not use a pop out design and a fixed 28mm threaded lens <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> was included at the front. The diameter of the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> happens to coincide with that of most clinical microscopes, resulting in the 9xx series becoming popular for hand-held eyepiece-projection photomicrography. This <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> is present on the entire series, making them system cameras; a set of intercompatible telephoto, wide-angle, and fish-eye converters were available, and worked on any of the 9xx cameras.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mathematical}} model of static and dynamic {{calculation of the}} improved design of balancing device with the hydraulically unloaded resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring</b> is represented in work. For the dynamic analysis of system {{it is necessary to}} consider the connected oscillations of resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring</b> and disk of balancing device. For the improved design device rigidity of the disk is much more than rigidity of the resiliently <b>mounted</b> <b>ring.</b> Therefore at calculation of the balancing device special attention is to be paid to dynamic analysis of axially moving ring. The forced angular oscillations of ring, which are caused by a possible misalignment of the rotating disk, are also considered...|$|R

5000|$|Canon's first {{iteration}} of the FD breech-lock, extended {{forward from}} the earlier R- and FL-series lenses, utilized a rotating <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> {{at the rear of}} the lens; the lens body itself did not rotate for mounting. Its minor disadvantage was a somewhat slower lens change than a bayonet.|$|E
50|$|The OM lens was {{designed}} to sit 46 mm (measured from the lens <b>mounting</b> <b>ring,</b> or flange) from the film plane. The combination of on-lens aperture control and the generous 'flange-distance' make OM lenses adaptable (with limited functionality) {{to a variety of}} other camera systems - including Canon EOS models - by using a mount-specific adapter.|$|E
50|$|Initially, all {{versions}} used {{a modified}} commercial closed cab design having a metal roof and doors. By 1944 an open cab version, with a canvas roof and doors, was used. This {{was easier to}} build, and the roof could be removed to lower the shipping height. 1 in 4 of cabs had a machine gun <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> above the co-driver's position.|$|E
50|$|If you're {{shooting}} using a long, heavy telephoto lens, it's {{better to}} use a tripod <b>mount</b> <b>ring.</b> This fixes the monopod to the lens rather than the camera body, giving better balance and stopping the monopod from rotating in your hands {{as you try to}} position it.|$|R

Three different modes of dynamic response are shown and the condition for parallel tracking is presented...|$|R
50|$|Armament {{consisted}} of two to four Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns, one in a front <b>ring</b> <b>mount</b> and one, two or sometimes even three in an upper <b>ring</b> <b>mount.</b> Bombs were suspended under the hull.|$|R
50|$|The KAF2-mount is {{the same}} as the KAF-mount except that it adds two extra power {{contacts}} to the inside of the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> and transmits modulation transfer function (MTF) data through the digital seventh contact. The power contacts were originally used for power zooming. Since the introduction of the K10D digital SLR model, they are mainly used for powering Silent Drive Motor and DC motor lenses.|$|E
50|$|The Ye-151 cannon-armed {{version was}} {{designed}} {{in parallel with}} the Ye-150 but did not proceed to the hardware stage. The weapon system was to have consisted of twin TKB-495 or Makarov TKB-539 cannon, with a rate of fire of 2,000 rds/min, mounted on a rotating ring in tilting mounts. The mounts could tilt ±30° and the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> could rotate 360°, which gave the installation a 60° cone of fire around the centreline of the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring.</b> To accommodate the ring turret, the inlet duct was lengthened with the rotating ring forming the inlet lip, wind tunnel testing confirming that the extended inlet duct would actually improve aerodynamic and inlet performance; the lengthened inlet was retained for all later Ye-150 series aircraft (without cannon installation). Further tunnel testing with an inlet mounting fitted with cannon revealed destabilising forces when the cannon were deflected, making accurate weapon aiming impossible and precluding further development. Studies were carried out with the cannon mount aft of the cockpit to reduce the destabilising moment, as the Ye-151-2, but no hardware resulted.|$|E
50|$|The {{center of}} the gondola housed the main wing spar, fuel storage, fuel piping and control mechanisms, control surface cable sections, {{propeller}} and engine controls, and radio/IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) equipment, but was predominantly occupied by the top turret <b>mounting</b> <b>ring,</b> rotation and elevation mechanisms, ammunition storage for the turret's machine guns, the GE2CFR12A3 gyroscopic fire control computer, and linkages to the gunner and radar operator's turret control columns, forward and aft, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{iteration}} of the f/3.5-5.6 ("USM" [...] in {{the chart}} below) non-L lens is identified by the metal <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> and DoF window. The initial USM version, while much smaller and lighter in weight than the L version, is considerably larger and heavier than later versions due to the internal optics {{and the use of}} larger but quieter and faster ring motor USM. Production of the first version ended in (approximately) 1995. This lens is unique in the 28-80 mm f/3.5-5.6 series.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 the Tasmanian Government {{undertook}} a controversial A$20 million redevelopment of the venue. The redevelopment involved {{the construction of}} a new 970 metre long, 19 metre wide harness track and a 700 metre long and 6 and a half metre wide track for greyhounds, as well as a redevelopment of the heritage listed grandstand, new bookmakers area. Lawned areas sweep down to the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring,</b> birdcage and the enclosures. Three public lounges and two dining areas are present in addition to members' facilities.|$|E
50|$|When this camera appeared, a new {{range of}} FD lenses was introduced, {{featuring}} instant mounting/unmounting of the lens. This {{was called the}} New FD mount and did away with the older type of <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> which was fitted on {{to the rear of}} the lens and was awkward to use and needed two hands, to a newer, easier system whereby the user lined up the red dot on the lens, with the red dot on the camera and simply turned the whole lens clockwise until it clicked into place.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a thermal}} model {{including}} the {{radiative heat transfer}} between the retroreflector, its <b>mounting</b> <b>rings,</b> and the aluminum cavity in which it sits, {{it is estimated that}} thermal drag accounts for about 70 percent of the observed average drag on the LAGEOS satellite. It is found that neutral particle drag accounts for about 13 percent of the average drag, with charged particle drag accounting for at least 5 percent. It is suggested that the remaining 12 percent is probably due to charged particle drag as well...|$|R
50|$|During the Korean War, the M1 bayonet and M1905 bayonet which {{mount to}} the M1, were proven {{difficult}} to remove with gloves on. As {{a result the}} U.S. M5 Garand bayonet was designed and issued in 1953. This was a total redesign based on the M4 bayonet used by the M1 carbine. The M5 bayonet looks nothing like the original M1905 or M1 bayonets for the M1 Garand. The M5 is the only U.S. bayonet without a barrel <b>mount</b> <b>ring</b> on the crossguard, making it {{look more like a}} fighting knife than a bayonet.|$|R

5000|$|Compared to the VF1000F, the VF1000R had {{completely}} different bodywork and rider positioning. The [...] "R" [...] model got fully faired, racer replica bodywork with rearset footpegs and adjustable clip-on handlebars. The handlebars were adjustable through {{a range of}} 4 degrees in 2 degree increments via a double serrated ring which meshed with the handle and the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> parts of the clip on. Even with the adjustment available in the clip ons, period tests still criticized the bike for having too committed of a riding position, with a long stretch over the tank.|$|E
5000|$|Lower cost non-USM {{versions}} ("Original" [...] and [...] "II" [...] in {{the chart}} below) were produced as well. A lower-cost drive system replaced the USM auto-focus system and therefore these lenses do not support FTM. AF action is considerably slower and noisier than USM versions. Lenses such as these without FTM focusing can be damaged if the focus ring is turned by hand while the lens is in the AF mode. Like the USM II-V versions, these non-USM versions have a plastic <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> and delete the DoF window.|$|E

50|$|After these events, a new {{launch of}} the Exoliner cargo capsule is {{projected}} to occur. All launches after the first flight will deliver only Exoliner cargo capsules, assuming that the Jupiter spacecraft is in good health. The new craft would include fuel for Jupiter as well as cargo to be delivered to the space station. The arriving Exoliner will remain attached to the upper stage through a <b>mounting</b> <b>ring.</b> Jupiter and the departing Exoliner, now filled with trash, will approach the nearly spent rocket stage. The departing container will undock from the Jupiter spacecraft and will briefly be unattached to either the upper stage or the spacecraft. Immediately following the undocking, the arriving Exoliner docked to the upper stage will be removed by the Jupiters robotic arm, and refastened onto the Jupiter. Finally, the departing container will be moved to the docking system on the upper stage of the rocket. After the Jupiter and Exoliner move away, the rocket stage will guide the used cargo pod down for a destructive reentry.|$|E
50|$|Starting in the 1930s, filters {{were also}} {{made in a}} sizing system known as a series mount. The filters {{themselves}} were round pieces of glass (or occasionally other materials) with no threads. Very early filters had no rims around the glass, but the more common later production filters had the glass mounted in metal rims. To mount the filters on a camera, the filter was placed between two rings; the mount ring either screwed into the lens threads or was slipped over the lens barrel and the retaining ring screws into the <b>mounting</b> <b>ring</b> to hold the filter in place. The series designations are generally written as Roman numerals, I to IX, though {{there are a few}} sizes not written that way, such as Series 4.5 and Series 5.5. Most Series filter sizes are now obsolete, production having ceased by the late 1970s. However, Series 9 became a standard of the motion picture industry and Series 9 filters are still produced and sold today, particularly for professional motion picture cinematography.|$|E
50|$|Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} the construction of compression driver diaphragms including titanium, aluminium, phenolic impregnated fabric, polyimide and PET film, each having its own characteristics. The diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former, typically made from a different material from the dome, since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change. Polyimide film, Nomex, and glassfibre are popular for this application. The suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a <b>mounting</b> <b>ring,</b> which may fit into a groove, over locating pins, or be fastened with machine screws. The diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug, which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat, preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface. The phase plug exits into a tapered tube, which forms the start of the horn itself. This slowly expanding throat within the driver is continued in the horn flare. The horn flare controls the coverage pattern, or directivity, and as an acoustic transformer, adds gain. A professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 dB/watt/meter. This is substantially more efficient (and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former) than other tweeter construction.|$|E
