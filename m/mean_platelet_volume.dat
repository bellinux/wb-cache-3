Materials and Method: A total of 63 newborns with similar gestational age were included in this retrospective study. They were divided into three groups as 21 babies of preeclamptic mothers with thrombocytopenia (Group A), 21 without thrombocytopenia (Group B) and 21 babies of normal pregnant women without thrombocytopenia (Group C). Hematologic data of the patients, obtained in the first 72 hours of their life, were achieved from their medical records. Groups were compared according to their birth weights, <b>platelet</b> counts and <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volumes</b> (MPV). Results: Gestastional age and birth weights of all groups were similar. The platelet count of group A was significantly lower (p< 0. 001). MPV seemed to increase as platelet counts decreased when the groups were compared. However no significant correlation was found between MPV and platelet counts and no significant difference between MPVs (p= 0. 052). Conclusion: Increase in MPV is accepted as a sign of platelet destruction and decrease as a sign of platelet production insufficiency. Our results showed that the etiology of thrombocytopenia in babies of preeclamptic mothers can not be explained with the help of MPV. (Journal of Current Pediatrics 2009; 7 : 53 - 6...|$|R

Platelets {{play a crucial role in}} the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic complications, contributing to thrombus formation. Platelet size (<b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume,</b> MPV) is a marker and possible determinant of platelet function, large platelets being potentially more reactive. Hence an attempt has-been made to study the association if any between <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> and thrombotic stroke. The aim of this study was to determine whether an association exists between <b>Mean</b> <b>Platelet</b> <b>Volume</b> (MPV) and thrombotic stroke.

40|$|BACKGROUND Vascular Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} (VEDS) causes reduced {{life expectancy}} because of arterial dissections/rupture and hollow organ rupture. Although the causative gene, COL 3 A 1, was identified > 20 years ago, {{there has been}} limited progress in understanding the disease mechanisms or identifying treatments. METHODS AND RESULTS We studied inflammatory and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling biomarkers in plasma and from dermal fibroblasts from patients with VEDS. Analyses were done in terms of clinical disease severity, genotype-phenotype correlations, and body composition and fat deposition alterations. VEDS subjects had increased circulating TGF-β 1, TGF-β 2, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, and leptin and decreased interleukin- 8 versus controls. VEDS dermal fibroblasts secreted more TGF-β 2, whereas downstream canonical/noncanonical TGF-β signaling was not different. Patients with COL 3 A 1 exon skipping mutations had higher plasma intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, and VEDS probands had abnormally high plasma C-reactive protein versus affected patients identified through family members before any disease manifestations. Patients with VEDS had higher <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volumes,</b> suggesting increased <b>platelet</b> turnover because of ongoing vascular damage, as well as increased regional truncal adiposity. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that VEDS is a systemic disease with a major inflammatory component. C-reactive protein is linked to disease state and may be a disease activity marker. No changes in downstream TGF-β signaling and increased platelet turnover suggest that chronic vascular damage may partially explain increased plasma TGF-β 1. Finally, we found a novel role for dysregulated TGF-β 2, as well as adipocyte dysfunction, as demonstrated through reduced interleukin- 8 and elevated leptin in VEDS...|$|R

Pearson's correlation and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves {{were used to}} analyze clinical significance of miR- 99 a- 5 p and its sensitivity and specificity for stroke diagnosis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that miR- 99 a- 5 p expression was upregulated in neutrophils of both ischemic stroke and hemorrhage patients, while was only increased in the lymphocytes of hemorrhage patients. ROC analysis revealed that the miR- 99 a- 5 p level in neutrophils and lymphocytes had a moderate diagnostic value for stroke. Moreover, a positive correlation existed between plasma miR- 99 a- 5 p levels and neutrophil numbers or neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio.

Age, sex, duration of disease, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Activity Index score, total white blood counts, neutrophil, platelet, lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein, sedimantation, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> values of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The present study found a significantly different neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> values in patients with ankylosing spondylitis when compared to the control group. We found a significantly different neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> values in patients with active phase of ankylosing spondylitis when compared to the inactive group. Conclusion: Clinicians may use neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> values to evaluate disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis since these easily determinable measurements are objective, simple and readily available and also do not lead to any additional cost [Cukurova Med J 2016; 41 (3. 000) : 479 - 484...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the platelet counts and the <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> in patients who received isotretinoin for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Method. A total of 110 patients were included in this retrospective study. Complete blood count parameters were recorded prior to and three-months following the treatment. Results. Both platelet counts and the <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> were significantly decreased following the treatment. No significant differences were noted on the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell count. Conclusion. Platelet counts and <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> significantly decreased following isotretinoin treatment. Since the decrease of platelet counts and the <b>mean</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> was seen concomitantly, it is concluded that the effect of isotretinoin was through the suppression of bone marrow. 1...|$|E

In the acute toxicity test, the extract caused death in animals receiving 3200 mg/kg dose. The extract also caused significant (P < 0. 05) changes in red blood cells, packed cell volume, hemoglobin concentration, <b>mean</b> corpuscular <b>volume,</b> <b>platelets,</b> {{white blood cells}} and its differentials at doses of 1600 mg/kg in sub-acute toxicity and in as low as 200 mg/kg in chronic toxicity. In biochemical parameters, the extract caused a signifi-cant (P < 0. 05) decrease in the levels of urea and creati-nine at 1600 mg/kg dose and a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction in urea, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, glutamine transference gamma-glutamyl trans-ferase (GGT), and alanine transminase in the 400 mg/kg dose in chronic toxicity. Changes were also noted in body weights, but no significant changes were observed in the levels of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride). Clinico-pathologically, starry hair coat, respiratory dis-tress, and mortality were recorded. The extract also caused various histopathological changes in the organs.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} results of {{different}} <b>platelet</b> <b>mean</b> <b>volume</b> (MPV) with the method of instrument and manual counting of platelet and its application in clinical practice. Method: According to prompts Sysmex xn (10) B 4 detection results MPV. The 246 samples divided for four groups, with Sysmex xn (10) B 4, Mindray BC 6800 blood cell analyzer, artificial bovine Bao counting plate platelet count number. The detection results are paired t-test. Results: When 5. 4 fL≤MPV≤ 7. 4 fL, 2 instruments and artificial platelet count results showed no significant difference; When 7. 5 fL≤MCV≤ 9. 0 fL, 2 instruments and artificial platelet count results showed no significant difference, Sysmex XN (10) B 4 slightly lower test results, Mindray BC 6800 test results closer to the true value; When 9. 1 fL≤MCV≤ 12. 0 fL, Sysmex XN (10) B 4 and artificial platelet count results were significantly, and manual counting Mindray BC 6800 platelet count was no significant difference; When MPV ≧ 12. 1 fL, 2 instrument testing platelet counting and artificial platelets results difference had statistical significance, platelet test results between two instruments are low. Conclusion: MPV is the main factors of effect of platelet count by apparatus, when the MPV increase should be the manual assay of platelet count {{in order to ensure}} accuracy, more realistically reflect the actual situation in the patient, and provide more valuable diagnostic basis for clinical...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Spontaneously {{hypertensive}} rats {{have long}} been used as an animal counterpart of human essential hypertension. The validation of this strain as a model rests mainly on the "clinical" similarity of the two syndromes, but it has scarcely been founded on numerical comparison of measurable parameters. We investigated three hematological indexes previously recognized to be altered in spontaneously hypertensive rats: the single-cell volume of erythrocytes, the single-cell <b>volume</b> of <b>platelets,</b> and the erythrocyte number. Erythrocyte volume was lower by 7 %, <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> was higher by 12 %, and erythrocyte count was higher by 22 % in spontaneously hypertensive rats in comparison with Wistar-Kyoto controls. More unexpectedly, {{it was found that}} erythrocyte volume is lower by 2 %, <b>platelet</b> <b>volume</b> is higher by 3 %, and erythrocyte number is higher by 6 % in essential hypertensive subjects when compared with normotensive healthy subjects. These results, combined with previously reported blood cell alterations in subjects and rats, reinforce the evidence of a biological similarity between essential and spontaneous hypertension.
