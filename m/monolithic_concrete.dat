25|$|Frame ties (German: Rahmenschwelle) {{comprise}} both lateral and longitudinal {{members in}} a single <b>monolithic</b> <b>concrete</b> casting. This system is in use in Austria; in the Austrian system the track is fastened at {{the four corners of}} the frame, and is also supported midway along the frame. Adjacent frame ties are butted close to each other. Advantages of this system over conventional cross increased support of track. In addition, construction methods used for this type of track are similar to those used for conventional track.|$|E
25|$|For the {{cantilevered}} floors, Wright and {{his team}} used upside-down T-shaped beams integrated into a <b>monolithic</b> <b>concrete</b> slab which formed both {{the ceiling of the}} space below and provided resistance against compression. The contractor, Walter Hall, also an engineer, produced independent computations and argued for increasing the reinforcing steel in the first floor’s slab. Wright refused the suggestion. While some sources state that the contractor quietly doubled the amount of reinforcement, others say that Kaufman's consulting engineers – at Kaufman's request – redrew Wright's reinforcing drawings and doubled the amount of steel specified by Wright.|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, {{the best}} {{that can be done}} is to reduce the {{entrance}} of water runoff from higher, stable elevations by capturing and bypassing through channels or pipes, and to drain water infiltrated directly and from subsurface springs by inserting horizontal perforated tubes. There are numerous locations in California where extensive developments have been built atop archaic landslides, which have not moved in historic times but which (if both water-saturated and shaken by an earthquake) have a high probability of moving en masse, carrying entire sections of suburban development to new locations. While the most modern of house structures (well tied to [...] <b>monolithic</b> <b>concrete</b> foundation slabs reinforced with post tensioning cables) may survive such movement largely intact, the building will no longer be in its proper location.|$|E
2500|$|As {{his career}} {{developed}} Lautner increasingly explored {{the use of}} concrete and he designed a number of homes for his more affluent clients that featured major structural elements fabricated from reinforced concrete. A commission by industrialist Kenneth Reiner, the 4,721 square feet Reiner-Burchill Residence, [...] "Silvertop" [...] (1956–76), was his first major exploration of the sculptural possibilities of <b>monolithic</b> <b>concrete</b> as {{it was designed to}} follow the exact contour of its hilltop site. The home sits on 1.26 acres on the crest of a hill and is reached by a cantilevered concrete driveway that wraps around a circular guesthouse. It features a large arching concrete roof over the main house's living room. The curving living-room window wall is made of five hanging glass panels. The infinity-edge swimming pool {{was one of the first}} of its kind.|$|E
50|$|The building's primary {{significance}} {{lies in its}} architecture {{rather than}} its history.

The use of poured <b>monolithic</b> <b>concrete</b> is common for plain, linear types of buildings (such as warehouses), however it was (and is) unusual for a structure of complex style and detailing to be constructed in this manner.|$|E

50|$|With the {{elimination}} of ramps, driving lanes, pedestrians and the reduction in ceiling heights, the APS requires substantially less structural material than the multi-story parking garage. Many APS utilize a steel framework (some use thin concrete slabs) rather than the <b>monolithic</b> <b>concrete</b> design of the multi-story parking garage. These factors contribute to an overall volume reduction and further space savings for the APS.|$|E
