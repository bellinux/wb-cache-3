50|$|The PS/55 was {{successor}} to IBM 5550 (<b>Multistation</b> 5550), but {{the machine was}} IBM PS/2 compatible, perhaps {{it was also an}} IBM clone. Most models had Micro Channel (MCA) for business use. Later, the AT bus model was released for home users.|$|E
50|$|A Media Access Unit (MAU), {{also known}} as a <b>Multistation</b> Access Unit (MAU or MSAU) is a device to attach {{multiple}} network stations in a star topology as a token ring network, internally wired to connect the stations into a logical ring (generally passive i.e. non-switched and unmanaged; however managed token ring MAUs do exist in the form of CAUs, or Controlled Access Units).|$|E
5000|$|Token Ring network {{interface}} cards contain {{all of the}} intelligence required for speed autodetection, routing and can drive themselves on many <b>Multistation</b> Access Units (MAUs) that operate without power (most MAUs operate in this fashion, only requiring a power supply for LEDs).

50|$|Higher volume {{producers}} typically utilize specialized {{tire and}} wheel mounting and inflation equipment which is partially or fully automated. Depending on the tire size, machines {{may be a}} single station or <b>multistation.</b> In these machines, the tire is inflated using high volume, high pressure compressed air that flows into the tire around the tire bead rather than through the valve stem. When the tire has achieved the desired inflation pressure, the machine's inflation head {{moves away from the}} tire and the inflation process is completed.|$|E
5000|$|The ODOP (Offset DOPpler) radar {{tracking}} system {{is essentially the}} same as the UDOP system used for many years at the Atlantic Missile Range, but ODOP operates at different frequencies. It is a phase-coherent, <b>multistation</b> Doppler tracking system which measures position of a vehicle equipped with the ODOP transponder. ODOP stations are located at and around Cape Kennedy. The ODOP transponder is carried in the first stage (S-IB or S-IC) of the Saturn vehicles and, therefore, ODOP tracking data is limited to the flight of the first stage only. The ODOP tracking system provides data immediately following lift-off while other tracking systems cannot [...] "see" [...] the vehicle or their accuracy is reduced by multipath propagation during the early phase of the flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of IBM-implemented (actual) passive Token ring MAUs operated without {{the requirement of}} power; instead the passive MAU used a series of relays that adjusted themselves as data is passed through: this is also why Token ring generally used relays to terminate disconnected or failed ports. The power-less IBM 8228 <b>Multistation</b> Access Unit requires a special 'Setup Aid' tool to re-align the relays after the unit has been moved which causes them to be in incorrect states: this is accomplished by a 9v battery sending a charge to snap the relays back in a proper state. The advantages of having a MAU operate without power {{is that they can}} be placed in areas without outlets, the disadvantage is that they must be primed each time the internal relays experience excessive force. The IBM 8226 MAU, while containing a power jack, primarily uses this for the LEDs: relays are still used inside the unit but do not require priming.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Dierent {{measurement}} schemes in <b>multistation</b> machining systems carry dierent {{amounts of}} information about the root causes of dimensional machining errors. The choice of a measurement strategy in a <b>multistation</b> machining system is therefore crucial for subsequent successful identi®cation of the machining error root causes. Recent advances in the linear state-space modelling of dimensional errors in <b>multistation</b> machining processes facilitate a formal and systematic characterization of measurement schemes. In this paper, the stream-of-variation methodology is employed to characterize various measurement schemes quantitatively in <b>multistation</b> machining systems using the Bayesian approach in statistics. Application of these methods is demonstrated in the characterization of measurement schemes in the machining process used for machining of an automotive cylinder head...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the optimal design of fixture layouts in <b>multistation</b> assembly processes. An optimal fixture layout improves the robustness of a fixture system against environmental noises, reduces product variability, {{and leads to}} manufacturing cost reduction. Three key aspects of the <b>multistation</b> fixture layout design are addressed: a <b>multistation</b> variation propagation model, a quantitative measure of fixture design, and an effective and efficient optimization algorithm. One of the challenges raised by this <b>multistation</b> design is that a high-dimension design space, which usually embeds a lot of local optimums, {{will have to be}} explored. Consequently, it makes a global optimality more difficult and, if an inefficient algorithm is used, may require prohibitive computing time. In this paper, exchange algorithms, originally developed in the research of optimal experimental design, are adopted and further revised t...|$|E

40|$|Dimensional {{control has}} a {{significant}} impact on overall product quality and performance of large and complex <b>multistation</b> assembly systems. To date, the identification of processrelated faults that cause large variations of key product characteristics (KPCs) {{remains one of the most}} critical research topics in dimensional control. This paper proposes a new approach for multiple fault diagnosis in a <b>multistation</b> assembly process by integrating multivariate statistical analysis with engineering models. The proposed method is based on the following steps: (i) modeling of fault patterns obtained using state space representation of process and product information that explicitly represents the relationship between process-related error sources denoted by key control characteristics (KCCs) and KPCs, and (ii) orthogonal diagonalization of measurement data using principal component analysis (PCA) to project measurement data onto the axes of an affine space formed by the predetermined fault patterns. Orthogonal diagonalization allows estimating the statistical significance of the root cause of the identified fault. A case study of fault diagnosis for a <b>multistation</b> assembly process illustrates and validates the proposed methodology. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2783228 �...|$|E

40|$|Reconfigurable {{systems and}} tools have given {{manufacturers}} {{the possibility to}} quickly adapt {{to changes in the}} market place. Such systems allow the production of different products with simple and quick reconfiguration. Another advantage of reconfigurable systems is that the accuracy of the tools provides a unique opportunity to compensate errors and deviations as they occur along the manufacturing system, hence improving product quality. This dissertation deals with the design of products, processes and controllers to enhance dimensional quality of products produced in reconfigurable assembly processes. The successful synthesis of these topics will lead to new levels of quality and responsiveness. Fundamental research has been conducted in dimensional control of reconfigurable <b>multistation</b> assembly systems. This includes three topics related to the design of products, processes, and controls. These are: o	Development of feedforward controllers: Feedforward controllers allow deviation compensation on a part-by-part basis using reconfigurable tools. The control actions are obtained through the combination of <b>multistation</b> assembly models, in-line measurements (used to measure deviations along the process), and the characteristics and requirements of products/processes, in an optimization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed control approach is effective on reducing variation. o	Optimal selection and distribution of actuators in <b>multistation</b> assembly processes: The availability of reconfigurable tools in the process enables error correction; however, it is too expensive to install at every location. The selection and distribution of the actuators is focused on cost effectively reducing variation in <b>multistation</b> assembly processes. Simulations results prove that dimensional variation could be significantly reduced through an appropriate distribution of actuators. o	Robust fixture design for a product family assembled in a reconfigurable <b>multistation</b> line: The assembly of a product family in a reconfigurable line demands fixtures sharing across products. The sharing impacts the products robustness to fixture variation due to frequent systems reconfiguration and tradeoffs made in the design of fixtures to accommodate the family in the single system. A robust fixture layout for a product family is achieved by reducing the combined sensitivity of the whole family to fixture variation and considering product and process constraints...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a methodology for optimal allocation of sensors in a <b>multistation</b> assembly {{process for the}} purpose of diagnosing in a timely manner variation sources that are responsible for product quality defects. A sensor system distributed in such a way can help manufacturers improve product quality while, at the same time, reducing process downtime. Traditional approaches in sensor optimization fall into two categories: <b>multistation</b> sensor allocation {{for the purpose of}} product inspection (rather than diagnosis); and allocation of sensors for the purpose of variation diagnosis but at a single measurement station. In our approach, sensing information from different measurement stations is integrated into a state-space model and the effectiveness of a distributed sensor system is quantified by a diagnosability index. This index is further studied in terms of variation transmissibility between stations as well as variation detectability at individual stations. Based on an understanding of the mechanism of variation propagation, we develop a backward-propagation strategy to determine the locations of measurement stations and the minimum number of sensors needed to achieve full diagnosability. An assembly example illustrates the methodology. Index Terms—Diagnosability, diagnosis of variation sources, <b>multistation</b> assembly process, sensor distribution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Magnitude, distance, and {{amplitude}} corrections (MDAC) made to ob-served regional amplitudes {{are necessary}} {{so that what}} remains in the corrected am-plitude is mostly information about the seismic source type. Corrected amplitudes {{can be used in}} ratios to discriminate between earthquakes and explosions. However, source effects remain that cannot easily be determined and applied as amplitude cor-rections, such as those due to depth, focal mechanism, local material property, and apparent stress variability. We develop a mathematical model to capture these near-source effects as random (unknown), giving an error partition of three sources: model inadequacy, station noise, and amplitude correlation. This mathematical model is the basis for a general <b>multistation</b> regional discriminant formulation. The standard error of the discriminant includes the variances of model inadequacy and station noise, along with amplitude correlation in its formulation. The developed methods are demonstrated for a collection of Nevada test site (NTS) events observed at regional stations (see Fig. 1). Importantly, the proposed formulation includes all corrected am-plitude information through the construction of <b>multistation</b> discriminants. In contrast, previous studies have only computed discriminants from single stations having both P and S amplitudes. The proposed <b>multistation</b> approach has similarities to the well-established mb versusMs discriminant and represents a new paradigm for the regional discrimination problem...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Manufacturing {{systems are}} {{inherently}} imperfect both statically and dynamically. Tolerance and maintenance design {{are two major}} tools to address the static and dynamic imperfection of manufacturing processes (i. e., inherent process imperfection and tooling deterioration, respectively). Yet, traditionally, tolerance and maintenance designs have been studied separately to address these two critical areas of manufacturing systems. This paper presents an integrated framework of tolerance and maintenance design for <b>multistation</b> manufacturing processes. Two nonlinear optimization problems are formulated to minimize the overall average production cost in the long run, which includes the tolerance cost of tooling fabrication, maintenance cost, and the overall loss of quality (as {{a part of the}} objective function or as a constraint function).

40|$|Compliant {{sheet metal}} {{assembly}} is a hierarchical manufacturing process that plays {{a significant role}} in automotive product development. Parts are joined in different stations to form the final product (e. g., the vehicle body structure). Dimensional variation is a product attribute of major importance that characterizes quality, and is mainly affected by the variability of parts, fixtures, and joining methods at each of the multiple stations. The propagation of dimensional variation through the <b>multistation</b> assembly system is modeled as a linear process, where all three aforementioned sources of variability are taken into account at each station using finite element models. In this article we apply the analytical target cascading process to the tolerance allocation problem in <b>multistation</b> assembly systems.

40|$|The {{effect of}} network density and {{geometric}} distribution on kinematic non-linear source inversion is investigated by inverting synthetic ground motions from a buried strike-slip fault (Mw 6. 5), {{that have been}} generated by dynamic spontaneous rupture modelling. For the inversion, we use a physics-based regularized Yoffe function as slip velocity function. We test three different cases of station network geometry: (i) single station, varying azimuth and epicentral distance; (ii) <b>multistation</b> circular configurations, that is stations at similar distances from the fault, and regularly spaced around the fault; (iii) irregular <b>multistation</b> configurations using different numbers of stations. Our results show: (1) single station tests suggest {{that it may be}} possible to obtain a relatively good source model even using a single station. The best source model using a single station is obtained with stations at which amplitude ratios between three components are not large. We infer that both azimuthal angle and source-to-station distance play an important role in the design of optimal seismic network for source inversion. (2) <b>Multistation</b> tests show that the quality of the inverted source systematically correlates neither with the number of stations, nor with waveform misfit. (3) Waveform misfit has a direct correlation with the number of stations, resulting in overfitting the observed data without any systematic improvement of the source. It suggests that the best source model is not necessarily derived from the model with minimum waveform misfit.

40|$|Assembly process-induced {{dimensional}} variation {{has a significant}} impact on product quality and functionality. The complexity of modern products coupled with part compliance/flexibility frequently results in ill-conditioned assembly systems further adding to the challenges of process control and fault failure diagnosis. This paper proposes an enhanced piecewise least squares (EPLS) -based approach for dimensional fault failure diagnosis of ill-conditioned <b>multistation</b> assembly systems. In this approach, predetermined fault patterns derived from an inverse stiffness matrix of assembly structures and fault patterns obtained from product measurement data are used to detect and isolate dimensional failures caused by fixturing error(s). The EPLS-based diagnostic methodology searches for a set of components called latent vectors with thesearch constrained by assembly response function, the stream of variation analysis (SOVA) model of an assembly system, which performs decomposition of response based on the end-of-line measurements.
