60|$|At {{the same}} meeting Mr. A. G. Butler, of the British Museum, communicated {{the results of}} his {{observations}} with lizards, frogs, and spiders, which strikingly corroborate those of Mr. Weir. Three green lizards (Lacerta viridis) which he kept for several years, were very voracious, eating all kinds of food, from a lemon cheesecake to a spider, and devouring flies, caterpillars, and humble bees; yet there were some caterpillars and moths which they would seize only to drop immediately. Among these the principal were the caterpillar of the <b>Magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Abraxas grossulariata) and the perfect six spot Burnet moth (Anthrocera filipendulæ). These would be first seized but invariably dropped in disgust, and afterwards left unmolested. Subsequently frogs were kept and fed with caterpillars from the garden, but two of these--that of the before-mentioned <b>Magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> and that of the V. moth (Halia wavaria), which is green with conspicuous white or yellow stripes and black spots--were constantly rejected. When these species were first offered, the frogs sprang at them eagerly and licked them into their mouths; no sooner, however, had they done so than they seemed {{to be aware of the}} mistake that they had made, and sat with gaping mouths, rolling their tongues about until they had got quit of the nauseous morsels.|$|E
60|$|His next {{experiments}} were with those smooth gaily-coloured caterpillars which never conceal themselves, {{but on the}} contrary appear to court observation. Such {{are those of the}} <b>Magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Abraxas grossulariata), whose caterpillar is conspicuously white and black spotted--the Diloba coeruleocephala, whose larvæ is pale yellow with a broad blue or green lateral band--the Cucullia verbasci, whose larvæ is greenish white with yellow bands and black spots, and Anthrocera filipendulæ (the six spot Burnet moth), whose caterpillar is yellow with black spots. These were given to the birds at various times, sometimes mixed with other kinds of larvæ which were greedily eaten, but they were in every case rejected apparently unnoticed, and were left to crawl about till they died.|$|E

50|$|Nyctemera annulata, {{commonly}} known as the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the family Erebidae. It is endemic to New Zealand and found {{in all parts of the}} country.|$|E
50|$|Nyctemera amicus, the senecio moth or <b>magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Erebidae. It is found in {{south-east}} Asia, Oceania, and most of Australia. It {{can also be found}} in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Other {{potential}} {{threats are}} V-moth (Macaria wauaria) and Gooseberry sawfly (Nematus ribesii). Nematus ribesii grubs will bury {{themselves in the}} ground to pupate; on hatching into adult form, they lay their eggs, which soon hatch into larvae, {{on the underside of}} gooseberry leaves. Insecticides used in the 19th-century against these included tar water, weak solutions of carbolic acid, and powdered hellebore, which worked against <b>magpie</b> <b>moths</b> and V-moths as well as gooseberry sawflies. (Foxglove and tobacco infusions were also sometimes used.) A 2008 study concluded that a solution of magnesium sulfate applied to a bush's leaves has a good residual action on the eggs and larvae of gooseberry sawfly, and also appears to deter egg-laying female sawflies. Careful removal of fallen leaves and tilling of the ground around the plant will also destroy most eggs and chrysalises of these insects.|$|R
50|$|Gooseberry bushes are {{vulnerable}} to <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Abraxas grossulariata) caterpillars. In cultivation, the best method for removing them is to remove the larvae by hand soon after they hatch; its eggs are laid on fallen gooseberry leaves.|$|E

50|$|Abraxas grossulariata is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae, native to the Palaearctic ecozone and North America. Its {{distinctive}} speckled colouration has given it a common name of <b>magpie</b> <b>moth.</b> The caterpillar is similarly coloured to the adult, and may be found as a pest feeding on the leaves of shrubs such as gooseberry.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} form of Senecio found in New Zealand is the {{introduced}} 'ragwort' (Jacobaea vulgaris) - a weed in most cultivated areas of the country and the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> can often be seen around cultivated farmlands during the summer months and feed primarily on the leaves and flowers. Other favoured plants include Senecio vulgaris (groundsel) and garden cineraria.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{food source}} of Nyctemera annulata are plants from the tribe Senecioinae of the Asteraceae. [...] Thirty three species {{are known to}} exist in the wild and New Zealand has 19 native Senecio species with 14 of them naturalised exotics. N. annulata diet is {{specifically}} limited to one specific plant. Even though the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> is a native, it has been found that they do not restrict themselves to only the native Senecio species in New Zealand and will also feed on exotic introduced species.|$|E
50|$|The adult moth has black wings {{with white}} {{markings}} {{on both the}} forewings and hindwings. The forewings have two white spots that are more elongated while the hindwing only has a single spot near to the centre; the wingspan is 35-45 mm. The thorax and abdomen of the moth are black with bands of orange. The <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> is diurnal which, coupled with its colourful markings means it is often mistaken for a butterfly. It is most active from September to June in the mornings and evenings {{where it can be}} seen flying over the tops of host plants.|$|E

He was appointed assistant to the Superintendent of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology in June 1902, and himself filled this position from 1909 to 1914. He was elected to the Royal Society of London on the strength of these achievements in 1915. He died of sarcoma in 1920, and William Bateson wrote his obituary in Nature.|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{species can}} {{significantly}} impact native food webs through indirect effects. Examples of apparent competition typically involve a non-native consumer disproportionately affecting one host {{population in the}} presence of another. My research finds evidence for apparent competition between two herbs, one invasive and one endemic, and mediated by an endemic insect herbivore. The European pasture herb Jacobaea vulgaris (formerly Senecio jacobaea), is an invasive weed in several parts of the world, including New Zealand. New Zealand is also home to 19 native species of Senecio – thirteen of which are endemic – that support an endemic insect fauna. Some of these insects have since expanded their host range to include the invasive J. vulgaris. I examined the relationships between one of those herbivores, the New Zealand <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Nyctemera annulata, Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), J. vulgaris and one endemic (S. wairauensis) and two native host plants (S. minimus and S. quadridentatus). In my laboratory assays, <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> larvae found J. vulgaris as attractive as native host plants and larvae fed only J. vulgaris developed at comparable rates to those fed only native hosts. My landscape surveys revealed a strong association between J. vulgaris infestations, <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> abundance and increased levels of herbivore damage of the endemic S. wairauensis. Likewise, S. wairauensis was more likely to be present in transects where J. vulgaris was rare. There is convincing anecdotal evidence that the native <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> became far more abundant because of an invasive weed and my study suggests that this detrimentally affects native plants through population spillback...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Weights, {{measurements}} and stomach-contents {{of a sample}} of shining cuckoos (Chrysococcyx lucidus) are summarised. Mean weights and measurements did not differ between the sexes. The diet comprised only insects, mainly caterpillars and beetles. A third of the caterpillars were larvae of the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Nyctemera annulata) whose spines embed in {{the lining of the}} gizzard, and most beetles were ladybirds (Coccinellidae). Thus many prey were insects generally avoided by other birds. Ingested items were mostly less than 16 mm long, and a third were only 1 - 5 mm long...|$|E
40|$|The enemy release {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} native herbivores will either prefer or cause {{more damage to}} native than introduced plant species. We tested this using preference and performance experiments in the laboratory and surveys of leaf damage caused by the <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> Nyctemera amica on a co-occuring native and introduced species of fireweed (Senecio) in eastern Australia. In the laboratory, ovipositing females and feeding larvae preferred the native S. pinnatifolius over the introduced S. madagascariensis. Larvae performed equally well on foliage of S. pinnatifolius and S. madagascariensis: pupal weights did not differ between insects reared on the two species, but growth rates were significantly faster on S. pinnatifolius. In the field, foliage damage was significantly greater on native S. pinnatifolius than introduced S. madagascariensis. These results support the enemy release hypothesis, and suggest that the failure of native consumers to switch to introduced species contributes to their invasive success. Both plant species experienced reduced, rather than increased, levels of herbivory when growing in mixed populations, as opposed to pure stands in the field; thus, {{there was no evidence}} that apparent competition occurred...|$|E
40|$|Insects rely on {{chemical}} {{information obtained}} from their surroundings when locating biologically important resources. Detection of these chemicals is {{mediated by the}} antennae, which are endowed with various sensory structures called sensilla. Sensilla type, distribution and density vary among species, between sexes and at different life stages, and may provide important information regarding the ability of individuals to detect and process such external stimuli. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantitatively investigate the sensory architecture of larval and adult antennae in the New Zealand <b>magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> Nyctemera annulata (Arctiinae). Using scanning electron microscopy the sensilla were identified and classified into 8 types: trichoid, basiconic, chaetic, auricillic, squamiform, styloconic, coeloconic and Böhm's bristles, with multiple subtypes. Larval antennae were found to possess morphology and sensory structures which are essentially ubiquitous across the Lepidoptera. Sexual dimorphism was apparent in the overall antennal morphology as well as in the distribution, density and morphology of particular types of sensilla in adult N. annulata, which likely represents a divergence in sensory functions based on the different resource cues responded to by males (sex pheromones) and females (host plant odours). This is a rare example of a study which quantifies variation in the numbers and dimensions of all antennal sensilla types for males and females to allow a thorough statistical assessment of sexual dimorphism in antennal sensory architecture...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{interactions between}} the endemic <b>magpie</b> <b>moth</b> (Nyctemera annulata) and four weedy Senecio spp. (two indigenous spp., S. glomeratus and S. quadridentatus and two adventive spp., S. sylvaticus and S. vulgaris), were examined in relation to insect preference and development, and counterdefences or developmental responses of the:hosts. Larval development, adult fecundity and host preference {{as a result of}} larval food plant conditioning were studied. Potential depredation of the insect on the hosts was determined and their physical defences and responses to defoliation were assessed. Imago ovipositing was not species specific but directly correlated with dry weight and leaf number of host Senecio spp. Under laboratory conditions fifth instar larvae selected the plant species supporting the most successful larval development, independent of larval conditioning. Food plant preference was in the order: Senecio vulgaris> S. glomeratus = S. quadridentatus > S. sylvaticus. Larvae selected S. vulgaris in field conditions before anthesis but this preference decreased at anthesis. Larvae reared on S. vulgaris had the highest pIc efficiency and E. C. I. value, resulting in rapid larval and pupal development, with larger and heavier instars when compared with other Senecio spp. Larvae reared on S. vulgaris always selected this species in petri dishes. However larval development on different specific hosts did not alter the correlation of oviposition with dry weight and leaf number. The order of imago fecundity for larvae raised on three Senecio spp. was: S. glomeratus > S. vulgaris > S. quadridentatus. Fifth instar larvae acquired the major proportion of the larval food and defoliated the four species to ground level under glasshouse conditions. However the expected overcrowding and complete defoliation in nature has not been observed, possibly due to populations being checked by a high juvenile larval mortality. All Senecio spp. were cold-tolerant and established during winter when larvae showed minimal activity. S. glomeratus and S. quadridentatus~ the two indigenous species, responded to defoliation by vegetative regeneration from root stock. S. vulgaris responded by producing mature fruit more rapidly when attacked. N. annulata may influence the altitudinal distribution of S. sylvaticus as this species is more prolific at higher altitudes where the insect is probably univoltine...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{described}} in this thesis investigate the role of indirect effects in invasion biology. The Introduction provides {{a brief overview of}} indirect effects and an outline of the thesis structure. The role of indirect effects in the context of invasion biology is addressed in an in-depth published literature review that comprises the second chapter, providing a theoretical background for the subsequent empirical studies. Chapters Three to Six are comprised of manuscripts that have been published or are under review or in press, which describe studies that investigate the importance of indirect effects in invasion biology using a model system consisting of the alien Asteraceae Senecio madagascariensis, a closelyrelated native, Senecio pinnatifolius, and the insect species with which they interact. Senecio madagascariensis and S. pinnatifolius occur in a similar geographic range in eastern Australia and these studies were conducted in mixed and pure populations of the two species. The herbivore and floral visitor assemblages of the two Senecio species at seven field sites in South-east Queensland were compared using sweep-net sampling, manual searching and floral visitor observation techniques. The floral visitor assemblages were similar between the two species, comprised largely of species of Syrphidae and the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. Herbivore assemblages, however, were highly variable both between species and between sites, with greater herbivore abundance and diversity recorded on the native S. pinnatifolius than its alien congener. The most commonly recorded herbivores were sap-sucking species such as Myridae. The <b>magpie</b> <b>moth,</b> Nyctemera amica was the most common folivore on both Senecio species and laboratory studies demonstrated a clear preference by ovipositing females and feeding larvae of this species for the native Senecio species, over the alien. Field surveys supported these findings, recording greater leaf damage on the native species than the invader. Herbivory levels were lower, rather than higher, in mixed populations than in pure populations, thus {{there was no evidence that}} the presence of one species enhanced herbivory in the other. Field pollination trials were conducted to determine whether competition for pollinators or facilitation of pollination occurred in mixed Senecio populations. The presence of the native S. pinnatifolius affected pollinator visitation rates to the alien Senecio; bee visits to S. madagascariensis were significantly reduced by the presence of S. pinnatifolius, whilst syrphid visits increased. However, altered visitation rates were not reflected in seed set. The presence of the alien species had no impact on pollinator visits to the native. Surprisingly, S. pinnatifolius seed set was higher in mixed populations than in pure populations. This might be due to abiotic factors, lower rates of herbivory at these sites or transfer of pollen between species resulting in the production of hybrid seed (if S. madagascariensis has greater male fitness). Hybridisation in the field was investigated using AFLP techniques. No mature hybrid plants were recorded in mixed populations, but hybrid seeds were produced by both species. Senecio pinnatifolius maternal parents produced higher numbers of hybrid seed than expected based on the relative frequencies of the two species, whilst hybridisation in S. madagascariensis was lower than expected. This may indicate greater male fitness of the invader. A range of complex indirect interactions can occur between invasive and native species, with these interactions having the potential to influence the success or failure of the invader and its impacts on co-occurring natives. The Discussion addresses the findings of the studies described here in the context of invasion biology theory...|$|E
