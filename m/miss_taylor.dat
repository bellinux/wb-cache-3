"How often, {{when you}} were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks--'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I may, or I have <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor's</b> leave'--something which, you knew, I did not approve.

60|$|Sixteen {{years had}} <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, {{less as a}} governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but {{particularly}} of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.|$|E

6000|$|Highbury, {{the large}} and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, {{in spite of its}} {{separate}} lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all {{the rest of her life}} at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner, ...|$|E
60|$|He got {{as near as}} {{he could}} to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things {{it was to be}} rather {{supposed}} that <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> had formed Miss Woodhouse's character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.|$|E
60|$|Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but {{not at all}} in {{the shape}} of any disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor's</b> loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no {{prospect}} of a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.|$|R

60|$|How was she to {{bear the}} change?--It was true that her friend was going only {{half a mile from}} them; but Emma was aware that great must be the {{difference}} between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.|$|E
6000|$|Emma {{turned away}} her head, divided between tears and smiles. [...] "It is {{impossible}} that Emma should not miss such a companion," [...] said Mr. Knightley. [...] "We should not like her so {{well as we}} do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor</b> must be glad to have her so happily married." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{situation}} was altogether {{the subject of}} hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, [...] "Ah, poor <b>Miss</b> <b>Taylor!</b> She would be very glad to stay." ...|$|E
