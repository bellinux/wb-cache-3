40|$|Lecturepg. 7 Although <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> {{are widely}} used in many machines, there is no universally {{accepted}} system for establishing limits of pressure, temperature, and speed. As a result, manufacturers of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> may use different methods for stablishing these limits. In turn, users of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> sometimes have their own rating system. Presented here is a general discussion of the difficulties involved in establishing limits along with some specific issues relating to seals used in centrifugal pumps. Recommended definitions are given or terms {{to be used in}} establishing pressure ratings of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> in centrifugal pumps.

40|$|To study {{tribological}} {{property of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> when distributing micropores along the radial face with changeable parameter, friction experiments of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> under a certain condition {{were carried out}} while the pore diameter changed. The results show that: the introduction of micropores on the surface can reduce the friction efficiently, but its antifriction effect {{is closely related to}} the distribution of micropores. The friction coefficient is the smallest when pore diameters increasing by degrees along the seal radial face from the inside out, while complexly distributed of pore diameter has a poor effect on antifriction of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> The results can offer some help for optimal design of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> with micropores...|$|R

5000|$|... A <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal</b> {{would most}} likely be created out of an annular {{elastomeric}} material through which the nozzle must pass during refueling, preventing vapors from escaping alongside the nozzle. A liquid seal is created by {{the design of the}} filler pipe, which creates a seal with the liquid flowing into the tank. Since the liquid fills the entire pipe, no emissions can escape during refueling. A liquid seal is usually used for smaller vehicles, while the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal</b> is used for larger vehicles.|$|E
50|$|An {{end face}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal,</b> also {{referred}} to as a mechanical face seal but usually simply as a <b>mechanical</b> <b>seal,</b> is a type of seal utilised in rotating equipment, such as pumps, mixers, blowers, and compressors. When a pump operates, the liquid could leak out of the pump between the rotating shaft and the stationary pump casing. Since the shaft rotates, preventing this leakage can be difficult. Earlier pump models used mechanical packing (otherwise known as Gland Packing) to seal the shaft. Since World War II, mechanical seals have replaced packing in many applications.|$|E
30|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{has been}} studied for monitoring the condition of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> by many researchers, however to the best knowledge of the authors, typical fault cases and their effects on tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> {{have not yet been}} successfully investigated. In this paper, AE signatures from common faults of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> are studied in association with tribological behaviour of sealing gap to develop more reliable condition monitoring approaches. A purpose-built test rig was employed for recording AE signals from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> under healthy and faulty conditions. The collected data was then processed using time domain and frequency domain analysis methods. The study has shown that AE signal parameters: root mean squared (RMS) along with AE spectrum, allows fault conditions including dry running, spring out and defective seal faces to be diagnosed under a wide range of operating conditions. However, when <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> operate around their transition point, conventional signal processing methods may not allow a clear separation of the fault conditions from the healthy baseline. Therefore an auto-regressive (AR) model has been developed on recorded AE signals to classify different fault conditions of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> and satisfactory results have been perceived.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 14 The {{rotating}} equipment industry's ever-increasing demand for efficient, {{safe and reliable}} seal elements {{has resulted in the}} application of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> in turbomachinery at very high face speeds. In addition to the commonly known installation of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> in fluid handling systems, such as heavy duty centrifugal pumps, applications have been extended in recent years to centrifugal compressors and gas turbines. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> in seawater and NGL injection pumps in oilfield applications are operating currently with face speeds up to 50 meters per second (m/s). In some cases, <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> in centrifugal compressors used in the petrochemical industry have exceeded face speeds of 100 m/s.

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> {{have become}} one of the most popular sealing systems for {{rotating}} machinery because of low leakage and absence of a requirement for routine maintenance. Generally, a <b>mechanical</b> face <b>seal</b> should operate with a fluid film as thin as possible, to reduce the leakage and to restrict friction and wear. Recent advances in a system of computer software based on finite element modelling and analytical approaches help in understanding of the working conditions of the <b>mechanical</b> face <b>seals.</b> This paper reviews tribological bahavior and condition monitoring of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> based on the literature of the recent years.

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> have {{increasingly}} {{been used for}} sealing rotating shafts in centrifugal pumps, propeller shafts in ships and submarines, compressors, liquid propellant rocket motors in aerospace industry, pumps, turbines, mixers and many other rotating machines during last two decades. Abnormal operating conditions in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> will degrade machine performance, increase operating cost and may cause unexpected sudden failures which are dangerous in both engineering and safety terms. Hence {{it is necessary to}} investigate the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> operating based on nonlinear coupling between fluid and surface dynamics, in order to develop more advanced diagnostic technologies to improve the reliability of such machines operating with <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> Different condition monitoring techniques have been studied to evaluate the lubrication state and severity of contact between the mating faces in <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> However, some of them are not cost effective others are not practical in industrial applications. Acoustic emission (AE) has been proved to be a sensitive indicator of lubrication conditions and changes in the lubricant properties, however the application of technique for identification of lubrication regimes in <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> has not been reported yet. Moreover, previous studies give relatively little information to acoustic emission condition monitoring of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals,</b> nor has comprehensive fault detection been implemented for a particular case. In addition, a review on previous works reveals the lack of comprehensive mathematical models to explain the relationship between AE energy and tribological characteristics of the mating faces under healthy and faulty conditions. In this research, the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> is investigated using acoustic emission measurements to pave a way for fault detection at early stage. Three common seal failures i. e. dry running, spring fault, and defective seal are studied in this thesis. The main objective is to extract AE features that can explain the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> under both healthy and faulty conditions. To achieve this, a purpose-built test rig was employed for collecting AE signals from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals.</b> Then, the collected data was processed using time domain, frequency domain and time frequency domain analysis methods which are of the most common techniques used for monitoring in AE applications. Based on results the main frequency band that can present the tribological behaviour of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> was detected. Also it has been proved that AE features in time domain and frequency domain can be effectively applied to indicate the lubrication condition of <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> as well as early fault detection. Moreover, mathematical models were developed to establish a relationship between AE root mean square (RMS) value of AE signals and working parameters of seals (rotational speed, load and number of asperities in contact) under different lubrication regimes. A good agreement was achieved between measured and predicted signals that gives a good evidence of the effectiveness of proposed models. Especially in case of leakage {{that is one of the}} main situations indicating the seal failure, a significant difference was observed between the predicted signal for healthy case and the measured signal under faulty conditions. Therefore, it can be deduced that the AE measurement system and signal processing developed in this work has a promising potential to be used to diagnose and monitor the <b>mechanical</b> <b>seals</b> online. Finally, the conclusions and achievements are given based on the entirety of this research work, and online monitoring incorporating with AE features and mathematical models developed in this thesis are suggested as the main works for further research...|$|R
