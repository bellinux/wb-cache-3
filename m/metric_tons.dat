S. concepts of logistical unit operations: harvest and collection, storage, transportation, preprocessing, and handling and queuing. In this paper, we quantify the logistics cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum in China under different scenarios. We analyze three scenarios of corn stover logistics from northeast China and three scenarios of sweet sorghum stalks logistics from Inner Mongolia in China. The case study {{estimates that the}} logistics cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum stalk to be $ 52. 95 /dry <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> and $ 52. 64 /dry <b>metric</b> <b>ton,</b> respectively, for the current labor-based biomass logistics system. However, if the feedstock logistics operation is mechanized, the cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum stalk decreases to $ 36. 01 /dry <b>metric</b> <b>ton</b> and $ 35. 76 /dry <b>metric</b> <b>ton,</b> respectively. The study also includes a sensitivity analysis to identify the cost factors that cause logistics cost variation. Results of the sensitivity analysis show that labor price has the most influence on the logistics cost of corn stover and sweet sorghum stalk, with a variation of $ 6 to $ 12 /dry <b>metric</b> <b>ton.</b> biomass; logistics system; modeling; corn stover; sweet sorghum stalk...|$|R

5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 <b>metric</b> <b>tons.</b> The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take threshers as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E
5|$|Power and {{communications}} across Rodrigues {{and the island}} of Mauritius were crippled by the storm, with {{the entirety of the}} former and 90 percent of the latter losing electricity. For approximately ten hours, the country was cut off from the outside world, with all communications disrupted. About 50,000 of the nation's 280,000 telecommunication lines sustained serious damage, resulting in prolonged power outages. Repair crews estimated that it would take until January 27, nearly a week after the storm's passage, for power to be fully restored. Widespread areas also lost water on Mauritius. Schools across the region sustained significant damage and as a precautionary measure, all classes were canceled until January 29. Agriculture sustained considerable losses {{as a result of the}} storm. Approximately 15 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> of flour and 20 <b>metric</b> <b>tons</b> of rice were damaged and preliminary estimates for sugarcane losses across the island reached US$47 million.
