25|$|Through {{incentive}} compensation structures, {{employees can}} be guided {{to focus their}} attention and efforts on certain organizational goals. The goals that are reinforced through incentive pay should be carefully considered to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in alignment with the organizational objectives. If there are multiple rewards programs, {{it is important to}} consider if there might be any conflicting goals. For example, individual and team-based rewards can sometime work at cross-purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan {{instructed}} animal quarantine offices across Japan {{to examine}} any live pigs being brought into Japan to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not {{infected with the}} influenza. Japanese Agriculture Minister Shigeru Ishiba appeared on television to reassure customers that {{it is safe to}} eat pork. The Japanese farm ministry said that it would not ask for restrictions on pork imports because the virus was unlikely to turn up in pork, and would be killed by cooking.|$|E
25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (or cry, or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in your favor.|$|E

25|$|One topic {{covered in}} this section {{describes}} the responsibility art therapist have to their patients (ATCB 2005). According to the ATCB, art therapists must strive to advance the wellness of their clients, respect {{the rights of the}} client, and <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> providing a useful service (2005). They cannot discriminate against patient whatsoever, and may never desert or neglect patients receiving therapy. Art therapist must fully explain to their patients what their expectations of the patients will be {{at the outset of the}} professional relationship between the two. Art therapists should continue therapy with a patient only if the client is benefiting from the therapy. It's against the principles established by the ATCB for art therapist to have patients only for financial reasons.|$|E
25|$|Financial {{institutions}} {{must now}} undertake steps {{to identify the}} owners of any privately owned bank outside the U.S. who have a correspondent account with them, along {{with the interests of}} each of the owners in the bank. It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not engaging in money laundering. Banks must identify all the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens. There is also an expectation that they must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any senior political figure where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption.|$|E

2500|$|United States – U.S. President Obama and aides {{for former}} Senator Domenici {{publicly}} supported continued {{development of new}} U.S. nuclear power facilities. The influential The New York Times stated in an editorial on 14 March that [...] "the unfolding Japanese tragedy also should prompt Americans to closely study our own plans for coping with natural disasters and with potential nuclear plant accidents to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> indeed, strong enough". A more definitive expression {{of the impact of}} the accidents in the United States was the decision by NRG Energy, Inc. to abandon already started construction on two new nuclear power plants in Texas. Analysts attributed the abandonment of the project to the financial situation of the plant-partner TEPCO, the inability raise other construction financing, the current low cost of electricity in Texas, and expected additional permitting delays.|$|E
2500|$|Typical weekly {{maintenance}} includes changing around 10–20% {{of the water}} while cleaning the gravel, or other substrate if the aquarium has one; however some manage to avoid this entirely by keeping it somewhat self-sufficient. A good habit is to remove the water being replaced by [...] "vacuuming" [...] the gravel with suitable implements, as this will eliminate uneaten foods and other residues that settle on the substrate. In many areas tap water is {{not considered to be}} safe for fish to live in because it contains chemicals that harm the fish. Tap water from those areas must be treated with a suitable water conditioner, such as a product which removes chlorine and chloramine and neutralizes any heavy metals present. The water conditions must be checked both in the tank and in the replacement water, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> suitable for the species of fish kept.|$|E
