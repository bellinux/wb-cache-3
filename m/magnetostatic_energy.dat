40|$|Free fall in an {{external}} static gravitational field of a composite test body consisting of electromagnetically interacting charged particles is analyzed using the TH-epsilon-mu formalism developed by Lightman and Lee (1973). The Lightman and Lee calculation that {{was carried out}} to 'post-Coulombian' order is extended to 'post-post-Coulombian' order, and violations of the weak equivalence principle are found which result from the magnetostatic self-energy of the test body. The current generation of Eotvos experiments is shown to test the cited formalism at first order in the external gravitational potential to an accuracy of 4 by 10 to the - 10 th power for electrostatic energies and 6 by 10 to the - 6 th power for <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energies.</b> It is concluded that although the formalism can be tested to an accuracy of 0. 04 for electrostatic energies at second order in the gravitational potential, a significant second-order test for <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energies</b> would require Eotvos experiments accurate to better than one part in 10 to the 15 th power...|$|R
40|$|In {{recently}} developed ferromagnetic shape-memory alloys (e. g., NiMnGa or FePd compounds), martensitic transformations, hence large changes of shape, can {{be triggered by}} an applied magnetic field. The macroscopic deformations exhibited by such ferromagnetic martensites in response to applied magneto-mechanical loads correspond to easy deformation paths achieved through the cooperative evolution of microscopic magnetoelastic domains. We discuss a variational model for these materials which includes elastic, magnetocrystalline and <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energies.</b> Macroscopic deformations are computed as averages on energy minimizing elastic domain structures. Magnetostriction curves are computed by solving parametrically a discrete, constrained optimization problem...|$|R

We found that a state with radial orientation of the magnetization prevails at remanence. The evaluation of the magnetoelastic, magnetocrystalline and <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energies</b> shows that a value as low as 1. 5 × 10 - 3 for the anisotropic relaxation of the in-plane strain components is enough to induce an effective radial easy magnetization direction.

50|$|The <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> is {{the energy}} {{stored in the}} field {{generated}} by a material's magnetic moments. The magnet's field reaches its maximum intensity if all the magnetic moments orient in one direction; this is what occurs in a hard magnet. In order to prevent building up the magnetic field, sometimes magnetic moments tend to form loops. That way, the energy stored in the magnetic field can be constrained; this is what occurs in a soft magnet. What determines whether a magnet is hard or soft is the dominant term of its magnetic energy. For hard magnets, the anisotropy constant is relatively large, making the magnetic moments align with easy axis. The opposite case applies to soft magnets, in which the <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> is dominant.|$|E
5000|$|An {{additional}} way for {{the material}} to further reduce its <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> is to form domains with magnetization {{at right angles to}} the other domains (diagram c, right), instead of just in opposing parallel directions. [...] These domains, called flux closure domains, allow the field lines to turn 180° within the material, forming closed loops entirely within the material, reducing the <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> to zero. However, forming these domains incurs two additional energy costs. First, the crystal lattice of most magnetic materials has magnetic anisotropy, which means it has an [...] "easy" [...] direction of magnetization, parallel to one of the crystal axes. Changing the magnetization of the material to any other direction takes additional energy, called the [...] "magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy".|$|E
5000|$|To form these {{closure domains}} with [...] "sideways" [...] {{magnetization}} requires additional energy {{due to the}} aforementioned two factors. So flux closure domains will only form where the <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> saved {{is greater than the}} sum of the [...] "exchange energy" [...] to create the domain wall, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and the magnetoelastic anisotropy energy. Therefore, most of the volume of the material is occupied by domains with magnetization either [...] "up" [...] or [...] "down" [...] along the [...] "easy" [...] direction, and the flux closure domains only form in small areas {{at the edges of the}} other domains where they are needed to provide a path for magnetic field lines to change direction (diagram c, above).|$|E
40|$|The high {{frequency}} magnetic susceptibility of glass-coated microwires with effective circumferential anisotropy has been modeled by micromagnetics. In their amorphous and magnetically soft metallic nucleus, the negative magnetostriction induces a continuous and non-uniform vortex-like structure, with an axially magnetized core coupled to a circumferentially magnetized outer shell. The {{model is a}} one-dimensional radial micromagnetic model where exchange, magnetoelastic and <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energies</b> are considered. The microwave permeability under AC (axial and circumferential) fields {{is found to be}} expressed as a sum over a set of eigenmodes, each with a characteristic resonance frequency. In the framework of this model, a sum rule on the frequency-dependent permeability is shown to hold. It provides a figure of merit and guidelines for the design of high permeability materials for applications in the microwave range. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Purpose - The paper {{seeks to}} do the following. To provide an {{expression}} of the electromagnetic power flow that is alternative to the Poynting's theorem expression, overcomes its postulate feature, and is particularly suitable for electric circuit elements. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proceeds from fundamental electromagnetic laws and, independently of Poynting's formulation, follows an approach that generalize established double formulations of the electrostatic and <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energies.</b> Findings - The paper proposes a compact and straightforward expression of the electromagnetic power flow based on the fundamental electromagnetic field sources, i. e. charge and current densities. Practical implications - The achieved expression confirms Poynting's expression in the case of electric elements, overcoming its arbitrariness, generalizes previous partial results by other authors, deduced via the Poynting's power balance. Originality/value - Is promising in the computation of power flow electromagnetic devices connected in electrical circuits, i. e. for coupled problems where the analysis of electromagnetic system interfaced to electric circuits is required. Due to its simple structure and straightforward deduction it has educational value to demonstrate the expressions of the electric power in circuit elements...|$|R

We estimate their <b>magnetostatic</b> interaction <b>energy</b> and its dependence on the microscopic distribution of the magnetization and the magnetic field in the composite material. We also define the hydrostatic component of the mechanical force developed and the volume change effect caused by the magnetostatic interactions in such composites. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|Ferromagnetic {{materials}} spontaneously {{divide into}} magnetic domains because the exchange interaction is a short-range force, so over long distances of many atoms {{the tendency of}} the magnetic dipoles to reduce their energy by orienting in opposite directions wins out. If all the dipoles {{in a piece of}} ferromagnetic material are aligned parallel, it creates a large magnetic field extending into the space around it. This contains a lot of <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy.</b> The material can reduce this energy by splitting into many domains pointing in different directions, so the magnetic field is confined to small local fields in the material, reducing the volume of the field. The domains are separated by thin domain walls a number of molecules thick, in which the direction of magnetization of the dipoles rotates smoothly from one domain's direction to the other.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetic}} hysteresis loop of an exchange spring magnet theoretically takes on a shape resembling that of a summation of its hard and soft magnetic components (as seen in Figure 1), meaning its energy product is {{higher than those of}} its components. A magnet’s maximum energy product (BH)max, which is roughly proportional to its coercivity (HC) and magnetization saturation (Msat), is used as a metric of its ability to do magnetic work as (BH)max is twice the magnet’s available <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy.</b> The exchange spring magnet offers a geometry able to improve upon the previously reported maximum energy products of materials such as Rare Earth/Transition Metal complexes; while both materials have sufficiently large HC values and operate at relatively high Curie Temperatures, the exchange spring magnet can achieve much higher Msat values than the Rare Earth/Transition Metal (RE-TM) complexes.|$|E
5000|$|EH is Zeeman energy: This is energy {{which is}} added to or {{subtracted}} from the <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy,</b> due to {{the interaction between the}} magnetic material and an externally applied magnetic field. It is proportional to the negative of the cosine of the angle between the field and magnetization vectors. Domains with their magnetic field oriented parallel to the applied field reduce this energy, while domains with their magnetic field oriented opposite to the applied field increase this energy. So applying a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic material generally causes the domain walls to move so as to increase the size of domains lying mostly parallel to the field, at the cost of decreasing the size of domains opposing the field. This is what happens when ferromagnetic materials are [...] "magnetized". With a strong enough external field, the domains opposing the field will be swallowed up and disappear; this is called saturation.|$|E
40|$|The most general {{electrodynamic}} equations of {{a perfect}} conducting state are obtained using a variational principle in a classical framework, following an approach by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes. London equations are derived as the time-independent case of these equations, corresponding to the <b>magnetostatic</b> minimal <b>energy</b> state of the perfect conducting system. For further confirmation, the same equations are also derived in the classical limit of the Coleman-Weinberg model, the most successful quantum macroscopic theory of superconductivity. The magnetic field expulsion is, therefore, {{a direct consequence of}} zero resistivity and not an exclusive property of superconductors. Comment: 7 pages; published in Int J Theor Phys (2013...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{multilayer}} device comprising of a thin-film-based ferromagnetic hetero-structure (FMH) deposited on a diamond layer doped with nitrogen vacancy centers (NVC's). We find {{that when the}} NVC's are in close proximity (1 - 2 nm) with the FMH, the exchange energy is comparable to, and may even surpass the <b>magnetostatic</b> interaction <b>energy.</b> This calls for the need to consider and utilize both effects in magnetometry based on NVC's in diamond. As {{the distance between the}} FMH and NVC is decreased to the sub-nanometer scale, the exponential increase in the exchange energy suggests spintronic applications of NVC beyond magnetometry, such as detection of spin-Hall effect or spin currents.

40|$|Using the {{micromagnetics}} package MAGPAR, {{we study}} {{the ground states}} of NiFe nanorings with sub- 100 -nm lateral dimensions, in zero external field. We solve the Landau–Lifschitz–Gilbert equation for three different initial magnetizations (in plane, out of plane, and vortex) to obtain the lowest energy state. Plotting the total energy {{as a function of}} thickness, along with its corresponding <b>magnetostatic</b> and exchange <b>energies,</b> we are able to identify various phase transitions and derive phase diagrams as a function of thickness and outer radius, normalized to the exchange length, for rings with different inner to outer radius ratios. We discuss the results in terms of shape anisotropy and its effect on the <b>magnetostatic</b> and exchange <b>energies.</b> We also compare the results of our numerical method to the phase diagram of a nanodot and the phase diagrams of rings obtained by analytical models. Finally, we present a new ground state configura-tion, the helix, found along the boundary between the vortex and out of plane phases, where the magnetization is vortex like, but with moments canted along the direction.

5000|$|The {{reason a}} piece of {{magnetic}} material such as iron spontaneously divides into separate domains, rather than exist in a state with magnetization {{in the same direction}} throughout the material, is to minimize its internal energy. [...] A large region of ferromagnetic material with a constant magnetization throughout will create a large magnetic field extending into the space outside itself (diagram a, right). This requires a lot of <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> stored in the field. To reduce this energy, the sample can split into two domains, with the magnetization in opposite directions in each domain (diagram b right). The magnetic field lines pass in loops in opposite directions through each domain, reducing the field outside the material. To reduce the field energy further, each of these domains can split also, resulting in smaller parallel domains with magnetization in alternating directions, with smaller amounts of field outside the material.|$|E
30|$|By {{looking at}} the balance between the <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> and the domain wall energy, it is energetically {{unfavorable}} to form domain walls below a critical radius, because the domain-wall energy is very low, and a single domain {{is formed as a}} result of high <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{postulated}} that in nanostructured ferromagnets, e. g., Ni, Fe, and Co, exchange and <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> dominate crystalline anisotropy energy {{and therefore the}} usual domain structure imposed via anisotropy {{is replaced by a}} structure consisting of topological defects. The defects are nonlinear solutions of the classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian of spins modified by <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy,</b> have the topological properties of disclinations, and are partly classified by the Hopf index. Coercive force is a consequence of entanglements of disclinations, pinning, and mutual obstruction during crossing processes correlated to local (spin) conductivity.

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} {{problem of}} a static head-to-head domain wall structure in a thin soft-magnetic nanowire with circular cross-section is treated {{within the framework of}} micromagnetic theory.

Rev. 67, 351 (1945) ]. The analytic results agree almost perfectly with simulation data as long as the wire diameter is sufficiently small to prevent inhomogeneities of the magnetization along the cross-section. Owing to the recently demonstrated negligible Döring mass of these walls, our results should also apply to the dynamic case, where domain walls are driven by spin-transfer toque effects and/or an axial magnetic field...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method to {{accurately}} compute {{the energy of the}} magnetostatic interaction between linearly (or uniformly, as a special case) magnetized polyhedrons. The method has applications in finite element micromagnetics, or more generally in computing the magnetostatic interaction when the magnetization is represented using the finite element method (FEM). The <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> is described by a six-fold integral that is singular when the interaction regions overlap, making direct numerical evaluation problematic. To resolve the singularity, we evaluate four of the six iterated integrals analytically resulting in a 2 d integral over the surface of a polyhedron, which is nonsingular and can be integrated numerically. This provides a more accurate and efficient way of computing the <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> integral compared to existing approaches. The method was developed to facilitate the evaluation of the demagnetizing interaction between neighbouring elements in finite-element micromagnetics and provides a possibility to compute the demagnetizing field using efficient fast multipole or tree code algorithms. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy</b> is {{calculated}} for a magnetic vortex in a noncircular elliptical nanodisk. It is well-known {{that the energy}} of a vortex in the circular disk is minimized though an ansatz that eliminates the magnetostatic charge at the disk edge. Beginning with this ansatz for the circular disk, a conformal mapping of a circle interior onto the interior of an ellipse results in the magnetization of the elliptical disk. This magnetization {{in the interior of}} an ellipse also has no magnetostatic charge at the disk edge also minimizing the <b>magnetostatic</b> <b>energy.</b> As expected the energy has a quadratic dependence on the displacement of the vortex core from the ellipse center, but reflecting the lower symmetry of the ellipse. Through numerical integration of the magnetostatic integral a general expression for the energy is obtained for ellipticity values from 1. 0 to about 0. 3.
