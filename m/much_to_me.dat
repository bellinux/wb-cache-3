5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
25|$|I have {{preferred}} to not let this diagnosis {{get in the way}} of getting on with life. I feel a deep frustration at this new roadblock, as I now have to take a step back and undergo treatment. The band means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and cancelling the tour has been a very sad decision. I am hopeful that in the near future we will be back on the road again playing music we love.|$|E
25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

500|$|During later {{interviews}} {{he spoke}} about Strasberg and the Studio's effect on his career. [...] "The Actors Studio meant so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Ismay, however, [...] "had a sneaking {{desire to}} be a cavalry soldier", and after doing poorly on his final {{examinations}} at Charterhouse, he was not eligible to attend Cambridge. As a result, he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1904. Ismay would later write: [...] "Sandhurst never meant nearly so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as Charterhouse had", but he enjoyed his time at the school and studied alongside many men who went on to become important military officers, including Lord Gort, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt and Cyril Newall.|$|E
500|$|During the post-race press conference, Harvick and Busch {{commented on}} their {{accident}} during the race. [...] "Harvick pulled a slide job on my {{earlier in the}} day, I crossed over and passed him clean. My guys worked way too hard {{to be in this}} position to have a wrecked race car {{at the end of the}} year. It means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to finish the year strong. I talked to him in the driver’s meeting but Kevin is such a two-faced guy it doesn’t really matter," [...] Busch said. Afterward, Harvick said [...] "Kyle raced me like a clown all day." ...|$|E

Despite Kariya having only once attended the arena following his retirement, Selänne made sure to invite his old teammate as [...] "he has meant so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> all my best years and the chemistry I’ve had with him." [...] Selänne {{even went so far}} to threaten to tie him up and toss him in his trunk of his car, then drive him to the stadium himself if Kariya refused. Paul Kariya was shown on the Jumbotron during the third period.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2008, Beghe {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the Church of Scientology held outside the Scientology building on East 46th Street in New York City. He addressed the 50 protesters gathered {{across the street from}} the Scientology building, and told them: [...] "What you guys are doing means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and so much to these people ... It just kills me. It makes me want to cry. You don’t know what kind of good you’re doing." [...] He then walked across the street in an attempt to enter the Scientology building, but was prevented from entering by three hired private security guards. He returned to the group of protesters and tried to phone the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael: [...] "I called and asked for John Carmichael and said I was Jason Beghe. Then they hung up." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Minogue's {{breast cancer}} {{diagnosis}} in 2005, {{she has been}} a sponsor and ambassador for the cause. In May 2010, she held a breast cancer campaign for the first time. She later spoke about the cause saying [...] "It means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{to be part of this}} year's campaign for Fashion Targets Breast Cancer. I wholeheartedly support their efforts to raise funds for the vital work undertaken by Breakthrough Breast Cancer." [...] For the cause, she [...] "posed in a silk sheet emblazoned with the distinctive target logo of Fashion Targets Breast Cancer" [...] for photographer Mario Testino. In 2010, she celebrated her fifth anniversary of being clear of the disease by hosting a charity concert to raise money for cancer charities and awareness of the condition.

500|$|... "Virus Alert" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Sparks, {{specifically}} {{their work in}} the mid-1970s, such as their album Kimono My House (1974). It details [...] "the evil that lurks in your email inbox." [...] "Close but No Cigar" [...] is a style parody of Cake that {{tells the story of}} a man who breaks up with his seemingly perfect girlfriends due to the most inconsequential of flaws. The song was inspired by an actual friend of Yankovic's who was never satisfied with any of his dates; Yankovic later explained that [...] "the song was inspired by [...] attitude, that nothing could ever be good enough." [...] The final original recorded, [...] "Pancreas", is a song mainly about the biological functions of the aforementioned organ. The song is an imitation of the musical stylings of Brian Wilson, specifically his work found on the 1966 album Pet Sounds, released by the Beach Boys, and their aborted follow-up album, Smile. Yankovic joked that the reason the song was written was because [...] "my pancreas has given so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> over the years, I felt like I needed to give something back to it".|$|E
500|$|Ross {{described}} Eve's {{relationship with}} Julian Crane as an authentic representation of an interracial couple. She felt Eve was written as a fully realized person {{with her own}} story, {{rather than as a}} [...] "walking, living philosophical statement" [...] about race relations. Ross praised [...] "the people who laid the groundwork for [...] " [...] and allowed characters to be played other than [...] "in a minstrel-like way", similar to Ellen DeGeneres paving the way for Will & Grace. Ross and Amelia Marshall, who played Eve's adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne, believed that the relationship emphasized a difference in social classes rather than races. Initially, Ross felt intimidated by playing a part of a supercouple, saying [...] "t means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I want to do it justice", but following the show's cancelation, she identified it as her favorite storyline. She went on to equate the Julian and Eve's love story to that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "My Baby's Gone", a song that Eve frequently performs on the show during flashbacks, was used to symbolize Eve's relationship with Julian. Ross recorded the vocals for it, as well as four other songs, without the aid of Auto-Tune. Passions was Ross' first singing role. When asked by a fan about her experiences singing on the show, Ross said she worked with a vocal coach, and described her sound as [...] "sincere, soft, [...] non-grating".|$|E
500|$|... "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] was favourably {{received}} by critics. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called the song [...] "powerful" [...] {{and described the}} backing vocals as tender and choirlike. Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described it as a}} [...] "hymn to human rights". Adrian Thrills of NME called it [...] "a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness". Nicholas Jennings of Maclean's felt that it was The Joshua Trees [...] "most topical song". Music journalist Andrew Mueller felt the track was a [...] "wilfully downbeat finale". In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' is built around desolate images of loss, but the setting is soothing and restorative—music of great sadness but also of unutterable compassion, acceptance and calm." [...] Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News stated that there was [...] "an ineffable sadness in Bono's vocals and images where 'Night hangs like a prisoner / Stretched over black and blue'", calling it [...] "a moving tribute" [...] to people around the world who had lost loved ones to warfare and conflict. He added [...] "hat's remarkable about the song is that despite the intrinsic pain, it remains eerily cleansing. Even in the midst of decay and excess and horror, Bono can find hope and absolution." [...] In 2006 Bono described it as [...] "a beautiful end to the album", saying, [...] "That song means as <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as any of the songs on that album, it's right up there for me," [...] and noting that it is a song [...] "I'm very proud of to this day." ...|$|E

500|$|Themes in Lavigne's music include {{messages}} of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view. Lavigne believes her [...] "songs are about being yourself {{no matter what}} and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true." [...] On her debut album, Let Go, Lavigne preferred the less mainstream songs, such as [...] "Losing Grip", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as [...] "Complicated", saying that [...] "the songs I did with the Matrix... were good for my first record, but I don't {{want to be that}} pop anymore." [...] Lavigne's second album, Under My Skin, had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that [...] "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about... Like boys, like dating or relationships". Musically, it's considered her heaviest album that showcased ballads and rocker songs with a more post-grunge sound that verged on nü-metal style. [...] In contrast, her third album, The Best Damn Thing, was not personal to her. [...] "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It's not like some personal thing I'm going through." [...] Her objective in writing the album was simply to [...] "make it fun". The style has been praised for her ability to combine bubblegum pop melodies with punk rock riffs. Goodbye Lullaby, Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records, with Lavigne describing the album as [...] "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional". Ian McKellen defined her as [...] "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" [...] on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{made his}} test debut against England in 1975. [...] "No one said <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before my first Test," [...] he recalled. [...] "You were an Australian, you'd got there {{because you could}} play, and you were {{expected}} to man up." ...|$|E
2500|$|An open letter, {{originally}} {{thought to have}} been written by Canibus on Tumblr, explaining his performance about the battle surfaced online, though it was later debunked by his manager as fake, saying that Canibus will make an official statement when the time is right. Canibus later released an official statement on his Facebook page. About the battle itself, Canibus commented that [...] "Sometimes people need laughter and entertainment {{at the expense of others}} embarrassment but hip hop means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I don't care." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{get down}} to Bleak House," [...] said Richard, [...] "I shall have <b>much</b> <b>to</b> tell you, sir, {{and you will have}} <b>much</b> <b>to</b> show <b>me.</b> You will go, won't you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Hamilton {{would later}} utilize a studio {{built at the}} Frederick Douglass Academy. Hamilton would spend countless hours in the studio, {{developing}} his craft and his own signature sound. Hamilton stated, [...] "The Lab (FDA's studio) means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> because when I literally didn't have anywhere else {{to go in the}} world, I can just go into my beloved alma mater and purge myself creatively." [...] The studio in the Frederick Douglass Academy is where most of Charles Hamilton's music is made. Hamilton has also stated, regarding FDA's studio, that [...] " [...] can do my thing in other studios. It's just something about home that makes my music breathe." [...] Hamilton attended Rice High School in Harlem, we're he would also participate in freestyle rap battles.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Manson {{announced}} she was stepping away from music, claiming she got {{sick of the}} music industry's new practices and had found more excitement in acting. Manson said she thought about abandoning the music business as soon as 2008, when her mother developed dementia, and later died, saying that [...] "I didn't want to make music, didn't feel creative. I could barely function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] at their son's memorial. According to Manson, [...] "we were all in so much pain, but it {{meant so much to}} them that I could sing that song and so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I was able to do something. It made me realise how much music sustains people. I don't know why I'd turned my back on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means so <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{to come here and}} get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear one, {{neither will}} it be so <b>much</b> {{pleasure}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> [...] . But I do take a little delight in my life, I suppose," [...] she pouted.|$|R
