50|$|Because {{of their}} {{usefulness}} {{in carrying out}} power calculations, listed voltages for power outlets (e.g., 120 V in the USA, or 230 V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies V = VRMS × √2, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the <b>mains</b> <b>voltage</b> in the USA is about 120 × √2, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts.

These are {{being used as a}} low-cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries. The filaments require a rather high voltage to light to nominal brightness, allowing them to work efficiently and simply with <b>mains</b> <b>voltages.</b> Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of the low voltage, high current converter that single die LEDs need. Usually, they are packaged in a sealed enclosure with a shape similar to lamps they were designed to replace (e.g. a bulb) and filled with inert nitrogen or carbon dioxide gas to remove heat efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Plugs {{and power}} cords have a rated voltage (V) and rated current (A) {{assigned}} {{to them by}} the manufacturer, and these values are required to be marked on the plug. For a plug, the values are normally those specified in the relevant standard sheet. The international preferred rating for household plugs and sockets is either 130 V or 250 V; these are the values for normal use, and at which they are tested. (Plugs and power cords are also required to be tested at higher voltage for a brief period of 1 minute to test their electrical strength in case of fault conditions.) The NEMA 1-15 U.S. 2 pin (Type A) and NEMA 5-15 U.S. 3 pin (Type B) plugs are rated at 125 V.

50|$|Vacuum tube {{equipment}} used {{a number of}} tubes, each with a heater requiring {{a certain amount of}} electrical power. In AC/DC equipment, the heaters of all the tubes are connected in series. All the tubes are rated at the same current (typically 100, 150, 300, or 450 mA) but at different voltages, according to their heating power requirements. If necessary, resistance (which can be a ballast tube (barretter), a power resistor or a resistive mains lead are added so that, when the mains voltage is applied across the chain, the specified heating current flows. Some types of ballast resistors were built into an envelope like a tube that was easily replaceable. With <b>mains</b> <b>voltages</b> of around 220 V, the power dissipated by the additional resistance and the voltage drop across it could be quite high, and it was common to use a resistive power cable (mains cord) of defined resistance, running warm, rather than putting a hot resistor inside the case. If a resistive power cable was used, an inexperienced repairer might replace it with a standard cable, or use the wrong length, damaging the equipment and risking a fire.|$|E
5000|$|Antifuses {{are best}} known for their use in mini-light (or miniature) style {{low-voltage}} Christmas tree lights. Ordinarily (for operation from <b>mains</b> <b>voltages),</b> the lamps are wired in series. (The larger, traditional, C7 and C9 style lights are wired in parallel and are rated to operate directly at mains voltage.) Because the series string would be rendered inoperable by a single lamp failing, each bulb has an antifuse installed within it. When the bulb blows, the entire mains voltage is applied across the single blown lamp. This rapidly causes the antifuse to short out the blown bulb, allowing the series circuit to resume functioning, albeit with {{a larger proportion of}} the mains voltage now applied to each of the remaining lamps. The antifuse is made using wire with a high resistance coating and this wire is coiled over the two vertical filament support wires inside the bulb. The insulation of the antifuse wire withstands the ordinary low voltage imposed across a functioning lamp but rapidly breaks down under the full mains voltage, giving the antifuse action. Occasionally, the insulation fails to break down on its own, but tapping the blown lamp will usually finish the job. Often a special bulb with no antifuse and often a slightly different rating (so it blows first as the voltage gets too high) known as a [...] "fuse bulb" [...] is incorporated into the string of lights to protect against the possibility of severe overcurrent if too many bulbs fail.|$|E

Excessive fluctuations beyond these limits may cause the appliance to malfunction or get irreparably damaged. Most protective devices are imported as well as expensive.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we focus our {{attention}} on the channel variation of indoor powerline channels caused {{by the presence of}} nonlinear loads. The nonlinear behavior of some electrical devices (with respect to the <b>mains</b> <b>voltages)</b> produces short time variations synchronous to the mains. The goal of our investigation is to obtain estimates of the upper and lower bounds of the channel’s response both in the time and in the frequency domain in such situation. Nonlinearities are modeled in the frequency domain as the sum of a nominal value impedance and a number of elementary pulse shaped terms with uncertain weights. The indoor power line channel is modeled in the wavelet domain and a sensitivity analysis with respect to the weights is performed by the adjoint circuit method. The proposed method allows a fast and accurate evaluation of the bounds of the response of the channel avoiding time consuming Montecarlo simulations...|$|E
