5|$|Meanwhile, Felix Leiter and Darius inform agent Silver of {{the second}} method of attack. Silver shows {{himself to be a}} double agent by failing to call in an airstrike against the Ekranoplan and by {{attempting}} to kill Leiter and Darius. In the shoot-out Darius successfully calls in the airstrike at the cost of his own life and Leiter survives only thanks to the timely arrival of Hamid, his taxi driver. The Ekranoplan is destroyed by RAF Vulcan bombers before it reaches its target. Bond and Scarlett escape through Russia but are pursued by Chagrin, whom Bond finally kills on a train. Later Gorner meets him on a boat and tries to shoot him, but Bond pushes him overboard, where he is torn to pieces by a propeller. With the subsequent elimination of both Chagrin and Gorner, Bond considers his mission a success, and on condition that the agent M has waiting in the wings will not take his place Bond is sent to assess the new agent, designated 004. She turns out to be Scarlett Papava. Scarlett discloses that the story of her twin sister was a ploy to convince Bond to enable her to join the mission. Papava feared that if Bond knew she was a potential 00 agent, he would not have worked with her. With Bond returning to active duty, Scarlett <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> to her own operations as a full 00 agent.|$|E
50|$|The {{cars are}} {{typically}} {{placed on a}} square lattice that is topologically equivalent to a torus: that is, cars that <b>move</b> <b>off</b> the right edge would reappear on the left edge; and cars that <b>move</b> <b>off</b> the bottom edge would reappear on the top edge.|$|R
50|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} the torpedo struck Owen gave the order to abandon ship. Forty-nine men took to the sea in three open boats. The boats <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> and stood by. Ten minutes later U-510 surfaced, fired two bursts from her 37mm AA gun into the {{waterline}} of the bow to flood the forward holds, and then <b>moved</b> <b>off</b> on the surface in a westerly direction. As the submarine <b>moved</b> <b>off,</b> Owen attempted {{to return to his}} ship but before the crew could get alongside Point Pleasant sank. As she sank, hull stress caused the steam whistle to sound in a long final salute.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>off</b> from an incline: A MMT car rolls {{backwards}} when on an up-sloping incline, unlike {{an automatic}} car. To <b>move</b> <b>off</b> from an up-sloping incline, apply handbrake before depressing the accelerator slightly. Do not hold {{the car on}} an incline by depressing the accelerator pedal, as the slipping clutch will overheat and lead to clutch damage.|$|R
25|$|Muffling {{the bass}} can be {{achieved}} with the same muffling techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping bag or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.|$|E
25|$|Erste Invasion (First Invasion). As {{the sound}} bombs {{continue}} to detonate, approaching signals of trumpets and trombones can be heard. Lucifer's troops, wearing {{black and red}} battle dress invade the hall, pursued by Michael's trumpeter troops, dressed in light blue and red. As the combatants move to and fro, the Lucifer troops succeed in removing some of the camouflage from the precipice, revealing a chrome bunker wall. The combat <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> to the right, the bass detonations cease, the music flak falls silent, and the melancholy Wednesday segment of Eve's formula in the octophonic music suffuses the space.|$|E
25|$|At UMass Amherst, only freshmen are {{required}} to live on campus. Housing {{is open to all}} full-time undergraduate students, regardless of year. Upper-class students who have continuously lived on campus during their first and sophomore years are guaranteed housing as long as they choose to live on campus. If, however, a student is admitted after their sophomore year, or <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> campus, and wants to move back onto campus, they are not guaranteed housing, but instead must go through a housing lottery, since demand outstrips supply. Housing assignments are accomplished by a complex process that takes into account building seniority as well as class year; those choosing to move from their building are subject to a lottery system. There are approximately 12,000 students living on campus.|$|E

500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent {{gave the}} album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "Williams' albums have {{increasingly}} come to focus upon the singer himself, which has consequently made them {{less and less}} appealing to those not entirely smitten with his charms." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from The Observer who also gave the album three stars out of five. She said that [...] "Reality Killed the Video Star is littered with references to his fall from grace, most of which hinge {{on the premise that}} someone or something else is truly responsible for his diminishing popularity." [...] Swash said that [...] "If there's a theme here it's not obvious, but it turns out Williams can be quite interesting when he <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the topic of himself." [...] Swash concluded that the album swings between [...] "mawkish strings and piano overproduction" [...] and [...] "flashes of genuine pop frivolity".|$|E
500|$|... 's Anthony Roux was {{the rider}} in question, {{and he set}} off after the quartet up front, {{and was able to}} reach them with around [...] {{remaining}} of the stage. However, the peloton was not far behind, and the breakaway did not last much longer after that. With the field back together, several riders attempted solo <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the front of the peloton, including Kadri's team-mate Mickaël Cherel, but all were unsuccessful. The group remained together into the climb towards the finish; [...] and [...] headed the group, protecting their main riders Nibali and Cadel Evans from any potential trouble. World time trial champion Tony Martin tried to get clear within the final kilometre for [...] but could not sustain a gap over everyone else, and [...] rider Daniel Moreno timed his sprint perfectly, to take his third win of the season, ahead of French pair Julien Simon (...) and 's Tony Gallopin. Wiggins finished ninth to maintain his one-second overall lead over Evans, who was seventh.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Dance with Somebody", Kurt {{feels that}} Blaine has been distant, and confides in {{a boy named}} Chandler he meets at the local music store. The two hit it off {{instantly}} with their common interest of moving to New York after high school. Kurt begins texting Chandler quite often soon after that. Rachel thinks he's being in the wrong that Kurt is cheating on Blaine instead of talking to Blaine about the rut they are in. Blaine finds out about Chandler and is extremely hurt. Both Kurt and Blaine sing Whitney songs to express {{how they feel about}} their situation with Blaine singing It's Not Right but It's Okay and Kurt singing I Have Nothing as an apology. Eventually after having a talk in Emma's office, the two make up and are stronger than ever. In [...] "Goodbye", Blaine is worried that he and Kurt will not make it as a couple after Kurt graduates and <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> to New York. Kurt reassures him that they will be okay as a couple. After graduation, Kurt, Rachel and Finn's letters from the New York schools they applied to come in. Kurt does not get accepted to NYADA.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the main}} field, 's Tanel Kangert and [...] rider Danilo Di Luca both {{launched}} combative <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the front, {{while at the}} bottom of the final climb, Kangert's team-mate Vincenzo Nibali fell to the ground due to the slippery conditions. The main field had split at this point, with [...] missing the junction, leaving Bradley Wiggins in a chasing group. Sella– who was in between the lead and the peloton– crashed with around [...] remaining, with the same corner later catching out Wiggins, who later elected to gingerly descend the rest of the hill, losing more time to the main group. At the front, Hansen– who completed all three Grand Tours in 2012– was still out front and soloed away to his first win since 2010. A 27-rider group came across the line just over a minute later, with 's Enrico Battaglin leading the group. The majority of the race favourites were within this group, with the exception of Wiggins, who lost nearly 90 seconds more than that, dropping outside the top 20 overall. Paolini was also in that group, and thus surrendered the lead of the race to the 's Beñat Intxausti, with Nibali and 's Ryder Hesjedal within ten seconds ahead of the following day's time trial.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Imperial Eagle" [...] (Kenzo Suzuki) and the [...] "Italian Eagle" [...] (Marco Corleone) were {{accompanied}} by CMLL Luchadora Mima Shimoda to the right for the main event match. During the early parts of the match the crowd would actually cheer for the rudo team at times, especially Marco Corleone, choosing to side with him instead of the recently turned Universo 2000 and Shocker who had not done a lot to earn the crowd's respect {{leading up to the}} match. Shocker pinned Corleone after just over four minutes of wrestling, putting his team up by a point. The second fall is about the length of the first one, approximately four minutes and saw the rudo team of Corleone and Suzuki win after Corleone executed a [...] "Superman Flight", one of his signature high flying <b>moves</b> <b>off</b> the top rope, and pinned Unverso 2000. With the match tied the third fall, both teams took more chances, including Corleone getting caught up on the ropes during one of his leaps out of the ring. The match saw Universo 2000 pin Kenzo Suzuki, followed by Marco Corleone pinning Universo 2000, leaving only himself and Shocker as the legal men in the match. When the referee turned his back Universo 2000 landed a low-blow on Marco Corleone, making it easy for Shocker to pin him for the third and deciding fall. After the match both Corleone and Suzuki {{stood in the middle of}} the ring while the designated barber cut their hair off and then shaved them completely bald to fulfill the Luchas de Apuestas stipulation.|$|E
