50|$|Commutator-type motors do {{not operate}} well on {{high-frequency}} AC, because the rapid changes of current are opposed by the inductance of the <b>motor</b> <b>field.</b> Though commutator-type universal motors are common in AC household appliances and power tools, they are small motors, less than 1 kW. The induction motor was found to work well on frequencies around 50 to 60 Hz, but with the materials available in the 1890s would not work well at a frequency of, say, 133 Hz. There is a fixed relationship {{between the number of}} magnetic poles in the induction <b>motor</b> <b>field,</b> the frequency of the alternating current, and the rotation speed; so, a given standard speed limits the choice of frequency (and the reverse).

50|$|In a Ward Leonard system, a {{prime mover}} drives a direct current (DC) {{generator}} {{at a constant}} speed. The armature of the DC generator is connected directly to the armature of a DC motor. The DC motor drives the load equipment at an adjustable speed.

The <b>motor</b> <b>field</b> current is usually not adjusted, but the <b>motor</b> <b>field</b> is sometimes reduced {{to increase the speed}} above the base speed. The prime mover is usually an alternating current (AC) motor, but a DC motor or an engine might be used instead.

50|$|The term back {{electromotive}} force, or just back-EMF, is also {{commonly used}} to refer to the voltage that occurs in electric motors where there is relative motion between the armature and the magnetic <b>field</b> from the <b>motor's</b> <b>field</b> magnets, or windings, thus also acting as a generator while running as a motor.

50|$|To {{accelerate}} the train still further, the traction motors are reconnected in series-parallel connection (2 parallel circuits with 2 series-connected traction motors in each). For this purpose, in starting notch #12 the controller closes {{a pair of}} parallel contactors and opens the bridge contactor. After this the controller moves to starting notch #13, which closes contactors #1 and #2 and opens both field-weakening contactors; this assembles 2 parallel circuits, each of which comprises 2 traction motors {{and a group of}} starting resistances connected in series and has a total resistance of 4.97 ohm. Further notching out of the controller shorts out the starting resistances in pairs until in starting notch #16 all of the starting resistances are shorted out; this corresponds to running notch #3 on the engineer's controller. Moving the controller to starting notch #17 weakens the traction <b>motor</b> <b>field</b> to 67%, and in starting notch #18 the field is weakened to 50%. Starting notch #18 corresponds to running notch #4 on the engineer's controller; this is the maximum notch and allows the train to reach top speed. To coast, the engineer moves the controller handle to 0; this opens the line contactors, thereby shutting off all power to the traction motors, and moves the controller into starting notch #1 (therefore if the traction motors are turned on again, they are connected in series and all the starting resistances are in the circuit).|$|E
50|$|A Ward Leonard {{control is}} usually used for {{controlling}} a shunt or compound wound DC motor, and {{developed as a}} method of providing a speed-controlled motor from an AC supply, though it is not without its advantages in DC schemes. The AC supply is used to drive an AC motor, usually an induction motor that drives a DC generator or dynamo. The DC output from the armature is directly connected to the armature of the DC motor (sometimes but not always of identical construction). The shunt field windings of both DC machines are independently excited through variable resistors. Extremely good speed control from standstill to full speed, and consistent torque, can be obtained by varying the generator and/or <b>motor</b> <b>field</b> current. This method of control was the de facto method from its development until it was superseded by solid state thyristor systems. It found service in almost any environment where good speed control was required, from passenger lifts through to large mine pit head winding gear and even industrial process machinery and electric cranes. Its principal disadvantage was that three machines were required to implement a scheme (five in very large installations, as the DC machines were often duplicated and controlled by a tandem variable resistor). In many applications, the motor-generator set was often left permanently running, to avoid the delays that would otherwise be caused by starting it up as required. Although electronic (thyristor) controllers have replaced most small to medium Ward-Leonard systems, some very large ones (thousands of horsepower) remain in service. The field currents are much lower than the armature currents, allowing a moderate sized thyristor unit to control a much larger motor than it could control directly. For example, in one installation, a 300 amp thyristor unit controls the field of the generator. The generator output current is in excess of 15,000 amperes, which would be prohibitively expensive (and inefficient) to control directly with thyristors.|$|E
50|$|To {{extend a}} DC motor’s service life, {{protective}} devices and motor controllers {{are used to}} protect it from mechanical damage, excessive moisture, high dielectric stress and high temperature or thermal overloading. These protective devices sense motor fault conditions and either annunciate an alarm to notify the operator or automatically de-energize the motor when a faulty condition occurs. For overloaded conditions, motors are protected with thermal overload relays. Bi-metal thermal overload protectors are embedded in the motor's windings and made from two dissimilar metals. They are designed such that the bimetallic strips will bend in opposite directions when a temperature set point is reached to open the control circuit and de-energize the motor. Heaters are external thermal overload protectors connected in series with the motor’s windings and mounted in the motor contactor. Solder pot heaters melt in an overload condition, which cause the motor control circuit to de-energize the motor. Bimetallic heaters function the same way as embedded bimetallic protectors. Fuses and circuit breakers are overcurrent or short circuit protectors. Ground fault relays also provide overcurrent protection. They monitor the electric current between the motor’s windings and earth system ground. In motor-generators, reverse current relays prevent the battery from discharging and motorizing the generator. Since D.C. <b>motor</b> <b>field</b> loss can cause a hazardous runaway or overspeed condition, loss of field relays are connected in parallel with the motor’s field to sense field current. When the field current decreases below a set point, the relay will deenergize the motor’s armature. A locked rotor condition prevents a motor from accelerating after its starting sequence has been initiated. Distance relays protect motors from locked-rotor faults. Undervoltage motor protection is typically incorporated into motor controllers or starters. In addition, motors can be protected from overvoltages or surges with isolation transformers, power conditioning equipment, MOVs, arresters and harmonic filters. Environmental conditions, such as dust, explosive vapors, water, and high ambient temperatures, can adversely affect the operation of a DC motor. To protect a motor from these environmental conditions, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have standardized motor enclosure designs based upon the environmental protection they provide from contaminants. Modern software can also be used in the design stage, such as Motor-CAD, to help increase the thermal efficiency of a motor.|$|E

Eight healthy, right-handed male volunteers participated in this study. Experiments for each subject consisted of recording of MRCFs following two types of finger movement. One (Task 1) involved voluntary extension of the right index finger to about 40 degrees. In the second (Task 2), an elastic band {{was placed on the}} right index fingertip, producing a resistance of about 1. 5 times the electromyographic activity associated with the voluntary movement yielding extension to approximately 40 degrees. Peak amplitude and the ECD moment of the <b>motor</b> <b>field</b> differed significantly between the two tasks. In Task 2, the electromechanical delay from EMG onset to movement onset (77. 8 ± 16. 2) was longer than in Task 1 (44. 4 ± 10. 4). However, the latency from EMG onset to MEF 1 peak was 87. 6 ± 8. 5 ms in Task 2, and did not differ significantly from that in Task 1 (88. 6 ± 8. 5). The ECDs of MEF 1 were located significantly medial to N 20 m and lateral and posterior to the <b>motor</b> <b>field.</b> These findings suggest that the ECD of MEF 1 is located in area 3 b, but is slightly different from N 20 m, and that this MEF 1 component activation is due not to the onset of joint movement but to that of muscular contraction...|$|E
