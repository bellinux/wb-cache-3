Precisely, {{it deals with}} the marriage itself and it is supported by individual proceedings of marriage authorization and other specific <b>status</b> <b>matrimonial</b> case proceedings.

The goal of my thesis is to provide the overview of law changes in individual matrimonial proceedings and more importantly their characters, supported by both theoretical and practical examples. While exploring above mentioned problematic, at the same time I engage in substantive law as well as in procedural law due to their mutual cohesion. For the sake of the differentiation of proceeding in matrimonial cases, text of this work is divided into four main chapters, where every chapter includes several subchapters to specify the concrete proceeding's character and its process.

40|$|International audienceThe {{majority}} of HIV-infected people in sub-Saharan Africa are women, many of reproductive age. Cameroon is severely {{hit by the}} AIDS epidemic and has developed a large national program for improving access to antiretroviral treatment (ART). The reproductive intentions of women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) who obtain access to ART in this country remain poorly documented. Our study aimed at exploring factors associated {{with the desire to}} have a child among 1, 433 ART-treated fertile WLHA aged < 50. Analyses were based on data collected during the national cross-sectional survey EVAL (ANRS 12 - 116), which was conducted between September 2006 and March 2007 in 27 HIV care centers in Cameroon. Logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with women's desire to have a child, defined as reporting the wish to have a/another child. A total of 791 women (55 %) reported the desire to have a child. After adjusting for age, <b>matrimonial</b> <b>status,</b> number of biological children and sexual activity, the main factors independently associated with this desire in a multivariate analysis were having a good physical health-related quality of life (HRQL) (1. 02 [1. 01 - 1. 03] for a one-point increment on the SF- 12 scale) and a CD 4 count at ART initiation < 200 cells/mm 3 (1. 7 [1. 2 - 2. 4]). As a conclusion, the desire to have a child is frequent among ART-treated WLHA in Cameroon. HIV care and family planning programs should be integrated more thoroughly in order to support WLHA's reproductive choices...|$|E

Methods The Impact of Event Scale – Revised (IES-R), also with sociodemographic questionnaire were used {{as an instrument of}} measuring. The research has been conducted on 100 examinees which were hospitalisated at Clinical section of traumatology in Osijek Univesity Hospital Center during period of 14 June 2011. to 28 August 2011. Descriptive statistics was used, and the differences between categorical variables were tested with Kruskall Walis test. Results The examenees were using an avoidance as their first line of a deffence within first few days after the accidant. The middle valuation of a subscale amounted 14. 50. The value of final result of IES-R was flactuating between 0 - 88. The middle value was 33 (interquartile range 21 - 49 points). Acute stress reaction was noted in seven (7 %) examenees, 26 (26 %) had clinically considerable simptoms. Statistically significant difference in acute stress event were obtained between gender (p=. 001), while the age, class of accident, <b>matrimonial</b> <b>status,</b> education and sociodemographic standard of living, were not considerable in perception of stress.

40|$|ISSN 0755 - 7809 International audienceSex {{and space}} use: the {{mediation}} of role distribution in the households. - Authors show, by means of two surveys they processed, {{the complexity of the}} relationship between gender differentiation and space use. They analyse this relationship with {{the mediation of}} role distribution in the household. Factors such as <b>matrimonial</b> <b>status</b> of household (couple or mother alone), employment status of women (working or non-working), children age and urban space, seem to be far more discrimination than only gender difference between men and women. Responsibility of household activities (children and chopping) is always for women, but the strongest difference in activity participation and space use is at first between both working men and women {{on the one hand and}} non-working women on the other hand, and secondly between working men and working women. A travers les résultats de deux enquêtes qu'ils ont menées, les auteurs montrent la complexité de la relation entre différenciation sexuelle et usage de l'espace, et cherchent à l'expliquer par la répartition des rôles au sein du ménage. Le statut matrimonial du ménage (couple ou mère seule), le statut d'emploi de la femme (active ou inactive), l'âge des enfants, et le type d'espace urbain apparaissent être des facteurs largement plus discriminants que la simple différence entre hommes et femmes. Même si la responsabilité des charges familiales revient toujours aux femmes, le clivage dans la pratique des activités et l'usage de l'espace se situe d'abord entre hommes et femmes actifs d'une part, femmes inactives de l'autre, et secondairement entre hommes et femmes actifs...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. The aim. If {{maternal}} milk is {{the best}} food for a term infant, for a preterm infant {{it will also be}} the best for the growth and development of an immature child. The aim of this work was to examine, by retrospective analysis, the frequency of breast-feeding in preterm infants and relate it with some epidemiologic variables (demographic, social, medical). Material and methods. In the period from 1993 to 1999 we analyzed the frequency of breast-feeding in all preterm deliveries from 22 to 36 weeks of gestation except for multiple pregnancies. The clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics of Clinical Hospital Center Rijeka is the first maternity hospital in Croatia that was proclaimed »Baby Friendly Hospital « by the UNICEF in 1996. We analyzed the following parameters in mothers: the age, <b>matrimonial</b> <b>status,</b> educa-tion, course of pregnancy, mode of beginning and delivery termination. In newborns: weight, Apgar score ≤ 7 at the first and fifth minute, acidosis, intracranial hemorrhage, early neurological signs, respiratory distress syndrome and infections. Results. In the examined period there were 22 119 deliveries out of which 923 (4. 17 %) were preterm deliveries. Out of the total of 923 preterm infants 453 (49. 07 %) were breast-fed: from 29 to 32 weeks of gestation 20 (4. 41 %) newborns, and from 33 to 36 weeks 433 (95. 58 %) newborns. Apgar score ≤ 7 at the first minute was present in 97 (21. 41 %) cases. Apgar score ≤ 7 at the fifth minute was present in 37 (8. 16 %) cases. No newborn had acidosis, 8 (1. 76 %) newborns had intracra-nial hemorrhage, one had (0. 22 %) early signs of cerebral disorder, 33 (7. 28 %) respiratory distress syndrome and 35 (7. 72 %) infection. Fifty percent of our preterm infants were fed with maternal milk and we continue to make additional efforts to reduce the percentage of non breast-fed children. Mothers who were breast feeding were more frequently primiparae aged from 26 to 35, married, employed and smoked up to 10 cigarettes a day. In mothers who were breast-feeding no children died. Conclusion. Feeding preterm infant with maternal milk should {{be a part of the}} intensive care and therapy of such a child...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} female cancer in Western {{countries}} is {{breast cancer and}} women diagnosed with this disease are often under 65 years old. With increasing prevalence of survivors {{it is important to}} shed light on problems facing these women after diagnosis and treatment. The overall aim of this thesis was to study the rehabilitation process following a breast cancer diagnosis for women at working age by examining factors related to type of treatment, tumour stage, socio-demographic status, health status, working condition, life satisfaction, and coping skills, and their association with return to work. In this thesis both quantitative and qualitative approaches are represented in three longitudinal cohort studies and a narrative interview study (16 enrolled women). The quantitative studies are based on two different sets of material of women treated for breast cancer (270 respective 102 enrolled women). Study I investigated whether factors such as type of treatment, tumour stage, educational level, <b>matrimonial</b> <b>status,</b> and presence of under-age children were associated with long-term problems in returning to work in women with breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy. The use of adjuvant endocrine therapy was associated with a twofold increase in the odds ratio of not having returned to work, although the confidence interval of this ratio was wide and included unity. Tumour stage (pN 1 - 4 +) was negatively associated with work status, possibly because of its association with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the regional nodes. Socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with return to work. The aim of Study II was to identify factors contributing to a successful return to the labour market using the narratives of women treated for breast cancer. All the women strove to belong to the labour market, but the study also revealed how women´s perceptions of the value of employment changed. The quality of social support received from employers and co-workers differed between women who returned to work and those still sick-listed one year after breast cancer treatment. Study III investigated if treatment type, socio-demographic factors, health status, and work-related factors could predict return to work 10 months after surgery for early-stage breast cancer in women. Axillary node dissection, treatment with chemotherapy, and high demands at work were shown {{to play an important role}} in return to work for women with early-stage breast cancer. Socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with return to work. The aims of Study IV were to generate new knowledge about life satisfaction, coping and rehabilitative measures taken after early-stage breast cancer treatment and the association of these concepts with return to work. Global life satisfaction was higher among the working women at both assessments. The working women used more positive coping resources compared with the sick-listed women, especially if treated with chemotherapy. Few of the sick-listed women received rehabilitation. The principal finding was that most of the studied women successfully returned to work after their active cancer treatments were completed. Type of treatment as well as work-related factors, life satisfaction and coping skills were associated with return to work...|$|E
