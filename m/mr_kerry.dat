2500|$|Kerry’s {{crew members}} who were there that day {{do not agree with}} Elliott’s {{characterization}} of the event in his 2004 affidavits. They contend that the enemy soldier, although wounded, was still a threat. For example, one of them, Fred Short, said, [...] "The guy was getting ready to stand up with a rocket on his shoulder, coming up. And <b>Mr.</b> <b>Kerry</b> took him out... he would have been about a 30-yard shot... here's no way he could miss us." [...] Del Sandusky, Kerry’s second in command, described the consequences to the lightly armored Swift Boat: [...] "Charlie would have lit us up like a Roman candle because we're full of fuel, we're full of ammunition." [...] Another witness stated that the VC [...] "had an entry wound at the side of his chest and exit wound at {{the opposite side of the}} chest cavity, a wound that was consistent with reports of the man turning to fire a second B-40 rocket." ...|$|E
