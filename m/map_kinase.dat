The activation requires its phosphorylation by <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> kinases (MKKs), or its autophosphorylation triggered by the interaction of MAP3K7IP1/TAB1 protein with this kinase. The substrates of this kinase include transcription regulator ATF2, MEF2C, and MAX, cell cycle regulator CDC25B, and tumor suppressor p53, which suggest the roles of this kinase in stress-related transcription and cell cycle regulation, as well as in genotoxic stress response.

40|$|Objective. We {{investigated}} whether angiotensin (Ang) III induces ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 mitogen activated protein (<b>MAP)</b> <b>kinases</b> protein phosphorylation {{in isolated}} rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Background. The molecular {{mechanisms by which}} Ang III induces various biological effects have not been fully investigated. Most {{studies have shown that}} <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> mediate Ang II apoptosis and growth promoting effects in VSMCs. Moreover, Ang II induces vascular remodeling in these cells leading to increases in blood pressure. <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> regulate or induce two crucial actions in VSMCs, proliferation and migration, which are associated with atherosclerosis and restenosis. Methods. Primary cultures of VSMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta of adult Wistar rats by the explant technique. VSMCs were treated with Ang III ranging in concentration from 0. 1 nM to 1000 nM for 10 minutes or with 100 nM Ang III for 1 minute to 30 minutes. Western blotting technique was used to determine whether Ang III induces ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> protein phosphorylation. Results. Concentration studies showed that Ang III caused a dose-dependent increase in ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> protein phosphorylation. The effects of Ang III on both <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> phosphorylation were maximal between 10 nM and 100 nM concentrations. The peptide effects were rapid and significant, occurring within minutes of treatment and the maximal effects on <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> phosphorylation was observed by 10 min. Conclusion. These findings provide insight into the molecular nature of the actions of Ang III and offer possible mechanism by which Ang III physiological and possibly pathological actions occur in VSMCs.

We have previously shown that activated Ras protein can induce markers of the hypertrophic phenotype, including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression and organization of contractile proteins, and that Ras is at least partially required for the hypertrophic effect of phenylephrine. In the present study, we examine the requirement for the mitogen-activated protein <b>kinases</b> (<b>MAP</b> <b>kinases)</b> in the hypertrophic response induced by phenylephrine. We find that phenylephrine treatment results in the activation of the <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> and that this activity is required for transactivation of the fos, ANF, and MLH promoters. However, inhibition of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> does not prevent phenylephrine-induced organization of actin.

40|$|<b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> (mitogen-{{activated}} protein kinases) are {{activated by}} dual phosphorylation on specific threonine and specific tyrosine residues that {{are separated by}} a single residue, and the TXY activation motif is a hallmark of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases.</b> In the fungus Ustilago maydis, which causes corn smut disease, the Crk 1 protein, a kinase previously described to have roles in morphogenesis, carries a TXY motif that aligns with the TXY of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases.</b> In this work, we demonstrate that Crk 1 is activated through a mechanism that requires the phosphorylation of this motif. Our data show that Fuz 7, a MAPK kinase involved in mating and pathogenesis in U. maydis, is required to activate Crk 1, most likely through phosphorylation of the TXY motif. Consistently, we found that Crk 1 is also required for mating and virulence. We investigated the reasons for sterility and avirulence of crk 1 -deficient cells, {{and we found that}} Crk 1 is required for transcription of prf 1, a central regulator of mating and pathogenicity in U. maydis. Crk 1 belongs to a wide conserved protein group, whose members have not been previously defined as <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases,</b> although they carry TXY motifs.

40|$|It is {{postulated}} that central effects of angiotensin (Ang) II may be indirect due to rapid conversion to Ang III by aminopeptidase A (APA). Previously, {{we showed that}} Ang II and Ang III induced mitogen-activated protein (<b>MAP)</b> <b>kinases</b> ERK 1 / 2 and stress-activated protein kinase/Jun-terminal kinases (SAPK/JNK) phosphorylation in cultured rat astrocytes. Most importantly, both peptides were equipotent in causing phosphorylation of these <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases.</b> In these studies, we used brainstem and cerebellum astrocytes to determine whether Ang II’s phosphorylation of these <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> {{is due to the}} conversion of the peptide to Ang III. We pretreated astrocytes with 10 [*]μM amastatin A or 100 [*]μM glutamate phosphonate, selective APA inhibitors, prior to stimulating with either Ang II or Ang III. Both peptides were equipotent in stimulating ERK 1 / 2 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation. The APA inhibitors failed to prevent Ang II- and Ang III-mediated phosphorylation of the <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases.</b> Further, pretreatment of astrocytes with the APA inhibitors did not affect Ang II- or Ang III-induced astrocyte growth. These findings suggest that both peptides directly induce phosphorylation of these <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> as well as induce astrocyte growth.

40|$|Rap 1 {{is a small}} Ras-related GTPase which when over-expressed is able {{to revert}} {{transformation}} by Ki-Ras. We have investigated the role of Rap 1 in regulating 'normal' Ras function by studying the activation of the mitogen-activated protein (<b>MAP)</b> <b>kinases</b> ERK 1 and ERK 2 by two fundamentally different growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 1 -oleoyl-lyso-phosphatidic acid (LPA). Conditional expression of RasN 17 (a dominant-negative mutant) in Rat- 1 cells inhibited activation of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> by EGF and also LPA, {{the first time a}} defined G-protein-coupled receptor mitogen has been shown to require Ras to exert its effects. Conditional or constitutive expression of even low levels of RapV 12 (a mutant insensitive to Rap-GAP) attenuated activation of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> by EGF and LPA, but did not interfere with growth factor-stimulated increases in Ras-GTP, indicating that signalling from receptors to Ras was not impaired. Inhibition of Ras-mediated signalling with either RasN 17 or RapV 12 attenuated DNA synthesis by EGF and LPA. We conclude that receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors use Ras as a common step in signalling to <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> and that Rap-GTP (RapV 12) at physiological levels interferes with downstream signalling from Ras to <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> in vivo...|$|R
25|$|Inactivation of MAPKs is {{performed}} {{by a number of}} phosphatases. A very conserved family of dedicated phosphatases is the so-called <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> phosphatases (MKPs), a subgroup of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). As their name implies, these enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing the phosphate from both phosphotyrosine and the phosphothreonine residues. Since removal of either phosphate groups will greatly reduce MAPK activity, essentially abolishing signaling, some tyrosine phosphatases are also involved in inactivating MAP kinases (e.g. the phosphatases HePTP, STEP and PTPRR in mammals).|$|E
25|$|The host elicits an {{immunological}} {{reaction against}} the tumor during the VGP, which is {{judged by the}} presence and activity of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These cells sometimes completely destroy the primary tumor; this is called regression, which is the latest stage of development. In certain cases, the primary tumor is completely destroyed and only the metastatic tumor is discovered. About 40% of human melanomas contain activating mutations affecting {{the structure of the}} B-Raf protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> pathway.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, MAPKs typically form multi-tiered pathways, receiving input {{several levels}} above the actual <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase.</b> In {{contrast to the}} relatively simple, phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of MAPKs and MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks have stunningly complex regulation. Many of the better-known MAP3Ks, such as c-Raf, MEKK4 or MLK3 require multiple steps for their activation. These are typically allosterically-controlled enzymes, tighly locked into an inactive state by multiple mechanisms. The first step en route to their activation consist of relieving their autoinhibition by a smaller ligand (such as Ras for c-Raf, GADD45 for MEKK4 or Cdc42 for MLK3). This commonly (but not always) happens at the cell membrane, where most of their activators are bound (note that small G-proteins are constitutively membrane-associated due to prenylation). That step is followed by side-to-side homo- and heterodimerisation of their now accessible kinase domains. Recently determined complex structures reveal that the dimers are formed in an orientation that leaves both their substrate-binding regions free. Importantly, this dimerisation event also forces the MAP3 kinase domains to adopt a partially active conformation. Full activity is only achieved once these dimers transphosphorylate each other on their activation loops. The latter step can also be achieved or aided by auxiliary protein kinases (MAP4 kinases, members of the Ste20 family). Once a MAP3 kinase is fully active, it may phosphorylate its substrate MAP2 kinases, which in turn will phosphorylate their <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> substrates.|$|E
40|$|The G-protein-coupled central {{cannabinoid}} receptor (CB 1) {{has been shown}} to be functionally associated with several biological responses including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, modulation of ion channels and induction of the immediate-early gene Krox- 24. Using stably transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing human CB 1 we show here that cannabinoid treatment induces both phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-activated protein (<b>MAP)</b> <b>kinases,</b> and that these effects are inhibited by SR 141716 A, a selective CB 1 antagonist. The two p 42 and p 44 kDa <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> are activated in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The rank order of potency for the activation of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> with various cannabinoid agonists is CP- 55940 > delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol > WIN 55212. 2, in agreement with the pharmacological profile of CB 1. The activation of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> is blocked by pertussis toxin but not by treatment with hydrolysis-resistant cyclic AMP analogues. This suggests that the signal transduction pathway between CB 1 and <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> involves a pertussis-toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein and is independent of cyclic AMP metabolism. This coupling of CB 1 subtype and mitogenic signal pathway, also observed in the human astrocytoma cell line U 373 MG, may explain the mechanism of action underlying cannabinoid-induced Krox- 24 induction...|$|R

40|$|Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-mediated {{signalling}} to {{the nucleus}} {{is an important}} event in the conversion of extracellular signals into a cellular response. However, the existence of multiple <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> which phosphorylate similar phosphoacceptor motifs poses a problem in maintaining substrate specificity and hence the correct biological response. Both the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) subfamilies of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> use a second specificity determinant and require docking to their transcription factor substrates to achieve maximal substrate activation. In this study, we demonstrate that among the different <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases,</b> the MADS-box transcription factors MEF 2 A and MEF 2 C are preferentially phosphorylated and activated by the p 38 subfamily members p 38 α and p 38 β 2. The efficiency of phosphorylation in vitro and transcriptional activation in vivo of MEF 2 A and MEF 2 C by these p 38 subtypes requires {{the presence of a}} kinase docking domain (D-domain). Furthermore, the D-domain from MEF 2 A is sufficient to confer p 38 responsiveness on different transcription factors, and reciprocal effects are observed upon the introduction of alternative D-domains into MEF 2 A. These results therefore contribute to our understanding of signalling to MEF 2 transcription factors and demonstrate that the requirement for substrate binding by <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> is an important facet of three different subclasses of <b>MAP</b> <b>kinases</b> (ERK, JNK, and p 38) ...|$|R

The protease calpain has also been shown to be involved in this type of cell destruction; just as the use of calpain inhibitors has been shown to decrease actin proteolysis and the degradation of DNA (another of the characteristic elements of apoptosis). On the other hand, the stress-induced triggering of apoptosis causes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (which also involves its polymerization), giving rise to structures called stress fibers; this is activated by the <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> pathway.|$|E
25|$|Stomatal {{patterning}} {{is controlled}} by the interaction of many signal transduction components such as EPF (Epidermal Patterning Factor), ERL (ERecta Like) and YODA (a putative <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> kinase kinase). Mutations in any one of the genes which encode these factors may alter the development of stomata in the epidermis. For example, a mutation in one gene causes more stomata that are clustered together, hence is called Too Many Mouths (TMM). Whereas, disruption of the SPCH (SPeecCHless) gene prevents stomatal development all together. Activation of stomatal production can occur by the activation of EPF1, which activates TMM/ERL, which together activate YODA. YODA inhibits SPCH, causing SPCH activity to decrease, allowing for asymmetrical cell division that initiates stomata formation. Stomatal development is also coordinated by the cellular peptide signal called stomagen, which signals the inhibition of the SPCH, resulting in increased number of stomata.|$|E
25|$|The IL-17F gene was {{discovered}} in 2001, and is located on chromosome 6p12. Notably, among this family, IL-17F has been well characterized both in vitro and in vivo, and {{has been shown to}} have a pro-inflammatory role in asthma. IL-17F is clearly expressed in the airway of asthmatics and its expression level is correlated with disease severity. Moreover, a coding region variant (H161R) of the IL-17F gene is inversely associated with asthma and encodes an antagonist for the wild-type IL-17F. IL-17F is able to induce several cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in bronchial epithelial cells, vein endothelial cells, fibroblasts and eosinophils. IL-17F utilizes IL-17RA and IL-17RC as its receptors, and activates the <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> related pathway. IL-17F is derived from several cell types such as Th17 cells, mast cells and basophils, and shows a wide tissue expression pattern including lung. Overexpression of IL-17F gene in the airway of mice is associated with airway neutrophilia, the induction of many cytokines, an increase in airway hyperreactivity, and mucus hypersecretion. Hence, IL-17F may have a crucial role in allergic airway inflammation, and have important therapeutic implications in asthma.|$|E

25|$|As {{typical for}} the CMGC kinase group, the {{catalytic}} site of MAP kinases {{has a very}} loose consensus sequence for substrates. Like all their relatives, they only require the target serine / threonine amino acids {{to be followed by}} a small amino acid, preferably proline ("proline-directed kinases"). But as SP/TP sites are extremely common in all proteins, additional substrate-recognition mechanisms have evolved to ensure signaling fidelty. Unlike their closest relatives, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), where substrates are recognized by the cyclin subunit, MAPKs associate with their substrates via auxiliary binding regions on their kinase domains. The most important such region consists of the hydrophobic docking groove and the negatively charged CD-region. Together they recognize the so-called MAPK docking or D-motifs (also called kinase interaction motif / KIM). D-motifs essentially consist of one or two positively charged amino acids, followed by alternating hydrophobic residues (mostly leucines), typically upstream of the phosphorylation site by 10–50 amino acids. Many of the known MAPK substrates contain such D-motifs that can not only bind to, but also provide specific recognition by certain MAPKs. Interestingly, D-motifs are not restricted to substrates: MAP2 kinases also contain such motifs on their N-termini that are absolutely required for MAP2K-MAPK interaction and MAPK activation. Similarly, both dual-specificity <b>MAP</b> <b>kinase</b> phosphatases and MAP-specific tyrosine phosphatases bind to MAP kinases through the same docking site. D-motifs can even be found in certain MAPK pathway regulators and scaffolds (e.g. in the mammalian JIP proteins).|$|E
