40|$|There is {{a growing}} cruise market. To {{accommodate}} the growth of cruise shipping in North-West Europe, the developers Consortium ‘Cruiseport The Hague’ wants to construct an outer harbour at Scheveningen; to this day, the harbour of Scheveningen {{is not able to}} receive today’s large cruise ships. Obviously, a cruise <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> has to be constructed in the outer port; however, this structure has to provide more than just the mooring of cruise vessels alone. A multifunctional structure was designed. The functions, besides providing mooring to cruise ships are an underground parking garage and substructure as a foundation for the cruise terminal and office towers (a ten level building). The objective of my graduation project was to design the substitute of the <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> with related construction method. Construction method alternatives for the <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> are developed by a global feasibility study. This study, in combination with a multi-criteria analysis shows that the caisson construction method is selected for construction of the <b>mooring</b> <b>facility.</b> The caisson method is investigated in further detail to conclude whether it is possible to design and construct a very large (area of about 50, 000 m 2) joint free caisson structure as a <b>mooring</b> <b>facility.</b> A global design has been prepared for all the construction stages of the caisson <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> (from the construction to the removal of the temporary construction pit). The report describes the design for a caisson structure, able to resist the forces working on it throughout its lifecycle. The technical feasibility of the mega caisson is evaluated using a hand calculation and a finite element model, ESA PT. Based on these models, it can be concluded that the use of a very large caisson structure as <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> is technically feasible. Furthermore, the study shows that, {{when it comes to the}} financial feasibility, the cofferdam method leads to the lowest construction costs.

40|$|Recently, {{there are}} several {{problems}} in space, infra-structure, and facility in the contiguity of existing harbors due to the trend of enlarged container vessels. In this regard, the Mobile Harbor has been proposed conceptually as an effective solution for those problems. This concept {{is a kind of}} transfer loader of the containers from the large container ship to the harbor on land, which is a floating barge of a catamaran type. The catamaran-type vessel is well known for its advantage in maneuverability, resistance, and the effectiveness for working on board. For the safe and effective operation of the two floating bodies, a container ship and the mobile harbor in the near sea apart from the quay, robot arms, novel crane systems, and pneumatic fenders are specially devised with additional <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> or DP(dynamic positioning) system. The concept is to be verified through comparison and simulation studies under various environmental conditions. It is shown that the proposed concept is in general feasible but {{there are several}} areas for further investigation and improvement...|$|E

40|$|The {{current status}} of {{contaminations}} by organotin (OT) compounds in Malaysia was reviewed. Tributyltin (TBT) in water samples ranged from to 115 ngL 1. The higher concentrations of TBTs in water samples were observed in <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> of pleasure crafts and the Strait of Malacca with heavy shipping traffic. TBT to total butyltin (BT) was dominant species in water samples, suggesting the latest use of TBT. Phenyltin (PT) compounds were not detected in water samples. Tributyltin in sediment samples ranged from dry to 492 ugkg dry. TBT concentrations in sediment samples were high in the Strait of Johor where locates between Malaysia and Singapore. In the case of sediment, the higher percentage of degradation products of TBT was observed among total BTs. The concentrations of triphenyltin (TPT) compounds in sediment ranged from 0. 1 - 34 ugkg dry. TBT in bivalves and fish also detected at the range of 1, 2. 4 - 190 ugkg 1, respectively. TBT concentrations in some biological samples exceeded the tolerable average residue levels (TALR) which calculated from tolerable daily intake (TDI) for TBT.

40|$|During {{the design}} {{phase of the}} {{reconstruction}} of the existing <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> “EBS Biohub” at the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, a high risk profile was recognized in the proximity of four new dolphins next to the existing jetty. The risk originated from the greater installation depth of the dolphins related to the limited foundation depth of the existing foundations and from the structural analysis which indicated that the superstructure could only withstand limited settlement differences. Risk management aspects were incorporated in the contract by defining an observational approach involving monitoring of the structure and the subsoil. The contractor Geka offered a pile test at dolphins to be installed at a safe distance from the jetty. A number of test piles were installed at varying distances from the dolphins in order to detect settlements. The induced settlements were compared with a contractually defined criterion. Based on the test, two installation methods were in place. Two dolphins were installed under a slope {{in order to create a}} minimum of 5 m distance between the installation trajectory and adjacent piles. Two dolphins at shorter distance were placed while two adjacent piles per dolphin were cut from the jetty platform with an alternative support by a reaction frame with active hydraulic compensation at service load. All criterion on bearing capacity, vibration levels, settlements, deformations and cone resistance were met. No damage on nor deformation of the existing structure was encountered resulting in a success in terms of budget, planning and risk management...|$|E
40|$|As the {{shipping}} industry is growing, {{more and more}} propulsion systems are being developed with better propulsion capabilities. These current and newly developing systems in ships are expected to cause scour at beds around berthing structures with greater likelihood than the systems preceding them, which increases the importance of protection methods used {{to deal with this}} issue. In early 2015, the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure (PIANC) has published a report titled ‘Guidelines for Protecting Berthing Structures from Scour Caused by Ships’ with the aim of providing practical guidelines and detailed background information about vessel propulsion systems in order to allow designers to make a proper design of the bed protection in front of the berth structures or to estimate the scour expected to develop. However, the applicability of these guidelines to real scenarios remains to be assessed. The limitations and uncertainties associated with the guidelines have been determined by applying the aforementioned guidelines to the riprap type of bed protection design of both open and solid berthing structures in an inland <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> located in the Rotterdam harbour. In examining these guidelines, it was revealed that several assumptions are necessary due to lack of information on various parameters and some specifications of the design ship, along with shortcomings and limitations of the methods and equations presented. The significance of these assumptions on the applicability of the guidelines has been investigated. In cases where limitations have been found, owing to assumptions or otherwise, certain solutions can be offered to overcome these. The guidelines were found to be applicable and provide decent instructions for a proper bed protection design in spite of the requirement of some assumptions. The effectiveness of the guidelines can be improved thanks to further research with bed protection designs for different case study locations and various bed protection methods to verify the conclusions reached in this study. Moreover, supplementary resources like a catalogue containing detailed information about several ship characteristics with relatively higher influences in the design process can help designers to gather more accurate data {{to be used in the}} calculations.

40|$|The Pulau Bukom-SBM, {{situated}} at about 10 kilometers offshore Singapore, {{is used as}} a <b>mooring</b> <b>facility</b> for tankers transporting crude oil for the Shell refineries on the island of Pulau Bukom. The bow hawsers (nylon ropes) which connect the ships with the SBM are frequently subjected to extreme forces excited by the ships. Many similar installations are used over the entire globe and normally these peak loads are due to wave- or current forces working on the tankers in severe weather conditions. Offshore Singapore, however, these loads also occur during apparent calm periods and seem to be independent of the waves. In order to guarantee safe dynamic operations SEPL installed a load monitor recorder on the SBM which measures all the executed forces in the hawsers. The data obtained from the load recordings are compared to the tidal predictions for Singapore area which show that some sort of relation exists between the height of the peak loads and the current velocities present at the time the forces are executed. Because of the suspected inaccuracies in the data the exact relation can not be derived. Investigation of the continuous load monitor recordings give some insight in the physics of the system as is explained in chapter 2. In chapter 3 the dynamics of the system (SBM inclusive moored tanker) are examined. Although the system is a non-linear double mass-spring system, adequate approximations of the resonant frequency can be obtained when the system is simplified to a linear single mass-spring system. Hereby the effects of the simplifications on the natural frequency value are investigated as well. A study on the average occuring wave fields near Singapore (chapter 4) shows that neither first- nor second order wave motions possess enough energy for exciting the moored tankers significantly. Through the establishment of a detailed tidal current model of the area of the SBM the presence of macro eddies is proven (chapter 5). These macro eddies are local current fluctuations in the order of minutes which originate in lee of islands or by other irregularities in the bottom topography. When carried along in the main current they can cover a distance of several kilometers before they are damped out. Since the diameters of the eddies are about two or three times the average ship length they can excite the tankers to peak loads comparable to the recorded forces and are, thus, the most probable cause of the problems. Although the development and testing of load reducing measures fall {{beyond the scope of this}} study, it is clear that it will be very difficult to apply adequate measures within limited costs which can lengthen the operational life of the hawser.
