40|$|Evidence of {{seasonality}} in oestrus in bitches within specialist breeding programmes, such {{as those}} for assistance dogs, may support colony management through tailoring the distribution of resources required for breeding throughout the year. However, at present there are conflicting data regarding seasonality in oestrus (and litter size) in domestic dogs. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to investigate seasonal variations in oestrus and litter size in a large assistance dog breeding colony in the UK in order to optimise colony management. The authors analysed the annual distribution of 3624 observations of oestrus collected from 568 brood bitches from January 2005 to June 2014. The authors also evaluated the relationship between month and litter size for 1609 litters observed during the same period. There was no evidence of regular seasonal variations in oestrus or litter size by meteorological season or month. The lack of seasonality in oestrus may be a function of dogs in the UK, particularly valuable breeding bitches, being exposed to fairly constant environmental conditions throughout the year as a consequence of artificial light and heating during the winter months. The authors’ findings suggest that special consideration of the annual distribution of oestrus and litter size is unnecessary for the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> dog breeding colonies similar to those in the UK...|$|E

This paper analyzes current practice in the targeting and <b>management</b> <b>of</b> humanitarian food <b>assistance</b> in complex emergencies, the constraints to recipient communities' participation, and the possibilities for participatory approaches to improve targeting. Access and security considerations, limited staff time and capacity, and other constraints have long meant that the actual oversight of food aid distributions in complex emergencies is left in the hands of local leaders at the village or camp level. Introduced institutions include Food Relief Committees, or other specially-organized bodies to deal with targeting and distribution questions. Differences in the accountability and legitimacy of these leaders and committees, together with post-distribution dynamics over which agencies have little control, account for much of the way in food assistance is actually distributed and utilized. But much of the process of food aid targeting remains opaque to recipients, who are often not aware of their entitlements or the process of determining who is entitled. The paper concludes with a number of practical suggestions to improve participation in targeting in complex emergencies.

Regarding the labour market, Law n. 183 of 10 December 2014 (also known as the Jobs Act) modified and integrated the pre-existing normative framework. Specifically, the main aims of the Jobs Act are to (a) increase employment and reduce the share of the workforce with precarious contracts and to (b) stimulate enterprise productivity by encouraging the employment of a young labour force, thereby improving growth and competitiveness through reduced labour costs. Since the mid- 90 s, the gradual reform of the labour market has led the country towards a more flexible structure (for example, the use of additional types of employment contracts, the introduction of policies to facilitate the entry of young people into the labour market, the creation of work agencies, and the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> unemployment <b>assistance).</b>|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the content of the intervention, to get an understanding how of the core concept, "good living conditions" has been interpreted and to gain an insight on how users perceive quality <b>of</b> their personal <b>assistance.</b> Method A literature survey of perceived quality in personal assistance was undertaken. The review was based on qualitative studies conducted during the past 20 year's implementation of the act. Results The review emerge joint themes that perceives quality <b>of</b> personal <b>assistance</b> by the user. Overall outcomes shows that an efficient personal assistance is characterized by feeling independent in relation to the environment, trust of feeling safe and secure in relation to the assistant and performed assistance, and that actions through personal assistance as a whole provides well-being for both the user as well as for the family members. Prerequisites for the ability to exercise control by the user, in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>assistance,</b> are emerging as a key condition for the experience of quality. A dilemma for policy intervention is, however, how the principle of user control should be practiced when groups with weak user control require personal assistance. Conclusions The result shows that perceived quality <b>of</b> personal <b>assistance</b> are in line with general health care and social indictors, rather than performing the core concept of the independent living through the LSS legislation.

These ad hoc interactions could {{be perceived as}} counterproductive when they are seen as interruptions or they could be perceived as productive when they are seen as ad hoc team assistances, which contribute to the team awareness, trust amongst team members, and improved shared mental model.

More than 400 ad hoc interactions have been analyzed. Ad hoc interactions required up to 30 % of the team total time.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} tsunami mortality and compare approaches to mortality assessment {{in the emergency}} context in Aceh, Indonesia, where {{the impact of the}} 2004 tsunami was greatest. Methods. Mortality was estimated using geographic information systems–based vulnerability models and demographic methods from surveys of tsunami-displaced populations. Results. Tsunami mortality in Aceh as estimated by demographic models was 131066 and was similar to official figures of 128063; however, it was a conserva-tive estimate of actual mortality and is substantially less than official estimates of 168561 presumed dead, which included those classified as missing. Tsunami im-pact was greatest in the district of Aceh Jaya, where an estimated 27. 0 % (n= 23862) of the population perished; Aceh Besar and Banda Aceh were also severely af-fected, with mortality at 21. 0 % (n= 61650) and 11. 5 % (n= 25903), respectively.
