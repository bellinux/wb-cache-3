40|$|This work {{develops}} a novel method for preparing a <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> <b>structure,</b> {{which has a}} sub-wavelength periodical Si nanocone structure on Si (100) substrate, using two-step metal assisted chemical etching (MACE). The 1 st and 2 nd MACE were respectively performed with the intention to form perpendicular Si nanowire arrays on a Si substrate and sharpening the Si nanowire arrays. We found the inhomogeneous absorption and aggregation of Au particles used {{as a catalyst for}} 2 nd MACE was important to obtain the nanocone shape. The obtained Si nanocone arrays showed superior anti-reflecting properties especially in wavelength below 600 nm compared to the Si nanowire arrays. A possible mechanism involved {{in the formation of the}} nanocone structure by the 2 -step MACE is discussed in this paper.

40|$|Antireflection {{structures}} on eyes potentially increase visual efficiency through increased photon capture {{for a given}} stimulus condition. We report an unusual surface grating on the compound eyes of an Eocene dolichopodid dipteran (45 Ma) known only from Baltic amber. By measuring the reflective properties of a flat model of this grating constructed from material of appropriate refractive index we show that this 'fly eye grating' is an efficient antireflector of white light at angles up to 60 degrees, and a relatively good antireflector for angles beyond 60 degrees. We calculate that such a grating would be particularly useful on a curved corneal surface as it would increase the transmission of incident light through the cornea compared with a smooth surface. This structure is also reported on the curved regions of the corneas {{of at least two}} extant dipterans. We argue that this grating probably derives from the previously described moth eye antireflection structure, which we also report here to occur in a silverfish, a 'primitive' insect. The fly eye grating is a more efficient antireflector than the <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> <b>structure</b> only at angles greater than about 10 degrees from the surface normal. A comparable antireflector is employed on solar absorbers...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for {{the realization of}} complex three dimensional 3 D structures in polymer materials is presented. The described process can be applied for the fabrication of 3 D structured foils {{as well as for}} 3 D structured polymer parts using a replica molding process. In the first step, the foil is structured by Hot Embossing. This structured foil is then blown into a structured mold by pressure at high temperature, using a thermoforming process. The thermoforming process is realized in an especially designed tool, where different mold inserts can be applied. In the thermoforming process this tool, containing the mold insert and the structured foil is heated up and a pressure is applied which assures, that the foil covers the structured mold insert. Due to parameter optimization, high pattern fidelity can be achieved. As structures a porefield with a pore diameter of 500 nm and lines and spaces with a width of 1. 6 lm were used. Besides a <b>Moth</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>structure</b> with a period of 280 nm and a blazed grating with a period of 1 lm and a blazed angle of 15 were imprinted and blown into the structured mold. The results show, that this process can be used to fabricate 3 D structured foils with good structure fidelity. Besides the structured foils, additional poly dimethylsiloxane PDMS replications can be made out of this foils. These PDMS replications are used as stamps in a replica molding process.

40|$|Materials, {{objects and}} {{processes}} {{found in nature}} functions from macro-scale to the nanoscale. Bio-inspiration or biomimetics is a tool to mimic these natural objects to develop functional materials which provide desired properties. There are {{a large number of}} examples found in nature such as plants, bacteria, land animals, aquatic animals and insects which provide an inspiration to mimic some structural and functional properties owned by them. For example some plant leaves and flower petals like lotus leaf, rice leaf, taro leaf and rose petal are well known for their superhydrophobic and self-cleaning properties due to the multiscale structural patterns present on their surfaces. This self-cleaning phenomenon also known as “Lotus effect” is due to high contact angle and low contact angle hysteresis. India canna is a common garden plant however structural properties of its various parts such as petal, leaf and seedpod have not been studied in literature. In this work, we studied the super hydrophobic nature of India canna plant. In case of seedpod, it is the high aspect ratio multiscale structures that cause the superhydrophobicity however interestingly in case of leaf and petal, it is low aspect ratio bump like structures for similar behaviour. We mimicked these structural patterns into a number of polymers like PDMS and an organic (resorcinol formaldehyde) gel and found that these biomimicked polymer surfaces also exhibit superhydrophobic property. To add the novelty, polymer surfaces with these multiscale surface patterns has also been studied for their antireflective properties with an inspiration from the <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> <b>structure.</b> The facile fabrication of superhydrophobic as well as antireflective polymer surfaces by a low cost and simple biomimicking route opens the possibilities of using such surfaces {{for a wide variety of}} engineering applications including energy storage devices...|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that the two main drawbacks of moth eye-structured ARCs-i. e., the lack of suitable coating materials and a process for large area, high volume applications-can be largely eliminated, paving the way for cost-efficient and large-scale production of durable moth eye-structured ARCs on polymer substrates. We prepared <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> coatings on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polycarbonate using wafer-by-wafer step-and-flash nano-imprint lithography (NIL). The reduction in reflection in the visible field achieved with these coatings was 3. 5 % and 4. 0 %, respectively. The adhesion of the coating to both substrates was good. The <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> coating on PMMA demonstrated good performance in three prototypical accelerated ageing tests. The pencil hardness of the <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> coatings on both substrates was < 4 B, which is less than required for most applications and needs further optimization. Additionally, we developed a roll-to-roll UV NIL pilot scale process and produced <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> coatings on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at line speeds up to two meters per minute. The resulting coatings showed a good replication of the <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> <b>structures</b> and, consequently, a lowering in reflection of the coated PET of 3. 0 %. © 2013 by the authors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{artificial}} nanostructured surfaces {{inspired by the}} <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> were developed on both inorganic and organic substrates. Two properties, i. e. anti-reflective (AR) and anti-bacterial (AB) were studied in detail. On inorganic fused silica (Suprasil®) substrates, nanopillar arrays were fabricated by combining block copolymer micellar lithography (BCML) and reactive ion etching (RIE) techniques. The nanopillar arrays were fabricated on a large area and {{the parameters of the}} pillars were controlled. The substrates were used as molds to create nanostructures in organic substrates using two methods: replica molding and nanoimprinting. The first method transferred the pillar structure into a polyurethane substrate creating nanoholes. However, it was shown that this method was limited due to the low aspect ratio and difficulties in mold removal. Using nanoimprinting methods instead solved these problems. Both nanohole and nanopillar structures were homogeneously imprinted in a large area of the intermediate polymer stamp (IPS®) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) materials. The AR properties of both organic and inorganic substrates were characterized using optical spectrometry. On Suprasil® surfaces, the transmittance was increased over a wide wavelength range of 200 - 1000 nm, with a maximum of 99. 5 % transmission per interface. Nanoimprinted IPS® and PMMA also depicted highly improved transmittance, with an increase from 91. 5 % to 95 % with a single-sided nanohole array on IPS® and from 91. 5 % to 97. 5 % with a double-sided nanopillar array on PMMA. Excellent AR performance was achieved to a high incident angle of 60 °, which significantly outperformed traditional thin-film AR coatings. A theoretical model was also set up matching the experimental results very well. The AB properties of the <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> inspired <b>structures</b> were investigated on the nanostructured Suprasil®. The surface coverage of Staphylococcus sciuri (S. sciuri) bacteria was statistically analyzed by optical microscopy and the attachment sites between the bacteria and the nanostructures were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Although the surface coverage showed {{no significant difference between the}} nanostructured and planar surfaces, SEM images clearly revealed a different interaction of the bacteria and the nanostructures compared to plain surfaces. Nanofibers most likely fimbriae connecting the bacteria and the nanopillar tips were observed.

Nature has its own strategy to effectively reduce reflection: for example, nanostructured surface on a <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> [6, 9]. Such biological nanostructured surfaces can create a composite comprising air and a material, where n gradually changes from the air to the material because effective n depends on the volume fraction of the two media.

40|$|Uncooled FIR-bolometer image sensors are {{established}} in many applications like building inspections, cold bridge analyses and predictive maintenance. New fields of application are discovered, like automotive night vision, advanced presence detection, gesture recognition etc. but these require a lower cost, {{small form factor}} packaging of the μ-bolometer sensors. Wafer level packaging (WLP) {{is seen as the}} enabling housing technology compared to ceramic packages for high volume production. Monolithic integrated μ-bolometer image sensors require a vacuum packaging with vacuum level in the range of 10 - 3 mbar or less. The growing demand for reliability especially in automotive applications has also a large impact on the package construction. The overall challenge for high sensitive μ-bolometer sensors is to create a small package that allows for a maximum IR transmission at minimum cost. The work describes a wafer level technology on 200 mm wafers with a hermetic sealing for large evacuated cavity dimensions with the process integration of different anti-reflective surface treatments. Cavities are created with 90 μm thick poly-silicon frames in an additive deposition technology. The IR window region in the caps features different customer specific anti-reflective concepts. One approach is a double side <b>moth</b> <b>eye</b> pattern that can be designed to suppress short wavelength by destructive interference. It is possible to use different geometries of <b>moth</b> <b>eyes</b> in- and outside of the cavities to create a low cost filter. To reduce sunlight transmission a combination of <b>moth</b> <b>eyes</b> inside the cavities and a multi-layer filter coating outside can be achieved. The <b>moth</b> <b>eyes</b> patterns are realized in silicon wafers by reactive ion etching. To generate a high vacuum up to 10 - 4 mbar a getter with large exposed surface is required.

One mode depends on the grating period and the other mode results from Fabry-Pérot-like resonance. In this paper, we adopted the concentric rings as the grating structures on the dielectric layer over the metallic ground and studied their near-field enhancements and far-field radiation patterns. The concentric rings have often been used for focusing applications. When the concentric rings are formed on the metal surface of a single layer, a strong transmission is obtained through the structure called the bull’s <b>eye</b> <b>structure</b> which has been described extensively elsewhere[18 – 22].

The transmission can be enhanced by cutting the bull’s eye antenna; i.e., a split bull’s eye structure[25].
