40|$|Degradation of {{xenobiotics}} by microbial populations is {{a potential}} method to enhance the effectiveness of ex situ or in situ bioremediation. The propose {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of repeated <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> folpet treatments on soil microbial communities and to select soil fungal strains able to degrade these fungicides. Results showed an enhanced degradation of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> folpet in vineyards soils submitted at repeated treatments with these fungicides. Indeed, highest degradation ability was observed in vineyard soil samples submitted at higher number of treatments. Respiration activities, determined in the presence of selective antibiotics in soil suspensions amended with <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> folpet, showed that the fungal population was the microbiota community most active in the degradation process. Batch cultures performed with a progressive increase of fungicide concentrations allowed the selection of five tolerant fungal strains: Penicillium sp. 1 and Penicillium sp. 2, mycelia sterila 1 and 3, and Rhizopus stolonifer. Among these strains, mycelium sterila 3 and R. stolonifer, presented only in vineyards soils treated with repeated application of these fungicides, showed tolerance higher than 1000 mg l- 1 against a commercial formulations of metalaxyl (10 %) plus folpet (40 %). Using specific methods for inducing sporulation, mycelium sterila 3 was identified as Gongronella sp. Since this fungus is rare, it was compared by csM 13 -PCR with the two known species G. butleri and G. lacrispora. The high tolerance to <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> folpet demonstrated by Gongronella sp. and R. stolonifer might be correlated with their degradation ability.

40|$|<b>Metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> tricyclazole are two {{fungicides}} {{widely used}} in Spain in vineyard and rice crops respectively. In this study an investigation {{has been made of}} the effect of three organic amendments [two commercial amendments, solid fertiormont (SF) and liquid fertiormont (LF), and a residue from the olive oil production industry, alperujo (OW) ] on fungicide fate in soils. Changes in soil porosity on amendment were studied by mercury intrusion porosimetry, sorption-desorption studies were performed by the batch equilibration method, dissipation of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> tricyclazole in the soil was studied at - 33 kPa moisture content and 20 °C and leaching was studied in hand-packed soil columns. Amendments with SF and LF reduced soil porosity, while OW increased porosity through an increase in pore volume in the highest range studied. Tricyclazole sorbed to soils to a much higher extent than metalaxyl. With some exceptions, sorption of both fungicides increased on amendment, {{especially in the case of}} SF-amended soils, which rendered the highest Koc values. In soils amended with the liquid amendment LF, sorption either remained unaffected or decreased, and this decrease was much higher in the case of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> a soil with 70 % clay. In this clay soil, amendment with OW, of very high soluble organic matter content, also decreased metalaxyl sorption. Tricyclazole is more persistent in soil than <b>metalaxyl,</b> <b>and</b> both fungicides were found to be more persistent in amended soils than in unamended soils. Leaching of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> tricyclazole in soil columns was inversely related to sorption capacity. The low recoveries of tricyclazole in leachates and in soil columns when compared with metalaxyl, a less persistent fungicide, were attributed to diffusion into micropores and to increase in sorption with residence time in the soil, both processes favoured by the low mobility of tricyclazole.

40|$|Phytophthora erythroseptica Pethybr. is {{the causal}} agent of potato pink rot {{which results in}} a wet rot and {{complete}} breakdown of tubers leading to significant yield losses in field and storage settings. Traditionally, products containing <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> later its enantiomer metalaxyl-m {{have been used to}} manage P. erythroseptica. However, in recent years, metalaxyl-m resistant strains of P. erythroseptica have been recovered in the United States and Atlantic Canada. A national survey was conducted from 2013 to 2016 to assess the distribution of metalaxyl m-resistant populations in Canadian potato- producing regions. The survey recovered resistant isolates from Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Manitoba, and Alberta. As a result of this survey, resistant isolates were identified {{for the first time in}} Ontario, Manitoba, and Alberta. Due to the increasing frequency of metalaxyl-m resistant populations there is a need for alternative management strategies. Therefore, registered and experimental fungicides were assessed for the capacity to control the pink rot pathogen in field and storage settings. The fungicides evaluated were metalaxyl-m, oxathiapiprolin, fluopicolide, phosphites, and a biological control agent Bacillus subtilis. The EC 50 values (the fungicide concentration inhibiting mycelial growth of the pathogen by 50 % relative to the 0 μg mL- 1 control) for two strains (PE 9913; <b>metalaxyl-m</b> sensitive <b>and</b> PE 1204; <b>metalaxyl-m</b> resistant) of P. erythroseptica exposed to <b>metalaxyl-m,</b> oxathiapiprolin, fluopicolide, <b>and</b> phosphites were determined using an amended agar assay. The EC 50 values were 0. 057 and 842. 41 ppm, respectively, for the <b>metalaxyl-m</b> sensitive <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl-m</b> resistant isolates grown on metalaxyl-m amended media. The EC 50 values of the <b>metalaxyl-m</b> sensitive <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl-m</b> resistant isolates exposed to oxathiapiprolin, fluopicolide, or phosphite were < 0. 0001 ppm, 0. 064 to 0. 128, and 112. 0 to 147. 6 ppm, respectively. Field trials were established from 2014 to 2016 to evaluate the fungicides for their efficacy in managing pink rot in the field. Significant control of pink rot was achieved by in-furrow treatments of oxathiapiprolin or fluopicolide, or phosphites applied foliarly. Some pink rot suppression was achieved following application of Bacillus subtilis, but of significantly smaller degree than provided by the other products. Storage trials were established in 2016 and 2017 to assess the capacity of these fungicides to inhibit P. erythroseptica infection of tubers inoculated with zoospores prior to storage. Significant control of pink rot was achieved with treatments of oxathiapiprolin, fluopicolide, phosphites, and to lesser extent Bacillus subtilis under storage conditions. The results of this study show that metalaxyl-m resistant populations of P. erythroseptica are increasing in frequency in Canadian potato-producing regions. However, management of these populations can be achieved with use of currently registered and experimental products in production settings...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} aging {{in the soil}} of three organic {{amendments}} (OAs), one liquid (LF) and two solid ones (SF and AL), has been investigated and related to changes in soil adsorption of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> tricyclazole. LF and AL have very high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents with low humification index values, whereas SF has a low DOC content but the highest amounts of highly humified material. All OAs increased the adsorption of tricyclazole, whereas adsorption of metalaxyl decreased in soils amended with LF and AL, due to competition with DOC for mineral adsorption sites. With aging, DOC from SF amended soils is not significantly affected and neither is adsorption behavior. On the contrary, the great reduction of DOC from LF and AL with aging {{has been shown to}} affect adsorption of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> tricyclazole, and this effect is dependent on the pesticide, the nature of the DOC, and the type of soil, in particular its clay mineralogy.

Three different treatments were tested in two soils: control soil (unamended), and soil amended with fresh or composted spent mushroom substrates, which correspond to common agricultural practices in Spain. Leaching experiments were performed under non-saturated flow conditions. The model was parameterized with laboratory and literature data, and using pedotransfer functions. It was first calibrated for water flow against chloride breakthrough curves. The key parameter was the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient (DISP). No leaching of penconazole, the most hydrophobic fungicide, was observed. It remained in the top 0 - 8 cm of the column. In any case, simulations were highly correlated to the experimental results. On the contrary, <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> its metabolite were consistently found in the leachates. A calibration step of the K-d of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> CGA- 62826 and of DISP for CGA- 62826 was necessary to obtain good prediction of the leaching of both compounds.

In sunlight-drying the residue level in the raisins was identical {{to that in the}} fresh fruits for benalaxyl, <b>metalaxyl,</b> <b>and</b> phosalone, whereas it was higher for iprodione (1. 6) and lower for vinclozolin and dimethoate (one-third and one-fifth, respectively). The oven-drying process was preceded by washing, which caused residue decreases for iprodione and procymidone of 57 and 41 %, respectively, whereas no decrease was observed in all of the other pesticides. During oven-drying pesticide residues in raisins with respect to fresh fruits showed an increase of 2. 7 for phosalone, the same values for benalaxyl, <b>metalaxyl,</b> <b>and</b> procymidone, and lower values for vinclozolin and dimethoate. Sunlight-drying was more effective for phosalone and vinclozolin, whereas oven-drying was more effective for iprodione and procymidone, which was due to the washing effect rather than to dehydration.

Zeolites seem to be a promising material to adsorb pesticides. This paper deals with the removal of mobile pesticides from water on different types of zeolites. Experiments were performed to understand the adsorption mechanisms of bentazon, clopyralid, imidacloprid, isoproturon <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl-m</b> on zeolites <b>and</b> to determine the most efficient adsorbent for the purification of water contaminated by these pesticides. More immobile pesticides (imidacloprid, isoproturon <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl-m)</b> tended to associate with the zeolites, whereas more mobile pesticides (bentazon and clopyralid) partitioned in water. According to the adsorption percentage, zeolite of the types BEA and FAU showed the best results for adsorbing the pesticides. Two different kinetic models, namely, pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, were used to fit the kinetics data. The experimental data were best described by the pseudo-second-order model. The rate of adsorption was also in line with the mobility of the pesticides. The adsorption isotherms were determined and modelled based on the observed types according to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The type III isotherm was most frequently observed in this case. The Freundlich model, which describes this type of isotherm, gave a good fit for the adsorption of the pesticides. Different assumptions, that could describe the meaning of these type III isotherms, are discussed in this paper.

40|$|Experiments were {{undertaken}} {{to understand the}} fate of selected pesticides in water-sediment systems and to determine whether laboratory experimental data coupled with mathematical modelling is able to represent behaviour in outdoor condition. Two pesticides were selected for study; thiamethoxam has a low sorption coefficient (Koc) and is susceptible to hydrolysis <b>and</b> photolysis, whilst <b>metalaxyl-M</b> has moderate sorption but is stable to hydrolysis and photolysis. A sequence of experiments was carried out starting with investigation of simple, single-phase systems and building additional complexity first in the laboratory and subsequently in the field. Hydrolysis of thiamethoxam was pH-dependent; the rate was very slow under acidic and neutral conditions and significantly higher at alkaline pH (p< 0. 001). Photolysis of thiamethoxam was also strongly influenced by pH (p< 0. 001) with the rate of photolysis 4. 30 and 3. 85 times faster at pH 10 than at pH 9 for pure and natural water, respectively. The presence of nitrate anions significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased rate of photolysis of thiamethoxam and this was attributed to a direct competition for absorption of light. Sorption of the two pesticides to a natural sediment (Koc 32. 6 and 36. 6 L kg- 1 for thiamethoxam <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl-M,</b> respectively) suggested that these pesticide are weakly sorbed and likely to be present predominantly in the water phase. Pesticides in water-sediment systems with plants (Myriophyllum spicatum) degraded much faster than in systems without plants under both laboratory and outdoor conditions. Plants had direct effects through sorbing and taking up pesticide, but the dominant influence was indirect due to changing pH to alkaline conditions and thus increasing the rate of photolysis and hydrolysis. Degradation in water broadly translated from the laboratory to outdoor experiment, but sorption behaviour in simplified systems greatly overestimated pesticide sorption in complex systems in outdoor experiments. There was less intense contact between pesticide and sediment in vessels under outdoor conditions and pesticide degraded from water much more quickly, limiting the time available for sorption. A previously unreported tendency for photolysis of metalaxyl-M in outdoor experiments showed the importance of selecting laboratory conditions able to mimic behaviour of pesticides under outdoor conditions. TOXSWA predictions for fate of the two pesticides in outdoor experiments showed a reasonable match to measured data for the water phase, although residues were overestimated at initial {{and after a few}} days of experiment. Model efficiency was - 1. 81 and 0. 944 for thiamethoxam <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl-M,</b> respectively.

The following treatments were evaluated (g a. i. 100 kg- 1 seeds) : metalaxyl-M + mancozeb (5. 6 + 89. 6), metalaxyl- M + mancozeb (7. 3 + 116. 5), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (15. 0 + 150. 0), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (19. 5 + 195. 0), metalaxyl-M (37. 5), metalaxyl-M (75. 0), metalaxyl-M + fludioxonil (5. 0 + 12. 5) <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl-M</b> + fludioxonil (9. 0 + 22. 5). Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 9 treatments in four replications. Plots were established in soil contaminated with oospores of P. sorghi derived from debris of systemically infected plants in the previous season. The plants were evaluated forty-five days after the sowing, <b>and</b> the fungicide <b>metalaxyl-M</b> (75. 0 g i. a. 100 kg- 1) showed absolute protection against the systemic infection. The third experiment was performed to evaluate the efficiency of fungicides for the control of downy mildew through foliar application against systemic infection and local lesions of P. sorghi. Treatments were planted in four row-plots between two rows on a susceptible genotype, planted 40 days before, to act as spreader rows. The following fungicides were used in this experiment (g i. a. ha- 1) : metalaxyl-M + mancozeb (100. 0 + 1600. 0), metalaxyl-M + mancozeb (72. 0 + 1152. 0), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (135. 0 + 1350. 0), metalaxyl-M + chlorothalonil (101. 2 + 1012. 5), fosetyl-Al (2000. 0) and fosetyl- Al (1440. 0). The experimental design was a randomized block with 7 treatments in four replications. Fungicide spraying, in number of four, was accomplished with a hand sprayer at a 14 day-interval, starting 21 days after planting. Evaluations were performed fourteen days after the last spraying and the results showed that the fungicide metalaxyl-M+ mancozeb <b>and</b> <b>metalaxyl–M</b> + chlorothalonil did not present systemically infected plants and local lesions which attends the field legislation of 0 % downy mildew in seed production fields.

40|$|Two novel polysaccharide-based chiral {{stationary}} phases (CSPs), {{known as}} Sepapak- 2 (cellulose tris(3 -chloro- 4 -methylphenylcarbamate)) and Sepapak- 4 (cellulose tris(4 -chloro- 3 -methylphenylcarbamate)),have been evaluated {{in this work}} for the chiral separation {{of a group of}} 16 pesticides including herbicides,insecticides and fungicides. The optimization of the mobile phase employed in nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC) enabled the chiral separation of seven pesticides on Sepapak- 2 and of nine pesticides on Sepapak- 4. Due to the fact that Sepapak- 4 gave better results, this column was selected to compare nano-LC and capillary electrochromatography (CEC) under the same conditions that consisted in the use of a 90 / 9 / 1 (v/v/v) ACN/H 2 O/ammonium formate (pH 2. 5) background electrolyte (BGE). As expected, both the efficiency and the chiral resolution obtained in CEC experiments were higher than in nano-LC for all the analyzed compounds. The analytical characteristics of the CEC developed methodology were evaluated in terms of linearity, LODs, LOQs, precision, selectivity, and accuracy allowing its application to the quantitation of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> its enantiomeric impurity in a commercial fungicide product marketed as enantiomerically pure (<b>metalaxyl-M)</b> <b>and</b> in soil and tap water samples after solid phase extraction (SPE).

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Phytophthora vignae, {{causal agent}} of stem and root rot of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), was {{reported}} {{for the first time}} in Sri Lanka. The pathogen was found in cowpea field soils from 3 of 5 geographic regions sampled. Only one site however, had plants exhibiting disease symptoms. Of the eight cowpea varieties grown in Sri Lanka, four were shown to be relatively resistant; all other legumes inoculated were completely resistant. Two morphologic and physiologic races of P. vignae were identified among the 24 isolates recovered, based on differential pathogenicity on cowpea varieties. Bacteria isolated from field soils, and other known bacterial biocontrol agents, inhibited P. vignae in culture, but only three Sri Lankan isolates considerably suppressed the disease in greenhouse tests. Volatile substances produced by most bacteria inhibited mycelial growth and sporangial production by P. vignae. The increased pH of the exposed medium suggested the involvement of ammonia. Volatile inhibitors were produced by these bacteria in soil, but only with added substrate; Strain DF- 3101 also reduced oospore germination in soil. Cowpea plants inoculated with the VA mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus Glomus intraradices in P. vignae-infested soil were larger than non-mycorrhizal plants, but only at low levels of the pathogen. VAM colonization was reduced at high levels of the pathogen, and root infection by the pathogen was reduced by VAM. The fungicides <b>metalaxyl,</b> fosetyl-Al, Banrot, <b>and</b> Manzate- 200 DF reduced in vitro mycelial growth, but at different concentrations. Sporangia formation and germination, and oogonia formation by P. vignae, was reduced significantly by <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> fosetyl-Al. In greenhouse tests, metalaxyl, even at low concentrations, reduced disease; Fosetyl-Al was effective at high concentrations; Manzate- 200 DF was effective as a soil drench but not as a foliar spray; Banrot effectively reduced disease at 50 mg a. i. /L. Exposure of a bacterial biocontrol agent to these fungicides in vitro did not affect its capacity to subsequently produce volatile inhibitors, but exposure to 10 ug/ml of <b>metalaxyl</b> <b>and</b> 50 ug/ml of Manzate- 200 DF reduced its capacity to subsequently inhibit mycelial growth of P. vignae...|$|R
