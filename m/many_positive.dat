5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is apparent from its <b>many</b> <b>positive</b> and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E

50|$|Scully earned {{himself a}} {{reputation}} as the best up-and-coming manager in Ireland by winning the First Division Trophy at his first attempt. Rovers finished the 2007 season in 5th position. Unfortunately the young team faded badly in the final stretch and European football was missed out on but despite this {{it was a good}} overall season with <b>many</b> <b>positives.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Many</b> <b>positives,</b> {{both of the}} box and 'cupboard' types, can {{be divided}} into upper and lower parts to be more easily moved. The lower part then usually {{contains}} the bellows, blower and/or treadle, and perhaps a few of the largest pipes. Wheels, casters or a custom-made hand truck are other aids to mobility, which have become vastly more common in modern times.|$|R
5|$|On 31 August, Smith joined Queens Park Rangers on {{an initial}} three-month loan deal. His move was made {{permanent}} in January 2011, with Smith having agreed a three-year deal {{for a fee}} of around £1.5 million. Smith provided the assist for Heiðar Helguson in a 2–1 win against Crystal Palace on 2 October and has since made <b>many</b> <b>positive</b> contributions to the QPR team but found starts {{hard to come by}} {{in the early days of}} his Rangers career. He scored his first goal for the club against Reading on 6 November, and also netted a late equaliser in a 1–1 draw with former club Portsmouth three days later, scoring a last-minute penalty to earn QPR a point and keep their unbeaten start to the season intact. On 20 August 2011, he scored his and QPR's first goal of the 2011–12 Premier League season, in a 1–0 away win against Everton.|$|E
5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities {{did their best to}} respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the <b>many</b> <b>positive</b> reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices {{for the remainder of the}} medieval period.|$|E

50|$|While {{the return}} to the 'top' {{divisions}} in Scottish League football did not, in the end, produce the hoped for promotion, nevertheless there were <b>many</b> <b>positives</b> to be taken from a successful season. Dumbarton were always challenging the top places in the Second Division throughout the campaign and eventually finished up 4th of 19, only 7 points behind champions Queen's Park (and just 4 short of a promotion place).|$|R

40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{and compares}} some basic facts about recultivation and alternative methods of restoration, such is revitalization and natural succession. Recultivation {{is the way}} of quick revegetation, but it's expensive and in many cases contraproductive considering biodiversity of recultivated sites. Whereas, approaches based on principles of ecological restoration have <b>many</b> <b>positives.</b> They can create much valuable landscape structures and ecosystems than recultivation, and they enhance biodiversity and conservation of rare species...|$|R
25|$|By 1976, Mineo's {{career had}} begun to turn around. While {{playing the role of}} a {{bisexual}} burglar in a series of stage performances of the comedy P.S.

25|$|The {{books have}} been criticized for their {{derivative}} nature. The two most commonly discussed sources are Star Wars (because of numerous similarities in the plots) and The Lord of the Rings (because of the setting, elf and dwarven races, the language and character and place names). Even <b>many</b> <b>positive</b> reviews note that the work pulls strongly from the conventions of fantasy, in characters, maps, dialogue and concepts.|$|E

Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health, greater longevity, lower rates of infant mortality, experience fewer stressful life events, and less frequently the victims of violent crimes However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.|$|E
25|$|Many Diophantine {{equations}} have a form {{similar to}} the equation of Fermat's Last Theorem {{from the point of}} view of algebra, in that they have no cross terms mixing two letters, without sharing its particular properties.

CIE detected about half as <b>many</b> <b>positives</b> as the other methods; RIA was the most sensitive.

50|$|Human {{interference}} {{is almost}} inevitable with the quickly increasing population. The goal behind habitat corridors shows the most hope for solving habitat fragmentation and restoring biodiversity {{as much as}} possible. Although there are <b>many</b> <b>positives</b> and negatives, there may be enough positives to continue studying and improving corridors. It is truly difficult to say whether corridors are the solution to increasing biodiversity, because each one must be judged on its own. Each corridor has {{its own set of}} standards and goals that may set it apart from another one.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{experiences}} of the first year of operation of a novel on-line health psychology module. Results from the first year indicated a number of pertinent issues: firstly, students performed in examinations at a higher level than with “traditional lectures” and their performance was correlated with usage of the material. Furthermore, students appeared to enjoy the material. However, there was some reluctance to develop an independent learning style. These results suggest that although on-line learning has <b>many</b> <b>positives,</b> tutors {{are going to have to}} ensure that the material is developed in an interactive and engaging fashion and students should not forget their responsibility for their own learning...|$|R

The trio garnered <b>many</b> <b>positive</b> reviews, with Faldo and Azinger often exchanging verbal barbs and engaging in humorous banter.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{release of}} Barber's Symphony No. 2 was widely criticized for various reasons. Several critics {{felt that the}} work {{was little more than}} war time propaganda. Many people complained about the inclusion of the electronic tone-generator in a symphonic work. Despite much criticism, the work also received <b>many</b> <b>positive</b> reviews. The work was generally viewed as Barber's most ambitious and contemporary work. There was a great sense of tension and energy in the work that was palpable to audiences.|$|E
25|$|The changes did {{not bring}} <b>many</b> <b>positive</b> results. While Florida's passing attack improved, the 1978 Gators' overall scoring output was almost {{identical}} to that of 1977 (about 22 points per game) and the team's record slumped to 4–7, leading to Dickey's dismissal. Spurrier {{expressed an interest in}} becoming Florida's next head coach but was not a serious candidate due to his lack of experience, and Clemson coach Charley Pell was hired soon after conclusion of the season. Pell chose not to retain any of Dickey's staff, leaving Spurrier without a job.|$|E
