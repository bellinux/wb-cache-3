60|$|DANCY. It's all damned kind of you. [With difficulty] But I {{must think}} of my wife. Give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let {{me ask you}} the {{question}} you asked <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> ago," [...] her companion begged. [...] "Were you born in America--or England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You will spare <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Tony. I have {{something}} to ask you,” he said. “We need have no diffidence in speaking before Mr. Craythorne.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so--' I shall niver reveal {{myself to}} me nephew.' He said those very words to <b>me</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before the fatal shell struck him." ...|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE. I am {{curious to}} know what Captain Brown can {{have to say to}} <b>me.</b> In <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Mr. Blades, Lieutenant Spicer, I shall be at your service.|$|R
6000|$|... 'MY DARLING,--I cannot release you--I must do {{anything}} to keep my [...] treasure. Will you not see <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> and let bygones go [...] to the winds?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray {{be patient}} with me, Sir; give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to collect myself. I have much need for a little self-possession before I tell you all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can go now. Come {{back for}} supper, if you like," [...] Jefferson {{replied with a}} twinkle and put down some documents. [...] "If you can give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Miss Jordan----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came {{to explain}} the state of Sylvia's Canadian affairs; she wished you to know," [...] he said. [...] "If you will give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> I'll try to make things clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} find you," [...] she said, [...] "so much of a philosopher. Now talk to <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{about what}} you have been doing in Africa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Rupert said, [...] "my grandfather, {{although}} he cares not {{at his age}} for prolonged exercise, has yet {{made a point of}} giving <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> each day the benefit of his skill." ...|$|R
60|$|Dear Sir,--I {{presented}} {{a petition to}} the house yesterday, [1] which gave rise to some debate, and I wish you to favour <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> with the 'Times' and 'Herald' to look on their hostile report.|$|R
6000|$|... "If your {{invitation}} to lunch still holds good," [...] he said, [...] "may I accept it? Afterwards, {{if you can}} spare <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> I will make things quite clear to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am feeling {{quite well}} again, thank you," [...] the Inspector said slowly. [...] "If you could spare <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> I should {{be glad to}} explain the matter which brought me here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how are you, Souchey?" [...] said Lotta, {{with unusual}} {{kindness}} of tone. [...] "I suppose {{you are not}} so busy but you can stay with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> while she is in there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll be soaked to the skin," [...] he protested. [...] "I {{want you}} to come into the smoking-room here with <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> We will have a drink {{together}} and a little conversation, if you don't mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hoped you had {{got over}} that foolishness," [...] George rejoined, {{throwing}} his cigarette on the floor, {{although he was}} generally careful about such things. [...] "Now listen to <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> {{and try to be}} sensible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} excuse <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> Mr. Meeson," [...] {{interrupted}} Lady Holmhurst at this point; [...] "I {{have to go}} to see about the dinner," [...] and before Augusta could interfere she had left the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said I, {{stepping}} to {{the bottom}} of the stairs, [...] "I have some things to attend to down here which will occupy <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> longer; then I will come up to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found that}} he was absent," [...] he said courteously, [...] "and that is why I venture to address you upon a matter of some importance. Give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of your time, therefore, I beseech you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Phil," [...] she said, in the Telfair, sweet, thrilling tones, [...] "why didn't {{you tell}} me about it before? I thought it was sister you wanted all the time, until you telephoned to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> ago!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know {{a charming}} new dance that I {{should like to}} show you; but {{it can only be}} done by two people. If the princess will honour <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> you will soon see how it is done.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} brought the charge without warrant, Captain Dave," [...] Cyril said gravely, [...] "and {{if you will}} bear with <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> I {{think you will see}} that there is at least {{something}} that wants looking into." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Pritchard {{introduced}} himself to <b>me</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> ago," [...] he declared. [...] "He brought me {{in here and}} I have been listening {{to a lot of}} rubbish from him of which I don't believe a single word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a {{thing that}} only struck <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> ago, and I'm rather troubled about it," [...] he confessed. [...] "The boys have worked hard enough already without being set to making flapjacks and cooking their supper, while I really don't know how I'm to tide over breakfast to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Vaucross {{stopped and}} talked to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> and then {{he took me to}} a high-toned {{restaurant}} to eat dinner. There was music, and then some Beethoven, and Bordelaise sauce, and cussing in French, and frangipangi, and some hauteur and cigarettes. When I am flush I know them places.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I had {{finished}} my turn at bridge,' he said, 'and {{went out into}} the garden to smoke a cigar. Lord Arthur Skelmerton joined <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later, and we were sitting in the pavilion when I heard a loud and, as I thought, threatening voice {{from the other side of}} the hedge.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mildred, not yet. You surely {{can spare}} me--me, who have {{suffered}} so much of late on your account--nay, by your means--you can, in mercy, spare <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>minutes.</b> Was this the reason--the only reason, dearest girl, why you so pertinaciously refused my hand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By jove, I forgot!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{must see}} my old friend, Dickson, before I leave town. It won't take <b>me</b> but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> You {{go to the}} depot and wait for me." [...] And before the money-lender's son could reply, he was off, down another side street.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will write}} with pleasure, Mr. Keller. We have {{half an hour}} yet before post-time. I have promised Minna {{to see how the}} {{wonderful}} necklace looks on her. Will you excuse <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes?</b> Or will you go upstairs with me?--I think you said something about it in the drawing-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{be happy}} to," [...] said Peter promptly. [...] "Danny {{has been telling}} me what a {{wonderful}} jumper you are. Would you mind showing me how you jump? I guess you jumped {{right in front of}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> ago, but I was so surprised that I didn't really see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} indeed of you, Mr. Trent," [...] she said earnestly. [...] "I was quite nervous about coming, for I {{had no idea that}} you would be so kind. Shall I finish my sketch first, and then perhaps {{you will be able to}} spare <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> for the interview?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{what ails}} you, Mr. Arabin?" [...] said she. [...] "Here {{you are in}} your own parish--Miss Thorne tells me that her party is given {{expressly}} in your honour--and yet you are the only dull man at it. Your friend Mr. Slope was with <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> since, full of life and spirits; why don't you rival him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It recalls {{something}} that still gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> very bad <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{every now and}} then. It has been worrying me again to-night." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My Dear Lord, Will {{you meet}} <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> today or tomorrow. I wish {{to speak to}} you on the subject of an unfortunate man who has written to me from Newgate with whose case I am not acquainted. His name is Cooper and I knew him when he was Consul at Venice. Yours {{faithfully}} Clare." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood by}} <b>me</b> for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> {{watching}} to see if I needed any more fixing, but when he {{made up his mind}} that I was done up securely, he brought a chair and sat down {{by the side of the}} bed and began to talk to me. I never saw anything like the audacity of the boy.|$|R
