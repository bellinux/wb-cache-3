5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} conceived in 1999 as Resident Evil 4. Due {{to the staff}} feeling it would not fit the Resident Evil franchise, the project dropped its ties to Resident Evil and was made into its own story instead.

5|$|The New York {{classical}} music scene included Charles Griffes, originally from Elmira, New York, who began publishing his <b>most</b> <b>innovative</b> material in 1914. His early collaborations were attempts to use non-Western musical themes. The best-known New York composer was George Gershwin. Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres, and his works were {{strongly influenced by}} jazz, or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time. Gershwin's work made American {{classical music}} more focused, and attracted an unheard of amount of international attention. Following Gershwin, the first major composer was Aaron Copland from Brooklyn, who used elements of American folk music, though it remained European in technique and form. Later, {{he turned to the}} ballet and then serial music. Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance, producing music in a uniquely American style, though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, South Korea's film {{industry}} {{was at a}} low point due to government censorship and underfunding. Because of the poor state of the local {{film industry}}, cinema attendance in South Korea had dropped drastically since its high-point in the 1960s. Kim Ki-young, however, working independently in B-movie-like genre films, began to produce some of his <b>most</b> <b>innovative</b> and personal works at this time. Kim fully regained his auteurist spirit with Woman of Fire (1971), the second of his Housemaid trilogy. The use of color, particularly reds and blues to express the anxiety and desires of the film's characters, distinguished this film from the original Housemaids dark, shadowy black-and-white photography. For this film, Kim was named Best Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and actress Youn Yuh-jung was given Special Mention for Best Actress at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. Not only popular with the critics, Kim's independently produced films were box-office successes during this era in which most films were harmed through heavy governmental interference. In 1972 Kim's Insect Woman was the only film to sell more than 100,000 tickets in Seoul and won Kim the Best Director prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards in 1973.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) {{launched}} {{a project to}} provide comprehensive support for autistic Singaporeans, which included plans {{to set up the}} first autism-focused special school in Singapore. The ARC collaborated with the Rainbow Centre over a period of five months to renovate the temporary campus, recruit school staff, decide on the school values and develop the school programmes. After opening in 2004 with 10 teachers and 41 students, Pathlight School conducted charity walks, merchandise sales and other events to raise funds for the introduction of more programmes for an expanding intake. In 2007, two teachers from Pathlight School won the inaugural Most Outstanding Special Education Teacher Award and <b>Most</b> <b>Innovative</b> Special Education Teacher Award, given by the Singaporean Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service. In 2009, the Autism Association of Singapore {{launched a}} second autism-focused special school, Eden School, and the two schools formed a partnership. The following year, Pathlight School moved to its permanent campus and announced plans to develop student internship programmes, build an information technology centre, and set up a lifelong learning club for alumni.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect {{was officially}} {{announced}} at the X05 trade show in Amsterdam on October 4, 2005 as an Xbox 360 exclusive.

IGN editors awarded the game for Best Graphics Technology and <b>Most</b> <b>Innovative</b> Design at their Best of E3 2006 Awards. They also listed it {{as one of the most}} anticipated games of 2007. New features of the game were detailed at the X06 trade show in Barcelona in September 2006, while the first hour of gameplay was shown at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in March 2007. Mass Effect was then presented at E3 in July 2007, where it received Game Critics Awards for Best Console Game and Best Role Playing Game, and at the Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany in August 2007.

5|$|Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a pacifistic journalist, {{had built}} up the {{educational}} resources of the Navy and made its Naval War College an essential experience for would-be admirals. However, he alienated the officer corps with his moralistic reforms (no wine in the officers' mess, no hazing at Annapolis, more chaplains and YMCAs). Ignoring the nation's strategic needs, and disdaining the advice of its experts, Daniels suspended meetings of the Joint Army and Navy Board for two years because it was giving unwelcome advice. He chopped in half the General Board's recommendations for new ships, reduced the authority of officers in the Navy yards where ships were built and repaired, and ignored the administrative chaos in his department. Bradley Fiske, one of the <b>most</b> <b>innovative</b> admirals in American naval history, was Daniels' top aide in 1914; he recommended a reorganization that would prepare for war, but Daniels refused. Instead, he replaced Fiske in 1915 and brought in for the new post of Chief of Naval Operations an unknown captain, William S. Benson. Chosen for his compliance, Benson proved a wily bureaucrat who {{was more interested in}} preparing for an eventual showdown with Britain than an immediate one with Germany.|$|E
