50|$|Marine mammals {{show some}} of the {{greatest}} sexual size differences of mammals. The mating system of pinnipeds varies from polygyny to serial monogamy. Pinnipeds are known for early differential growth and maternal investment since the only nutrients for newborn pups is the milk provided by the mother. For example, the males are significantly larger than the females at birth in sea lion pups. The pattern of differential investment can be varied principally prenatally and post-natally. <b>Mirounga</b> <b>leonina,</b> the southern elephant seal, {{is one of the most}} dimorphic mammals.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Southern {{elephant}} male seals (<b>Mirounga</b> <b>leonina</b> Linnaeus, 1758) {{were studied}} at King George Island (62 ° 14 ´S, 58 ° 40 ´W) from September to December 1999. The first males came ashore {{at the beginning}} of September. Twenty−five adults were im− mobilized, hot iron branded, and measured. Thirteen out of the 25 marked males spent an average of 66 (± 8) days on land. Early arrival was positively correlated with the time spent ashore (r = 0. 88, P < 0. 05). Nine harems were formed in the study area. At the maxi− mum haul−out of females (28 October) mean harem size was 32 ± 42 females (range 3 – 107). During the course of harem development, 10 changes in male harem dominance were observed. These changes were more frequent during the early (1 – 20 October, n = 6) than during the mid (21 October – 10 November, n = 2) and late (11 – 29 November, n = 2) periods of harem development. Overall, there were 14 dominant males; five of these in two different harems and nine in one harem. Of the 25 marked males, 44 % were resighted in the following breeding or moulting season, and 16 % seemed to improve their potential breeding success.

The flats were roughly surveyed in 1933 by Discovery Investigations personnel, and were resurveyed in 1947 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS).

40|$|Unlike most phocid species (Phocidae), <b>Mirounga</b> <b>leonina</b> (southern {{elephant}} seals) {{experience a}} catastrophic moult where {{they not only}} replace their hair but also their epidermis when ashore for approximately 1 month. Few studies have investigated behavioural and physiological adaptations of southern elephant seals during the moult fast, a particularly energetically costly life cycle’s phase. Recording heart rate is a reliable technique for estimating energy expenditure in the field. For the first time, subcutaneous heart rate data loggers were successfully implanted during the moult in two free-ranging southern elephant seals over 3 – 6 days. No substantial postoperative complications were encountered and consistent heart rate data were obtained.

40|$|Abstract Reproductive {{effort is}} a key {{parameter}} of life history because it measures the resources allocated to reproduction {{at the expense of}} growth and maintenance. Male reproductive effort always had a minor role with respect to female effort both in the development of theories and in field research. Elephant seals are an ideal subject for reproductive effort studies because they fast during the breeding season, splitting the phase of energy acquisition from the phase of energy use for breeding. In this paper, we present results on male reproductive effort (weight loss estimated by photogrammetry) in southern elephant seals (<b>Mirounga</b> <b>leonina),</b> the most dimorphic and polygynous of all mammal species. We show that total reproductive effort increases with age, with no sign of late decrease or senescence. Male reproductive effort in this specie...|$|R
40|$|Like many {{pinniped}} species, southern elephant seals (<b>Mirounga</b> <b>leonina)</b> {{are conducive}} to long-term population studies using mark-recapture techniques. The twenty-four year longitudinal dataset at sub-Antarctic Marion Island has already provided much insight into elephant seal population dynamics. However, {{a limitation of}} the present dataset is that mother / pup relatedness cannot be examined because pups are only tagged after their tagged mothers have abandoned them. We test the usefulness of two different temporary marking techniques (tagging and 'strapping'), and four different marker types over two consecutive breeding seasons for use on pups with attending marked mothers. We show that strapping is an ineffective way to mark unweaned southern elephant seals. By comparison, 'Supersmall®' Dalton plastic tags allow quick, effective and easy marking {{of large numbers of}} pups with known mothers, without excessive marker loss...|$|R
40|$|We compare genetic (both {{nuclear and}} mitochondrial) and morphometric {{measures}} between two putative populations of {{southern elephant seal}} (<b>Mirounga</b> <b>leonina),</b> and interpret the results {{in the context of}} data from mark-recapture and satellite-telemetric studies. One population is on the Argentine mainland, while the other is 2, 400 km away on South Georgia island. We found pronounced differentiation at the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region that was distinct from the pattern of variation seen among island rookeries. Some morphometric characters and seven out of ten nuclear-DNA markers also showed differentiation between the island and mainland sites. Diversity at nuclear markers was high in both populations but mtDNA diversity was low in the mainland population, suggesting a founder event and little subsequent immigration of females. Morphological differences may suggest different selective environments at the two sites...|$|R
40|$|A novel alphavirus was {{isolated}} from the louse Lepidophthirus macrorhini, collected from southern elephant seals, <b>Mirounga</b> <b>leonina,</b> on Macquarie Island, Australia.

Nearly all Macquarie Island elephant seals tested had neutralizing antibodies against the virus, but no virus-associated pathology has been identified, Antarctic Division personnel who have worked extensively with elephant seals showed no serological evidence of exposure to the virus. Sequence analysis illustrated that the southern elephant seal (SES) virus segregates,vith the Semliki Forest group of Australasian alphaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of known alphaviruses suggests that alphaviruses might be grouped according to their enzootic vertebrate host class, The SES virus represents the first arbovirus of marine mammals and illustrates that alphaviruses can inhabit Antarctica and that alphaviruses can be transmitted by lice...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{buoyancy}} {{during an}} animal’s time at sea are {{a powerful tool}} for inferring spatial and temporal foraging success.

In addition to the characteristic drift dives of elephant seals, drifting also occurred during putative foraging dives.
