40|$|In their {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>know</b> <b>how,</b> proponents <b>of</b> Intellectualism routinely appeal to ‘practical modes of presentation’. But what are practical modes of presentation? And {{what makes them}} distinctively practical? In this essay, I develop a Fregean account of practical modes of presentation: I argue that there are such things as practical senses and I give a theory of what they are. One of the challenges facing the proponent of a distinctively Fregean construal of practical modes of presentation is to provide an account of their nature on which they are plausible qua Fregean senses. I take up this challenge, arguing that we find examples of practical senses in the semantic values assigned to programs by operational semantics for programming languages. By looking at a species of practical senses, we will have taken one important step towards legitimizing the genus. In particular, I show that certain features of operational semantic values can be generalized towards a comprehensive theory of practical senses. The upshot is a full-fledged account of what practical senses are, which can be put to use in an explanatory theory <b>of</b> <b>know</b> <b>how...</b>|$|R

40|$|Orthodoxy {{has it that}} {{knowledge}} is bifurcated between different kinds of states and in particular that there are species of knowledge that cannot be reduced to knowledge of truths. Moreover, it is commonly alleged {{that knowledge}} of truths alone falls short of explaining a distinctive kind of human capacity: the human capacity for skillful actions. This dissertation challenges both these orthodoxies. In the first chapter, “Know how and Gradability, ” I defend the unity of knowledge against the single most powerful and thus far unanswered argument against it, what I call “The argument from gradability. ” According to this argument from gradability, due to Gilbert Ryle (151) in The Concept <b>of</b> Mind, <b>know</b> <b>how</b> and propositional knowledge cannot be the same state, because the first comes in degrees, whereas the latter is absolute. In this chapter, I argue that the Rylean argument from gradability to dualism fails, as it moves too quickly from the surface form <b>of</b> ascriptions <b>of</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to conclusions about the state that is ascribed by means of those ascriptions. According to Intellectualism about <b>know</b> <b>how,</b> knowing how to do something {{is a matter of}} possessing a piece of propositional knowledge. Intellectualists about kno...|$|R
