Mortality risk for each BMI quintile (I, 27. 4 kg/m 2) was determined from a proportional hazard regression with adjustment for age and other covanables. In this population, the overall BMI-mortalrty relation showed dependence on age, duration of follow-up, and baseline indicators of preexisting illness (weight fluctuation, history of major chronic disease, and severe physical complaints). Therefore, the analysis focused on women with no indicators of preexisting illness, and risk estimates were stratified by age at baseline and duration of follow-up. Among middle-aged women (ages 30 - 54 years), the authors found a weak linear relation dunng years 1 - 8 (<b>median</b> attained <b>age,</b> 51 years), a significant linear relation during years 9 - 14 (<b>median</b> attained <b>age,</b> 57 years), and a significant nonlinear (U-shaped) relation during years 15 - 26 (<b>median</b> attained <b>age,</b> 68 years).
