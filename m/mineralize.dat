5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum {{was thought}} to be saprotrophic, and has been {{described}} in this manner in both scholarly and popular discussions of the species. However, this classification was the result of its taxonomic history and comparisons with saprotrophic fungi that are not closely related. After its assignment to the Sclerodermatineae, a suborder whose members are ectomycorrhizal, its ecological role came into question. In 2007, Andrew Wilson and David Hibbett of Clark University and Eric Hobbie of the University of New Hampshire employed isotopic labeling, DNA sequencing, and morphological analysis to determine that this species is also ectomycorrhizal. Like all mycorrhizal fungi, C.cinnabarinum establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of trees, allowing the fungus to exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of the tree. This association is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces enzymes that <b>mineralize</b> organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. The only host trees identified for C.cinnabarinus are Quercus oaks, although related members of Calostoma have been observed to associate with other trees in the Fagaceae family, such as beech.|$|E

500|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} {{caused by}} environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they <b>mineralize</b> initially. Enamel hypoplasia {{is a condition}} in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency {{than the rest of the}} tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.|$|E

One of the strategic approaches is to produce tissue engineering (TE) constructs that mediate bone regeneration by recapitulating the natural bone formation or healing process. In this study, we aimed at producing devitalized <b>mineralized</b> carriers with augmented bone forming capacity via a modified culture protocol (i. e., culture conditions with high calcium and/or phosphate concentrations) that first promotes cell growth and, subsequently, <b>mineralized</b> extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by human periosteum-derived osteoprogenitor cells (hPDCs) on additive manufactured three-dimensional (3 D) porous titanium (Ti) -based scaffolds. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed to characterize the physicochemical properties of the produced devitalized <b>mineralized</b> carriers, as well as their effects as carriers on in vitro cell growth and osteochondrogenic differentiation of hPDCs under a perfusion bioreactor culture set-up. The results showed that the modified culture protocol was useful to produce devitalized <b>mineralized</b> carriers with different amount, distribution, composition, and morphology of <b>mineralized</b> matrix that resembled hydroxyapatite, and exhibited different Ca(2 +) release kinetics, distinct human bone morphogenetic protein (hBMP) - 2, human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF) proteins, and collagen contents. The produced devitalized <b>mineralized</b> carriers supported 3 D growth of hPDCs, with minor osteochondrogenic differentiation effects under the perfusion bioreactor culture condition. Subcutaneous implantation of hPDC-seeded devitalized <b>mineralized</b> carriers in athymic nude rats showed nearly five-fold augmentation in the ectopic bone-forming capacity, with no bone induction obtained for unseeded, devitalized <b>mineralized</b> carriers and plain Ti scaffolds.

The Nussir copper deposit is hosted by sedimentary and volcanic rock of Precambrian- Palaeoproterozoic age (2. 5 - 1. 6 Ga) that was deposited in an intracratonic half graben. It is classified as sediment-hosted stratabound copper deposit were bornite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite occurs as disseminated grains in a dolomitic rock with mineralization along veins. Geological mapping, re-logging of diamond drill cores, thin section analysis, micro probe analysis of thin sections, statistical analysis of chemical data and a correlation of geophysical measurements in drill holes was performed. Geological mapping indicated a conformation between the sedimentary Units in the Saltvatn Group. Drill core logging indicated a thicker and dolomite-rich Upper <b>mineralized</b> horizon and a more slate-rich dolomite in the Lower <b>mineralized</b> horizon. Because of the increasing contents of slate in the Lower <b>mineralized</b> horizon, it seem to pinch out towards west. The most western drill hole seemed to cut through the Upper <b>mineralized</b> horizon. This is in contradiction to the pre-classification of this horizon, which had classified it as being part of the Lower horizon. This observation comes from re-logging and study of polarized thin sections, which showed similarities with the Upper horizon. Microprobe analysis indicate a higher concentration of copper in bornite in the Upper <b>mineralized</b> horizon, and a higher concentration of silver in bornite and chalcocite in the Lower <b>mineralized</b> horizon. Multivariate analysis indicate great similarity between the Upper- and Lower <b>mineralized</b> horizon, and a lateral similarity along the <b>mineralized</b> horizon from east to west. Previous trace element analysis have been performed by use of different methods. In particular, one set of methods were utilized for the samples analysed in 2008 and before, and another set for the samples from 2008 and later.
