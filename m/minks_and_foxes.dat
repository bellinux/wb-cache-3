The outbreaks took place during April and May, {{around the time of}} whelping. During this period, mink are particularly susceptible to Salmonella infections. All affected farms were served by the same feed factory and it was concluded that a batch of contaminated feed was responsible for the outbreaks, although repeated culture of feed samples collected during the same period were negative. No other likely source could be identified. The results emphasize the importance of strict hygiene measures at feed factories and the proper use of ingredients of known Salmonella status, in particular during the whelping season.

40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} an area which {{receives}} more and more attention from media, NGOs, consumers and politicians. In {{order to meet the}} expectations from the surrounding society, animal industries must meet the public concerns openly, demonstrate transparency, and show a continued focus on improving animal welfare conditions. Overall, WelFur is designed to fulfil three purposes: 1) Provide a reliable and feasible system for animal welfare assessment based on scientifically proven measures. 2) Create consumer transparency about animal welfare standards on European fur farms. 3) Work as a toolbox for the individual fur farmer to point out and improve any areas on the fur farm where welfare standards potentially can be improved. With that in mind, the European Fur Breedersâ€™ Association started the WelFur project for fur farmed species (<b>mink</b> <b>and</b> <b>fox)</b> in 2009. The WelFur system is based on the methodology of the European Commissionâ€™s Welfare QualityÂ® project, which is widely recognized as the worldâ€™s most comprehensive animal welfare assessment system. Animal welfare can be a difficult concept to pin down, and many people have their own personal views. Despite this, there is general agreement within the scientific community about what represents good animal welfare. This consensus has been expressed in the Five Freedoms which is a definition of ideal physical and mental states for animals. WelFur is largely inspired by the European Commissionâ€™s Welfare QualityÂ® project that established four principles essential to safeguard and improve animal welfare: Good Housing, Good Feeding, Good Health and Appropriate Behaviour. These principles complement and build on the Five Freedoms. Within the principles Good Housing, Good Feeding, Good Health and Appropriate Behaviour, the Welfare QualityÂ® project defined 12 specific animal welfare criteria. Below the 12 criteria are a number of welfare measurements which are species-specific and must consider the biology of the animal species. The specific welfare measurements for <b>mink</b> <b>and</b> <b>fox</b> have been chosen by the scientists behind their project for their scientific validity, reliability and feasibility. Representing 7 European universities and institutions, the scientists did an in-depth review of all existing animal welfare research on fur animals before they identified the welfare indicators and measurements that eventually became the WelFur protocols. Throughout the development of WelFur external scientific reviewers have conserved the quality of the scientific work and the alignment with the original Welfare QualityÂ® project. The scoring of the welfare measurements have been accomplished with the support of INRA (French National Institute of Agronomic Research) ...|$|R

50|$|Skunk farming largely began {{during the}} late 1890s, when there was much foreign demand for their skins, and {{intensive}} trapping had largely extirpated the more valuable mostly black-colored specimens. Captive breeding of skunks proved relatively simple when compared to <b>mink</b> <b>and</b> marten farming, as skunks are easier to tame and have less specialized dietary needs. Emphasis was placed on selectively breeding the tamest and darkest colored skunks. Prior to the First World War, skunk pelts were primarily shipped to Europe until better methods of deodorizing and processing the skins lead to increased interest in selling them for North American consumption. Despite being easy to breed and manage, skunk farming wasn't overly profitable, as the relatively low price of the pelts didn't compensate for the costs in maintaining them. Nevertheless, raising skunks was considered good practice for amateur fur farmers wishing to later move on to more valuable furbearers like martens, sable, <b>mink</b> <b>and</b> silver <b>foxes.</b>|$|R

Traditionally, virtually all parkas worn by the Nunivaarmiut were made from the skins of seals, caribou, or birds; the skins of reindeer have been used in more recent times. <b>Mink</b> <b>and</b> <b>fox</b> skins were also utilized in the past, the latter occasionally for the ruff since it was too thin to be durable enough for men's parkas. Mainland furs that have been used in recent times but not in the past include ground squirrels received from the people of Nelson Island who, in turn, obtained them from the Kuskokwim River, and wolverine used primarily for trim. Muskrat skins (single layer) and Arctic ground squirrel (double layer) were used for winter parkas because these furs are light in weight but very warm. However, caribou (or its domesticated cousin, the reindeer, introduced to Alaska in the 1890s) is also quite warm and also more durable, making it perhaps the most desired material for winter clothing. Historically, ground squirrel, muskrat, and caribou were commonly used for clothing.|$|R

40|$|A related {{group of}} parvoviruses infects members of many {{different}} carnivore families. Some of those viruses differ in host range or antigenic properties, but the true relationships are poorly understood. We examined 24 VP 1 /VP 2 and 8 NS 1 gene sequences from various parvovirus isolates to determine the phylogenetic relationships between viruses isolated from cats, dogs, Asiatic raccoon dogs, <b>mink,</b> raccoons, <b>and</b> <b>foxes.</b> There were about 1. 3 % pairwise sequence differences between the VP 1 /VP 2 genes of viruses collected up to four decades apart. Viruses from cats, <b>mink,</b> <b>foxes,</b> <b>and</b> raccoons were not distinguished from each other phylogenetically, but the canine or Asiatic raccoon dog isolates formed a distinct clade. Characteristic antigenic, tissue culture host range, and other properties of the canine isolates have previously {{been shown to be}} determined by differences in the VP 1 /VP 2 gene, and we show here that there are at least 10 nucleotide sequence differences which distinguish all canine isolates from any other virus. The VP 1 /VP 2 gene sequences grouped roughly according to the time of virus isolation, and there were similar rates of sequence divergence among the canine isolates and those from the other species. A smaller number of differences were present in the NS 1 gene sequences, but a similar phylogeny was revealed. Inoculation of mutants of a feline virus isolate into dogs showed that three or four CPV-specific differences in the VP 1 /VP 2 gene controlled the in vivo canine host range...|$|R
40|$|OVERVIEW: Feline {{panleukopenia}} virus (FPV) infects all felids {{as well as}} raccoons, <b>mink</b> <b>and</b> <b>foxes.</b> This pathogen may {{survive in}} the environment for several months and is highly resistant to some disinfectants. INFECTION: Transmission occurs via the faecal-oral route. Indirect contact {{is the most common}} route of infection, and FPV may be carried by fomites (shoes, clothing), which means indoor cats are also at risk. Intrauterine virus transmission and infection of neonates can occur. DISEASE SIGNS: Cats of all ages may be affected by FPV, but kittens are most susceptible. Mortality rates are high - over 90 % in kittens. Signs of disease include diarrhoea, lymphopenia and neutropenia, followed by thrombocytopenia and anaemia, immunosuppression (transient in adult cats), cerebellar ataxia (in kittens only) and abortion. DIAGNOSIS: Feline panleukopenia virus antigen is detected in faeces using commercially available test kits. Specialised laboratories carry out PCR testing on whole blood or faeces. Serological tests are not recommended, as they do not distinguish between infection and vaccination. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: Supportive therapy and good nursing significantly decrease mortality rates. In cases of enteritis, parenteral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach), peracetic acid, formaldehyde or sodium hydroxide are effective. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS: All cats - including indoor cats - should be vaccinated. Two injections, at 8 - 9 weeks of age and 3 - 4 weeks later, are recommended, and a first booster 1 year later. A third vaccination at 16 - 20 weeks of age is recommended for kittens from environments with a high infection pressure (cat shelters) or from queens with high vaccine-induced antibody levels (breeding catteries). Subsequent booster vaccinations should be administered at intervals of 3 years or more. Modified-live virus vaccines should not be used in pregnant queens or in kittens less than 4 weeks of age...|$|R
40|$|Results All <b>mink</b> <b>and</b> blue <b>foxes</b> {{maintained}} {{good health}} throughout both experiments. Mink In the digestibility trial mean final weights in mink (Figure 1) were equal in all diet groups (1846. 7 - 1908. 3 g), except the group dehulled oats 15 % {{where it was}} lower. In the production trial {{no statistically significant differences}} between treatments were found in weight gain (Figure 3). In the latter part of this experiment (November) mink fed 50 % dehulled oats gained even more than did the mink whose diet contained only barley as a cereal source. The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small and not significant (Table 3). Blue fox In the digestibility trial mean final weights of blue foxes were equal in all diets (Figure 1, 7355 - 7687 g). Average daily gain of blue foxes varied between 77. 4 - 81. 5 g. Final average weights varied from 13. 49 to 13. 75 kg (Figure 4). The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small (Table 4). Only quard hair quality, in the group 8 % dehulled oats became better than in other groups. Discussion Somewhat poorer weight gain in mink in the groups of 8 and 16 % dehulled oats did ot confirm the results of digestibility trial, where the difference in digestibility was not seen. The preliminary results of the digestibility trial show that both dehulled and naked oats diets were highly digestible. The difference may originate from looser and softer consistencys of dehulled oats diets. Dehulled oats finer particle size (2 mm) resulted in looser and softer consistency and probably led to feed waste from the wire mesh. The problem arose only with mink because the mink cages did not have feeding trays. In contrast, blue fox fed with the same experimental feed gained similarly to other diets. Van Barneveld et. al (1997) also studied digestibility of naked and dehulled oats in growing pigs and found that both dehulled and naked oats have very high amino acid digestibility. These results indicate that both naked and dehulled oats can promote good weight gain both in <b>mink</b> <b>and</b> blue <b>foxes.</b> Naked oats have been included in commercial young pigs diets with positive growth responses. Dehulled and naked oats have even been found very good feed ingredients for dogs. Amino acid content and profile oats is better than in corn Kempe et al. (2004). Our results, both digestibility data, growth and fur properties show that dehulled and naked oats are suitable ingredients in <b>mink</b> <b>and</b> blue <b>fox</b> diets. Naked oats is a new crop and not yet widely cultivated in Finland. Recent studies have shown that some varieties produce yields as high as common oats (Kangas et al., 2001). Hence, naked and dehulled oats will have a potential as a feed ingredient in fur bearing animal diets. References van Barneveld, R. J., Szarvas, S. R. and Barr, A. R. (1998).
