40|$|Este trabalho {{consiste}} na medida de traços radioativos em leite em pó, através da espectrometria gama de alta resolução, utilizando um detector de GeHP de 10 % de eficiência relativa, acoplado à eletrônica nuclear de medidas e a uma placa multicanal de 8192 canais. Antes de iniciar as medidas, foram realizados alguns testes. O primeiro deles para definir a blindagem a ser utilizada, fazendo várias medidas com diferentes blindagens de acordo com os materiais disponíveis, optando finalmente por uma blindagem com tijolos de chumbo de 10 cm, placas de ferro de 4 mm e de alumínio de 2 mm. Em seguida foram testadas 4 geometrias diferentes de porta amostra, sendo que o béquer Marinelli de 2, 1 litros totalmente preenchido é o que forneceu a melhor razão pico/fundo. Ainda foi realizada uma inferência estatística para determinar a amostragem necessária para representar cada um dos lotes de leite a serem medidos, estabelecendo-se um número de 6 amostras, para uma confiabilidade de 95 %. Foram analisadas duas marcas de leite, Leite em Pó Integral Cativa e Leite em Pó Integral Polly. As amostras foram devidamente acomodadas no béquer Marinelli de 2, 1 L, lacradas e guardadas por 40 dias para atingir o equilíbrio secular. A duração de cada medida foi de dois dias. Foi possível identificar os radionuclídeos 40 K, 137 Cs e 232 Th (a partir do 208 Tl), cujas atividades foram calculadas de acordo com as normas da Agência Internacional de Energia Atômica (IAEA, 1989). A eficiência do detector foi medida utilizando amostras calibradas, preparadas a partir dos padrões certificados IAEA- 326 e IAEA- 375. Foram realizadas correções de auto-absorção, com base em medidas de amostras com diferentes densidades. Os resultados obtidos para o leite em pó Cativa foram: 464 ± 12 Bq/kg para o 40 K, 3, 46 ± 1, 05 e 0, 46 ± 0, 16 Bq/kg para as atividades mínimas detectáveis do 137 Cs e do 232 Th, respectivamente. Para o leite Polly encontraram-se: 452 ± 10 Bq/kg para o 40 K, 3, 19 ± 0, 63 e 0, 32 ± 0, 12 Bq/kg para as atividades mínimas detectáveis do 137 Cs e do 232 Th, respectivamente. As análises estatísticas realizadas comprovaram a repetitividade das medidas, através do teste de comparação de médias de Tukey. Uma análise de correlação entre o desvio padrão e a média mostrou a ausência de erros sistemáticos significativos. Comparando-se os resultados obtidos com outros trabalhos da literatura, comprovou-se que os valores das atividades encontradas estão dentro dos níveis normais de radioatividade para este produto e bem abaixo dos níveis máximos permissíveis estabelecidos pela CNEN, ou seja, as marcas de leite analisadas podem ser consumidas normalmente. Por outro lado, a metodologia implementada apresentou um bom desempenho, face às condições experimentais disponíveis. This work {{deals with}} the measurement of radioactive lines in powdered milk, with high resolution gamma spectrometry, using a HPGe detector with relative efficiency of 10 %, coupled to the electronic nuclear chain and a <b>multichannel</b> <b>card</b> of 8192 channels. Some tests were realized before beginning the measurements. The first of them was to define the shield to be used, making several measures with different shields according to the available materials, opting finally for a shield composed of bricks of lead (10 cm thickness), plates of iron (4 mm thickness) and of aluminum (2 mm thickness). Four different geometries for the samples recipients were tested, and the Marinelli beaker of 2, 1 liters totally filled was the one which supplied the best peak/background ratio. A statistical inference was also realized to determine the sampling that represents {{each one of the}} lots of milk to be measured, resulting in a number of 6 samples, for a confidence level of 95 %. Two different kinds of powdered milk produced at Londrina were analyzed, Integral Powdered Milk Cativa and Integral Powdered Milk Polly. The samples were properly put in the Marinelli beaker of 2, 1 L, sealed and kept for 40 days to reach the secular equilibrium. The counting time for each measurement was two days. It was possible to identify the radionuclides 40 K, 137 Cs and 232 Th (from 208 Tl), whose activities were calculated according to the International Atomic Energy Agency norms (IAEA, 1989). The detector efficiency was measured using calibrated samples, prepared with the certified reference materials IAEA- 326 and IAEA- 375. Corrections for self-absorption were accomplished, based on measures of samples with different densities. The results obtained for the powdered milk Cativa were: 464 ± 12 Bq/kg for 40 K, 3, 46 ± 1, 05 and 0, 46 ± 0, 16 Bq/kg for the minimum detectable activities of 137 Cs and 232 Th, respectively. For the milk Polly, the results were: 452 ± 10 Bq/kg for 40 K, 3, 19 ± 0, 63 and 0, 32 ± 0, 12 Bq/kg for the minimum detectable activities of 137 Cs and 232 Th, respectively. The statistical analyses performed checked the measurements repeatability by means of the Tukey?s average comparison test. A correlation analysis between standard deviations and the mean showed the absence of significant systematic deviation. Comparing the results obtained with literature, it was demonstrated that the values of the activities found are within the normal levels of radioactivity for this kind of product and below the maximum permissible levels established by CNEN, that is, the analyzed milk can be normally consumed. On the other hand, the implemented methodology presented a good performance, faced to the available experimental conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of S, Cl, K and Ca along the profiles of two soils of different texture (Red Yellow Podzolic and Dark Red Latosol) treated with amounts of vinasse equivalent to 4000 m³/ha were studied using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence, observing {{a significant increase}} in the contents of these elements. The same effect was observed for Cu, Zn, Rb and Sr contents in soils treated with vinasse as compared to the control. The concentrations of Al, Si, Ti, Mn, Fe and Zr could also be evaluated but no significant variation was observed due to the high soil initial concentrations of these elements as compared to the low concentrations in the vinasse. Annular radioactive sources of Fe- 55 and Cd- 109 were employed for the excitation of these elements in the soil samples, treated or not with vinassse. For the detection of the characteristic X-rays, a Si (Li) semiconductor detector was used, coupled to a <b>multichannel</b> emulation <b>card</b> inserted in a microcomputer...|$|R

40|$|An eye safe, compact, {{solid state}} lidar for {{profiling}} atmospheric cloud and aerosol scattering has been demonstrated. The transmitter of the micropulse lidar is a diode pumped micro-J pulse energy, high repetition rate Nd:YLF laser. Eye safety is obtained through beam expansion.

Daytime background induced quantum noise is controlled by a narrow receiver field-of-view and a narrow bandwidth temperature controlled interference filter.

40|$|Abstract — The {{objective}} of this work is to design and implement wireless Multi Channel DAQ using FPGA. The method of implementing the proposed design is the system on-chip via {{field programmable gate array}} (SoC-FPGA) to reduce the hardware size and for memory size. Using this <b>multichannel</b> data acquisition <b>card</b> we can read upto eight process signals at a time. This project would be very much useful to read multiple process parameters like pollution in an industrial environment. The multichannel ADC transmits the process information to the microcontroller. We can also assign set point values for the process parameters and if the value of the parameter exceeds or goes below the set point value the display will indicate the same using annunciate. The VHDL code can be simulated to verify its functionality. Then gate level design equivalent will be synthesized targeting FPGA. The real physical design will be laid by place and route method. At least the soft-core design is down loaded into chip. Application software is used for Design Entry and Simulation.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} is to study low energy electron impact induced ionization and fragmentation of uracil. The apparatus consists of a pumped vacuum system with an expansion chamber, a collision chamber and a flight tube. A beam of uracil is generated in the expansion chamber, passes through a skimmer and crossed with a pulsed beam of low energy electrons in the collision chamber. The electron gun has a pulse width of 1 μs providing the necessary time of flight resolution and incorporates a deflection system for the steering of the beam. Positive ion fragments are mass resolved and detected using a reflectron time of flight mass spectrometer with a microchannel plate detecter. A <b>multichannel</b> scaler <b>card</b> is used for data acquisition. Code written in LabVIEW is used to control the electron impact energy and the acquisition of mass spectra {{as a function of}} electron impact energy. Ion yield curves for positive fragments are obtained from the mass spectra. Ion yield curves and appearance energies have been obtained from our data set and are in good agreement with results from previous research and other research groups. Partial ionization cross sections have been obtained by normalization of the sum of the ion yield curves to the average of calculated total ionization cross sections at 70 eV. These results provide new information about the fragmentation pathways initiated by electron impact and the cross sections for production of these ions. This research is relevant in the study of low energy secondary electron interactions within biological organisms. The aim of this research is to better understand the fundamental reaction mechanisms leading to DNA strand breaks. The experiment also includes the development and testing of a supersonic source using a 50 micron straight nozzle with argon gas acting as the buffer gas. The supersonic source will improve beam collimation and will enable formation of small nucleobase-water clusters when water vapour is introduced into the source...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} the Higgs boson and {{supersymmetry}} (SUSY) are the current goals of particle physics which {{the advent of the}} Large Hadron Collider (LHC) aims to address. The ATLAS detector is one of two general purpose detectors to fully exploit the LHC's potential. However the high energy and large particle multiplicities put stringent demands on the performance of the detector; the tracker. In order to extract the optimal performance from the tracker, the detector elements will be required to be aligned to O(10 #mu#m). The run-time alignment will be monitored by a combination of tracks and an alignment grid. The lengths of the alignment grid are measured by Frequency Scanning Interferometry (FSI). This is an interferometric technique capable of measuring distances to a precision of 1 #mu#m over I m. A low mass FSI interferometer, known as a grid line interferometer (GLI), is placed at the nodes of the alignment grid. But this design returns little light,O(pW). Avalanche photodiodes (APD) were proposed as low cost photodetectors capable of resolving 1 pW. This thesis follows the design of a low noise APD amplifier from initial conception to design and testing. Initial studies focused on measuring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and factors affecting its performance. The final evaluation involved taking FSI data with APDs from a GLI. The results show APDs do not degrade the performance and a 1. 5 m GLI was measured to 1 #mu#m precision. The APD amplifier design was extended to a <b>multichannel</b> DAQ <b>card</b> and its integration to the complete FSI DAQ architecture. The final chapter of this thesis is a study of a heavy SUSY mass (> 1 TeV) model. The initial study showed discovery of this model would be achieved after 4 months of low luminosity running.
