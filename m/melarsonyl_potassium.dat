40|$|The {{effects of}} the arsenical drug <b>melarsonyl</b> <b>potassium</b> on Onchocerca volvulus were {{investigated}} in patients in Cameroon infected with the Cameroon forest and Sudan savanna strains of the parasite. Two intramuscular dosage schedules were tested: the first comprised 4 consecutive daily doses of 200 mg repeated once after a 10 - 14 day interval, i. e., 2 (4 × 200 mg). The second was a single dose schedule at 7. 1 mg/kg— 10 mg/kg, with a maximum of 500 mg...|$|E
40|$|The antitrypanosomal drug melarsamine {{hydrochloride}} (MelCy) (trade name, Cymelarsan) is a melamino-phenylarsine made by conjugation of one {{equivalent of}} melarsen oxide and two equivalents of cysteamine. Immediately {{after it was}} dissolved in water, the compound was found to exist as an equilibrium mixture containing MelCy (43 %), MelCy which had lost one cysteamine moiety (MelCy - 1; 24 %), melarsen oxide (33 %), and free cysteamine. Small amounts (< 1 %) of the oxidation products derived from the last two components were also formed (cystamine and sodium melarsen). On incubation at room temperature, the MelCy content decreased steadily, with an associated increase in the melarsen oxide and sodium melarsen contents. After 5 days in solution at room temperature, 27 % of the arsenical agent was MelCy, 14 % was MelCy - 1, 42 % was melarsen oxide, and 17 % was sodium melarsen. Since H 2 O 2 production was detectable in MelCy or cysteamine solutions {{and the addition of}} small amounts of exogenous H 2 O 2 readily converted the trivalent melarsen oxide to the pentavalent sodium melarsen, it is hypothesized that the nonenzymatic conversion of cysteamine to cystamine produced H 2 O 2, which then oxidized melarsen oxide to sodium melarsen. Similar time course experiments showed that <b>melarsonyl</b> <b>potassium</b> and melarsoprol were more stable in solution...|$|E
40|$|Twelve new dithiaarsanes were {{evaluated}} for their in vitro and in vivo trypanocidal properties {{in regard to}} their three parent molecules, 4 -amino-phenylarsenoxide, melarsenoxide, and 4 -dansylamino-phenylarsenoxide. The most potent dithiaarsane, compound 2 b, had a minimum effective concentration of 1. 5 nM after 48 h of incubation and at a dose of 0. 39 μmol/kg of body weight (0. 2 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously cured 100 % of mice acutely infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei CMP. With this model, the chemotherapeutic index of compound 2 b was 512, compared to 256 for melarsamine dihydrochloride (Cymelarsan) under the same conditions. With a chronic infection produced by T. brucei brucei GVR, compound 2 b cured 100 % of mice after treatment at a dose of 25 μmol/kg (12. 5 mg/kg) for 4 consecutive days, whereas melarsamine dihydrochloride and <b>potassium</b> <b>melarsonyl</b> (Trimelarsan) cured less than 50 % mice at this dose. For both acute and late-stage infections, dithiaarsanes having a melaminophenyl ring exhibited the most-potent trypanocidal activity. Compound 2 b is thus {{one of the most}} active organoarsenicals described in a mouse trypanosomiasis model. Considering that the main intracellular targets of organoarsenicals are thiol groups, we studied the possibility of ligand exchange between Cymelarsan and several dithiols. In aqueous solution, we observed a rapid exchange of cysteamine from melarsamine with free cysteamine and also with various dithiols always in favor of more stable cyclic derivatives. These ligand exchanges suggest the ability of trivalent organoarsenicals to react with targets such as trypanothione and dihydrolipoic acid. Among several ligands, a 1, 3 -dimercaptopropane moiety appeared the most suitable for trypanocidal activity...|$|R
