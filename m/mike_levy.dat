40|$|A couple {{issues have}} been {{generating}} {{a great deal of}} media interest lately: continued coverage of the situation in Tibet, and the political views (and demonstrations) of Chinese students. Here are a few recommendations for further reading on those two topics: 1. We referenced this piece in an earlier posting, but just in case you didn’t make the jump that time, we wanted to urge you to do it again. China Digital Times hasthis fascinating translation of a Qinghua student’s description of what happened when several Public Security Bureau officers dropped by his group’s Carrefour protest planning meeting. 2. James Fallows blogged recently on a Beijing exhibit on Tibetan history as a window onto how Chinese are thinking about Tibet’s historical relationship to China. 3. For a look at how one group of students (members of Guizhou University’s Kurt Vonnegut book club) are struggling with their visions of China’s future, see <b>Mike</b> <b>Levy’s</b> piece at In These Times. 4. For a great summary of the events in Tibet, see Robert Barnett’s review of Pico Iyer’s new book in the New York Review of Books. 5. There are interesting quotes about the protests from Chinese students gathered by Monroe Price at HuffPost (and he links to Jeff Wasserstrom’s recent piece at The Nation’s blog near the end). 6. And finally, this commentary by Kerry Brown at opendemocracy makes the tongue-in-cheek argument that China’s recent bad news, from Tibet to the torch relay, will have the effect of lowering expectations for the Olympics—a correction Brown argues was much-needed...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{technology}} has become increasingly important in language teaching and learning. The successful use {{of technology}}, however, requires that language teachers have the necessary technical competence and pedagogical knowledge. The volume Teacher Education in CALL, edited by Philip Hubbard and <b>Mike</b> <b>Levy,</b> appears at a critical time when {{the issue of how}} to prepare current and future language teachers for effective {{use of technology}} in their profession is a serious and growing concern. As the editors point out in the introduction to the volume, “both pre-service and in-service language teachers will find themselves at a disadvantage if they are not adequately proficient in computer-assisted language learning ” (p. ix). Although the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has produced a set of guidelines to increase technological competence among teachers (ISTE, 2000), CALL teacher education presents a number of unique challenges and opportunities that have not yet been fully explored. For example, several chapters in the volume report that many teachers {{do not have access to}} solid professional development or lack institutional support, and that it is often unclear whether CALL training will lead to subsequent changes in teaching practice. It is also unclear what types of teacher education work best in which situations, and how teachers perceive and respond to different professional development opportunities that involve learning about and using technology...|$|E
40|$|CALL Dimensions: Options and Issues in Computer-Assisted Language Learning {{is based}} on a {{detailed}} analysis of a corpus of Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) works and papers. By creating a thesaurus of CALL descriptors, such as “design ” and “evaluation”, which are termed identifiers (p. 255) in the book, the authors, <b>Mike</b> <b>Levy</b> and Glenn Stockwell, are able to describe each corpus article and identify its areas of study. The frequencies of the identifiers ’ usage were then counted and the seven most frequently used identifiers (design, evaluation, computer-mediated communication (CMC), theory, research, practice, and technology) are used in the book as chapter titles, also called dimensions of CALL. This approach enables the authors to develop a presentation of the most-researched areas in CALL, based on published papers in the field. However, the field of CALL can never be perceived as a discipline consisting of separate constituent parts because of the multiple aspects that need to be taken into consideration when practicing or researching it. Therefore, discussing these identifiers, or dimensions, individually may be misleading for the formation of a complete picture of the field. For example, it is unrealistic to talk about CALL design (Chapter 2) without mentioning evaluation, CMC, second language acquisition (SLA) theory, or technology, because these are the factors that determine design choices and process. To cope with this problem, the last section of the book (Chapter 9, Integration, and Chapter 10...|$|E
