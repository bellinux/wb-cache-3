25|$|In {{suspension}} bridges, large <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> (normally two) hang {{between the}} towers and are anchored {{at each end}} to the ground. This {{can be difficult to}} implement when ground conditions are poor. The <b>main</b> <b>cables,</b> which are free to move on bearings in the towers, bear the load of the bridge deck. Before the deck is installed, the cables are under tension from their own weight. Along the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> smaller cables or rods connect to the bridge deck, which is lifted in sections. As this is done, the tension in the cables increases, as it does with the live load of traffic crossing the bridge. The tension on the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> is transferred to the ground at the anchorages and by downwards tug on the towers.|$|R
5000|$|In some {{contexts}} {{the term}} [...] "simple suspension bridge" [...] refers not {{to this type}} of bridge but rather to a suspended deck bridge that is [...] "simple" [...] in that its deck is not stiffened. [...] Although simple suspension bridges and [...] "simple" [...] suspended deck bridges are similar in many respects, they differ in their physics. On a simple suspension bridge, the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> (or chains) follow a hyperbolic curve, the catenary. This is because the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> are free hanging. In contrast, on a suspended deck bridge (whether [...] "simple" [...] or not) the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> follow a parabolic curve. This is because the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> are tied at uniform intervals to the bridge deck below (see suspension bridge curve). The differences between these two curves was a question of importance in the 17th century, worked on by Isaac Newton among others.|$|R

25|$|On a {{conventional}} suspension bridge, sections of deck are hung {{in place and}} so immediately tension the suspenders. The proper initial length of each suspender is predetermined by engineering calculations and adjustments are required for segment relative positioning and equality of load distribution amongst the several suspenders of the section. On this bridge, the deck sections were already in a fixed relative position (being joined together and resting upon the falsework) and all suspender cables must be brought to specific tensions individually in order to tension the <b>main</b> <b>cable.</b> A jacking saddle on the western end is used to balance the tension among the sections of the single <b>main</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2011, {{proper balance}} between <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> runs and {{suspender}} cables and proper tension {{were applied to}} the main and suspender cables. On November 20, 2012, this process was completed which made the SAS portion of the bridge self-supporting. After that, the falsework was removed.|$|E

50|$|A {{stressed}} {{ribbon bridge}} also has {{one or more}} catenary curves and a deck laid on the <b>main</b> <b>cables.</b> Unlike a simple suspension bridge however, a stressed ribbon bridge has a stiff deck, usually due to the addition of compression elements (concrete slabs) laid over the <b>main</b> <b>cables.</b> This stiffness allows the bridge to be much heavier, wider, and more stable.|$|R

25|$|The skyway and YBITS {{structures}} have custom lighting using 48,000 high-performance LEDs grouped in 1521 fixtures, most {{of which}} are mounted on 273 poles. These fixtures were designed by Moffatt & Nichol and built by Valmont Industries. Within a specific fixture the beam pattern of each LED is restricted by a masking structure. Each fixture has been adjusted independently and with the LED masking will illuminate the roadways only in the direction of travel, similar to the vehicles' headlights and therefore greatly reducing glare presented to drivers. This is expected to improve safety for travelers. The main span roadways are illuminated by downward-pointing LED fixtures mounted upon the <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> suspender saddles. Additional upward-facing decorative lighting at the extreme outboard edges of the roadways illuminate the suspender cables and the underside of the <b>main</b> <b>cable.</b> Additional lights highlight the main tower.|$|E
25|$|Working {{the entire}} day of May 19, 2011, {{operating}} engineers and ironworkers lifted and placed the 900,000 pound double cable saddle atop the SAS tower. While {{a large portion of}} the span was fabricated in China, this particular piece was made in Japan, as was the eastern and western deviation saddles and <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> hydraulic jacking saddle.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} cables curve and the {{suspender}} cables splay outward {{to the deck}} edge, the saddle design is individual to the location, being fabricated in mirror image pairs for each side. In mid-June 2012, most saddles were in place upon the <b>main</b> <b>cable.</b> Wire rope suspender cables were then draped over these saddles and later were pulled outward and attached to projections from the main deck.|$|E

25|$|Large devices called saddles, {{which will}} carry the <b>main</b> {{suspension}} <b>cables,</b> are positioned atop the towers. Typically of cast steel, {{they can also be}} manufactured using riveted forms, and are equipped with rollers to allow the <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> to shift under construction and normal loads.|$|R
25|$|The tower saddle {{includes}} eyebars for {{the attachment}} of temporary cables that supported four walkways, each a simple suspension bridge (called a catwalk) that allowed {{access to the}} cable spinning mechanism and the <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> during construction. In several ways similar to a ski lift, additional superior cables carried {{one or more of}} these travelers, wheeled devices that shuttled from one end of the span to the other, pulled by drafting cables manipulated by several winches.|$|E
25|$|While earlier {{bridges of}} this type use chain eyebars, the long span needed here uses wire cable, like other modern {{suspension}} bridges. Uniquely, this is a single loop of cable rather than the usual pair of cables, and, rather than being spun in place above the catwalks, substantial bundles of strands were dragged into place with temporary support above the catwalks, eventually suspended by tensioning the strand. These strand bundles were then arranged to be finally compacted to form the completed <b>main</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Work in September 2011 {{included}} {{the installation of}} the turning tracks for the travelers at the western deviation saddles. These tracks allowed the continuous motion of the traveler across the western end of the main span. By mid-October 2011, the traveler cables were installed. A temporary group of tower stay cables to the west, intended to resist the overturning forces imposed by the bare <b>main</b> <b>cable,</b> were also installed. Subsequently, the eastern deviation saddles were installed, preparing the bridge for cable placement.|$|E

25|$|In mid-June 2011, {{preparations}} for the spinning of the <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> began by installing the temporary catwalks on the SAS span. Both western catwalks were installed and by mid-August, all four catwalks were installed in place and an approximation of the completed outline of the bridge could then be seen. All four catwalks, the traveler, its suspension cable and the drafting cables and the winches and specialized tracks at the deviation saddles {{had to be in}} place before strand dragging could begin. These catwalks were required for worker's access to the cable strands for bundling and arrangement as the individual wires are placed.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{segments}} at {{each end}} are not simple repetitions of the central span segments. The extreme deck segments on the eastern end are curved and tilted to fair into the curved portion of the skyway. These extreme segments are also beyond the <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> strand anchors and the eastern support columns and {{a substantial portion of}} the bridge joining the skyway is already in place (the grey portion seen above). The extreme east bound deck segments on the western end must fair with the horizontal eastbound portion of the YBITS connector, while the westbound (north side) segments begin a rise to the westbound YBITS, elevating traffic to the upper deck of the Yerba Buena tunnel.|$|E
25|$|A {{cable-stayed}} bridge has {{one or more}} towers (or pylons), from which cables support the bridge deck. A distinctive feature are the cables which run directly from the tower to the deck, normally forming a fan-like pattern or a series of parallel lines. This {{is in contrast to}} the modern suspension bridge, where the cables supporting the deck are suspended vertically from the <b>main</b> <b>cable,</b> anchored {{at both ends of the}} bridge and running between the towers. The {{cable-stayed bridge}} is optimal for spans longer than cantilever bridges and shorter than suspension bridges. This is the range where cantilever bridges would rapidly grow heavier if the span were lengthened, while suspension bridge cabling would not be more economical if the span were shortened.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} cables must be anchored at {{each end}} of the bridge, since any load applied to the bridge is transformed into a tension in these <b>main</b> <b>cables.</b> The <b>main</b> <b>cables</b> continue beyond the pillars to deck-level supports, and further continue to connections with anchors in the ground. The roadway is supported by vertical suspender cables or rods, called hangers. In some circumstances, the towers may sit on a bluff or canyon edge where the road may proceed directly to the main span, otherwise the bridge will usually have two smaller spans, running between either pair of pillars and the highway, which may be supported by suspender cables or may use a truss bridge to make this connection. In the latter case there will be very little arc in the outboard <b>main</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{process to}} build the SAS tower atop its {{foundation}} consisted of five phases. The first four phases each consisted of lifting four similar columns and bolting them into place and to elements connecting them, while the last phase was to lift the final top cap that will carry the crowning <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> saddle. On July 28, 2010, {{the first of four}} below-deck main tower pillars was erected, having arrived earlier in the month by barge from China. They were placed by lifting one end from a barge into a temporary scaffold, with a carriage on the barge to allow the lower end to move into place. After the columns were bolted into place, the scaffolding was then extended upward to allow the next set of above deck columns to be erected, lifted, and translated into position, a process repeated for each of the remaining phases.|$|E
25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck mounting bosses to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. The bolts were tested in place by overtightening their retaining nuts. In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to hydrogen embrittlement, with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of the bolts can be replaced while others cannot be removed and load transfer will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location. It was suggested internally that issues with tensioning the <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> {{may have led to}} the bolt failures.|$|E
500|$|The cables were spun on-site using a reel {{because of}} the {{problems}} which had arisen using a bundle on the Great Belt Bridge in Denmark. This also allowed for cost savings, as the reels could be used two times. The cables were spun using air spinning with controlled tension, which allowed spinning with little space and with a crew with limited spinning experience. This involved installing a carrier which shuttles forward and back over the catwalk; it spins the upper side of the cable in the one direction and the lower side in the other direction. The system has two reel racks, each with four reels of wire. Each rack only uses one reel at a time, allowing for minimum down-time when changing reels. Wires were connected using pressure casing. The balance in the system is kept in place using a counterbalance tower. Spinning of the <b>main</b> <b>cable</b> started on 2 March 2000 and was concluded on 14 April. In all [...] of steel wire were used to create the cables. The two bridges were {{the first time that}} on-site spinning was chosen in Norway, and it gave a cost saving of NOK10 to 11 million.|$|E
50|$|To begin {{preparations}} for spinning the <b>main</b> <b>cables,</b> Roebling's Sons {{had set up}} a reeling plant on the Tacoma tideflats. 100000000 ft of galvanized steel wire - the total amount needed for both <b>main</b> <b>cables,</b> began arriving in 350 lb coils.
