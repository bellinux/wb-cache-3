30|$|They {{concluded}} that the <b>maximal</b> <b>subsidence</b> found in the specimens was mainly reversible or elastic and depended on the fixation technique with the locked plate group having a significantly higher <b>maximal</b> <b>subsidence.</b> The amount of irreversible or plastic deformation did not differ between the two fixation methods. The authors felt that this difference was {{due to a lack}} of interfragmentary compression in the locked plate group. In the locked plate group the meta-diaphyseal gap remained in the specimens. The authors also stated that the higher amount of reversible motion may be desirable because this micromotion may enhance fracture callus formation. It was {{concluded that}} the locked plates had similar amounts of plastic deformation compared to a dual plating construct with less soft tissue stripping and therefore might be a better construct in the treatment of these complex fractures.|$|E
30|$|The interferograms present good {{coherence}} and the fringes are relatively continuous because the spatiotemporal baselines used are short (Fig.  2 and Table  2). The coseismic deformation field of LOS {{obtained from the}} ascending track data (Fig.  2 a, c) presents a shape of a long flat oblate with the long axis trending to the NW with a <b>maximal</b> uplift and <b>subsidence</b> of 0.07 and 0.21  m, respectively. The deformation {{on both sides of}} the fault is asymmetric. However, the displacements are mainly concentrated on the west side of the fault, indicating that the fault is dipping to the west. The overall deformation pattern has a subsidence style with slight uplift in the south. The maximal deformation region of the coseismic field obtained from the descending track data is fundamentally consistent with that of the subsidence region obtained from the ascending track data. The deformation is mainly concentrated on the west side of the fault, and the <b>maximal</b> uplift and <b>subsidence</b> are 0.16 and 0.08  m, respectively. The dislocation characteristics obtained from the ascending and descending data have some discrepancies. This is mainly related to the imaging geometry of the satellite and the direction of the surface deformation.|$|R
40|$|To {{reconstruct}} femoral intramedullary bone-stock loss in revision surgery {{of failed}} total hip arthroplasties, morsellized trabecular bone grafts can be used. In 14 goats a noncemented hydroxyapatite-coated titanium stem was fixed within a circumferential construction of bone allografts. After 6 or 12 wk, four goats {{were used for}} mechanical tests and three for histology. The stability of the stems relative to the bone was determined in a loading experiment with Roentgenstereo-Photogrammatic Analysis (RSA). Owing to two loosenings and two fractures, only one 6 -wk specimen and three 12 -wk specimens were available for mechanical testing. The prostheses were very stable at 12 wk. The most important movements were axial rotation (maximal 0. 17 degrees at 800 N) and <b>subsidence</b> (<b>maximal</b> 0. 036 mm at 800 N). After unloading, there was 40 - 60 % elastic recovery. Histological examination showed revascularization and remodelling of the graft in all the specimens investigated. At the graft site, bone apposition and bone resorption had resulted {{in a mixture of}} graft and new bone. Bone incorporation was mainly seen in the proximal areas. Graft lysis was evident in the midshaft region and at distal levels around the prosthese...|$|R
