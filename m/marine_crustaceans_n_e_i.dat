40|$|SYNOPSIS. <b>Marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> {{present an}} {{extremely}} interesting set of examples {{in which to}} examine visual development and metamorphosis. Larvae of these an-imals are almost always planktonic, living in the light field of open waters. The presence of a simple, predictable photic environment, the relatively basic visual requirements of larvae, {{and the need to}} remain transparent to reduce predation lead to the use of a single eye type throughout all <b>marine</b> <b>crustacean</b> larvae. Adult crustaceans, on the other hand, use a greater diversity of optical designs than all other animals combined, occupy habitats from the deep sea to mountaintops, and have very complex visual systems and behaviors. Thus, visual development varies tremendously among modern Crustacea. In this brief review, we consider the structure and development of <b>marine</b> <b>crustacean</b> eyes, focusing on optics, retinal design, and metamorphosis of the visual pigments...|$|R

In most cases, it eats small fish or <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans.</b> Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill.

40|$|Selenoproteins (Sels) are {{involved}} in oxidative stress regulation. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase {{are among the most}} studied Sels in crustaceans. Since their expressions and activities are affected by pathogens, environmental and metabolic factors, their functions might be key factors to orchestrate the redox cellular balance. The most studied invertebrate selenoproteome is from Drosophila. In this fly, SelD and SelB {{are involved}} in selenoproteins synthesis, whereas SelBthD, SelH and SelK are associated with embryogenesis and animal viability. None of the Sels found in Drosophila have been identified in <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> yet, and their discovery and function identification is an interesting research challenge. SelM has been identified in crustaceans and is differentially expressed in tissues, while its function remains to be clarified. SelW and G-rich Sel were recently discovered in <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> and their functions are yet to be clearly defined. To fully understand the crustacean selenoproteome, it is still necessary to identify important Sels such as the SelD, SelBthD and SelB homologs.

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} the current {{knowledge}} about the usage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins as energy source by <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> during starvation. Crustaceans are a large and diverse group including some economically important species. The efforts to culture them for human consumption has prompted the interest to understand the preferences of energy sources to be applied for feed formulation and cost reduction. Important differences have been found among species and appear to be related {{not only to the}} biochemistry and physiology of nutrition, but also to the living environment of the crustaceans. Furthermore, crustaceans undergo morphological, physiological and behavioral changes due to their natural growing process that affect their feeding habits, an aspect that should be carefully considered. We discuss the current information on <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> about energy usage and describe areas of future research, where starvation studies render important insights...|$|R

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> to ocean acidification is poorly understood, {{but can be}} assessed by combining data from physiological and ecological studies. The species most at risk are exclusively marine and have limited physiological capacities to adjust to environmental change. They are poor iono- and osmoregulators and have limited abilities to compensate for acidâ��base disturbances. The problems are compounded in slow-moving, relatively inactive species because they have low circulating protein levels and low buffering capacities. Species living in low-energy environments, such as deep-sea and polar habitats, are particularly vulnerable, because they are metabolically limited with respect to environmental change. Elevated pCO 2 levels in seawater, such as those predicted for the year 2300, {{are known to have}} diverse effects on calcification rate, little effect on egg production and a negative effect on growth rate and moulting frequency in <b>marine</b> <b>crustacean</b> species. At these levels, embryonic development is negatively impacted, but larval and juvenile stages {{do not appear to be}} affected, unless the changes in pCO 2 are accompanied by rising temperatures. Overall, <b>marine</b> <b>crustaceans</b> are broadly tolerant to the seawater pCO 2 levels expected by 2100 and 2300, but only in the medium-term (weeks) and only in the more adaptable species. The reductions in growth rate are of concern, as these changes could affect species survival, distribution and abundance. Studies are urgently needed to evaluate whether the patterns of vulnerability identified here in crustaceans will still be relevant after long-term (months) exposure to the relevant pCO 2 levels, in combination with changes in other environmental factors...|$|R
