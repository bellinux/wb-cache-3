50|$|The {{most closely}} related {{receptor}} to the 5-HT1E is the 5-HT1F receptor. They share 57% {{amino acid sequence}} homology and have some pharmacological characteristics in common. Both receptors are Gi-coupled (inhibit adenylate cyclase activity) and both receptors have high affinities for 5-HT and low affinities for 5-carboxyamidotryptaine and <b>mesulergine.</b> However, due to major differences in brain expression patterns, these receptors are unlikely to mediate similar functions in humans. For example, 5-HT1E receptors are abundant in the hippocampus but are not detectable in the striatum (caudate and putamen of the human brain), while {{the opposite is true}} for the 5-HT1F receptor. Thus, conclusions about the function of the 5-HT1E receptor cannot be ascribed to the function of the 5-HT1F receptor, and vice versa.|$|E
5000|$|Neutral antagonists (also {{known as}} silent antagonists) bind the {{receptor}} {{and have no}} intrinsic activity but will block the activity of agonists or inverse agonists. Inverse agonists inhibit the constitutive activity of the receptor, producing functional effects opposite to those of agonists (at the 5-HT7 receptor: ↓cAMP). Neutral antagonists and inverse agonists are typically referred to collectively as [...] "antagonists" [...] and, {{in the case of}} the 5-HT7 receptor, differentiation between neutral antagonists and inverse agonists is problematic due to differing levels inverse agonist efficacy between receptor splice variants. For instance, <b>mesulergine</b> and metergoline are reported to be neutral antagonists at the h5-HT7(a) and h5-HT7(d) receptor isoforms but these drugs display marked inverse agonist effects at the h5-HT7(b) splice variant.|$|E

Serum prolactin was substantially lowered in 10 women; two subsequently conceived and completed normal pregnancies. Twelve women stopped treatment due to side-effects, usually nausea and vomiting, or inadequate responses. The side-effects were generally similar to those on bromocriptine; in one patient they were better and in four worse than on bromocriptine. The male patients were more tolerant of <b>mesulergine,</b> and substantial falls in serum prolactin were seen with evidence of tumour shrinkage. Twenty-seven women with hyperprolactinaemia received pergolide; serum prolactin was lowered or normalized in 16. Side-effects necessitating cessation of treatment were similar to those seen with bromocriptine. Nevertheless, four women tolerated pergolide better than bromocriptine and two women adequately treated with <b>mesulergine</b> had previously been intolerant of pergolide. We conclude that both pergolide and <b>mesulergine</b> may be useful and effective drugs in the treatment of hyperprolactinaemia as alternatives to bromocriptine...|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} 5 -HT receptors mediating contraction and relaxation to 5 -HT in dog proximal stomach longitudinal muscle (LM) strips. Of the tryptamine analogues tested, 5 -HT {{was the most}} potent contractile agent at basal length, while 5 -CT was the most potent relaxant of PGF 2 α-induced contraction. Neither the contractions to 5 -HT, nor the relaxations to 5 -CT were influenced by tetrodotoxin, illustrating that action potential propagation is not involved. The 5 -HT-induced contraction was antagonized by <b>mesulergine</b> (0. 03 to 0. 3 [*]μM) and ketanserin (2 – 20 [*]nM), but the antagonism was not of a simple competitive nature, indicating multiple receptor involvement. Ketanserin (3 to 30 [*]nM) and <b>mesulergine</b> (30 [*]nM) competitively antagonized the α-Me- 5 -HT-induced contraction (pKB: 8. 83 ± 0. 09 and pA 2 : 8. 25 ± 0. 06 respectively).

The 5 -HT 2 antagonists {{ritanserin}} and ketanserin and the selective 5 -HT 3 antagonists ICS 205 - 930 and MDL 72222 {{had no effect}} on food intake. In contrast, the non-selective 5 -HT antagonists metergoline, methiothepin, <b>mesulergine,</b> mianserin and methysergide (all of which have high affinity for various 5 -HT 1 receptor subtypes), dose-dependently increased food intake during a 4 -h daytime test. Furthermore, metergoline dose dependently increased food intake over a 24 -h period. Surprisingly, <b>mesulergine</b> decreased food intake over a 24 -h period at the same doses that increased daytime food intake. This may indicate that the increase in daytime feeding produced by <b>mesulergine</b> is a non-specific response. Although the antagonists used have varying degrees of selectivity for 5 -HT receptor subtypes, the pattern of results suggests that postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 receptors (possibly of the 5 -HT 1 C type) {{play an important role in}} the control of feeding in rats...|$|E

40|$|Pharmacological {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} on isolated basilar arteries (BA) from the brain vasculature of guinea-pig and rat in order to characterize post-junctional serotonergic receptors mediating contraction {{by the use of}} selective agonists and antagonists. The sensitivity to 5 -HT was higher, but the intrinsic activity lower, in guinea-pig compared to rat vessels. The contractile potency of the 5 -HT 1 agonists, 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT), was three times higher than 5 -HT in guinea-pig but 16 times lower in rat BA. In arteries from both species the 5 -HT 1 A agonist, 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) -tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), only caused weak contraction. In rat BA, where the serotonergic contractile receptors are ketanserin-sensitive, <b>mesulergine</b> inhibited the contraction in doses high enough to block 5 -HT 2 receptors, and also propranolol slightly inhibited the contraction, probably due to its binding to these receptors. Methiothepin, a potent antagonist of the 5 -HT 1 -like receptors, affected the contraction in a non-competitive manner. The antagonist profile was different in guinea-pig BA: propranolol was ineffective, <b>mesulergine</b> caused a slight, non-surmountable inhibition, whereas methiothepin acted as a true, competitive antagonist. The data support previous suggestions that the serotonergic contraction in rat BA is mediated by 5 -HT 2 receptors, whereas the present data show that 5 -HT 1 -like receptors predominate in guinea-pig BA...|$|E
40|$|The {{superior}} temporal gyrus (STG) {{is strongly}} {{implicated in the}} pathophysiology of schizophrenia,particularly with regards to auditory hallucinations. In this study, using in situ quantitative autoradiography in postmortem tissue, we investigated the binding of the [3 H]ketanserin to 5 -HT 2 A receptors and [3 H] <b>mesulergine</b> to 5 -HT 2 C receptors in the left STG of 8 male schizophrenic patients compared to 8 control subjects. A strong [3 H]ketanserin binding was observed in the STG, however {{there was a very}} weak [3 H] <b>mesulergine</b> binding in the STG. A significant decrease in binding of [3 H]ketanserin was clearly observed in schizophrenia patients in comparison with control subjects. There were no significant correlations between 5 -HT 2 A binding density and age, postmortem intervals, or brain pH. These results suggest that the alterations of the 5 -HT 2 A receptors contribute to the pathophysiology of the STG in schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is a clear tendency for a positive correlation between 5 -HT 2 A and muscarinic M 1 receptor bindings, and for negative correlations between 5 -HT 2 A and GABAA receptor bindings and between muscarinic M 1 and GABAA receptor bindings. This provides a possible mechanism of auditory hallucinations through interactions between 5 -HT 2 A, acetylcholine muscarinic and GABA transmissions in the STG in schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Earlier autoradiographic {{studies with}} the 5 -HT 2 {{receptor}} agonist [125 I](±) DOI in human brain showed unexpected biphasic competition curves for various 5 -HT 2 A antagonists. We have performed similar studies in rat brain regions with selective 5 -HT 2 A (M 100907) and 5 -HT 2 C (SB 242084) antagonists together with ketanserin and <b>mesulergine.</b> The effect of GTP analogues on antagonist competition was also studied. Increasing concentrations of Gpp(NH) p or GTPγS {{resulted in a}} maximal inhibition of [125 I](±) DOI-specific binding of approximately 50 %. M 100907 competed biphasically in all regions. In the presence of 100 μM Gpp(NH) p, M 100907 still displaced biphasically the remaining [125 I](±) DOI binding. Ketanserin showed biphasic curves in some regions and monophasic curves in others. In the latter, Gpp(NH) p evidenced an additional high-affinity site. SB 242084 competed biphasically in brainstem nuclei and monophasically in the other regions. In most areas, SB 242084 affinities were not notably altered by Gpp(NH) p. <b>Mesulergine</b> competed monophasically in all regions without alteration by Gpp(NH) p. These results conform with the extended ternary complex model of receptor action: receptor exists as an equilibrium of multiple conformations, i. e. ground (R), partly activated (R*) and activated G-protein-coupled (R*G) conformation/s.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the 5 -HT receptors involved in the 5 -HT-induced contraction of longitudinal muscle (LM) strips of porcine proximal stomach. This was done in a classical organ bath set-up for isotonic measurement. The concentration-contraction curve to 5 -HT was not modified by 5 -HT 3 and 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonism. Methysergide, ketanserin and <b>mesulergine</b> antagonized the curve to 5 -HT. Concomitantly, increasing concentrations of ketanserin and <b>mesulergine</b> progressively revealed a biphasic nature of the 5 -HT curve. Ketanserin antagonized the low-affinity receptor while it did not modify the high-affinity receptor. Tetrodotoxin did not influence the concentration-contraction curve to 5 -HT neither in the absence nor presence of ketanserin, indicating that nerves are not involved. Ketanserin competitively antagonized the monophasic concentration-response curve to α-Methyl- 5 -HT, yielding a Schild slope that was not significantly different from unity. After constraining the Schild slope to unity, a pKB estimate of 8. 23 ± 0. 90 was obtained. This affinity estimate of ketanserin closely approximates previously reported affinities at 5 -HT 2 A receptors. In the presence of ketanserin (0. 1 μM; exposing the high-affinity receptor), a wide range of 5 -HT receptor antagonists covering all 5 -HT receptors known, was tested. Only methysergide and ritanserin inhibited the response to 5 -HT, thus expressing affinity for the high-affinity receptor. This did not reveal the identity of the receptor involved. It can be concluded that 5 -HT induces pig proximal stomach (LM) contraction via 5 -HT 2 A receptors located on smooth muscle. A ketanserin-insensitive phase of contractions could not be characterized between the actually known classes of 5 -HT receptors with the pharmacological tools that were used...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} {{profile of the}} long form of the human cloned 5 -HT 7 receptor (designated h 5 -HT 7 (a)) was investigated using a number of 5 -HT receptor agonists and antagonists and compared with its binding profile. Receptor function was measured using adenylyl cyclase activity in washed membranes from HEK 293 cells stably expressing the recombinant h 5 -HT 7 (a) receptor. The receptor binding profile, determined by competition with [3 H]- 5 -CT, was consistent with that previously reported for the h 5 -HT 7 (a) receptor. The selective 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonist SB- 258719 ((R) - 3,N-Dimethyl-N-[1 -methyl- 3 -(4 -methylpiperidin- 1 -yl) propyl]benzene sulfonamide) displayed high affinity (pKi[*] 7. 5) for the receptor. In the adenylyl cyclase functional assay, 5 -CT and 8 -OH-DPAT were both full agonists compared to 5 -HT and the rank order of potency for agonists (5 -CT> 5 -HT> 8 -OH-DPAT) was the same in functional and binding studies. Risperidone, methiothepin, <b>mesulergine,</b> clozapine, olanzapine, ketanserin and SB- 258719 antagonised surmountably 5 -CT-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Schild analysis of the antagonism by SB- 258719 gave a pA 2 of 7. 2 ± 0. 2 and slope {{not significantly different from}} 1, consistent with competitive antagonism. The same antagonists also inhibited basal adenylyl cyclase activity with a rank order of potency in agreement with those for antagonist potency and binding affinity. Both SB- 258719 and <b>mesulergine</b> displayed apparent partial inverse agonist profiles compared to the other antagonists tested. These inhibitory effects of antagonists appear to be 5 -HT 7 receptor-mediated and to reflect inverse agonism.

In one patient there was evidence of spontaneous pituitary infarction unrelated to dopamine agonist therapy. At operation 12 patients had apparently functionless pituitary adenomas which failed to immunostain for prolactin, one had an epidermoid cyst and one a Rathke's pouch cyst.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the tachycardic response to 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in the spinal-transected cat is mediated by ‘ 5 -HT 1 -like' receptors since this effect, being mimicked by 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT), is not modified by ketanserin or MDL 72222, but it is blocked by methiothepin, methysergide or <b>mesulergine.</b> The present study was set out to reanalyse this suggestion in terms of the IUPHAR 5 -HT receptor classification schemes proposed in 1994 and 1996. Intravenous (i. v.) bolus injections of the tryptamine derivatives, 5 -CT (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), 5 -HT (3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and 5 -methoxytryptamine (3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) as well as the atypical antipsychotic drug, clozapine (1000 and 3000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) resulted in dose-dependent increases in heart rate, with a rank order of agonist potency of 5 -CT >> 5 -HT > 5 -methoxytryptamine >> clozapine. The tachycardic effects of 5 -HT and 5 -methoxytryptamine were dose-dependently antagonized by i. v. administration of lisuride (30 and 100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), ergotamine (100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or <b>mesulergine</b> (100, 300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1); the highest doses of these antagonists used also blocked the tachycardic effects of 5 -CT. Clozapine (1000 and 3000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) did not affect the 5 -HT-induced tachycardia, but attenuated, with its highest dose, the responses to 5 -methoxytryptamine and 5 -CT. However, these doses of clozapine as well as the high doses of ergotamine (300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and <b>mesulergine</b> (300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) also attenuated the tachycardic effects of isoprenaline. In contrast, 5 -HT-, 5 -methoxytryptamine- and 5 -CT-induced tachycardia were not significantly modified after i. v. administration of physiological saline (0. 1 and 0. 3 [*]ml[*]kg− 1), the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor antagonist, GR 127935 (500 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or the 5 -HT 3 / 4 receptor antagonist, tropisetron (3000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1). Intravenous injections of the 5 -HT 1 receptor agonists, sumatriptan (30, 100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and indorenate (300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or the 5 -HT 4 receptor (partial) agonist cisapride (300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) were devoid of effects on feline heart rate per se and failed to modify significantly 5 -HT-induced tachycardic responses. Based upon the above rank order of agonist potency, the failure of sumatriptan, indorenate or cisapride to produce cardioacceleration and the blockade by a series of drugs showing high affinity for the cloned 5 -ht 7 receptor, the present results indicate that the 5 -HT receptor mediating tachycardia in the cat is operationally similar to other putative 5 -HT 7 receptors mediating vascular and non-vascular responses (e. g. relaxation of the rabbit femoral vein, canine external carotid and coronary arteries, rat systemic vasculature and guinea-pig ileum). Since these responses represent functional correlates of the 5 -ht 7 gene product, the 5 -HT 7 receptor appellation is reinforced. Therefore, the present experimental model, which is not complicated by the presence of other 5 -HT receptors, can be utilized to characterize and develop new drugs with potential agonist and antagonist properties at functional 5 -HT 7 receptors...|$|E

Competition experiments with (±) -[3 H] 1 -(4 -bromo- 2, 5 -dimethoxyphenil) - 2 -aminopropane [(±) -[3 H]DOB] were also performed in membranes from Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOFA 4) expressing cloned human 5 -HT 2 A receptors. In both systems, ketanserin and MDL 100, 907 displayed biphasic competition profiles, whereas SB 242084 and <b>mesulergine</b> competed monophasically. In absence of antagonist, 100 μM Gpp(NH) p decreased brain (±) -[125 I]DOI specific binding by 40 to 50 % and (±) -[3 H]DOB specific binding to CHOFA 4 cells by 30 %. The remaining agonist-labeled uncoupled sites were still displaced biphasically by ketanserin and MDL 100, 907, with unaltered affinities. Saturation experiments were performed in CHOFA 4 cells. (±) -[3 H]DOB labeled two sites (Kdn = 0. 8 nM, Kd 1 = 31. 22 nM). Addition of 100 μM Gpp(NH) p resulted in a single low-affinity (Kd = 24. 44 nM) site with unchanged Bmax. [3 H] 5 -HT showed no specific binding to 5 -HT 2 A receptors. These results conform with the extended ternary complex model of receptor action that postulates the existence of partly activated receptor conformation(s) (R*) in equilibrium with the ground (R) and the activated G protein-coupled (R*G) conformations. Thus, both in human brain and CHOFA 4 cells, the agonists possibly label all three conformations and ketanserin and MDL 100, 907 recognize with different affinities {{at least two of}} these conformations.

Receptor binding parameters in temporal cortex homogenates were assessed using [3 H] 5 -HT in the presence of 100 nM 8 -OH-DPAT, 1 microM propranolol and 1 microM <b>mesulergine</b> to prevent labelling of the 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 1 C sites, respectively. Under these conditions, [3 H] 5 -HT apparently bound to a class of high affinity (Kd = 5. 0 +/- 1. 0 nM) low capacity (Bmax = 96 +/- 23 fmol/mg protein) sites. In competition experiments, 5 -HT and 5 -carboxyamidotryptamine (5 -CT), as well as ergotamine, lysergic acid, sumatriptan and RU- 24969 exhibited high affinity for these sites. This pharmacological profile is concordant with the ligand selectivity pattern reported for 5 -HT 1 D receptors in other species and thus provides further evidence for its existence in human temporal cortex. In addition, the competition profile of some ligands, particularly of unlabelled 5 -HT, 5 -CT and ergotamine, revealed the existence of a lower affinity binding site. The latter suggests receptor heterogeneity or the presence of a lower affinity state of 5 -HT 1 D receptors...|$|E

The following substances acted as agonists, with the order of potency: 5 -HT > dl-alpha-methyl- 5 -hydroxytryptamine = 5 -carboxamidotryptamine > quipazine > 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(dl-n-propylamino) tetralin. dl-Propranolol, <b>mesulergine</b> and mianserin acted as competitive, methysergide, 6 -methyl- 1 -(1 -methylethyl) -ergoline- 8 beta-carboxylic acid 2 -hydroxy- 1 -methylpropyl ester and sumatriptan as non-competitive, and ritanserin acted as both a competitive and non-competitive antagonist of the 5 -HT-induced relaxation. Neither the 5 -HT 2 antagonists ketanserin and spiperone nor the 5 -HT 3 antagonist 1 alpha-H, 3 alpha, 5 alpha-H-tropan- 3 -yl, 3, 5 -dichlorbenzoate affected the 5 -HT-induced relaxation. The pEC 50 values of the agonists and the pA 2 and pAh values of the antagonists correlated strongly with pKD values at the 5 -HT 1 C binding site.

40|$|Much {{interest}} {{is currently being}} directed towards serotonin (5 -HT) receptors of type 2 C (5 -HT 2 C) because of their possible involvement in the control of different activities, such as {{the composition of the}} cerebrospinal fluid, locomotion, feeding, neuronal excitability and anxiety. The limited information regarding their distribution in the human brain prompted us to investigate, and to characterize the binding of [H- 3]mesulergine, a HT 2 C antagonist, in autopsy samples from 24 subjects. The results showed that the [H- 3]mesulergine binding represented 95 % of the total binding and equilibrium saturation binding experiments resulted in a single straight line, consistent with the presence of one site only. The area with the highest density of [H- 3]mesulergine binding was the choroid plexus, followed at a significantly lower level by the hippocampus, substantia nigra, basal ganglia, amygdala, hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex. The pharmacological profile of the [H- 3]mesulergine binding was consistent with that of 5 -HT 2 C receptors, since the most effective displacers were ritanserin, <b>mesulergine</b> and mianserine, followed by clozapine, ketanserine and III-CPP, while other compounds had a negligible or no effect. These findings, showing a wide distribution of [H- 3]mesulergine binding sites in the human brain, could provide anatomical bases for the different functions attributable to 5 -HT 2 C receptors in humans.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the possibility that the}} synthesis/accumulation of neurosteroids, i. e., brain-produced steroids putatively endowed with modulatory actions in the CNS, is regulated by monoaminergic receptor-mediated mechanisms. In minces of rat brain cortex, L-ascorbic acid concentration-dependently (0. 07 - 1. 0 mM) increases the levels of pregnenolone, allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. This effect of L-ascorbic acid is region-dependent: in hippocampus, progesterone and allopregnanolone are also increased, whereas dehydroepiandrosterone is unchanged, and in corpus striatum only progesterone is increased significantly. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (10 microM), 1 -(3 -chlorophenyl) piperazine (1. 0 microM), and 5 -methoxytryptamine (0. 4 microM) mimic the effect of L-ascorbic acid, whereas a pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (400 mg/kg i. p., 2 days) reduces the amplitude of the L-ascorbic acid effect on brain cortical neurosteroids. The effect of L-ascorbic acid is blocked by the nonselective serotonin antagonists methiothepin, clozapine, methysergide, and pizotifen, but not <b>mesulergine,</b> spiperone, MDL 72222, and DL-propranolol, nor by the catecholaminergic receptor antagonists prazosin and S(-) -sulpiride. L-Ascorbic acid is not additive with dibutyryl-cyclic AMP and, furthermore, the inhibition of adenylate cyclase by MDL 12330 A, but not of phospholipase C by U- 73122, markedly attenuates the L-ascorbic acid-induced increase of pregnenolone in rat brain cortical minces.

40|$|The {{serotonin}} 2 (5 -HT 2) receptor antagonists, MCI- 9042 (Anplag®) and ketanserin, {{have been}} shown to lower intraocular pressure in rabbits (1) and humans (2). The mechanism of action of these drugs has not been determined, but it is hypothesized that 5 -HT 2 receptors, and possibly α-adrenergic receptors, (3) may regulate in part aqueous humor production via an intracellular signal transduction pathway in the ciliary body. We therefore examined whether 5 -HT 2 receptors were coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis in an organ culture system of isolated bovine ciliary epithelium. 5 -HT stimulated [3 H]inositol phosphates ([3 H]InsPs) accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum increase approximately twice over the basal level. The mean EC 50 value was 1. 1 μM, which was calculated from four dose-response curves. The 5 -HT stimulated accumulation of [3 H]InsPs was inhibited by spiperone (5 -HT 2 A/ 1 A and dopamine 2 (D 2) antagonists), M- 1 (a major metabolite of MCI- 9042), ketanserin (5 -HT 2 A antagonist), SB- 206553 (5 - HT 2 B/ 2 C antagonist), and <b>mesulergine</b> (5 -HT 2 C antagonist and D 2 agonist).

40|$|The {{vasodilator}} {{effects of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{in the external}} carotid bed of anaesthetized dogs with intact sympathetic tone are mediated by prejunctional sympatho-inhibitory 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptors and postjunctional 5 -HT receptors. The prejunctional vasodilator mechanism is abolished after vagosympathectomy which results in the reversal of the vasodilator effect to vasoconstriction. The blockade of this vasoconstrictor effect of 5 -HT with the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor antagonist, GR 127935, unmasks a dose-dependent vasodilator effect of 5 -HT, but not of sumatriptan. Therefore, the present study set out to analyse the pharmacological profile of this postjunctional vasodilator 5 -HT receptor in the external carotid bed of vagosympathectomized dogs pretreated with GR 127935 (20 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.). One-minute intracarotid (i. c.) infusions of 5 -HT (0. 330 [*]μg[*]min− 1), 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT; 0. 010. 3 [*]μg[*]min− 1), 5 -methoxytryptamine (1100 [*]μg[*]min− 1) and lisuride (31000 [*]μg[*]min− 1) resulted in dose-dependent increases in external carotid blood flow (without changes in blood pressure or heart rate) with a rank order of agonist potency of 5 -CT>> 5 -HT⩾ 5 -methoxytryptamine>lisuride, whereas cisapride (1001000 [*]μg[*]min− 1, i. c.) was practically inactive. Interestingly, lisuride (mean dose of 85 ± 7 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. c.), but not cisapride (mean dose of 67 ± 7 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. c.), specifically abolished the responses induced by 5 -HT, 5 -CT and 5 -methoxytryptamine, suggesting that a common site of action may be involved. In contrast, 1 [*]min i. c. infusions of 8 -OH-DPAT (33000 [*]μg[*]min− 1) produced dose-dependent decreases, not increases, in external carotid blood flow and failed to antagonize (mean dose of 200 ± 33 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. c.) the agonist-induced vasodilator responses. The external carotid vasodilator responses to 5 -HT, 5 -CT and 5 -methoxytryptamine were not modified by intravenous (i. v.) pretreatment with either saline, (±) -pindolol (4 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or ritanserin (100  μg kg− 1) plus granisetron (300  μg kg− 1), but were dose-dependently blocked by i. v. administration of methiothepin (10 and 30  μg kg− 1, given after ritanserin plus granisetron), <b>mesulergine</b> (10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), metergoline (1 and 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), methysergide (1 and 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or clozapine (0. 3 and 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). Nevertheless, the blockade of the above responses, not significant after treatment with the lower of the two doses of metergoline and <b>mesulergine,</b> was nonspecific after administration of the higher of the two doses of methysergide and clozapine.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of sumatriptan on coronary flow was examined before and after two different forms of endothelial ablation in guinea-pig isolated hearts. The mechanism was assessed {{in terms of the}} influence of the integrity of the coronary endothelium, the role of release of nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium, and the receptor subtypes mediating the effects. Continuous perfusion with sumatriptan reduced coronary flow, but the concentration-response curve was v-shaped. Sumatriptan (0. 001 – 0. 1 [*]μM) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in coronary flow with the maximum effect achieved at 0. 23 ± 0. 04 [*]μM. The pEC 50 was 8. 49 ± 0. 07. At higher concentrations (0. 1 – 10 [*]μM) there was a concentration-dependent diminution of the vasoconstrictor effect. Endothelial ablation by saponin removed the diminution in the vasoconstrictor effect. In contrast, pretreatment with NG-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (100 [*]μM, 45 [*]min perfusion) did not affect it. This was despite both saponin and L-NAME being effective in reducing basal release of NO into the coronary effluent (measured by chemiluminescence) to the same extent (71 ± 3 and 73 ± 2 %, respectively). GR 127935, a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine 1 D (5 -HT 1 D) receptor antagonist (3 and 10 [*]nM), which by itself had no effect on coronary flow or NO release, antagonized the vasoconstrictor response to sumatriptan and unmasked a sumatriptan-induced concentration-dependent increase in coronary flow and NO release. These increases in coronary flow and NO release were abolished by pretreatment with either saponin or L-NAME. <b>Mesulergine,</b> a 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist which had no effect by itself on basal coronary flow or NO release, inhibited the vasodilator response to sumatriptan that occurred in the presence of GR 127935, and actually enhanced the vasoconstrictor response, increasing the maximum fall in coronary flow from − 3. 9 ± 0. 4 to − 5. 2 ± 0. 4 [*]ml[*]min− 1 [*]g− 1 (P< 0. 05). The diminution of vasoconstrictor effect of sumatriptan was abolished by <b>mesulergine</b> and by pretreatment with saponin, but not by L-NAME. In conclusion, guinea-pig coronary arteries constrict to low concentrations of sumatriptan, causing a reduction in coronary flow. This effect appears to be caused by 5 -HT 1 D agonism with the receptors located on the coronary vascular smooth muscle. With higher concentrations of sumatriptan this is partially offset by a weaker vasodilator effect, which is caused by low affinity 5 -HT 2 agonism. Although this effect is endothelium-dependent, it is not caused by the release of NO. Interestingly, when the vasoconstrictor effect of sumatriptan was inhibited by the 5 -HT 1 D antagonist GR 127935, a high affinity vasodilator effect of sumatriptan was unmasked. This is 5 -HT 2 receptor mediated and is caused by release of NO from the coronary endothelium. In man, sumatriptan and 5 -HT may both be capable of causing pathogenic coronary vasoconstriction. The implications of the present data are that the scope for this may depend greatly on (i) the extent of underlying endothelial dysfunction, (ii) the extent of endothelial 5 -HT 2 receptor-mediated release of vasodilator autacoids (which include NO) and (iii) the extent of smooth muscle 5 -HT 1 D receptor-mediated vasoconstriction...|$|E

All h 5 -HT 7 splice variants elevated basal and forskolin-stimulated AC. The basal AC activity was reduced by the 5 -HT 7 antagonist methiothepin and this effect was blocked by <b>mesulergine</b> (neutral 5 -HT 7 antagonist) indicating that the inhibitory effect of methiothepin is inverse agonism at the 5 -HT 7 receptor. Receptor density correlated poorly with constitutive AC activity in stable clonal cell lines and transiently transfected cells. Mean constitutive AC activity {{as a percentage of}} forskolin-stimulated AC was significantly higher for the h 5 -HT 7 (b) splice variant compared to the h 5 -HT 7 (a) and h 5 -HT 7 (d) splice variants but only in stable cell lines.
