40|$|The <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> is {{a common}} law concept based on the {{proposition}} that a person’s income consists only of funds derived from external sources and that funds derived from internal sources are, therefore, not assessable for income tax purposes. The <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> is enjoyed by numerous entities within the Australian non-profit sector to access tax exemptions. The Ralph Report into taxation suggested a significant review and reformulation of the <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle.</b> However, following a recent Federal Court decision, the Commonwealth Government acted to preserve the <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> by legislative amendment. It is contended that any new taxation provisions prompted by the Ralph Report should not {{lose sight of the}} fact that mutual entities play a socially desirable role through charitable, sporting, recreational and community services...|$|E
40|$|Moral {{conflicts}} {{occur in}} theories that involve {{more than one}} principle. I examine basic {{ways of dealing with}} moral dilemmas in medical ethics and in ethics generally, and propose a different approach based on a principle I call the "mutuality principle". It is offered as an addition to Tom Beauchamp and James Childress' principlism. The principle calls for the mutual enhancement of basic moral values. After explaining the principle and its strengths, I test it by way of an examination of three responses—in the recent Festschrift for Dr Raanon Gillon—to a case involving parental refusal of a blood transfusion. The strongest response is the one that comes closest to the requirements of the <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> but yet falls short. I argue that the <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> provides an explicit future orientation in principlism and gives it greater moral coherence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{how the two}} fundamental principles in risk allocation, i. e., the <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> and the transfer principle, can be implemented in order to manage efficiently catastrophic risk. From a decomposition of the insurable loss into idiosyncratic and systemic components, we show that the systemic risk is first filtered through a participating policy with a variable premium based on the realized systemic loss, and then it is transferred through an insurance contract providing a coverage on the variable premium. This model is reconsidered to examine the financing of catastrophe risk with alternative risk transfer solutions. Group captives, offering participating policies, are shown to be market enhancing...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mutuality</b> is the <b>principle</b> of private, {{commercial}} insurance; individuals {{enter the}} pool for sharing losses, and pay {{according to the}} best estimate of the risk they bring with them. Solidarity is the sharing of losses with payment according to some other scheme; this is the principle of state social insurance; essential features of solidarity are comprehensiveness and compulsion. Private insurance {{is subject to the}} uberrima fides principle, or utmost good faith; each side declares all it knows about the risk. The Disability Discrimination Act requires insurers to justify disability {{discrimination on the basis of}} relevant information, acturial, statistical or medical, on which it is reasonable to rely. It could be very damaging to private insurance to abandon uberrima fides. However, although some genetic information is clearly useful to underwriters, other information may be so general as to be of little use. The way in which mortality rates are assessed is also explained...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{years after}} Canada’s Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples {{produced}} their landmark report, which named mutual recognition {{as the first}} principle required for a new relationship, Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission echoed the call for Aboriginal peoples and settler-Canadians alike to live mutuality. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal scholars throughout {{a wide range of}} fields, such as feminist theologies, postcolonial biblical studies, and political science, represent those who grapple with an intelligible articulation of mutuality as a lived social praxis. While mutuality is not a new concept, living it is a challenge, and a gap remains in the literature that provides a good theory about how mutual recognition is actually lived. My thesis is that Paul Ricœur’s ethical thought makes a contribution that helps respond to the call for mutual recognition as a fundamental element for better Indigenous - Settler relations in Canada. In particular, he offers to settler-Canadians a helpful approach to bridge the problem between adherence to <b>mutuality</b> in <b>principle</b> and a demonstrated a failure to live it with Aboriginal peoples. One area that provides evidence of such failure is a protectionist model as the basis for addressing the disproportional occurrence of trafficking in Aboriginal women and girls in Canada. The first aim of my thesis is to help settler-Canadians to distinguish between protection and mutuality as models for social action, and to differentiate their role in each. A second aim is to better understand mutuality and to ask how it offers a better alternative. A third aim is to respond to the question, “How is mutuality a lived praxis?” The point of addressing these three aims is to assist settler-Canadians in their own comprehension of mutuality. Further, this thesis helps to develop a view of mutual recognition between Aboriginal peoples and settler Canadians, and to identify a theological contribution. Finally, my hope is to indicate how mutual recognition in Canada might serve to assist practical social action to help end the problem of trafficking in Aboriginal women and girls. These goals will be explored first by defining in the Introduction the concepts of settler colonialism, Indigenous – Settler relations, and protection. In the first Chapter, the global reality of human trafficking, Canada’s implication in it, and a gap in Canada’s domestic response concerning Aboriginal women and girls will be exposed. The following chapter will discuss the question of protection as a form of power-over and suggest mutuality as an alternative to protection when addressing social injustice. Subsequent chapters will develop Paul Ricœur’s understanding of mutual recognition. Ricœur’s mediated self, as the basis for understanding mutual recognition, will open readers to a trajectory that leads to festive recognition. Festivity is the theological contribution Ricœur makes to understanding and living mutual recognition in its fullness. The view of mutual recognition examined in this thesis is evaluated in the concluding chapter, where a concrete initiative for human trafficking prevention is examined...|$|R
40|$|Sporting {{expertise}} is multidimensional and develops when an athlete interacts {{with a range}} of task and environmental constraints. Ecological dynamics is a suitable theoretical framework to understand these complex and dynamic interactions due to the importance placed on the person-environment <b>mutuality.</b> A key <b>principle</b> of ecological dynamics, when faced with the challenge of developing skilled performers, is the influence of task and environmental constraints on an athlete’s ability to become attuned to the affordances (opportunities for action) in a performance landscape. Athletes who are unreflectively responsive to a rich and diverse range of affordances will be better equipped to act skilfully in competition. Ecological psychologist James Gibson introduced the concept of affordances as ”the affordances of the environment are what it offers the animal” (e. g. a ball offers kicking, or a slow player offers a quick player running past, or a hard pitch offers sidestepping on). Recently several scholars have further developed Gibson’s concept of affordances, here we aim to combine these interpretations to propose that the variety of socio-cultural practices that exist in what Wittgenstein termed forms of life (e. g. behaviours and customs of our communities), can influence an athlete’s affordance responsiveness. Although recent conceptual interpretations make valuable contributions to the literature on affordances, little is known in the sport domain about how identifying a form of life can help sport padagogists to gain an understanding of how socio-cultural practices influence affordance responsiveness and sporting expertise. Understanding more about this important area can help sport padagogists to manipulate socio-cultural constraints to enhance the quality of skill and expertise acquisition in specific sports. Therefore the purpose of this presentation is to (1) provide a brief historical insight into why forms of life and the associated behaviours and customs may exist in sport performance and coaching. (2) Using examples from the sport of rugby league we discuss how recent interpretations of affordances can provide insights into how forms of life can affect an athlete’s skilled performance.

40|$|We {{examine how}} risk-sharing is {{impacted}} by asymmetric {{information on the}} probability dis-tribution of wealth. We define the optimal incentive compatible agreements in a simple two-agent model with two levels of wealth. When there is complete information on the probability of the dif-ferent outcomes, the resulting allocation satisfies the <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> (which states that every-one’s final wealth depends only upon the aggregate wealth of the economy). This is no longer true when agents have private information regarding their probability distribution of wealth. Asym-metry of information (i) makes ex-post equal sharing unsustainable between two low risk agents and (ii) induces exchanges when agents have the same realization of wealth...|$|E
40|$|In {{a static}} {{exchange}} economy, {{when all the}} endowments are issued as securities on a stock exchange, Pareto optimal allocations may be reached by trading options on the market index (see Breeden and Litzenberger (1978)). We extend this result {{when some of the}} risks cannot be exchanged on the market. Options on an appropriate index, which typically differs from the market index, depending on the correlation of the non-tradable risks with the exchanged securities, are still an appropriate tool to support a (constrained) efficient equilibrium. This suggests that the recent development of derivatives based on interest rates may be an efficient way to reach a Pareto optimal allocation of risks. <b>Mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> · Option · Market index. ...|$|E
40|$|All {{business}} {{depends on}} {{the environment in which}} it operates and the existence of suppliers, customers and owners. Collectively, these and other groups which interact with the organisation, and whose needs and concerns must be considered, are known as stakeholders. Most research on stakeholder relationships has focused on large, publicly-owned corporations, and little appeared to be known about identity, dynamics, motivation and operations of stakeholder relationships in small business. Stakeholder theory, although mainly focused on large publicly owned corporations, is also highly relevant for small business and is the focus of this study. Two research questions were developed; “Who are the stakeholders in Australian small business?” (RQ 1) and “How can relationships between Australian small business and stakeholders be defined?” (RQ 2). A multiple-case study approach, where the same process of investigation is repeated in each case, was used to facilitate the understanding of ‘who’ and ‘how’ of stakeholder relationships in context and to allow cross-case comparison, analytical generalisation and formulation of theory. Cases were purposively selected according to potential for yielding insights and understanding into the identity of stakeholders in Australian small business. The interviewees were the key decision maker of a small business with fewer than 20 employees. In six of the eight cases, the interviewee was the owner-manager of the business. All cases were located in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Data collection was by way of face-to-face, interviews that followed a semi-structured interview instrument. It was found that stakeholders of small business can be readily identified and typically include owner-managers, customers, employees, suppliers, family, community and government. These stakeholders can also be ranked and measured in terms of their salience (the combination of urgency, legitimacy and power). In small business, where the key decision maker is typically the owner-manager, the interests of the manager thus align that of the owner, putting into play a <b>mutuality</b> <b>principle</b> and encouraging responsiveness to stakeholders as a strategy to enhance financial performance. This sets small business apart from large business and therefore has implications for policy that aims to support the economically and socially important small business sector...|$|E
