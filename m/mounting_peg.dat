25|$|The {{frame is}} a single tube {{following}} the circumference of the front wheel, then diverting to a trailing wheel. A <b>mounting</b> <b>peg</b> is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any trail. A spoon brake is usually fitted on the fork crown, operated by a lever {{from one of the}} handlebars. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the headset. The saddle mounts on the frame less than 50cm (18in) behind the headset.|$|E
5000|$|A tilbury is a light, open, two-wheeled carriage, with {{or without}} a top, {{developed}} in the early 19th century by the London firm of Tilbury, coachbuilders in Mount Street (see also Stanhope (carriage)). A tilbury rig {{is little more than a}} single [...] "tilbury seat" [...] - the firm's characteristic spindle-backed seat with a curved padded backrest - [...] mounted over a raked luggage boot, and fitted with a dashboard and <b>mounting</b> <b>peg,</b> all on an elaborate suspension system of curved leaf springs above the single axle. The tilbury has large wheels for moving fast over rough roads. A tilbury is fast, light, sporty and dangerous: ...|$|E
5000|$|Mount Tom {{is a small}} peak, {{standing}} at 1357 feet, located {{in the town of}} Woodstock, Vermont. [...] It {{is a part of the}} Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. The peak has a multitude of hiking, running, and Nordic skiing trails, and has many sites dedicated to the national park. Standing in the middle of Woodstock, Vermont, the peak also is host to many annual town events, including the Road to the Pogue Race. Visible from the top are sights such as the village of Woodstock, the sister peak of <b>Mount</b> Tom (<b>Mount</b> <b>Peg),</b> the Ottauquechee River, Vermont Route 4A, and many neighboring mountains.|$|R

Three kinds of structures studied in recent year, the <b>mounting</b> of <b>pegs</b> on reinforcement, {{the use of}} lightweight brick to reduce {{the weight of the}} beams, and the use the light weight aggregate for bamboo concrete composite frame. All that experiments overcome some problems exist in using bamboo as environmental acceptance structures...|$|R
50|$|Like most of {{the other}} {{settlements}} on the west coast of Tasmania, Rosebery is a mining town. In 1893, prospector Tom McDonald discovered gold in alluvial wash, along with boulders of zinc-lead sulphide in dense rainforest on the slopes of <b>Mount</b> Black. McDonald <b>pegged</b> several claims {{in the name of the}} Rosebery Prospecting Association (named after Lord Rosebery), which later became the Rosebery Gold Mining Company. The South Rosebery Mining Company was formed soon after to mine the southern continuation of the orebody.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was common}} to provide several transoms, {{each with a}} {{different}} range of angles it would measure. Three transoms were common. In later instruments, separate transoms were switched in favour of a single transom with pegs to indicate the ends. These <b>pegs</b> <b>mounted</b> in one of several pairs of holes symmetrically located {{on either side of}} the transom. This provided the same capability with fewer parts. [...] The transom on Frisius' version had a sliding vane on the transom as an end point.|$|R
60|$|Never {{before in}} her life had <b>Peg</b> <b>mounted</b> a steed of any kind whatever. She knew the lady's {{position}} on horseback by sight, of course, but not by practice. To attempt it even with a side-saddle would have been impossible; but Elephant was barebacked. Fortunately he was fat and broad, and without a visible back-bone. Old Peg at once made up her mind, and, climbing the bank, scrambled {{on his back in}} gentleman's position. It was more comfortable than she had dared to hope.|$|R
50|$|A {{freelance}} newsreel cameraman and cinema projectionist, Vidor {{made his}} debut {{as a director}} in 1913 with The Grand Military Parade. In Hollywood from 1915, {{he worked as a}} screenwriter and as director of a series of six short juvenile-delinquency films for Judge Willis Brown before directing his first feature, The Turn in the Road, in 1919. A successful <b>mounting</b> of <b>Peg</b> o' My Heart in 1922 won him a long-term contract with Goldwyn Studios (later to be absorbed into MGM). Three years later he made The Big Parade, among the most acclaimed war films of the silent era, and a tremendous commercial success. This success established him as one of MGM's top studio directors for the next decade. In 1928, Vidor received his first Oscar nomination, for The Crowd, widely regarded as his masterpiece and one of the greatest American silent films. In the same year, he made the classic Show People, a comedy about the film industry starring Marion Davies (in which Vidor had a cameo as himself), and his much-loved screwball comedy The Patsy, which also starred Davies and was his last silent film.|$|R
40|$|Objective: There {{is limited}} {{information}} on compounded apixaban formulations for administration via enteral feeding tubes. This {{study was designed}} to identify a suitable apixaban suspension formulation that is easy to prepare in a pharmacy setting, is compatible with commonly used feeding tubes, and has a beyond-use date of 7 days. Methods: Apixaban suspensions were prepared from commercially available 5 -mg Eliquis tablets. Several vehicles and compounding methods were screened for ease of preparation, dosage accuracy, and tube compatibility. Two tubing types, polyurethane and polyvinyl chloride, with varying lengths and diameters, were included in the study. They were <b>mounted</b> on a <b>peg</b> board during evaluation to mimic the patient body position. A 7 -day stability study of the selected formulation was also conducted. Results:Vehicles containing 40...|$|R
5000|$|Riders usually pedal a {{few times}} for speed, and then perform various stunts often {{involving}} difficult and/or awkward stances on <b>pegs,</b> <b>mounted</b> to the axles of their front or back wheels. Pegs are aluminum or plastic tubes, which are bolted onto {{both sides of the}} front and back axles. When flatland riding first began, most riders would do one trick and then return to the pedals. However, by combining different body and bicycle positions into [...] "combos" [...] and [...] "linking" [...] them together, riders began to do several tricks in a row without stopping between each move. Flatland riding is now usually a combination of many different kinds of moves, often linked together non-stop as the rider goes through as many as 10-12 consecutive moves, and position/direction changes, before returning to the pedals.|$|R
25|$|The {{geographic}} Broken Hill, {{for which}} the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing <b>Mount</b> Gipps Station, <b>pegged</b> out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at {{the eve of the}} Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.|$|R
25|$|When {{a string}} is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves {{the air around}} it, {{producing}} sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes {{the character of the}} sound produced. A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion. A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning <b>pegs</b> <b>mounted</b> on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.|$|R
2500|$|A zither banjo {{usually has}} a closed back and sides with the drum body (usually metal) and skin {{tensioning}} system suspended inside the wooden rim/back, {{the neck and}} string tailpiece was mounted on the wooden outer rim, the short string usually led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning <b>peg</b> could be <b>mounted</b> on the <b>peg</b> head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three and so if 5 stringed had a redundant tuner. The banjos could also be somewhat easily converted over to a six-string banjo. British opera diva Adelina Patti advised Cammeyer that the zither-banjo might be popular with English audiences (it was invented there), and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. With his virtuoso playing, he helped show that banjos could make sophisticated music than normally played by blackface minstrels. He was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir Arthur Sullivan, who recommended that Cammeyer progress from arranging the music of others for banjo to composing his own music. (Supposedly unknown to Cammeyer, William Temlett had patented a seven-string closed back banjo in 1869, and was already marketing it as a [...] "zither-banjo.") ...|$|R
