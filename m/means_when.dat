5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs are portrayed by different <b>means.</b> <b>When</b> inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E
5|$|The eldest generational Avatar {{within a}} House is {{dominant}} {{and called the}} Prophet. He possesses blue blood, also called Vitae Divina. The next in line is the Ascendant Prince. Any additional Avatara within the House are Princes ranked by generation. Although Avatara form blood dynasties from father to son, House affiliations can be mixed within a dynasty. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies, the dynasty is ended. Most dynasties only last on average three generations, since typical Avatara can be killed by any <b>means.</b> <b>When</b> a dynasty ends, the first male child born {{elsewhere in the world}} with the most Avataric blood will be a new Prince starting a new dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{was also}} {{involved}} in a dispute between Wulfstan and Evesham Abbey over lands in Worcestershire as, after the Conquest, Urse acquired the lands of Azur, a kinsman of an earlier Bishop of Worcester, Beorhtheah. Azur had originally leased the lands from the diocese, but after Urse confiscated the lands, the sheriff did not return the lands to the bishop, and instead kept them for himself. The Worcester monk Hemming recorded {{the loss of the}} lands to Urse in Hemming's Cartulary, a cartulary written about 1095 recording lands and charters belonging to the diocese of Worcester. Hemmings' Cartulary mentions not just Azur's lands, but others at Acton Beauchamp, Clopton, and Redmarley as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse. After Abbot Æthelwig's death, Urse also acquired lands that Æthelwig had seized through less than legal <b>means,</b> <b>when</b> William I's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux, presided at the lawsuit brought to determine the ownership of the lands. Odo gave a number of the disputed estates to Urse {{during the course of the}} lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text <b>means,</b> <b>when</b> it was created, and in what circumstances. When they write, their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters they write, but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E
25|$|After {{the demise}} of his father Bhaktivinoda on 23 June 1914, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati {{relocated}} his Calcutta press to Mayapur and then to nearby Krishnanagar in the Nadia district. From there he continued publishing Bhaktivinoda's Sajjana-toshani, and completed the publication of Chaitanya Charitamrita. Soon after, his guru Gaurakishora Dasa Babaji also died. Without these two key sources of inspiration, and {{with the majority of}} Bhaktivinoda's followers being married and thus unable to pursue a strong missionary commitment, Bhaktisiddhanta found himself nearly alone with a mission that seemed far beyond his <b>means.</b> <b>When</b> a disciple suggested that Bhaktisiddhanta relocate to Calcutta to establish a center there, he was inspired by the suggestion and began preparing for its implementation.|$|E

That is what Pytheas <b>means</b> <b>when</b> he says that Thule is located at the place where the Arctic Circle is identical to the Tropic of Cancer. At that point, {{on the day of the}} Summer Solstice, the vertical rod of the gnōmōn casts a shadow extending in theory to the horizon over 360° as the sun does not set. Under the pole the Arctic Circle is identical to the Equator and the sun never sets but rises and falls on the horizon. The shadow of the gnōmōn winds perpetually around it.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011 {{scientists}} at Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Development ENEA deduced from the STURP results that {{the color of}} the Shroud image is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen, similar to the yellowing of the paper of ancient books. They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to ultraviolet light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other <b>means.</b> <b>When</b> subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.|$|E
25|$|Tree {{alignment}} {{problem is}} a NP-hard problem when we restrict its scoring mode and alphabet size, {{and it can be}} found an algorithm, which uses to find the optimized solution. However, there is an exponential relationship between its efficiency and the number of sequence, it <b>means</b> <b>when</b> the number of sequence is very large, the runtime before getting results is an enormous figure and it is unacceptable. Using star alignment is faster than tree alignment to get the approximate optimized solution. However, whatever the degree of multiple-sequence similarity is, the time complexity of star alignment has a proportional relationship with the square of sequence number and the square of the sequence average length. In usual, the sequence in MSA is so long that it is also inefficient or even unacceptable. Therefore, how to reduce the time complexity to linear is one of the core issues in the Tree alignment.|$|E

25|$|In September 2002, Michael Chabon {{was hired}} to rewrite. His draft had a younger Doc Ock, who becomes {{infatuated}} with Mary Jane. His mechanical limbs use endorphins to counteract the pain of being attached to his body, which he enjoys. When he injures two muggers on a date, this horrifies Mary Jane and in the resulting battle with Spider-Man his tentacles are fused together, and the fusion begins to kill him. In the script, Octavius is {{the creator of the}} genetically-altered spider from the first film, and gives Peter an antidote to remove his powers: this <b>means</b> <b>when</b> Octavius is dying with his tentacles, he wants to extract Spider-Man's spine to save himself. This leads to the alliance with Harry in the final film. Beforehand, Harry and the Daily Bugle put a $10million price on Spider-Man's head, causing the city's citizens to turn against him. Producer Avi Arad rejected the love triangle angle on Ock, and found Harry putting a price on Spider-Man's head unsubtle.|$|E
25|$|Most {{carnivorous}} plants live in habitats {{with high}} light, waterlogged soils, and extremely low soil nitrogen and phosphorus, producing the ecological impetus to derive nitrogen from an alternate source. High light environments {{allowed for the}} trade off between photosynthetic leaves and prey capturing traps that are photosynthetically inefficient. To compensate for photosynthetically inefficient material, the nutrients obtained through carnivory would need to increase photosynthesis by investing in more leaf mass, i.e. growing. This <b>means</b> <b>when</b> {{there is a shortage}} of nutrients and enough light and water, prey capture and digestion has the greatest impact on photosynthetic gains, favoring the evolution of plant adaptations which allowed for more effective and efficient carnivory. Due to the large amount of energy and resources allocated to carnivorous adaptations. i.e. the production of lures, digestive enzymes, modified leaf structures, and the decreased rate of photosynthesis over total leaf area, some authors argue that carnivory is an evolutionary last resort when nitrogen and phosphorus are limited in an ecosystem.|$|E
