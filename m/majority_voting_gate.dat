We {{present a}} Monte Carlo {{simulation}} of two implementations of Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) circuits: {{one based on}} simple ground state relaxation {{and the other on}} the clocked cell scheme that has recently been proposed by Tóth and Lent. We focus on the time-dependent behavior of two basic circuits, a binary wire and a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> <b>gate,</b> and assess their maximum operating speed and temperature requirements for different sets of fabrication parameters...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simulator}} for quantum cellular automaton (QCA) circuits, {{based on a}} semiclassical model and aimed at {{the determination of the}} error probability in the presence of thermal excitations. Di!erent methods are discussed; either a complete exploration of the con"guration space, or a partial exploration by means of simulated annealing. Results for the probability of obtaining the ground state and the correct logical output are derived and compared for a chain of cells, for a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> <b>gate</b> and for a simple combinatorial network. This approach can be extended to generic implementations of the QCA paradigm. Copyright? 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Directors have {{traditionally}} been elected by a plurality of the votes cast. This means that in uncontested elections, a candidate who receives even a single vote is elected. Proponents of "shareholder democracy" have advocated a shift to a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rule in which a candidate must receive a <b>majority</b> of the <b>votes</b> cast to be elected. Over the past decade, they have been successful, and the shift to <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> {{has been one of}} the most popular and successful governance reforms. Yet critics are skeptical as to whether <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> improves board accountability. Tellingly, directors of companies with <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rarely fail to receive majority approval - even more rarely than directors of companies with plurality voting. Even when such directors fail to receive majority approval, they are unlikely to be forced to leave the board. This poses a puzzle: why do firms switch to <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> and what effect does the switch have, if any, on director behavior? We empirically examine the adoption and impact of a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> rule using a sample of uncontested director elections from 2007 to 2013. We test and find partial support for four hypotheses that could explain why directors of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> firms so rarely fail to receive majority support: selection; deterrence/accountability; electioneering by firms; and restraint by shareholders. Our results further suggest that the reasons for and effects of adopting <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> may differ between early and later adopters. We find that early adopters of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> were more shareholder-responsive than other firms even before they adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting.</b> These firms seem to have adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> voluntarily, and the adoption of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> has made little difference in their responsiveness to shareholders responsiveness going forward. By contrast, for late adopters, we find no evidence that they were more shareholder-responsive than other firms before they adopted <b>majority</b> <b>voting,</b> but strong evidence that they became more responsive after adopting <b>majority</b> <b>voting.</b> Differences between early and late adopters can have important implications for understanding the spread of corporate governance reforms and evaluating their effects on firms. Reform advocates, rather than targeting the firms that, by their measures, are most in need of reform, instead seem to have targeted the firms that are already most responsive. They may then have used the widespread adoption of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> to create pressure on the nonadopting firms. Empirical studies of the effects of governance changes thus need to be sensitive to the possibility that early adopters and late adopters of reforms differ from each other and that the reforms may have different effects on these two groups of firms...|$|R

Sir John Hotham was {{invested}} with the full authority of both Houses of Parliament to retain the arsenal regardless of circumstance. King Charles wrote to Sir John informing him of his intentions to join his son James, Duke of York who was residing in Hull. After holding a meeting in Ye Olde White Hart Inn on 23 April 1642 it was decided by <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> that the <b>gates</b> of the city would be closed to the king. The king was furious and Sir John was dubbed a traitor. A siege of Hull by the king lasted for three weeks and although Sir John escaped to his manor at Scorborough {{he was arrested and}} taken to the Tower of London. The House of Commons ordered that money, plots of land and the goods belonging to Sir John be seized. In December 1644 he was tried and condemned to execution. Sir John's son, Captain Hotham, was also deemed guilty and executed. The estate was left to Captain Hotham's only son, also called John, aged 13. Like his grandfather, John became an MP for the local town of Beverley and went into exile in 1684 after the exclusion crisis. He returned with William of Orange in 1688 and was appointed the Governor of Hull in 1689. He died that year after becoming ill with a [...] "chill" [...] while travelling from Hull to Beverley. The Hotham family's estate is now in the nearby village of South Dalton.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Boosting is {{recognized}} as one of the most successful techniques for generating classifier ensembles. Typically, the classifier outputs are combined by the weighted <b>majority</b> <b>vote.</b> The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the advantages of some fuzzy combination methods for ensembles of classifiers designed by Boosting. We ran two-fold cross-validation experiments on six benchmark data sets to compare the fuzzy and nonfuzzy combi-nation methods. On the “fuzzy side ” we used the fuzzy integral and the decision templates with different similarity measures. On the “nonfuzzy side ” we tried the weighted <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> as well as simple combiners such as the <b>majority</b> <b>vote,</b> minimum, maximum, average, product, and the Naive–Bayes combination. In our experiments, the fuzzy combination methods performed consistently better than the nonfuzzy methods. The weighted <b>majority</b> <b>vote</b> showed a stable performance, though slightly inferior to the performance of the fuzzy combiners.

40|$|A robust {{character}} of combining diverse classifiers using a <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> {{has recently been}} illustrated in the pattern recognition literature. Furthermore, negatively correlated classifiers turned out to offer further improvement of the <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> performance even comparing to the idealised model with independent classifiers. However, negatively correlated classifiers represent a very unlikely situation in the real-world classification problems and their benefits usually remain out of reach. Nevertheless, it is theoretically possible to obtain 0 % <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> error using {{a finite number of}} classifiers at the error level lower than 50 %. We attempt to show that structuring classifiers into relevant multistage organisations can widen this boundary as well as the limits of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> error even more. Introducing discrete error distributions for analysis, we show how <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> errors and their limits depend on parameters of a multiple classifier system with hardened binary outputs (correct/incorrect). Moreover, we investigate sensitivity of boundary distributions of classifier outputs to small discrepancies modelled by the random changes of votes and propose new more stable patterns of boundary distributions. Finally, we show how organising classifiers into different structures can be used to widen the limits of <b>majority</b> <b>voting</b> errors and how this phenomenon can be effectively exploited...|$|R
