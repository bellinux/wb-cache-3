He is <b>mad</b> <b>that</b> Naomi told Jen about his past: he wanted to keep it a secret. However, he was not aware that Jen was Naomi's sister, and upon finding out is horrified. Naomi finds out about it but thinks that Annie was with Liam, not Jen.

25|$|In 1982 Marriott {{was back}} on the road with Jim Leverton (bass, backing vocals), former Steppenwolf keyboardist Goldy McJohn and Chicago born drummer Fallon Williams III. This {{grouping}} was originally set to be called The Official Receivers, The Three Trojans (after McJohn departed) or The Pie but ended up being billed by promoters as Humble Pie. McJohn was let go after suffering drug troubles and the remaining trio toured Australia in October 1982 billed mostly as Small Faces to entice patrons. In January 1983 Leverton ran into trouble at US Immigration and was deported back to England. Marriott based himself in the Atlanta, Georgia area, since that was where his second wife, Pamela Stephens, was from, and continued to tour clubs as Humble Pie. Atlanta musician Keith Christopher (from The Brains) took over bass and a young guitarist from Tennessee, Tommy Johnson, joined as well. And after a hoped for deal with Capricorn Records in nearby Macon fell through after that label's second collapse, this line-up went into Pyramid Eye Studios in Chattanooga, Tennessee to record three songs for a projected album, but nothing further came from it. After Johnson missed a show, he was replaced by Phil Dix. The band was then scheduled to record demos with Yes/ELP producer Eddy Offord at Eddy's studio in Atlanta with Rick Richards (also from The Brains and soon to find fame with the Georgia Satellites) as the new guitarist. But when Rick and Keith missed rehearsals, Steve was so <b>mad</b> <b>that</b> he not only fired Rick but Keith as well. The recordings were done with Fallon on drums and Dave Hewitt (ex-Babe Ruth) on bass. But when these demos failed to attract another record deal and Pamela left Steve for another man, Steve disbanded this version of the Pie and departed the US to return to England in late 1983.|$|E
500|$|David Garrick's {{acceptance}} of Irene for production prompted Johnson to finish rewriting the play. Garrick changed the play's title to Mahomet and Irene, and requested {{changes that would}} make the play more acceptable to his sense of theatrical style. Johnson was initially opposed to the changes and complained that Garrick [...] "wants me to make Mahomet run <b>mad,</b> <b>that</b> he may have an opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels". Johnson's friend John Taylor resolved the dispute and Johnson ultimately carried out Garrick's suggestions, which included revising Irene's death scene so that she would be strangled onstage, instead of offstage as originally written.|$|E
500|$|Now Christopher Smart {{was a very}} beggarly poet of {{the eighteenth}} century [...] but had not the {{smallest}} claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem. Kit Smart, in fact, though he wrote a pestilent deal of verse, could not write poetry—nor anything else [...] Legally <b>mad,</b> <b>that</b> is; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses, and a decent citizen out of them. He went mad—legally and medically—once, and nothing came out of it, perhaps because he was not mad enough. Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in Bedlam wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century—perhaps the finest-before the advent of Blake [...] Smart regained his senses, and therewith his hopeless inability to write poetry. And he never did anything after.|$|E

However, Mr. Krabs, Patrick, Sandy and Squidward tell him about how he helped them with their problems and that his [...] "Best Day Ever" [...] was about them rather than [...] "perfect days". To {{make it up to}} him, they hold a production in which SpongeBob performs his song, [...] "The Best Day Ever" [...] to complete his day with Patrick, Sandy, Squidward and Mr. Krabs co-starring along in it. After a few hours, SpongeBob is still singing, but the others are tired and sleepy, and the audience has all departed. When Squidward asks Mr. Krabs how long they have to keep up the performance, Mr. Krabs replies, [...] "Just 'til his little heart gives out, Squidward. Just 'til his little heart gives out." ...|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{commented on}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest that [...] "I {{feel like the}} music is such a better {{representation}} of me where I am now as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good." [...] Much of the new material incorporates hip hop and R styles previously seen in Minaj's earlier mixtapes. The opening track [...] "Up in Flames" [...] incorporates a [...] "slow, heavy and melodramatic beat", where Minaj addresses her wealth and delivers negative remarks directed towards her adversaries. The second song [...] "Freedom" [...] was compared to material from her debut studio album Pink Friday (2010); it utilizes minimal production and reflects on Minaj's rise to prominence. The third song [...] "Hell Yeah" [...] features Parker and further criticizes Minaj's opponents. She references her much-publicized on-set tension with fellow American Idol judge Mariah Carey in the line [...] "But I'm quick to check a bitch if she’s outta line" [...] and references the series' personnel in the line [...] "Shout out Mike Darnell and Nigel [...] / Why these bums so <b>mad</b> <b>that</b> the queen on Idol".|$|E

[...] In response, the scoreboard at the Oracle Arena began showing a graphic of the Warriors' mascot throwing a pie at Barkley.|$|E

2500|$|An {{organized}} letter-writing campaign, dubbed COOP (Citizens Opposed to the Offing of Peaks), {{attempted to}} save the show from cancellation. The campaign was successful, as ABC agreed to air the remaining six episodes to finish the season. But due to the Gulf War, Twin Peaks was moved from its usual time slot [...] "for six weeks out of eight" [...] in early 1991, according to Frost, preventing the show from maintaining audience interest. In the final episodes, Agent Cooper was given a love interest, Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), to replace the writers' intended romance between him and Audrey Horne. According to Frost, Lara Flynn Boyle, who was romantically involved with Kyle MacLachlan at the time, had effectively vetoed the Audrey-Cooper relationship, forcing the writers {{to come up with}} an alternative. Sherilyn Fenn corroborated this claim in a 2014 interview, stating, [...] " [...] was <b>mad</b> <b>that</b> my character was getting more attention, so then Kyle started saying that his character shouldn’t be with my character because it doesn’t look good, ’cause I’m too young... I was not happy about it. It was stupid." [...] The series finale did not sufficiently boost interest, despite ending on a deliberate audience-baiting cliffhanger, and the show was not renewed for a third season, leaving the cliffhanger unresolved.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} the banquet is narrated by Apollodorus, but before the {{narration}} proper begins, it is shown that Apollodorus is telling the story {{to a friend of}} his that isn’t named, and also that the story of this banquet has been told before by others, as well as previously by Apollodorus himself. This section previews the {{story of the}} banquet, letting the reader know what to expect, and it provides information regarding the context and the date. The banquet was hosted by the poet Agathon to celebrate his first victory in a dramatic competition: the [...] Dionysia of 416 BCE. Apollodorus was not present at the event, which occurred when he was a boy, but he heard the story from Aristodemus, who was present. Apollodorus later checked parts of the story with Socrates, who was also there. In this brief introductory passage it is shown that the narrator, Apollodorus, has a reputation for being somewhat <b>mad,</b> <b>that</b> he is a passionate follower of Socrates, and that he spends his days either listening to Socrates or else telling others of what he has learned from Socrates. The story, as told by Apollodorus, then moves to the banquet at Agathon’s home, where Agathon challenges each of the men to speak in praise of the Greek god, Eros.|$|E
