Of course, that depends on their expertise. As an independent producer, I {{have to be a}} type of skilled laborer. There were many times that I had to make a film quickly.

I just make films by following my heart, so the analysis I leave to all of you." [...] Kim Ki-youngAlthough a critically acclaimed, financially successful independent filmmaker, Kim was not immune from governmental pressure. He filmed Ban Geum-ryeon in 1975, but it was banned at the time, and not released until 1981, with 40 minutes of footage censored. The government also coerced Kim into making an anti-Communist propaganda film. The resulting film, Love of Blood Relations (1976), transcended the bounds of propaganda by portraying the communist agent as one of Kim's typical femme fatale characters. Kim later commented, [...] "North or south, capitalist or communist, ideology is far less interesting to me than the things that divide the sexes." ...|$|E
