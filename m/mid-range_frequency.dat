50|$|Audio {{amplifier}} {{power ratings}} are typically established by driving the {{device under test}} to the onset of clipping, to a predetermined distortion level, variable per manufacturer or per product line. Driving an amplifier to 1% distortion levels will yield a higher rating than driving it to 0.01% distortion levels. Similarly, testing an amplifier at a single <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequency,</b> or testing just one channel of a two-channel amplifier, will yield a higher rating than if it is tested throughout its intended frequency range with both channels working.

The author established {{for the first time the}} link between atypical mass strandings of whales and the use of military sonar by concluding that although pure coincidence cannot be excluded there was better than a 99.3% likelihood that sonar testing caused that stranding. He noted that the whales were spread along 38.2 kilometres of coast and were separated by a mean distance of 3.5 km (sd=2.8, n=11). This spread in time and location was atypical, as usually whales mass strand at the same place and at the same time.|$|E

50|$|Frequency {{response}} requirements differ {{depending on}} the application. In high fidelity audio, an amplifier requires a frequency response of at least 20-20,000 Hz, with a tolerance as tight as ±0.1 dB in the <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequencies</b> around 1000 Hz, however, in telephony, a frequency response of 400-4,000 Hz, with a tolerance of ±1 dB is sufficient for intelligibility of speech.|$|R
50|$|When another {{mid-range}} or midwoofer {{is added}} vertically and symmetrically opposite {{to the existing}} one, {{the result is that}} the tilted on-axis plane gets corrected such that the differences between the midwoofer and tweeter planes become immaterial - the on-axis plane is always w.r.t. the tweeter's center. This of course requires that the two midwoofers are in exactly the same plane, and exactly the same distance from the tweeter - which is much easier to do physically. There is however a price to pay for this - although the MTM's on-axis response is near perfect, its radiation pattern or main lobe is much narrower than that of the MT or TM configuration's. As a result, the off-axis response (i.e., response at locations vertically away from exactly opposite the tweeter) is much weaker and there can be obvious and discernible change in tonality at the crossover as one's listening height relative to the tweeter changes, and the effect is perceived more as the listener moves closer to the loudspeaker. This is corrected by (1) mounting the midwoofers as close to the tweeters as possible (so that the listening distance is much larger than the distance between the drivers) and (2) operating the midwoofers and tweeter in quadrature, i.e., achieved by ensuring that the tweeter lags the midwoofer by 90° in phase at the crossover frequency, and this in turn can be achieved if the crossover has a 3rd order Butterworth characteristic. To achieve the smallest distance between the mids and tweeters requires the drivers to have the smallest possible size - but there are design limitations to this (lowest <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequency,</b> for example, will place a lower limit to the mid's diameter).|$|E

In comparison with the traditional use of PCA, the proposed method gives better recognition accuracy and discriminatory power; further, the proposed method reduces the computational load significantly when the image database is large, with more than 256 training images.

The two climatic driving factors, i. e., the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the Northern Limit of Western Pacific Subtropical High (NWPSH) were considered in particular. The relationships between summer precipitation and EASM/NWPSH were also examined. The results revealed similar periods in low-frequency oscillation (76 – 95 years) and <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillation (32 – 60 years) for the summer precipitation in the Beijing area and EASM/NWPSH.

40|$|Activation of {{urethral}} or genital afferents of the pudendal nerve can elicit or inhibit micturition, and {{low frequency}} {{stimulation of the}} compound pudendal nerve (PN) is known to produce a continence response. The present study demonstrates that PN stimulation also can elicit a micturition-like response and that the response to PN stimulation is dependent on stimulation frequency. We measured the changes in bladder pressure and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electroneurogram (ENG) evoked by PN stimulation before and up to 16 h after spinal cord transection (SCT) in cats anaesthetized with α-chloralose. Low frequency (10 Hz) stimulation elicited a continence-like response, including inhibition of the bladder and activation of the EUS, but mid-frequency (33 Hz) stimulation produced a micturition-like response, including excitation of the bladder without activation of the EUS. The dependence of the response on stimulus frequency was linked to interpulse interval as {{the same number of}} pulses at 10, 33 and 100 Hz produced different responses.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{utilizes}} high-field superconducting Main Dipole Magnets that {{bend the}} trajectory of the beam. The LHC ring is electrically divided into eight octants, each allocating a 7 km chain of 154 Main Dipole Magnets. Dedicated de- tection and protection systems prevent irreversible magnet damage caused by quenches. Quench is a local transition from the superconducting to the normal conducting state. Triggering of such systems, along with other failure scenarios, result in fast transient phenomena. In order to analyze the consequence of such electrical transients and failures in the dipole chain, one needs a circuit model that is validated against measurements. Currently, there exists an equivalent circuit of the Main Dipole Magnet resolved at an aperture level. Each aperture model {{takes into account the}} dynamic effects occurring in the magnets, trough a lossy-inductance model and parasitic capacitances to ground. At low frequencies the Main Dipole Magnet behaves as a linear inductor. Cable eddy current losses are demonstrated by a flattening of the transfer function impedance in the 30 − 50 Hz range. The time constant of such losses is dictated by the parallel re- sistance, and the relative size of the loss is given by a scaling parameter. Capacitive effects become dominant around 10 kHz. Across the dipole magnet there is a resistor connected in parallel to dampen voltage waves. Simulations of an Main Dipole Magnet in OrCAD Cadence PSpice, using the present parameters, and measurements from the LHC give a clear discrepancy. This necessi- tated an updated fit and three methods tailored to obtain each parameter were devel- oped. Firstly, the inductance value was obtained estimated from the initial slope of the impedance plot. Secondly, the numerical method chosen for the parameter fit is Particle Swarm Optimization. The algorithm iteratively minimizes the error between measure- ments and the analytical impedance transfer function, making it possible to estimate the value of the parallel resistor and the scaling factor. Finally, parasitic capacitance to ground was determined with Finite Element Method in COMSOL, as it is challenging to extract parameters from high frequency measurements. Values from measurements verify this method of estimating capacitance. The measurements of the Main Dipole Magnets were performed while connected {{to the rest of the}} dipole magnet chain, which influenced frequency response measurements. Hence a proposal on how to reduce the sensitivity to this influence is outlined. More- over, the method of fitting was found to be modular, meaning each Main Dipole Magnet can be fitted individually. This is significant as it is not necessarily possible to perform measurements on a stand-alone magnet. To cross-check the validity of the method, Par- ticle Swarm Optimization fits from stand-alone measurements and measurements from the dipole magnet chain were compared. Both values of the parallel aperture resistance and scaling factor were different for the two cases. Compared to the operating point of the Main Dipole Magnet, measurements were performed at low current, resulting in 20 % lower inductance than nominal value. Through COMSOL simulations persistent magnetization was found to be the dominat- ing cause. Furthermore, at 1 A the magnet is in the Meissner phase, which introduces non-linearities in the superconducting cable due to persistent magnetization. Simula- tions indicate that this distorts the <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequency</b> AC characteristics represented by the parallel aperture resistance and scaling factor. However, measurements outside the Meissner phase are expected to provide similar parameter values to that of the work- ing point of the LHC. The approach presented has shown promising results and can be translated to a general method for fitting electrical parameters for accelerator magnets...|$|E

But this process requires long thermal cycles and produces <b>mid-range</b> spatial <b>frequency</b> errors due to the anti-stick mandrel coatings. Over the last few years, MIT Space Nanotechnology Lab has developed a non-contact slumping process differentiating from the preceding contact slumping, which utilizes a pair of porous air bearing mandrels through which compressed nitrogen is forced, with a thin piece of glass sheet floating between two thin layers of nitrogen during the thermal cycle. However, the underlying mechanism behind air bearing slumping still remains unveiled. This thesis describes a series of design and tests on horizontal slumping tool with improved active control algorithm and fiber sensing techniques, which results in glass with reduced <b>mid-range</b> spatial <b>frequency</b> errors that could be accomplished in much shorter thermal cycles. We examined {{the influence of the}} slumping time, the supply pressure and the air film thickness and gravity to the outcome shape of the glass. To complement the experiments and to understand the mechanism, we built a finite element model with fluid-structure interaction to analyze the viscoelastic behavior of glass during air bearing slumping. We proved that for the 2 D axisymmetric model, experimental and numerical approaches have comparable results. We also discovered the crucial impacts of bearing permeability to the glass shape. The 3 D cylindrical model is also in development, and a novel vertical slumping tool is to eliminate the undesirable influence of gravity under test.

One important aspect is that the utterances the users produce differ from native speaker utterances, they have a non-native accent. The motivation for our work is that people hear better at low frequencies and know that low frequencies are more important for producing understandable utterances in the foreign language. Therefore they first aim to copy the low frequency behav-ior of the foreign language. Additionally, changes in mid to high frequencies are caused by little tongue movements. These subtle changes are hard to control for non-native speakers. Together both reasons cause the effect that non-native speech differs stronger from native speech for <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Thus we analyze if speech recognition of non-native speakers can be improved by lowering the influence of mid to high frequencies.

The Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy (ASTRON) is studying the possibility of covering the <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequencies</b> (~ 0. 2 to 2 GHz) with an instrument based on the phased-array technology. This technology presents the major advantages of avoiding mechanically moving structures and of enabling very flexible beamforming. One of the envisaged broadband antenna elements is the tapered slot antenna, also called Vivaldi antenna. The design of these antennas is based on infinite array models, which automatically include the mutual coupling effects. As each station will probably be made of {{a very large number of}} small arrays, it is important to know how these arrays will behave when they are truncated. We developed a computation scheme for arrays of antennas made of metallic fins. We justify the adopted approach, then details are given for the fast resolution of the resulting equation system. Finally, examples are shown for wide dipoles and comments are made about the extension to Vivaldi antenna...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} explores some of {{the issues}} involved in searching for transients, pulsars, and ETI signals with a widefield instrument. We assume also that steady sources are surveyed at the same time, including spectral lines and continuum radiation from galaxies and AGNs. We present a survey metric that quantifies survey completeness and incorporates time-variable sources with arbitrary durations and event rates. We discuss the role of propagation effects in surveys. Some radio sources are intensely modulated, such as giant pulses from the Crab pulsar with structure as short as 0. 4 ns, variations in active galactic nuclei on time scales of days and longer, and GRB afterglows on day to month time scales. Apart from pulsars, we know about such variations from observations that target previously detected sources, as opposed to discovering them via their time variability in blind surveys. The transient or dynamic radio sky is rich enough to make it plausible that blind surveys will discover many sources of both known and unknown types. Schemes for conducting searches are outlined {{in the context of the}} Large-N-Small-D concept for the Square Kilometer Array, though they are applicable to large single reflectors and aperture array concepts with minimal changes. The particular science addressed is for <b>mid-range</b> <b>frequencies,</b> e. g. 0. 3 to 10 GHz. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA), properly designed, ca...|$|R
