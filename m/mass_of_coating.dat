40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to perform in-line Near Infrared (NIR) {{measurements}} inside a pan coater to monitor a coating operation in real-time, by predicting the increases in <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> materials and coating thickness. A polymer combination of ethylcellulose/poly(vinyl-alcohol) -poly(ethylene-glycol) graft copolymer was used as functional aqueous coating. Coated tablets were sampled at regular intervals during the coating operation, then subjected to either simple and fast weighing (n = 50) or accurate and non-destructive Terahertz Pulsed Imaging (TPI) measurements (n = 3). Off-line NIR spectra analysis revealed that the coating operation could efficiently be controlled by focusing on two distinct NIR regions, related to absorption bands of ethylcellulose. Principal component analysis of in-line NIR spectra gave a clear classification of the collected coated tablets. Real-time quantitative monitoring of the coating operation was successfully performed from partial least square calibration models built using either TPI or weighing as reference method. Coating thicknesses as well as <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> materials used as primary values provided accurate NIR predictions. A comparison study demonstrated that both reference methods led to reliable and accurate real-time monitoring of the coating operation. This work demonstrated that in-line NIR measurements associated with multivariate analyses can be implemented to monitor in real-time a pan coating operation in order to fulfil the expectations of ICH Q 8 guideline on pharmaceutical development, especially in terms of PAT control strategy and reduced end-product testing.

40|$|Summary. Currently {{creation}} of small inexpensive analytical devices is very actual. Possibility of miniaturization vibrational gas sensors {{is associated with}} the possibility of using resonators smaller than the traditionally used sizes. The study used two types of sensors: sensors based on BAW resonators brand RK 169 with frequency of self-oscillation of 10 MHz and a mini - sensors, resonators based on BAW resonators brand MBC 10000 and MBC 15000 with frequencies of self-oscillation of 10 and 15 MHz respectively. As modifier of electrodes polyethylene glycol PEG 2000 was used. Check of sensitivity of microbalance and evaluation other performance properties of sensors was carried in pairs chloroform, 2 -propanol and benzene. Mini -sensor has a smaller surface available sorption, whereby mini-sesors have a smaller analytical signal as compared traditional used resonators. <b>Mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> which cause failure of self-oscillation for mini -sensors does not exceed 3 mcg and it is much smaller than for traditionally used sensors. It has been established that the analytical signal of mini-sensors in pairs of test compounds is higher than analytical signal of traditionally used sensors. Analytical signal is more for sensors with higher <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> and for sensors with higher selfoscillation frequency. The study found that the mini-sensors can be used for a narrow range of problems in the analysis. the sensitivity of mini-sensors is higher than that traditionally used sensors, but they have significant limitations on weight of coating...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the nature <b>of</b> Supercell <b>coating,</b> an on-line tablet coater that employed a unique pattern <b>of</b> airflow. Tablets <b>coated</b> at different spray rates (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mL/min) were analyzed to investigate the influence of different wetting conditions on the quality <b>of</b> <b>coats</b> formed. Scanning electron micrographs showed that tablet coats formed at a spray rate of 4 mL/min consisted of spray-dried droplets that did not coalesce. At a spray rate of 6 mL/min, surface roughness was found to be lower than at the other spray rates, and the coat appeared smoothest, whereby droplets seemed fused together. At higher spray rates, the droplets appeared as branching arms and scale-like structures. This was attributed to the spread of spray droplets by the processing air and <b>mass</b> transfer <b>of</b> wet <b>coating</b> materials between tablets. Further tests showed that coats formed at higher spray rates had higher drug yield, drug uniformity, color uniformity, and density. However, the variability in coat thickness was increased due to the <b>mass</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>coats</b> and dissolution <b>of</b> tablet core surfaces by the coating material.

The polymer-CNTs interaction is tuned by using different surface modification strategies, comprising grafting and coating. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) are chosen as surface modifiers. The nanocomposite materials are prepared by melt-blending polymer-modified-CNTs in EA and PA. Polymer-grafted-CNTs tend to concentrate at the PA/EA interface, even if predispersed in PA, as opposed to pristine CNTs, which stay inside PA under the same circumstances.

To narrow down the topic six of these factors were selected: the amount of current, {{the time that the}} current is applied, concentration of the electrolyte, temperature, kind of solution and the oxidation state of the metal ion are the factors that were tested. The hypothesis for each factor were developed as: 	The relation between the time and the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>coated</b> should be a direct proportion. 	For a certain time interval, when the current applied to the electroplating cell is increased, the amount of metal that is coated should also increase. 	With a concentrated electrolyte, the plated metal amount is expected to be greater compared to the one with a diluted electrolyte. 	The amount of deposited metal is expected to decrease at higher temperatures. 	The greatest amount of metal will be plated when copper (II) nitrate electrolyte is used. 	The number of moles of metal plated will have a relation as: silver > copper > aluminum. After a series of experiments and calculations the following were concluded: 	Time is directly proportional with the amount <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> metal. 	If the current applied to the cell is increased, the amount of plated metal also increases in a direct proportion. 	When the concentration of the electrolyte is increased, the amount of deposited metal decreases. 	Temperature does not have a valid affect on the electroplating process. 	Copper (II) nitrate is a more effective electrolyte than copper (II) sulphate. 	The oxidation state of metal is inversely proportional with the amount <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> metal.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the electrochemical responses obtained from electroactive counterions incorporated in Nafion coatings {{to the extent of}} hydration of the coatings^(27 - 38) is shown to be enhanced significantly when the electroactive ion is the only counterion present in the coating. Nafion coatings fully saturated with Os(bpy) ^(2 +) _ 3 exhibit unusually narrow and sharply peaked anodic currents in first-scan oxidative voltammograms. This voltammetric feature is accompanied by the expulsion of one-third of the Os complex from the coating. The counterion actually ejected is primarily Os(bpy) ^(3 +) _ 3. As the Os(bpy) ^(3 +) _ 3 counterions are ejected, H_ 2 O molecules enter the coatings. The quantity of H_ 2 O molecules incorporated is so large that the <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> (monitored with a quartz crystal microbalance) increases despite the ejection of the heavy Os(bpy) ^(3 +) _ 3 cations.

The contrasting behaviors of hydrated and unhydrated coatings are compared, and possible explanations are offered for the differences observed...|$|R
40|$|Microstructure of WC {{reinforced}} Ni-based self-fluxing alloy composite coating sprayed and fused by {{oxy-acetylene flame}} was investigated by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and energy dispersive X-ray Spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The wear performance <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> was studied by a MLS- 225 wet sand rubber wheel abrasive wear tester at various loads and sizes of abrasive particles. Also, the wear resistance <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> was compared with uncoated ASTM 1020 steel. The {{results indicated that the}} coating is bonded metallurgically to the substrate and has a homogeneous microstructure composed of both coarse WC and fine carbide and boride grains such as Cr 7 C 3, Cr 23 C 6, and Ni 2 B which disperse uniformly in the matrix of γ-Ni solid solution and Ni 3 B. The worn <b>mass</b> loss <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> and ASTM 1020 steel both increased with the load and size of abrasive particles, also, the coating has exhibited excellent abrasive wear resistance compared with ASTM 1020 steel. Abrasive wear, spraying and fusing coating, Ni-based self-fluxing alloy...|$|R
