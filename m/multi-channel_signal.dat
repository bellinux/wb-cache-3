30|$|When {{considering}} the physical model for reverberant speech {{as shown in}} Eq. 1, it would appear natural to perform denoising prior to dereverberation. Nevertheless, our proposed system performs dereverberation before denoising. There are two main reasons for choosing this processing order. First, model-based SE employs non-linear processing that would destroy the linear filtering model of reverberation that WPE relies on. Second, WPE can process <b>multi-channel</b> <b>signals</b> while preserving source location information and outputs <b>multi-channel</b> <b>signals.</b> In contrast, the output of an MVDR beamformer is a single channel signal. Therefore, when applying MVDR before WPE, WPE cannot exploit spatial {{information provided by the}} multi-channel inputs, and performances are thus not optimal.|$|R

5000|$|One such {{source of}} ground noise is the {{isolated}} ground loop. The isolated ground loop {{differs from the}} ground loop in {{that there is no}} secondary connection to power supply ground or other non-signal ground. Instead two signal ground conductors (such as the outer conductor of stereo coaxial audio wire) are common at the amplifier input (by an internal connection in the multi-channel amplifier), they travel some distance whereupon they experience different induction currents and then are made common at some other secondary location (typically a <b>multi-channel</b> <b>signal</b> source device), as in stereo patch cords. The induction currents being different for each of the two outer coaxial conductors set up a current between the two which results in a difference in potential appearing at the negative input terminals at the amplifier, with respect to the positive input terminals. The problem is made worse by the increasing the length of the cables, and their proximity to devices radiating magnetic noise. One solution to this problem incorporates the use of a single ground conductor as a shield (see coax) and the use of multiple other separated internal conductors as positive signal wires inside a single shield conductor, allowing for several separate and distinct positive signals to all arrive at the amplifier input referenced to a single ground shield conductor. This method also insures that all the signal conductors and the single ground shield conductor (like coax) all experience similar induction of unwanted signals. Another solution is the incorporation of [...] "star topology" [...] signal grounding technique wherein no signal ground ever connects to any other signal ground, except at a single centralized location.|$|E

The applications of BSS range from denoising in pervasive devices such as cellular phones to digital re-mastering of old music recordings.
