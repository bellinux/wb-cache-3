40|$|Chessboard-twinned albite is {{abundant}} in some Franciscan metaconglomerates and associated <b>metagraywackes</b> in the Diablo Range of California. The chessboard albite occurs in pebbles of sedimentary rocks, felsic volcanic and plutonic pebbles, {{and in the}} graywacke matrix of the metaconglomerates, where it has probably formed during blueschist-facies metamorphism. The mode of occurrence of chessboard albite in felsic igneous pebbles suggests that this albite formed by replacement of potash feldspar (albitization); potassium released from the feldspar reacted with aluminous silicates to form white mica. Similarly, chessboard-twinned albite in Franciscan <b>metagraywackes</b> may also result from albitization of detrital potash feldspars. Thin-section examination of many Franciscan <b>metagraywackes</b> has revealed that chessboard albite is selectively distributed among pumpellyite- and lawsonitebearing rocks which now lack potash feldspars.

5000|$|From NE to SW the Baltic shield {{consists}} of the following structural-formational zones: 1) the Central Belomorian mafic zone (CBMZ) dominantly formed by mafic and ultramafic rocks, 2) the Chupa Paragneissic Belt (ChPB) composed of deep and repeatedly metamorphosed <b>metagraywackes</b> (mainly high-alumina gneisses), 3) the North Karelian system of greenstone belts (NKGB) dominated by volcanics of calc-alkaline series, and 4) the North Karelian diorite-plagiogranitic batholith (NKB) and xenoliths of ultramafic to andesite-dacite composition that occur in it. The CBMZ is dominated by metabasalts (amphibolites) with widespread metaultrabasic rocks (metaperidotites, serpentinites and apoultramafic amphibolites), and extremely rare acid metavolcanics. The chemical composition of metabasalts in the CBMZ {{is similar to that}} of mid-oceanic ridge basalts (MORB). The isotopic age of the rhyolite-dacites is 2.887 Ga. This association is interpreted as a fragment of a Late Archean ophiolitic complex. The CBMZ marks a collision suture. The supracrustal strata of NKGBS consist of metabasalts, metakomatiites and felsic to intermediate metavolcanics. Metaandesites-metarhyolites make up a considerable portion of the sequence.

40|$|The Salobo {{iron oxide}} copper-gold deposit {{is located in}} the Carajas Mineral Province, {{northern}} Brazil. The copper-gold ore is hosted by the Archean Salobo-Pojuca Group, which is formed by a sequence of amphibolites, banded iron formations, <b>metagraywackes</b> and quartzites. These rocks were deposited in a trondhjemitic basement, where a continental rift basin, that has been further described as a pull apart basin, was developed. Principal ore assemblages are magnetite-bornite-chalcocite and magnetite-bornite-chalcopyrite, with magnetite dominant and variable amounts of copper sulphides. The iron oxide copper-gold ore shows elevated concentrations of Ag, U, Co, Mo, F and LREE. Differences in geochemistry and textures between magnetite of iron-rich rocks and magnetite of banded iron formation suggest a hydrothermal origin for the mineralization. Fluid inclusion data for quartz veins and apatite indicate the involvement of highly saline fluids in the deposit formation. Adominantly magmatic source of the sulphur is indicated by isotope ratios determined for chalcopyrite and bornite (834 S between 0. 2 %o and 1. 6 %o). Petrographic evidence supported by preliminary geochronological data indicates that the mineralization post-dates the metamorphism. Hydrothermal alteration effects on host amphibolites have been also investigated. The studied amphibolites occur as lenses or layers close to the contact with the gneissic basement or included in <b>metagraywackes</b> of the Salobo-Pojuca Group. Trace element chemistry of these rocks indicates that they are subalkaline basalts with tholeiitic affinity. Based on the K., 0 content, three alteration groups have been defined and informally named "less altered", "medium altered" and "very altered" types. They characterize rocks affected by different degrees of alkali metasomatism, resulting in major compositional changes. "Less altered" rocks (3. 5 wt%) values. The spatial association of "very altered" rocks with the main ore zone suggests a relationship between alkali metasomatism and mineralization. Similarities in the the hydrothermal alteration pattern combined with the ore mineralogy and chemistry indicate that the Salobo deposit belongs to the class of iron oxide (Cu-U-Au-REE) deposits...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of crystallized and glassy melt inclusions (MI) in high-grade, partially melted metapelites and <b>metagraywackes</b> {{has opened up}} new possibilities to investigate anatectic processes. The present study focuses on three case studies: khondalites from the Kerala Khondalite Belt (India), the Ronda migmatites (Spain), and the Barun Gneiss (Nepal Himalaya). The results of a detailed microstructural investigation are reported, along with some new microchemical data on the bulk composition of MI. These inclusions were trapped within peritectic garnet and ilmenite during crystal growth and are therefore primary inclusions. They are generally isometric and very small in size, mostly £ 15 lm, and only rarely reaching 30 lm; they occur in clusters. In most cases inclusions are crystallized (nanogranites) and contain a granitic phase assemblage with quartz, feldspar {{and one or two}} mica depending on the particular case study, commonly with accessory phases (mainly zircon, apatite, rutile). In many cases the polycrystalline aggregates that make up the nanogranites show igneous microstructures, e. g. granophyric intergrowths, micrographic quartz in K-feldspar and cuneiform rods of quartz in plagioclase. Further evidence for the former presence of melt within the investigated inclusions consists of melt pseudomorphs, similar to those recognized at larger scale in the host migmatites. Moreover, partially crystallized inclusions are locally abundant and together with very small (£ 8 lm) glassy inclusions may occur in the same clusters. Both crystallized and partially crystallized inclusions often display a diffuse nanoporosity, which may contain fluids, depending on the case study. After entrapment, inclusions underwent limited microstructural modifications, such as shape maturation, local necking down processes, and decrepitation (mainly in the Barun Gneiss), which did not influence their bulk composition. Re-homogenized nanogranites and glassy inclusions show a leucogranitic and peraluminous composition, consistent with the results of partial melting experiments on metapelites and <b>metagraywackes.</b> Anatectic MI should therefore be considered as a new and important opportunity to understand the partial melting processes...|$|R
40|$|Retardation {{of nuclear}} {{contaminants}} in rock matrices {{can lead to}} long retention times, allowing substantial radionuclide decay prior to eventual release. Imbibition and diffusion into the rock matrix can move contaminants away from an active fracture, thereby contributing to their retardation. However, diffusive transport in some rocks may behave anomalously because of their sparsely connected porespace, in contrast to diffusion in rocks with denser pore connections. We examined imbibition of weakly sorbing tracers into welded tuff and Indiana sandstone, and water imbibition into <b>metagraywacke</b> and Berea sandstone. Tuff samples were initially equilibrated to 12 % and 76 % water (v/v) within controlled humidity chambers, while the other rocks were air-dried. For imbibition, one face was exposed to water, with or without tracer, and uptake was measured over time. Following imbibition, tracer concentration measurements were made at fine (1 mm) increments. Three anomalous results were observed: (1) Indiana sandstone and <b>metagraywacke</b> showed mass of imbibed water scaling as time{sup 0. 26 }, while tuff and Berea sandstone showed the more classical scaling with time{sup 0. 05 }; (2) tracer movement into dry (2 % initial saturation) Indiana sandstone showed a dispersion pattern similar to that expected during tracer movement into moist (76 % initial saturation) tuft and (3) tracer concentrations at the inlet face of the tuff sample were approximately twice those deeper inside the sample. The experiment was then modeled using random walk methods on a 3 -D lattice with different values of pore coordination. Network model simulations that used a pore coordination of 1. 49 for Indiana sandstone and 1. 56 for <b>metagraywacke</b> showed similar temporal scaling, {{a result of their}} porespace being close to the percolation threshold. Tracer concentration profiles in Indiana sandstone and tuff were closely matched by simulations that used pore coordinations of 1. 49 and 1. 68, respectively, because of how low connectivity alters the accessible porosity {{in the vicinity of the}} inlet face. The study supports pore connectivity as a coherent explanation for the observed anomalies and demonstrates the utility of pore-scale modeling in elucidating mechanisms critical to radionuclide retardation in geological repositories...|$|E
40|$|The {{utility of}} {{microearthquake}} data for characterizing the Northwest Geysers geothermal {{field and the}} Long Valley Caldera (LVC) was investigated. Three-dimensional (3 -D) P- and S-wave seismic velocity models were estimated for the Coldwater Creek Steam Field (CCSF) in the Northwest Geysers region. Hypocenters relocated using these 3 -D models appear {{to be associated with}} the steam producing zone, with a deeper cluster of hypocenters beneath an active injection well. Spatial and temporal patterns of seismicity exhibit strong correlation with geothermal exploitation. A 3 -D differential attenuation model was also developed for the CCSF from spectral ratios corrected for strong site effects. High-velocity anomalies and low attenuation in the near surface correspond to Franciscan <b>metagraywacke</b> and greenstone units. Microearthquakes recorded at seismographic stations located near the <b>metagraywacke</b> unit exhibit high corner frequencies. Low-velocity anomalies and higher attenuation in the near surface are associated with sections of Franciscan melange. Near-surface high attenuation and high Vp/Vs are interpreted to indicate liquid-saturated regions affected by meteoric recharge. High attenuation and low Vp/Vs marks the steam producing zone, suggesting undersaturation of the reservoir rocks. The extent of the high attenuation and low Vp/Vs anomalies suggest that the CCSF steam reservoir may extend northwestward beyond the known producing zone. This study concludes that microearthquake monitoring may be useful as an active reservoir management tool. Seismic velocity and attenuation structures as well as the distribution of microearthquake activity can be used to identify and delineate the geothermal reservoir, while temporal variations in these quantities would be useful in tracking changes during exploitation...|$|E

5000|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{deposition}} continued until 450 million years before the present causing increase of weight of the sediments in the basin. When subsidence stopped uplift began due to compression of the subsidence from the sides. Due to the compression, temperature and pressure rose which led to a reformation of the rocks in the basin. Increasing temperature led to recrystallization of minerals in the rocks. As the result of recrystallization, the micas were preferentially oriented, or oriented in the same position. Due to this orientation, foliation took place. Recrystallization and foliation changed the shales, sandstones, greywackes and basalts into mica schists, quartzites, <b>metagraywackes</b> and amphibolites. It {{is likely that}} metamorphism destroyed fossil remains that may have been in the rocks. Along with metamorphism folding and faulting of the rocks took place. There were two periods of the folding in the park. Pressure led to breach of the rocks.|$|R

40|$|A reactive-transport {{model for}} 14 C was {{developed}} to test its applicability to the Aidlin geothermal system. Using TOUGHREACT, we developed a 1 -D grid to evaluate the effects of water injection and subsequent water-rock-gas interaction on the compositions of the produced fluids. A dual-permeability model of the fracture-matrix system was used to describe reaction-transport processes in which the permeability of the fractures is many orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} the rock matrix. The geochemical system included the principal minerals (K-feldspar, plagioclase, calcite, silica polymorphs) of the <b>metagraywackes</b> that comprise the geothermal reservoir rocks. Initial simulation results predict that the gas-phase CO 2 in the reservoir will become more enriched in 14 C as air-equilibrated injectate water (with a modern carbon signature) is incorporated into the system, and that these changes will precede accompanying decreases in reservoir temperature. The effects of injection on 14 C in the rock matrix will be lessened somewhat because of the dissolution of matrix calcite with "dead" carbon...|$|R

40|$|Sulfur {{isotopic studies}} of pyrite from metasediments in the 2. 6 b. y. old Deer Lake greenstone sequence, Minnesota, were {{conducted}} in order to evaluate the possible importance of sulfate reducing bacteria in sulfide formation. Pyrite occurs as ovules up to 2 cm in diameter within graphitic slates, and as fine disseminations in <b>metagraywacke</b> units. SEM studies indicate the pyrite is framboidal in morphology. Delta notation values of pyrite from the Deer Lake sediments range from - 2. 3 to 11. 1 0 / 00, with a peak at approximately + 2 o/oo. Isotopic data is consistent with either high temperature inorganic reduction of circulating seawater sulfate, or low temperature bacterial reduction. However, the lack of sulfide bands or massive occurrences in the sediments, the restriction of pyrite mineralization to the sediments, {{and the absence of}} evidence for hot spring activity suggest that a diagenetic origin of pyrite is more feasible.

The Big Sulphur Creek enhanced tectonic disruption area provides the best situation for shallow felsite injection, shallow reservoir top, metasomatism transformation, and profound fracture permeability. Steam cells commonly extend to great depths and laterally drop off sharply, with relatively flat lateral continuance in some resource areas. Injectate ponding may offer a third fluid interface for reservoir steam reserves. A possible boiled down residuum of complex evaporates and hematite has been viewed in one area of the field where the reservoir (proper) bottom was encountered.

Klinkenberg slip factor b for these plugs is generally consistent with the inverse relation between slip factor and permeability observed by Jones (1972) for plugs of much more permeable material.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Small gabbroic bodies intruding <b>metagraywackes</b> and cherts of the Late Mesozoic Franciscan Complex {{represent}} small-scale magmatic {{activity in}} a trench sedimentary environment or in the accretionary prism itself. At Leech Lake Mountain, located in the eastern Franciscan belt of northern California, interbedded radiolarian cherts and graywackes are locally intruded by Ti-rich alkalic diabase sills. The thicker sills are internally differentiated and display cumulate textures of olivine and augite. Although the diabases and surrounding graywackes were overprinted by blueschist metamorphism as indicated by jadeite-rich clinopyroxene and glaucophane, they show little deformation and good preservation of the mafic igneous minerals. The sills comprize alkali basaltic to hawaiitic compositions, all related by fractionation of olivine (Fo 84), augite, and titanomagnetite. The immobile trace elements Th, U, Nb, and the LREE (light Rare Earth Elements) are strongly enriched compared to MORB (Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt), whereas Y and the HREE (heavy Rare Earth Elements) are depleted.

40|$|The Thelon basin, Nunavut, shares many {{similarities}} {{with the}} uranium-producing Athabasca basin, Saskatch-ewan; however, the uranium deposits {{associated with the}} Thelon basin are still poorly understood. The Kig-gavik project area (AREVA Resources Canada) is located near the northeastern terminus of the Thelon basin and comprises multiple uranium deposits hosted exclusively in basement rocks. The Bong deposit is hosted dominantly by Neoarchean <b>metagraywacke</b> of the Woodburn Lake group. A five-phase metallogenetic model is proposed for the Bong deposit, with three stages of uraninite identified. The premineralization phase is characterized by host-rock silicification. Mineralization is separated into three main stages. Stage 1 uraninite (U 1; ca. 1500 Ma) is preserved in highly fractured and altered disseminated grains that are overgrown by later stages of uraninite. Stage 2 uraninite (U 2; ca. 1100 Ma) forms veinlets parallel to D 1 foliation and coats and fills fractures in organic matter nodules and blebs. Stage 2 uraninite is associated with pervasive illite that formed from ~ 190 °C fluids (δ 18 O: – 6. 4 ‰, δ 2 H: – 97 ‰), which remobilized much of Stage 1 uraninite and completely overprinted Stage 1 alteration. At ~ 1000 Ma an oxidizing fluid deposited uraninite along redox fronts (U 3) while altering and remobilizing Stage 1 and 2 uraninite.

40|$|Several orogenic belts {{around the}} world as the Alpine-Hymalayan, the circum-Mediterranean, and the Appalachians contain melanges that are key records of the tectono-stratigraphic {{evolution}} of orogens. The Alpine metaophiolites constitute the sutured Jurassic Tethys Ocean interposed between the European and African plates. Here, serpentinites are often directly covered by metasediments. In the Mount Avic serpentinite massif (Italian Western Alps), interpreted as a fossil oceanic core complex, the serpentinite-sediment contact is marked by a kilometer-scale and few meters-thick serpentinite melange. Upon massive to veined and brecciated serpentinite, the melange starts with white marble and carbonatic calcschist alternating with decimeters-thick horizons of serpentinite metabreccia and <b>metagraywacke,</b> including isolated metric blocks of serpentinite. The sequence continues with rounded to irregularly-shaped blocks of serpentinite, cm-to several dm in size, randomly distributed within a matrix of foliated impure marbles and calcschist. The serpentinite melange has been severely overprinted by Alpine tectonic deformation and metamorphic recrystallization through subduction-related stretching and boudinage and collision-related folding. Nevertheless, its internal fabric still retains records of a block-in-matrix structure well consistent with mass-transport processes related to an active tectonic setting in which mantle rocks were progressively and continuously exhumed by faulting. The products of mass-transport processes and faulting are unconformably sealed by flysch-type calcschists embedding cm-sized clasts of actinolite/tremolite-schists. This scenario has profound implications in the physiography of the Tethys Ocean. A correct reconstruction of products and processes occurred at the mantle-sediment interface is thus crucial for better interpreting the complete orogenic cycle, from intra-oceanic extensional processes to subduction-accretion and exhumation ones, affecting the Alpine ophiolites...|$|E

This investigation focuses on the isotopic composition of sulfur in meta-morphosed sedimentary rocks, Stillwater-associated sills and dikes, sulfide accumulations near {{the base of the}} complex, and platinum-group element-enriched sulfide mineralization that constitutes the J-M reef and the Picket Pin deposit. The (•a 4 S values for 233 samples analyzed in this study have a mean of 0. 4 per mil, a standard deviation of 1. 7, and a maximum and minimum of- 3. 8 and 7. 8 per mil, respectively. Despite the very narrow range of values, analysis of variance calculations confirms that the data comprise three statistically distinct groups. These groups are (1) metagraywackes and metashales (mean = 2. 8 % 0); (2) iron-formation, Stillwater-associated sills and dikes, and basal sulfide accumulations in the complex (mean =- 0. 7 % 0); and (3) disseminated sulfide minerals that occur above the basal accumulations in the Stillwater Complex (mean [...] 1. 2 %o). The isotopic composition of sulfur in the basal sulfide accumulations indicates that assimilation of substantial amounts of sulfur from iron-formation may have occurred. The low tenor of the basal sulfide ores is also consistent with assimilation of sulfur into a limited volume of magma near the base of the intrusion...|$|E

On the southeast they are in fault contact with the Miners Delight Formation comprised primarily of <b>metagraywackes</b> with minor calc-alkaline volcanics. The ophiolitic and associated metasedimentry rocks (Goldman Meadows Formation) have been multiply deformed and metamorphosed. The most prominant structures are a pronounced steeply plunging stretching lineation and steeply dipping foliation. These structural data indicate that the ophiolitic and associated metasedimentary rocks have been deformed by simple shear. The ophiolitic rocks are interpreted as the remains of Archean oceanic crust, probably formed at either a mid-ocean ridge or back-arc basin. All the units of a complete ophiolite are present except for upper mantle periodotities. The absence of upper mantle rocks {{may be the result}} of detactment within the crust, rather than within the upper mantle, during emplacement. This could have been the result of a steeper geothermal gradient in the Archean oceanic lithosphere, or may have resulted from a thicker oceanic crust in the Archean...|$|R
40|$|Results of hydrologic tests {{conducted}} on four representative core plugs from Geysers Coring Project drill hole SB- 15 -D have {{been related to}} detailed mineralogic and textural characterization of the plugs to yield new information about permeability, porosity, and capillary-pressure characteristics of the uppermost Geysers steam reservoir and its immediately overlying caprock. The core plugs are all fine- to medium-grained, Franciscan-assemblage (late Mesozoic) <b>metagraywacke</b> with sparse Franciscan metamorphic quartz-calcite veins and late Cenozoic, hydrothermal quartz-calcite-pyrite veins. The matrices of three plugs from the caprock are rich in metamorphic mixed-layer illite/smectite and disseminated hydrothermal pyrite; the reservoir plug instead contains abundant illite and only minor pyrite. The reservoir plug and one caprock plug are sparsely disrupted by latest-stage, unmineralized microfractures which both follow and crosscut veinlets but which could be artifacts. Porosities of the plugs, measured by Boyles-law gas expansion, range between 1. 9 and 2. 5 %. Gas permeability and Klinkenberg slip factor were calculated from gas-pressure-pulse-decay measurements using a specially designed permeameter with small (2 mL) reservoirs. Matrix permeabilities in the range 10 - 21 m&sup 2; (= 1 nanodarcy) were measured for two plugs that included mineral-filled veins but no unfilled microfractures. Greater permeabilities were measured on plugs that contained microfractures; at 500 psi net confining pressure, an effective aperture of 1. 6 µm was estimated for one plug. Capillary pressure curves were determined for three cores by measuring saturation as weight gain of plugs equilibrated with atmospheres in which the relative humidity was controlled by saturated brines...|$|E
40|$|Detrital zircon {{studies suggest}} that the few {{quartzite}} occurrences in southern Finland are younger than 1. 87 Ga and express sedimentation after 1. 89 – 1. 87 Ga accretional deformation and metamorphism in the Svecofennian orogenic belt. Detailed field work in the high-grade metamorphic Pyhäntaka area allowed to distinguish an overturnedformation within metagraywackes (cordierite paragneisses) and psammites. The Pyhäntaka formation has a maximum thickness of 1000 meters and consists of quartzite overlain by meta-arkose, metatuff, and metabasalt on top. An uncorformity, expressed by aweathering surface, separates the quartzite from underlying <b>metagraywacke.</b> The metavolcanic rocks within, stratigraphically underlying and overlying the Pyhäntaka formation are mostly basalts and basaltic andesites, but a felsic volcanic rock and dacitic fragments in volcaniclastic rocks imply bimodal affinity. The quartzite was deposited during a stable intra-orogenic period probably after accretion but before 1. 83 – 1. 80 Ga collisionaldeformation and metamorphism in the Svecofennian orogen. Rifting during the intraorogenic period and accumulation of variable material in the rift from nearby sources by fluvial processes is a viable scenario for deposition and preservation of the Pyhäntakaformation. Geochemical diagrams of the metavolcanic rocks show a scatter that is best explained by source heterogeneity and crustal contamination. Despite their (likely) postaccretion setting the basaltic rocks show arc-type characteristics due to subduction-modified lithospheric mantle sources. Because of recycling, also the paragneisses in the Pyhäntaka area are geochemically similar in spite that they represent different tectonic settings. The use of elemental geochemistry alone appears to be insufficient for discriminatingtectonic settings of basalts or graywackes in the Svecofennian of southern Finland where accretion and post-accretion settings were largely obliterated by late collision...|$|E
40|$|A biotite {{granodiorite}} {{and seven}} Sn-bearing two-mica granites crop {{out in the}} Gouveia area, central Portugal. A SHRIMP U–Th–Pb zircon age from the granodiorite, and monazite ages from four of the two-mica granites, {{show that they are}} of Early Ordovician (~ 480 Ma) and Permo-Carboniferous, i. e. Variscan (~ 305 and 290 Ma) age respectively. The Variscan two-mica granites are late- and post-D 3. Major and trace element variation in the granitic rocks and their biotite and muscovite indicate mainly individual fractionation trends. The granitic rocks are mostly depleted in HREE relative to LREE. The biotite granodiorite is probably derived from igneous lower crust, as evidenced by low initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 7036), high εNdT (+ 2. 5) and moderate δ 18 O (8. 8 ‰). The two-mica granites are probably derived by partial melting of heterogeneous mid-crustal metasediments, mainly metapelite and some <b>metagraywacke,</b> as evidenced by their high initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 7076 – 0. 7174), δ 18 O (10. 7 – 13. 4 ‰) and major element compositions. However, variation diagrams for major and trace elements from two of the muscoviteNbiotite granites and their micas define fractionation trends. Rb–Sr whole-rock analyses from the two granites are perfectly fitted to a single isochron and the rocks have subparallel REE patterns; the younger granite is derived from the older by fractional crystallization of quartz, plagioclase, biotite and ilmenite (tested by modelling major and trace elements). Most of the Sn-bearing granites are derived from distinct magma batches. They result from partial melting of a heterogeneous midcrustal metasediment. They do not represent a crustal anomaly in tin. Fractional crystallization is responsible for the increase in the Sn contents of the granites and their micas. Muscovite has a higher Sn content than coexisting biotite and is the principal host mineral for Sn in these rocks...|$|E
40|$|Migmatitic rocks {{developed}} in <b>metagraywackes</b> during the Variscan orogeny in the Aiguilles-RougesMassif (westernAlps). Partial melting took place 320 Ma {{ago in a}} 500 m-wide vertical shearzone. Three leucosome types have been recognised {{on the basis of}} size and morphology: (1) large leucosomes > 2 cm wide and > 40 cm long lacking mafic selvage, but containing cm-scale mafic enclaves; (2) same as 1 but with thick mafic selvage (melanosome); (3) small leucosomes < 2 cm and < 40 cm) with thin dark selvages (stromatic migmatites). Types 1 + 2 have mineralogical and chemical compositions in keeping with partial melting experiments. But Type 3 leucosomes have identical plagioclase composition (An 19 - 28) to neighbouring mesosome, both in terms of major- and trace-elements. Moreover, whole-rock REE concentrations in Type 3 leucosomes are only slightly lower than those in the mesosomes, unlike predicted by partial melting experiments. The main chemical differences between all leucosome types can be related to the coupled effect of melt segregation and late chemical reequilibration. Mineral assemblages and thermodynamic modelling on bulk-rock composition restrict partial melting to ∼ 650 °C at 400 MPa. The large volume of leucosome (20 vol. %) thus generated requires addition of 1 wt. % external water. Restriction of extensive migmatization to the shearzone, without melting of neighbouring metapelites, also points to external fluid circulation within the shearzone as the cause of melting...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCa. 500 Ma orthogneisses and bimodal suites are {{widespread}} {{along the}} northern part of the Bohemian Massif (central European Variscides) and are interpreted to document intense magmatism during a continental break-up episode {{along the northern}} periphery of Gondwana. Based on geological setting, and geochemical and isotopic evidence, these felsic igneous rocks record the generation of: (1) magmas of pure or predominantly crustal derivation, represented by minor extrusives and much more voluminous orthogneisses similar to S-type granitoids; (2) subordinate magmas of exclusively mantle origin (ranging from within-plate alkali trachytes to oceanic plagiogranites) corresponding to felsic derivatives of associated basalts; and (3) magmas of hybrid origin, produced either as a result of large degrees of contamination of mantle-derived magmas ascending through the crust, or alternatively, generated by partial melting of mixed sources, such as interlayered sediments and mafic rocks or graywackes containing a juvenile component. The high-temperature dehydration melting process responsible for the generation of the most abundant rock-types necessitated the advection of mantle heat, in a context of continental lithosphere extension, as documented by broadly coeval basaltic magmatism at the scale of the igneous province. The large volumes of felsic magmas generated during the 500 -Ma anorogenic event are interpreted to result from the combination of a hot extensional tectonic regime with the widespread availability in the lower crust of fertile lithologies, such as <b>metagraywackes.</b> This in turn reflects the largely undifferentiated nature of the crustal segment accreted some 50 – 100 m. y. earlier during the Cadomian orogeny...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} geology and rocks paragenesis has been {{conducted}} at the Córrego do Sítio auriferous lineament, containing the Cachorro Bravo, Laranjeiras and Carvoaria metaturbidite-hosted lode-gold deposits located in the Quadrilátero Ferrífero Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil. These representative deposits are described to illustrate the essentially similar general character of all the deposits of lineament {{as well as the}} wide compositional and mineralogical differences in the ore of the different deposits, where, for the Cachorro Bravo deposit, a geological mapping included two underground mine galleries. The Córrego do Sítio unit is a metamorphosed turbidite in an alternating sequence of <b>metagraywackes</b> and phyllites, with parallel to discordant metamafic dikes and sills. The ore zone is predominantly hosted at the stratigraphic break between metasedimentary and metamafic rocks. Four deformation events affected the mine sequence. Mineralized veins and veinlets are considered to have formed within a brittle-ductile shear-zone environment and occurred in multiple episodes. Different vein types are recognized, but the most important volumetrically is a S 1 -concordant type characterized by smoky and milky quartz-carbonate-sulfide ± sulfosalts veins. Veins are dominated by quartz, but locally they are characterized by carbonate and a large variety of sulfide and sulfosalt minerals. Pyrite is the commonest associated sulfide mineral, followed by arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite. An extensive mineralogical study of polished sections has confirmed different generations of sulfide minerals. The sulfides and sulfosalt minerals are interrelated in the veins and disseminated on wall rocks. The data are consistent with a genetic models related to other Archean lode-gold deposits...|$|R
