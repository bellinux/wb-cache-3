5|$|Since {{the first}} {{installment}} was released in 1995, the Tales series has grown to include the main entries and multiple spin-offs that derive multiple gameplay and narrative elements from the main entries. Except when indicated by naming, the main Tales entries are separate from each other apart from gameplay mechanics and themes. While Tales titles are often ported to new consoles after their original release, these remakes are rarely localized. The 2006 Nintendo DS game Tales of the Tempest was originally seen as a <b>main</b> <b>entry</b> in the series, but in 2007 was classified as a spin-off, possibly due to poor reception of that particular title.|$|E
5|$|The Tales {{series is}} {{classified}} as a role-playing video game series. Multiple gameplay elements carry over from entry to entry. The main unifying element is the combat system, the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS for short).

Introduced in Phantasia, it is a real-time fighting system similar to a brawler, as opposed to the majority of RPGs at the time of Phantasias release, which primarily used turn-based battle systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who also created the story concept and main character designs.

Production on Versus XIII ended in 2012, when it was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV and transferred over to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 3 version, which was originally built using the company's proprietary Crystal Tools game engine, was abandoned due to concerns about the platform's shortening life cycle. Its engine was changed to Luminous Studio, Square Enix's custom-built engine for eighth-generation gaming hardware.|$|E
