5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate.</b> In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the jet stream during the cold season. This shift in the jet stream brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E
5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate,</b> but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as it tends to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate,</b> steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.|$|E
50|$|Some {{vegetation}} {{types are}} formed of dwarf-shrubs: low-growing or creeping shrubs. These include the maquis and garrigues of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates,</b> and the acid-loving dwarf shrubs of heathland and moorland.|$|R
50|$|Dsb {{arises from}} the same {{scenario}} as Dsa, but at even higher altitudes or latitudes, and chiefly in North America, since the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates</b> extend further poleward than in Eurasia.|$|R
5000|$|Under the Köppen classification, dry-summer climates (Csa, Csb) usually {{occur on}} the western sides of continents. Csb zones in the Köppen system include areas {{normally}} not associated with <b>mediterranean</b> <b>climates</b> but with Oceanic climates, such {{as much of the}} Pacific Northwest, much of southern Chile, parts of west-central Argentina, and parts of New Zealand. Additional highland areas in the subtropics also meet Cs requirements, though they, too, are not normally associated with <b>mediterranean</b> <b>climates,</b> as do a number of oceanic islands such as Madeira, the Juan Fernández Islands, {{the western part of the}} Canary Islands, and the eastern part of the Azores ...|$|R
5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. These primary types are A) tropical, B) dry, C) mild mid-latitude, D) cold mid-latitude, and E) polar.

5|$|An oceanic (or maritime) {{climate is}} {{typically}} found {{along the west}} coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year-round. The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate</b> regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. A steppe is a dry grassland. Subarctic climates are cold with continuous permafrost and little precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis is {{endemic to}} the Southwest Botanical Province, a floristic {{province}} renowned as a biodiversity hotspot, {{located in the}} southwest corner of Western Australia. This area has a <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate,</b> with wet winters and hot, dry summers. B.sessilis occurs throughout much of the province, ranging from Kalbarri in the north, south to Cape Leeuwin, east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay, and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin. It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland. It is also absent from the Karri forest in the cool, wet, southwest corner of the province, but even there, B.sessilis var. cordata occurs along the coast.|$|E
50|$|Barásoain {{is located}} in a {{transitional}} climatic region. It borders the Oceanic and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates,</b> showing a pattern influenced by both. It is, nevertheless, classified as having an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb).|$|R
50|$|The garden also {{contains}} a herbarium of some 6,000 species, with particular strength in phanerogams of the Mediterranean region and other <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates,</b> including Salvia, Phlomis, Astragalus, Cistaceae, and species cultivated in the garden.|$|R
50|$|A fast-growing {{plant in}} cultivation, B. hookeriana flowers 3-4 years from seed. It {{requires}} good drainage. It {{can be grown}} in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates</b> such as Victoria and South Australia, but does not tolerate climates with summer humidity.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate,</b> natural attractions, and {{historic}} heritage make Alanya a popular destination for tourism, and responsible for nine percent of Turkey's tourism sector and {{thirty percent of}} foreign purchases of real estate in Turkey. Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population. Warm-weather sporting events and cultural festivals take place annually in Alanya. In 2014 Mayor Adem Murat Yücel, of the Nationalist Movement Party unseated Hasan Sipahioğlu, of the Justice and Development Party, who had previously led the city since 1999.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate</b> at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climate</b> and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days. However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
50|$|This {{prosperity}} {{started to}} fade in the 1960s {{with the increasing}} availability of foreign holidays to the general public. Competing against resorts in Europe that enjoyed <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates,</b> the popularity of all the Clyde seaside resorts fell.|$|R
5000|$|Wine {{regions with}} {{maritime}} climates are characterised by their {{close proximity to}} large bodies of water (such as oceans, estuaries and inland seas) that moderate their temperatures. Maritime climates share many characteristics with both <b>Mediterranean</b> and continental <b>climates</b> and are often described as a [...] "middle ground" [...] between the two extremes. Like <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates,</b> maritime climates have a long growing season, with water currents moderating the region's temperatures. However, while <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>climates</b> are usually very dry during the growing season, maritime climates are often subject to the viticultural hazards of excessive rain and humidity which may promote various grape diseases, such as mold and mildew. Like continental climates, maritime climates will have distinct seasonal changes, but they are usually not as drastic, with warm, rather than hot, summers and cool, rather than cold, winters. Maritime climates also exist in some wine-growing areas of highlands of subtropical and tropical latitudes, including the southern Appalachian Mountains in the USA, eastern Australian highlands, and central highlands of Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Carpenteria californica is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental plant, {{grown for}} its lush appearing foliage, seasonal flowers and drought tolerance.
