2500|$|Like all thrips of {{suborder}} Terebrantia, S. dorsalis undergoes two nymphal stages {{followed by}} two [...] "false" [...] pupal stages, and under optimal conditions, this thrips may reach adulthood in approximately two weeks. However, {{research has shown that}} the length of these life-history stages are flexible within a group depending on an individual's access to nutrients and temperature. Nymphs entering the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>process</b> drop off of the plant during the first of two propual stages, and then complete their development in loose soil or leaf litter at the base of their host - but have been observed to pupate in any dark and humid crevice low on the plant, including bark and the folds of tightly packed lower leaves or flowers. The pupal process can range from two days to a full week. In temperate regions where the temperature falls below the critical lower threshold, non-diapausing adults are reported to overwinter in the soil or apical buds. Colder temperatures may even drive pupation, but this has not been experimentally confirmed.|$|E
60|$|The {{upper half}} of this gypseous {{formation}} is mainly formed of the same calcareous clay-shale rock, but without any gypsum, and varying extremely in nature: it passes from a soft, coarse, earthy, ferruginous state, including particles of quartz, into compact claystones with crystallised oxide of iron,--into porcellanic layers, alternating with seams of calcareous matter,--and into green porcelain-jasper, excessively hard, but easily fusible. Strata of this nature alternate with much black and brown siliceo-calcareous slate, remarkable from the wonderful number of huge embedded logs of silicified wood. This wood, according to Mr. R. Brown, is (judging from several specimens) all coniferous. Some of the layers of the black siliceous slate contained irregular angular fragments of imperfect pitchstone, which I believe, as in the Uspallata range, has originated in a <b>metamorphic</b> <b>process.</b> There was one bed of a marly tufaceous nature, and of little specific gravity. Veins of agate and calcareous spar are numerous. The whole of this gypseous formation, especially the upper half, has been injected, metamorphosed, and locally contorted by numerous hillocks of intrusive porphyries crowded together in an extraordinary manner. These hillocks consist of purple claystone and of various other porphyries, and of much white feldspathic greenstone passing into andesite; this latter variety included in one case crystals of orthitic and albitic feldspar touching each other, and others of hornblende, chlorite, and epidote. The strata surrounding these intrusive hillocks at the mines of Los Hornos, are intersected by many veins of copper-pyrites, associated with much micaceous iron-ore, and by some of gold: in the neighbourhood of these veins the rocks are blackened and much altered. The gypsum near the intrusive masses is always opaque. One of these hillocks of porphyry was capped by some stratified porphyritic conglomerate, which must have been brought up from below, through the whole immense thickness of the overlying gypseous formation. The lower beds of the gypseous formation resemble the corresponding and probably contemporaneous strata of the main Cordillera; whilst the upper beds in several respects resemble those of the Uspallata chain, and possibly may be contemporaneous with them; for I have endeavoured {{to show that the}} Uspallata beds were accumulated subsequently to the gypseous or Neocomian formations of the Cordillera.|$|E

50|$|Frankamenite {{occurs in}} {{association}} with the rare mineral charoite, which is found only in the Sakha Republic, Yakutia, Siberia, Russia. Here, metasomatism enriches a syenite massif with potassium when it comes into contact with a limestone at around 200-250 °C. This <b>metamorphic</b> <b>process</b> produces a potassium feldspar metasomatite, the typical geological environment for canasite and, therefore, frankamenite. Frankamenite and charoitein are exclusive to the Sakha Republic in this sort of environment, as mineralogists have yet to discover the minerals elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|Serpentinization is a {{geological}} low-temperature <b>metamorphic</b> <b>process</b> involving {{heat and}} water in which low-silica mafic and ultramafic rocks are oxidized (anaerobic oxidation of Fe2+ by the protons of water leading {{to the formation of}} H2) and hydrolyzed with water into serpentinite. Peridotite, including dunite, at and near the seafloor and in mountain belts is converted to serpentine, brucite, magnetite, and other minerals — some rare, such as awaruite (Ni3Fe), and even native iron. In the process large amounts of water are absorbed into the rock increasing the volume, reducing the density and destroying the structure.|$|E
50|$|Skarns or tactites are {{calcium-bearing}} calc-silicate rocks. Skarns {{are most}} often formed at the contact zone between intrusions of granitic magma bodies and carbonate sedimentary rocks such as limestone and dolostone. Hot fluids derived from the granitic magma are rich in silica, iron, aluminium, and magnesium. These fluids mix in the contact zone, dissolve calcium-rich carbonate rocks, and convert the host carbonate rock to skarn deposits in a <b>metamorphic</b> <b>process</b> called metasomatism. The resulting metamorphic rock may consist of a very wide variety of minerals dependent largely on the original composition of the magmatic fluids and {{the purity of the}} carbonate sedimentary rocks.|$|E
50|$|Oakley {{stone is}} {{micaceous}}, meaning it is a mica-bearing stone. This mineral gives the product a fish-scale-like sheen.

The green color of the rock {{is the result of}} chromium in the mica which is also known as fuchsite. The original sedimentary rock from which the quartzite formed was a quartz-rich sandstone. During the <b>metamorphic</b> <b>process,</b> the pressure caused the layers of clay within the sandstone to thin and flatten into the mica-rich layers. The space between planes of parting or foliation are consistent which makes it uniform in thickness.|$|E
