500|$|King {{states the}} cover was odd; [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{and a half}} to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E
500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. When I got back, it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E
500|$|... "Raining Blood" [...] {{was covered}} by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls. King has {{admitted}} that he thought the cover was odd: [...] "It took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{and a half to}} find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation". A medley of [...] "Raining Blood" [...] and [...] "Postmortem" [...] appears on Body Count's 2016 album Bloodlust, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time [...] "and always will be"; a video for Body Count's version was released in August of 2017.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Stop! I implore you, {{before you}} answer me, to walk round this place once more. It {{will give you}} <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> time to think, and <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> time to get some fortitude together.' ...|$|R
60|$|The time {{occupied}} by his worship's hums, and haws, and puffs of tobacco smoke, {{together with the}} slow and pompous manner in which he spoke, gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> space to collect my ideas, dispersed as they were by the extraordinary purport of this annunciation.|$|R
2500|$|Stenhouse, who tied a career-best Sprint Cup Series {{finish with}} a runner-up finish in a special paint scheme {{dedicated}} to the late Bryan Clauson, said afterwards that he [...] "knew {{we were going to}} have to get everything perfect, and it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> to get the top going. I wanted to give up when we were two [...] down, but I remembered we had Bryan Clauson’s tribute car here, and his favorite helmet, and I dug deep and the guys dug deep and made a lost of changes that made our Fastenal Ford a lot better. We really wanted to park it in Victory Lane for his whole family and all of his friends and fans for Tim, Di, Taylor and Lauren his fiancée… Just a little bit short." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{what makes}} me think there ain't any, Squire Braile. If you're not in {{too much of a}} hurry, I wish you'd stop and talk to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> I'm in trouble." ...|$|E
