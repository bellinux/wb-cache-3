5|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the approaching hurricane in the Yucatán Peninsula were regarded as calm by the United States media. Mexican officials declared an emergency alert by September 2, although they did not advise any evacuations. Meteorologists in the United States urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately. Fearing significant loss of life and property, the Red Cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize. The following day, the Mexican Army rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities. <b>Mobile</b> <b>communication</b> units and relief teams were prepared for deployment following the storm's passage. Many of the nearly 35,000residents {{in and around the}} city of Chetumal evacuated to higher ground.|$|E

Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for <b>Mobile</b> <b>Communication</b> (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that besides {{the quality of}} service (QoS), the energy efficiency is also a key parameter in designing and evaluating <b>mobile</b> multimedia <b>communication</b> systems, which has catalyzed great interest in recent literature. In this paper, an energy efficiency model is first proposed for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) <b>mobile</b> multimedia <b>communication</b> systems with statistical QoS constraints. Employing the channel matrix singular-value-decomposition (SVD) method, all subchannels are classified by their channel characteristics. Furthermore, the multi-channel joint optimization problem in conventional MIMO-OFDM communication systems {{is transformed into a}} multi-target single channel optimization problem by grouping all subchannels. Therefore, a closed-form solution of the energy efficiency optimization is derived for MIMO-OFDM <b>mobile</b> mlutimedia <b>communication</b> systems. As a consequence, an energy-efficiency optimized power allocation (EEOPA) algorithm is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of MIMO-OFDM <b>mobile</b> multimedia <b>communication</b> systems. Simulation comparisons validate that the proposed EEOPA algorithm can guarantee the required QoS with high energy efficiency in MIMO-OFDM <b>mobile</b> multimedia <b>communication</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|Similar to wired <b>communication,</b> <b>Mobile</b> IP <b>communication</b> is {{susceptible}} to various kinds of attacks. Of these attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attack is considered as a great threat to <b>mobile</b> IP <b>communication.</b> The number of approaches hitherto proposed to prevent DoS attack {{in the area of}} <b>mobile</b> IP <b>communication</b> is much less compared to those for the wired domain and mobile ad hoc networks. In this work, the effects of Denial of Service attack on <b>mobile</b> IP <b>communication</b> are analyzed in detail. We propose to use packet filtering techniques that work in different domains and base stations of <b>mobile</b> IP <b>communication</b> to detect suspicious packets and to improve the performance. If any packet contains a spoofed IP address which is created by DoS attackers, the proposed scheme can detect this and then filter the suspected packet. The proposed system can mitigate the effect of Denial of Service (DoS) attack by applying three methods: (i) by filtering in the domain periphery router (ii) by filtering in the base station and (iii) by queue monitoring at the vulnerable points of base-station node. We evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme using the network simulator NS- 2. The results indicate that the proposed scheme is able to minimize the effects of Denial of Service attacks and improve the performance of <b>mobile</b> IP <b>communication...</b>|$|R
5|$|Using {{conventional}} GSM systems {{was rejected}} also because GSM lacks {{many of the}} functionalities of TETRA, such as group conversations, dispatcher centers, and direct communication. In addition, Global System for <b>Mobile</b> <b>Communication</b> – Railway (GSM-R) was considered, but rejected {{because of the lack}} of trans-border functionality and the need for more base stations, and thus higher investment costs, and longer start-up time for calls. The technology was considered because the Norwegian National Rail Administration was at the time building a GSM-R network to cover the entire Norwegian railway network. Another reason that TETRA was preferred was that at the time of decision there were five manufacturers of TETRA equipment and only two for GSM-R. TETRA also allows a fall-back system, where a base station can allow communication between users within the range of the base station, even if the central parts of the network break down.|$|E
