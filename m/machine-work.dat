Respected sir, this way of talking as if heaven were a kind of Washington patent-office museum--oh, oh, oh!--as if mere <b>machine-work</b> and puppet-work went to heaven--oh, oh, oh!

6000|$|... 20. In {{proportion}} to the increasing spirituality of religion, the conception of worthiness in material offering ceases, {{and with it the}} sense of beauty in the evidence of votive labor; <b>machine-work</b> is substituted for handwork, as if the value of ornament consisted in the mere multiplication of agreeable forms, instead of in the evidence of human care and thought and love about the separate stones; and--machine-work once tolerated--the eye itself soon loses its sense of this very evidence, and no more perceives the difference between the blind accuracy of the engine, and the bright, strange play of the living stroke--a difference as great as between the form of a stone pillar and a springing fountain. And on this blindness follow all errors and abuses--hollowness and slightness of framework, speciousness of surface ornament, concealed structure, imitated materials, and types of form borrowed from things noble for things base; and all these abuses must be resisted with the more caution, and less success, because in many ways they are signs or consequences of improvement, and are associated both with purer forms of religious feeling and with more general diffusion of refinements and comforts; and especially because we are critically aware of all our deficiencies, too cognizant of all that is greatest to pass willingly and humbly through the stages that rise to it, and oppressed in every honest effort by the bitter sense of inferiority. In every previous development the power has been in advance of the consciousness, the resources more abundant than the knowledge--the energy irresistible, the discipline imperfect. The light that led was narrow and dim--streakings of dawn--but it fell with kindly gentleness on eyes newly awakened out of sleep. But we are now aroused suddenly in the light of an intolerable day--our limbs fail under the sunstroke--we are walled in by the great buildings of elder times, and their fierce reverberation falls upon us without pause, in our feverish and oppressive consciousness of captivity; we are laid bedridden at the Beautiful Gate, and all our hope must rest in acceptance of the [...] "such as I have," [...] of the passers by.|$|E
50|$|Wilton C. Dinges {{founded the}} Electric Machine and Equipment Company (Emeco) in 1944 with $300 in savings and a used lathe for <b>machine-work.</b> He started bidding on {{government}} manufacturing contracts {{out of a}} loft in Baltimore, Maryland, beginning with experimental antennas and jet engine parts. Dinges moved to Hanover, Pennsylvania in 1946 {{in order to take}} advantage of the local labor market. He obtained 10,000 pounds of aluminum scrap metal at an attractive price and started using it to build dining table legs. Later he manufactured chair frames and eventually focused completely on aluminum chairs in 1948. The Emeco 1006 chair the company would become known for was one of several furniture products, such as bunks and lockers, Emeco made for the US Navy's fleet during World War II, out of an anodized aluminum material. The business grew by under-bidding other manufacturers on government contracts for office building furniture. By 1953, there were four Emeco factories in Hanover.|$|E
40|$|This work, wrought in {{branch of}} {{engineering}} technology {{in terms of}} baccalaureate studies, mentions the basic type partitioning of screw threads and their screw-threads labelling. There are presented some possibilities of screw threads manufacturing by chip-forming operation and by chipless machining operation, both with using of appropriate tools. Further the methods of production used in small <b>machine-works</b> are described. In this case the small <b>machine-works</b> is represented by secondary technical school...|$|R
50|$|Delahaye began {{experimenting with}} {{belt-driven}} cars while {{manager of the}} Brethon Foundry and <b>Machine-works</b> in Tours, in 1894. These experiments encouraged an entry in the 1896 Paris-Marseille-Paris race, held between 24 September-3 October 1896, fielding one car for himself and one for sportsman Ernest Archdeacon. The winning Panhard averaged 15.7 mph; Archdeacon came sixth, averaging 14 mph, while Delahaye himself was eighth, averaging 12.5 mph.|$|R

The selection procedure was won the Roudnické slévárny a strojírny (Foundries And <b>Machine-Works</b> of Roudnice) with its ROSS R210 project. The R210 was outsourcing many components from Renault. Since 1996 the company delivered 15 vehicles for the testing purposes, after which the delivery of serial vehicles was supposed to start, however in 1998 the Czech Army canceled the contract. The company has invested a lot into {{the development of the}} truck and subsequently it bankrupted.|$|R

50|$|Émile Delahaye {{was born}} in Tours, Indre-et-Loire, in the Loire Valley. He studied {{engineering}} at Arts et Métiers ParisTech trade school {{in the city of}} Angers, the same school later attended by Louis Delâge, another automobile pioneer. For a time, Delahaye worked in Belgium, at the Crail Engineering works, a company known for making steam engines for locomotives, before returning to Tours following the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. Delahaye married in 1873. In 1879, he took over the Brethon Foundry and <b>Machine-works,</b> a local business specializing in the manufacturing of brick kilns and related equipment for the ceramics trade. Delahaye experimented with steam and internal combustion engines, eventually converting part of the company's production to the manufacture of stationary petrol engines. In 1894, he displayed his first automobile at the first-ever Paris Motor Show. It was one of only two motorized entries.|$|R
40|$|This {{exhibition}} catalogue was {{published on the}} occasion of the exhibition 'Alice Kettle: allegory' held at the Crafts Study Centre, Farnham, 24 November 2009 until 13 March 2010, and touring to other UK museums and art centres until Spring 2011. The catalogue includes an essay by Professor Simon Olding. Alice Kettle's exhibition for the Crafts Study Centre reflects an interest in the way that narrative can be expressed through the medium of <b>machine-worked</b> embroidery, both in large wall hangings and in a series of private and symbolic three-dimensional works, using a restrained monochrome palette as well as more vibrant colours. Her recent interest in working in partnership with other artists is also revealed in the exhibition, with the presentation of collaborative pieces with the potter Stephen Dixon, her colleague at Manchester Metropolitan University. The exhibition takes as its starting point the painting by Poussin 'A Dance to the Music of Time' in The Wallace Collection, London...|$|R
40|$|I {{limited the}} content of the work to arms production. Overview of patent law {{development}} in Bohemia in 19 th and a part of 20 th century is not narrowed. Protection of patents - inventors protection law was first adapted by law in 1832, second more sophisticated "new prerogative law" in 1852. Invention protection law from 1897 solves the same issues like prerogative law from 1852. Patent protection was valid for 15 years. There was only one central "patent office" for patent protection of all inventions based in Vienna. "Register of patents" made an entry of granting a patent. Patent court was appropriate for reviewing of the decision of the Office. National Assembly adopted patent law from 1897 and in 1919 extended its validity to "the whole area of Czechoslovakia". The law from 1922 added a lot of partial changes and also listing of fees. In 1923 a new regulation was issued which changed the inner organization of the Patent Office and its personnel. In 1924 Patent Office rules of procedure were modernized. Administration of patents in join-stock company, former Škoda Works, foundation and development of the company. <b>Machine-works</b> in Pilsen came into being in 1859 and ing.
