5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A <b>molecule</b> of lactose is {{formed by the}} combination of a <b>molecule</b> of galactose with a <b>molecule</b> of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and they are unable to digest lactose.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the masing <b>molecule,</b> {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing <b>molecule</b> must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given <b>molecule</b> will take place. The specific conditions for each <b>molecule</b> known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by {{the fact that there is}} no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E
50|$|This same concept can {{be applied}} to other species {{including}} non-hydride AB2 and BAC <b>molecules,</b> HAB and HAAH <b>molecules,</b> tetraatomic hydride <b>molecules</b> (AH3), tetraatomic nonhydride <b>molecules</b> (AB), H2AB <b>molecules,</b> acetaldehyde, pentaatomic <b>molecules</b> (CH3I), hexaatomic <b>molecules</b> (ethylene), and benzene.|$|R
50|$|Nucleic acid <b>molecules</b> {{are usually}} unbranched, and may occur as linear and {{circular}} <b>molecules.</b> For example, bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, mitochondrial DNA, and chloroplast DNA are usually circular double-stranded DNA <b>molecules,</b> while chromosomes of the eukaryotic nucleus are usually linear double-stranded DNA <b>molecules.</b> Most RNA <b>molecules</b> are linear, single-stranded <b>molecules,</b> but both circular and branched <b>molecules</b> {{can result from}} RNA splicing reactions.|$|R

5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A <b>molecule</b> of sucrose is formed by the combination of a <b>molecule</b> of glucose with a <b>molecule</b> of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} <b>molecule</b> is called an amphiphilic <b>molecule.</b> Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
40|$|In mice, two {{families}} of structurally distinct Ia <b>molecules,</b> one designated I-A {{and the other}} I-E, have been identified and characterized. The HLA-DR <b>molecules</b> represent one family of human Ia <b>molecules</b> equivalent to the murine I-E <b>molecules</b> {{on the basis of}} amino acid sequence homology. We describe the isolation and biochemical characterization of a second family of human Ia <b>molecules,</b> designated HLA-DS for second D-region locus, equivalent to the murine I-A <b>molecules.</b> The human HLA-DS <b>molecules</b> consist of two polypeptide chains, DS alpha (37, 000 mol wt) and DS beta (29, 000 mol wt), with 73 % amino acid sequence identity to the murine I-A <b>molecules.</b> Furthermore, the HLA-DS <b>molecules</b> are closely linked genetically to HLA-DR <b>molecules,</b> a situation analogous to that observed in mice. The similarity in molecular weights of the DR and DS <b>molecules</b> might explain why others have failed to identify the latter in man...|$|R
5000|$|Biologists {{often use}} the terms [...] "net movement" [...] or [...] "net diffusion" [...] to {{describe}} the movement of ions or <b>molecules</b> by diffusion. For example, oxygen can diffuse through cell membranes {{and if there is}} a higher concentration of oxygen outside the cell than inside, oxygen <b>molecules</b> diffuse into the cell. However, because the movement of <b>molecules</b> is random, occasionally oxygen <b>molecules</b> move out of the cell (against the concentration gradient). Because there are more oxygen <b>molecules</b> outside the cell, the probability that oxygen <b>molecules</b> will enter the cell is higher than the probability that oxygen <b>molecules</b> will leave the cell. Therefore, the [...] "net" [...] movement of oxygen <b>molecules</b> (the difference between the number of <b>molecules</b> either entering or leaving the cell) is into the cell. In other words, there is a net movement of oxygen <b>molecules</b> down the concentration gradient.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of biologically interesting <b>molecules</b> using cloning and culturing methods allows {{the study and}} manufacture of relevant <b>molecules.</b> Except for excreted <b>molecules,</b> cells producing <b>molecules</b> of interest must be disrupted.

5|$|Acetyl-CoA, on {{the other}} hand, derived from {{pyruvate}} oxidation, or from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one <b>molecule</b> of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every <b>molecule</b> of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that produces CO2 and water, with the energy thus released captured {{in the form of}} ATP.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling <b>molecule</b> cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling <b>molecule</b> triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the CAS protein family, EFS is a {{multi-domain}} docking <b>molecule</b> that lacks any known enzymatic activity, but instead mediates signaling by promoting protein–protein interactions through conserved sequence motifs (Figure 1).|$|E
50|$|Tetrahedral (abbreviated Td) <b>molecules</b> {{are highly}} {{symmetric}} <b>molecules</b> that belong the Td symmetry group. In Td <b>molecules,</b> the dihedral bond angles between adjacent bonds is approximately 109.5°. <b>Molecules</b> within the Td point group include methane, phosphorus pentoxide, and adamantane. Molecular orbitals of Td <b>molecules</b> {{can be determined}} using reducible representations, SALCs and projection operator techniques.|$|R

5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} amide bonds, one amino acid <b>molecule</b> can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a <b>molecule</b> of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA <b>molecule</b> through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the molecules}} that underlie LTP {{can be classified}} as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a <b>molecule,</b> such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a <b>molecule</b> that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first <b>molecule</b> of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second <b>molecule</b> of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling <b>molecule,</b> with this <b>molecule</b> having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E
5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional <b>molecule</b> of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting <b>molecule</b> is called a gene product.|$|E
5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single <b>molecule,</b> but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the <b>molecule</b> (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E

5|$|Interstellar {{acetic acid}} was {{discovered}} in 1996 by {{a team led by}} David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory.

Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first <b>molecule</b> discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas.
