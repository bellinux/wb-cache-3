Sampling theorems for continuous-time signals remain an active research field for decades. The classical Shannon sampling theorem has been extended into various generalized versions. Specifically, Papoulis has showed that a Fourier bandlimited signal can be recovered from several linear time-invariant filtered versions of the original signal, where each channel is sampled at a fraction of the Nyquist rate [7]. In fact, the Papoulis' <b>multichannel</b> <b>sampling</b> theorem can be understood from the framework of filterbanks, which is independently developed in the discrete-time domain. In [8], Brown exhibits the resemblance between the Papoulis' <b>multichannel</b> <b>sampling</b> and the filterbanks and shows that the reconstruction process from multichannel samples is essentially a problem of designing a synthesis filterbank.

40|$|The {{modulated}} wideband converter (MWC) {{is a kind}} of sub-Nyquist {{sampling system}} which is developed from compressed sensing theory. It accomplishes highly accurate broadband sparse signal recovery by <b>multichannel</b> sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> sequences. However, when the number of sparse sub-bands becomes large, the amount of sampling channels increases proportionally. Besides, {{it is very hard to}} adjust the number of sampling channels when the sparsity changes, because its undersampling board is designed by a given sparsity. Such hardware cost and inconvenience are unacceptable in practical applications. This paper proposes a distributed modulated wideband converter (DMWC) scheme innovatively, which regards one sensor node as one sampling channel and combines MWC technology with a broadband cooperative spectrum sensing network perfectly. Being different from the MWC scheme, DMWC takes phase shift and transmission loss into account in the input terminal, which are unavoidable in practical application. Our scheme is not only able to recover the support of broadband sparse signals quickly and accurately, but also reduces the hardware cost of the single node drastically. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that phase shift has no influence on the recovery of frequency support, but transmission loss degrades the recovery performance to a different extent. Nevertheless, we can increase the amount of cooperative nodes and select satisfactory nodes by a different transmission distance to improve the recovery performance. Furthermore, we can adjust the amount of cooperative nodes flexibly when the sparsity changes. It indicates DMWC is extremely effective in the broadband cooperative spectrum sensing network...|$|R

The concentrations of particulate C, determined using only a quartz filter pack sampling system, were low {{by an average of}} 39 %, {{as a result of the}} loss of semi-volatile organic compounds from the particles collected on quartz filters during sampling. The loss was higher during the summer than during the winter sampling periods. The BOSS and IMPROVE quartz filter carbon measurements were in agreement except for a few samples collected during the summer. The fine particulate carbonaceous material concentrations determined using the BOSS have been combined with concentrations of particulate elemental C (soot), sulfate, nitrate, crustal material, and fine and coarse particulate mass from the IMPROVE sampling system, as well as relative humidity, light absorption, and transmissometer measurements of light extinction from IMPROVE. Extinction budgets have been calculated using multilinear regression analyses of the data set. Literature data were used to estimate the change in the mass extinction coefficients for the measured species as a function of relative humidity. The results show carbonaceous material to be the principal contributor to light extinction due to particles during the study period, with the major contributor to light extinction being light-absorbing carbonaceous material.
