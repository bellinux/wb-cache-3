5|$|Rooted in the 1980s {{hardcore}} punk scene, Butthole Surfers {{quickly became}} {{known for their}} chaotic and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and a sound that incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, punk and, later, electronica, {{as well as their}} use of sound <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> tape editing.|$|E
5|$|A Mutant who {{was once}} Xavier's ally and close-friend, Magneto now {{believes}} mutants are superior to humans. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, {{as well as the}} ability to create magnetic fields. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's and all telepathic-based abilities. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information on Cerebro, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> engineering.|$|E
5|$|In Dead or Alive 4 (2005), Ayane {{has pledged}} {{her life to}} her {{half-brother}} and Mugen Tenshin clan leader Hayate, in his cause to destroy the DOATEC for the suffering the company has caused the ninja clans. Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell to blow up the DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E

5|$|On 11 September 1966, Cambodia {{held its}} first open election. Through <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> {{harassment}} (and to Sihanouk's surprise) the conservatives won 75 percent of {{the seats in the}} National Assembly. Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named Prince Sirik Matak; an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk. In addition to these developments and the clash of interests among Phnom Penh's politicized elite, social tensions created a favorable environment for the growth of a domestic communist insurgency in the rural areas.|$|E

Egyptian political scientist Alaa al-Din Desouki blamed the 1952 revolution's shortcomings on Nasser's concentration of power, and Egypt's lack of democracy on Nasser's political style and his government's limitations on freedom of expression and political participation.|$|E

At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> stroke, or no association.|$|E
5|$|He {{originally}} recorded Lagos for his use in-studio, {{but when}} presented {{with the idea of}} sharing the sound for artistic installation, he began to edit the clips for their best representation of Lagos and considered the best method of public dissemination. Home from his Egyptian art program, Ogboh was inspired to create the Lagos Soundscapes project when the artist was able to identify the sounds of his city during a phone call with a friend. As he transitioned to the field, he turned to online help in discussion forums and email. In his installations, Ogboh prefers audio that requires minimal studio <b>manipulation,</b> <b>and</b> does not significantly alter the sounds. Some audio effects come from the recording environment, both surfaces that echo and distort sound, and the effect of traveling with a recorder. His first sound installation was in the Fayoum academy's bathroom, followed by his first Lagos Soundscapes installation at the Lagos African Artists' Foundation in 2009. Ogboh remembered reception mostly around his work's novelty.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E

40|$|The reassigned bandwidth-enhanced {{additive}} sound {{model is}} a high-fidelity representation that allows <b>manipulations</b> <b>and</b> transformations {{to be applied to}} a great variety of sounds, including noisy and nonharmonic sounds. Combining sinusoidal and noise energy in a homogeneous representation, the reassigned bandwidth-enhanced model is ideally suited to sound morphing, and is implemented in the open source software library, Loris. This paper presents methods for using Loris and the reassigned bandwidth-enhanced additive model to achieve high-fidelity sound representations <b>and</b> <b>manipulations,</b> <b>and</b> introduces new software tools allowing non-programmers to avail themselves of the sound modeling <b>and</b> <b>manipulation</b> capabilities of the Loris package...|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> {{the provision of}} decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{has stated}} that the trade of items for real {{currency}} is officially {{a violation of the}} Terms of Service for Final Fantasy XI. In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency, which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300billion gil was removed from circulation. In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar <b>manipulation</b> <b>and</b> commerce. Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.|$|E
5|$|The player builds their {{character}} by spending acquired points {{to increase their}} ratings in the three areas. The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or how far the player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, <b>manipulation,</b> <b>and</b> appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers and investigation). The player is initially assigned points to spend in the three areas, with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah can spend the most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and {{it is impossible to}} accrue enough experience points to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance {{their character}}). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's statistics and abilities. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcupuncture is an {{important}} component part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The therapeutic effects may be influenced by a variety of factors. Stimulation quantity is one of the factors for achieving good therapeutic effects in acupuncture practice. With the development of science and technology, besides the influence of manual manipulations, the parameters adopted for electroacupuncture have become the benchmark of stimulation quantity. This study, by referring to the related literatures, is designed to explore the influence of manual <b>manipulations</b> <b>and</b> electrical parameters on therapeutic effects of acupuncture. The results from the present study show that different manual <b>manipulations</b> <b>and</b> electrical parameters may exert different therapeutic effects of acupuncture, which are closely related to the characteristics of diseases. Different manual <b>manipulations</b> <b>and</b> electrical parameters should be adopted according to syndrome differentiation of TCM. This is very important in acupuncture treatment...|$|R
