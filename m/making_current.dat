50|$|Analytics, {{which is}} often termed as {{business}} intelligence, has come out as new software and hardware that enables businesses to gather and analyse large amounts of information or data. The analytics process {{is made up of}} gathering, analysing, data manipulation and employing the results to answer critical questions such as ‘why’. Analytics was first applied in the admissions department in higher education institutions. The institutions normally used some formulas to choose students from a large pool of applicants. These formulas drew their information from high school transcripts and standardized test scores. In today’s world, analytics is commonly used in administrative units such as fund raising and admissions. The use and application of academic analytics is meant to grow due to the ever-increasing concerns about student success and accountability. Academic analytics primarily marries complex and vast data with predictive modelling and statistical techniques to better decision <b>making.</b> <b>Current</b> academic analytics initiatives are bent to use data to predict students experiencing difficulty (Arnold, & Pistilli, 2012, April). This allows advisors and faculty members to intervene by tailoring procedures which will meet the student’s learning needs (Arnold, 2010). As such, academic analytics possesses the ability to improve learning, student success and teaching. Analytics has become a valuable tool for institutions because of its ability to predict, model and improve decision making.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the soft path was first used for energy {{resource}} management and was developed by Amory Lovins shortly after {{the shock of the}} 1973 energy crisis in the United States. This concept has now been refined and applied to water, most notably by water expert Peter Gleick and David Brooks. The soft path is often framed as a more integrated and effective alternative to supply-side water resource management. Supply-side water management focuses on meeting demands for water through centralized, large-scale physical infrastructure, and centralized water management systems. In the 20th century, this approach focused on constructing bigger dams and drilling deeper wells to access more water to meet projected demands of consumers. More recently, a focus on demand-side management has emerged in regions where water supply is increasingly constrained (see, for example, Peak water), and it focuses on managing demand and <b>making</b> <b>current</b> practices more efficient. The soft path integrates both supply and demand concepts but in a broader context by recognizing that water is a means to satisfy demands for goods and services and asking how much water, of what qualities, is actually required to satisfy those demands efficiently and sustainably. Soft path water planning also requires broader institutional approaches to water management including the application of smart economics, the potential for distributed rather than centralized water systems, and more democratic participation in water policy decisions. Others have described the soft path as [...] "unleashing the full potential of demand-side management.", ...|$|E
