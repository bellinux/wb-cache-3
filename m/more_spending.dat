5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for <b>more</b> <b>spending</b> were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas {{education}} system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included <b>more</b> <b>spending</b> for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E

25|$|The United States {{has been}} the world's largest {{national}} economy in terms of GDP {{since at least the}} 1920s. For many years following the Great Depression of the 1930s, when danger of recession appeared most serious, the government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more, and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged <b>more</b> <b>spending.</b> Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the New Deal era that began in 1933, to the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s, national policy makers relied principally on fiscal policy to influence the economy.|$|E

In humans, men who <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time copulating with their regular partner also perform more “semen-displacing” copulatory behaviors (e. g., deeper, more vigorous penile thrusting). We investigated whether men who <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time performing oral sex on their regular partner also <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time copulating {{with her and}} perform more semen-displacing copulatory behaviors. We proposed and tested the ejaculate adjustment hypothesis for men's copulatory behaviors: Men adjust their copulatory behaviors to increase their sexual arousal and consequent ejaculate quality, thereby increasing their chances of success in sperm competition. Two hundred and thirty-three men in a committed, heterosexual relationship responded to questions about their copulatory behavior and sexual arousal during their most recent sexual encounter with their long-term partner. The results indicated that men who <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time performing oral sex on their partner also <b>spend</b> <b>more</b> time copulating with her, perform more semen-displacing copulatory behaviors, and report greater sexual arousal. We discuss limitations to the current research and highlight the heuristic value of sperm competition theory for understanding human sexual behaviors...|$|R

25|$|Perceiving a {{means of}} revenge, Republican congressmen {{defeated}} Bush's proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by $500billion over five years. Scrambling, Bush accepted the Democrats' demands for higher taxes and <b>more</b> <b>spending,</b> which alienated him from Republicans and {{gave way to a}} sharp decrease in popularity. Bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill. Near the end of the 101st Congress, the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for high-income taxpayers. Although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax, Bush relented on this issue as well. This agreement with the Democratic leadership in Congress proved to be {{a turning point in the}} Bush presidency; his popularity among Republicans never fully recovered.|$|E

In his oral history of Combs, Robinson noted that Ford, thirteen years Combs' junior, [...] "came across better on television" [...] and that many voters in the state felt that Combs must have ulterior motives in leaving a judgeship that paid a salary of $42,500 for the governorship, which paid only $30,000 annually. Catholics were also upset that Combs had married his second wife, Helen Clark Rechtin, just forty-three days after his divorce from Mabel Hall was finalized on July 18, 1969. (Combs and Hall had been separated for five years prior to finalizing the divorce.) Despite these handicaps, many Democrats assumed that Combs, the proven candidate, would easily defeat the newcomer Ford, and fewer than one-third of registered Democrats voted in the primary. In what the Courier-Journal called a [...] "stunning defeat", Ford defeated Combs in the Democratic primary {{and went on to}} win the governorship.|$|E
