5000|$|... "I {{have been}} criticized for 20 years for running ideologically arched campaigns. I plead guilty. I will {{continue}} to run ideologically arched campaigns {{as long as there are}} <b>more</b> <b>conservatives</b> than there are liberals, rather than more Democrats than there are Republicans."

5|$|The Huggins tables {{have not}} been officially tested, but are <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> than the 1956 US Navy tables. They have been {{calculated}} from limits which would theoretically produce venous bubbles 10 to 20% of the time.|$|E
5|$|V-Planner {{runs the}} {{variable}} permeability model, developed by D.E. Yount {{and others in}} 2000, and allows the choice of VPM-B and VPM-B/E, with six conservatism levels (baseline plus five incrementally <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> ones). GAP allows the user to choose between a multitude of Bühlmann-based algorithms and the full reduced gradient bubble model, developed by Bruce Wienke in 2001, in its five conservatism levels (baseline, two incrementally more liberal and two incrementally <b>more</b> <b>conservative).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Self {{selection}} is Gross’s main {{explanation for the}} liberal tendency of academia. Smart young liberals {{are more likely to}} stay in academia after they receive their degree. Young conservatives may chose not to stay in academia based upon its reputation for being liberal. The <b>more</b> <b>conservatives</b> are critical of educational institutions for being liberal, the less likely conservative graduates are to stay and join the professoriate.|$|R

50|$|The congregations in the LCR and the Concordia Lutheran Conference were {{organized}} as the Orthodox Lutheran Conference (OLC), in 1951. The OLC split in 1956 after Prof. Paul E. Kretzmann suspended church-fellowship with some congregations after they {{charged him with}} teaching error in class. These congregations formed the Concordia Lutheran Conference, while the others, along with Kretzmann, joined with <b>more</b> <b>conservatives</b> leaving the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod to organize as the LCR.|$|R
5|$|Although {{unusual in}} the West, school {{corporal}} punishment is not uncommon in <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> areas of the state, with 28,569 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Texas is surpassed only by Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Even {{according}} to the <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> estimate, the auxilia were by this time significantly larger than the legions, which contained c. 155,000 effectives (28 legions of 5,500 men each) at this time, of which just 3,360 were cavalry. (For a detailed breakdown, see section 4: Auxilia deployment in the 2nd century, below).|$|E
5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the Senate was <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> than his senior colleague, George Aiken, and {{reflected}} Flanders's business orientation. In his second term, a Republican majority allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee and the Committee on Armed Services. These assignments reflected his interests as a senator.|$|E
50|$|Foreign aid is {{a highly}} {{partisan}} issue in the United States, with liberals, on average, supporting foreign aid much <b>more</b> than <b>conservatives</b> do.|$|R
50|$|Saudi {{funding to}} Egypt's al-Azhar center of Islamic learning, has been {{credited}} with causing that institution to adopt a <b>more</b> religiously <b>conservative</b> approach.|$|R

5|$|In an {{interview}} from 2008, Yanayev said he regretted making himself acting President, further {{claiming that he}} was pressured by the <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> members to sign the documents which declared his own presidency. He described the events of 1991 as a burden {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive group {{selection}} {{tables for}} repetitive dives were modified. The first repetitive dive {{uses the same}} repetitive group selection as the U.S. Navy tables but subsequent dives use <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> tables which place the diver in a higher repetitive group than the Navy tables would for the same profile. This tendency is continued for {{the third and fourth}} repetitive dives.|$|E
5|$|The PADI tables {{known as}} the PADI Recreational Dive Planner (RDP) were {{developed}} by Raymond Rogers and tested by DSAT (Diving Science And Technology, an affiliate of PADI Inc.). The M values were derived from Spencer's no-stop limits and the repetitive group designators {{were based on a}} 60-minute tissue compartment. This combination resulted in <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> first dives, but less conservative repetitive dives.|$|E
50|$|Davis's {{negative}} ads against Riordan {{appear to have}} contributed to Riordan's defeat in the Republican primary by the <b>more</b> staunchly <b>conservative</b> candidate Bill Simon.|$|R
5000|$|Supreme Court Justices {{opposing}} {{the death penalty}} such as Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer have at multiple times argued in their dissents that the delay and waiting on death row was a factor making capital punishment unconstitutional as a cruel and unusual punishment. Their views were rejected by concurring opinions from <b>more</b> <b>conservatives</b> justices such as Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, who said that this long delay {{was caused by the}} convicts themselves and by [...] "Justices opposed to the death penalty." ...|$|R
25|$|Conservative Judaism {{is divided}} {{on the role of}} the Mussaf Amidah. <b>More</b> {{traditional}} <b>Conservative</b> congregations recite a prayer similar to the Mussaf prayer in Orthodox services, except they refer to Temple sacrifices only in the past tense and do not include a prayer for the restoration of the sacrifices. <b>More</b> liberal <b>Conservative</b> congregations omit references to the Temple sacrifices entirely. Reconstructionist and Reform congregations generally do not do the Mussaf Amidah at all, but if they do, they omit all references to Temple worship.|$|R
5|$|The RGBM {{developed}} by Dr Bruce Wienke at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a hybrid model which modifies a Haldanian model with factors {{to take some}} account of bubble mechanics to model gas phase production during decompression. The bubble factor modifies the M-values of the Haldanian model, making it <b>more</b> <b>conservative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Union Bank of Switzerland {{entered the}} 1990s {{as the largest}} and most {{conservative}} of the three large Swiss Banks. The bank's investments had been in the conservative asset management and life insurance businesses; further, 60% of the bank's profits came from its even <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> Swiss banking operations.|$|E
5|$|Aberhart's {{government}} was re-elected in the 1940 election with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in Calgary; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was soundly defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 {{and was replaced}} as Premier by Ernest Manning, who steered the Social Credit League in a <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> and conventional direction until his 1968 retirement.|$|E
25|$|He {{maintained}} Canada's independent voice {{politically and}} socially {{at a time}} of increasing economic integration with the US and the rise of <b>more</b> socially <b>conservative</b> right-wing politics there.|$|R

50|$|Tommo So Tɔmmɔ sɔ, called Tombo so by Bondum Dom speakers, {{is spoken}} {{in a region}} from Kasa to Bandiagara. It is <b>more</b> linguistically <b>conservative</b> than Toro So.|$|R
5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war, Barkley supported bills implementing conscription and raising revenue for the fight. Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying the tactical situation and meeting with leaders there. Like Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and participation in the League of Nations, but both measures failed after {{the election of a}} <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> Congress in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{can be used}} to generate tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive profile and breathing gas mixtures. The usual procedure is to generate schedules for the intended profile and for the most likely contingency profiles, such as slightly greater depth, delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a <b>more</b> <b>conservative</b> schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E
5000|$|... "Perjury is {{a serious}} crime. This {{newspaper}} argued on behalf of its seriousness in the 1990s, during the Clinton perjury controversy, and today is no different. We'd have hoped that <b>more</b> <b>conservatives</b> would agree. The integrity of the judicial process depends on fact-finding and truth-telling. A jury found Libby guilty of not only perjury but also obstruction justice and lying to a grand jury. It handed down a very supportable verdict. This is true regardless of the trumped-up investigation and political witch hunt. It is true regardless of the unjustifiably harsh sentence." ...|$|R
50|$|Hutchinson {{held the}} seat until 1906 when the Rye reverted to its <b>more</b> usual <b>Conservative</b> representation. After his defeat by George Courthope, Hutchinson did {{not stand for}} Parliament again.|$|R
