In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert <b>M.</b> <b>Lee,</b> commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E

On January 31, 1896 Colonel Albert Jennings Fountain and his eight-year-old son Henry disappeared at the edge of the White Sands area of southern New Mexico. Neither of the Fountains was ever seen again. The Fountain mystery was never officially solved, even with the efforts of Apache scouts, the Pinkertons, and an all-out push by the Republican Party. In April 1896, Garrett was appointed sheriff of Dona Ana County, and two years later had gathered sufficient evidence to make arrests, asking a judge in Las Cruces for warrants to arrest Oliver <b>M.</b> <b>Lee,</b> William McNew, Bill Carr and James Gililland.

Crook ordered Crazy Horse's arrest and then departed, leaving the post commander at Fort Robinson, Lieutenant Colonel Luther P. Bradley, to carry out his order. Additional troops were brought in from Fort Laramie. On the morning of September 4, 1877, two columns moved against Crazy Horse's village, only to find that it had scattered during the night. Crazy Horse had fled to the nearby Spotted Tail Agency with his wife, who had become ill with tuberculosis. After meeting with military officials at Camp Sheridan, the adjacent military post, Crazy Horse agreed to return to Fort Robinson with Lieutenant Jesse <b>M.</b> <b>Lee,</b> the Indian agent at Spotted Tail.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{forensic}} entomology became {{well known}} through {{the trial of}} David Westerfield in 2002 for the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Danielle van Dam. In this San Diego case, the courtroom became a battle over conflicting reports from four forensic entomologists: David Faulkner, Neal Haskell, <b>M.</b> <b>Lee</b> Goff, and Robert D. Hall. A fifth scientist, William Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist, also testified on this issue. Danielle had vanished from her bedroom the night of February 1–2; her partially decomposed body was found February 27. Haskell, Hall, and Faulker argued that forensic entomology established that the body of was dumped in mid-February, during which time Westerfield was already under police surveillance (since February 5), while Goff said the victim's body was colonized by larvae earlier than the other three entomologists estimated (his dates were February 9 to 14). His dates were earlier as he used new data from Canada which gives a significantly slower development for that fly species. Richard Merritt, a forensic entomologist and professor at Michigan State University, stated that because each scientist has his own method, {{this can lead to}} disagreement, {{but a lot of the}} disagreements involve a variation of one or two days, not over a week and a half as in the Westerfield case: “If it's that big a time, someone screwed up”.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, the 12th {{took part}} when the Army was given {{responsibility}} for flying the mail after President Franklin Roosevelt cancelled all civilian contracts because of alleged rate-fixing by the airlines. 12th pilots {{were assigned to}} the difficult and dangerous CAA Route 18, from Salt Lake City, Utah to Oakland, California, via Elko, Nevada, and Sacramento, California. The aircraft they flew were primarily Douglas Y1B-7 bombers. On 1 June 1937, the 12th Observation Squadron left Texas to operate with the 7th Cavalry Brigade, the mechanized forerunner of the First Armored Division, at Fort Knox, Kentucky. While stationed at Fort Knox, the squadron participated in field maneuvers with the mechanized cavalry near Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, and at Fort Riley, Kansas, in 1938; in the First Army maneuvers at Plattsburg, New York in 1939; and in the Third Army maneuvers in Louisiana in 1940. In the summer of 1940, the squadron was the first to be attached to an armored division – the First – and on 2 December, a base detachment was formed at For. Knox to manage Goodman Field, a new and modern airfield still under construction. Captain Robert <b>M.</b> <b>Lee,</b> commanding officer of the 12th, was also detachment commander. Along with the First Armored Division, the 12th Squadron played {{an active role in the}} Carolina and Louisiana Maneuvers from July to December 1941. After those maneuvers, the 12th returned to the recently completed Godman Field, where the unit supplied a cadre to organize the Headquarters Squadron of the 73d Observation Group.|$|E

50|$|During one of <b>Ms.</b> <b>Lee's</b> English classes, Ji-hye {{is caught}} passing notes in class.

Ji-hye, while in the bathroom, immediately calls her mom and cries on the phone to her; not long after her mom appears in the classroom and assaults <b>Ms.</b> <b>Lee.</b> The dean defends the parents and verbally reprimands <b>Ms.</b> <b>Lee</b> while Mr. Jo stands up for her. Mr. Jo is later called into the principal's office, where he is insulted and threatened with termination if he doesn't change Ji-hye's grades. This tears into the conscience of Mr. Jo, a teacher who truly cares about his students - particularly those who aren’t privileged. He returns to class very dejected and starts hitting one of the class clowns that had been misbehaving, but the bully disrespectfully talks back to Mr. Jo and pushes him down; this enrages Du-shik and severely beats up the bully inside the classroom for his insubordination to the teacher. Du-shik, who had generally been under the radar, is now feared and respected by his classmates. Later that evening, Du-shik treats the bully to some drinks as an apology of sorts; there, the bully is confronted by a rival bully from a neighboring school, but Du-shik defends him and ends up beating up his classmate’s rival and his entire crew.|$|R

500|$|In 1937, Carl Hansberry {{purchased}} a property from James Joseph Burke located at 6140 South Rhodes. Anna <b>M.</b> <b>Lee,</b> and other promoters of the covenants, sued to prevent Hansberry's family from {{living in the}} neighborhood. [...] This led to the Hansberry v. Lee, [...] case. Defendants argued that the stipulation made previously in Burke v. Kleiman that more than 95% of the owners had signed the covenant was false and the case should be reajudicated. Plaintiffs, while admitting to the fact, contended that the principle of res judicata barred courts from rehearing the old arguments. The Illinois courts {{ruled in favor of}} plaintiffs. However the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People decided to represent the buyer in the United States Supreme Court.
