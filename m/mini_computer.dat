50|$|Multi User Dungeons and Dragons (MUDD) {{came about}} in the early 1990s. At that time they used to run mainly on UNIX {{workstations}} or <b>mini</b> <b>computers.</b> One of the well known type of MUDD was the DikuMUD. Later, other types or MUDDs showed up such as MUSHes, MUMEes, etc. Later, it was shortened to MUD or Multi-User Dungeon and became a huge forefront to current MMORPG gaming.|$|R
50|$|Since 2006, major OEM PC brands such as HP and Dell {{have begun}} to sell fully {{assembled}} SFF systems. These are often described as bookshelf units since they resemble a miniature tower case {{small enough to fit}} on a bookshelf. The HP Slimline series and Dell C521 (volume 1.65 L) are good examples of this trend. The Maxdata Favorite 300XS is another <b>mini</b> <b>computer.</b> The HP Slimline uses a non-standard motherboard that is very similar in size to Mini-ITX.|$|E
50|$|The 6800 {{architecture}} and instruction set {{were influenced by}} the then popular Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 <b>mini</b> <b>computer.</b> The 6800 has a 16-bit address bus that could directly access 64 KB of memory and an 8-bit bi-directional data bus. It has 72 instructions with seven addressing modes {{for a total of}} 197 opcodes. The original MC6800 could have a clock frequency of up to 1 MHz. Later versions had a maximum clock frequency of 2 MHz.|$|E
50|$|The MX-2 has an {{operating}} pressure of 2.5-4 psi. It is a rear-entry suit, featuring a fiberglass HUT. Air, LCVG cooling water, and power are open loop systems, provided through an umbilical.

50|$|Workstations are {{computers}} that {{are intended to}} serve one user and may contain special hardware enhancements not found on a personal computer. By the mid 1990s personal computers reached the processing capabilities of <b>mini</b> <b>computers</b> and workstations. Also, {{with the release of}} multi-tasking systems such as OS/2, Windows NT and Linux, the operating systems of personal computers could do the job of this class of machines.|$|R
50|$|The {{system bus}} {{connector}} {{was based on}} the K1520 standard for 8-bit computers in the GDR. This conformity to one standard across computers, ranging from tank-sized <b>mini</b> <b>computers</b> to small home computers, allowed the reuse of hardware from minicomputers with the same bus interface. This meant that most of the hardware and binary code from one platform could be used across very different platforms and allowed the sharing of resources.|$|R
50|$|The code of PowerMILL {{originates}} {{from the}} software DUCT which {{was developed in}} 1973 by Donald Welbourn and Ed Lambourne along {{with the help of}} Delta Metal Group, whose funding aided the transferral of the system into industry. DUCT was initially developed with the sponsorship of Control Data in Germany in the form of access to their time-sharing computing resources. The advancement of <b>mini</b> <b>computers</b> from 1982 meant that it became economically viable to design complex 3D shapes using a computer.|$|R

50|$|Teklogix (more fully, Teklogix International Inc.) {{was created}} in 1967 by Lawrence Cragg {{together}} {{with a small group}} of engineers.The company focused on <b>mini</b> <b>computer</b> applications. It designed and built complete systems based upon DEC's PDP-8 computer, DEC's logic modules and purpose built logic. Many of the company's projects involved control of material handling systems and this led to the development of radio linked terminals for installation on fork lift trucks complete with multiplexers to interface to a variety of main frame computer systems.|$|E
5000|$|The Z800 was, in most ways, a <b>mini</b> <b>computer</b> {{inspired}} [...] "super Z80" [...] {{that would}} run existing, and larger, programs at considerably higher speeds. However the address and data buses were multiplexed and the chip was, also in other respects, somewhat complicated to program and interface to. Calculation of exact execution times {{was also very}} much harder to do than for the Z80. Moreover, the plain Z80 were good enough for most applications at the time so the extra computing power was, in many cases, not worth the added complexity. Bad marketing seems to have hurt the product as well.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} {{a number of small}} {{microprocessors}} that implements a stack directly in hardware and some microcontrollers have a fixed-depth stack that is not directly accessible. Examples are the PIC microcontrollers, the Computer Cowboys MuP21, the Harris RTX line, and the Novix NC4016. Many stack-based microprocessors were used to implement the programming language Forth at the microcode level. Stacks were also used as a basis of a number of mainframes and <b>mini</b> <b>computers.</b> Such machines were called stack machines, the most famous being the Burroughs B5000.|$|R
5000|$|Nespoli {{is part of}} Expedition 52/53, {{which started}} in 2017. He {{launched}} on Soyuz MS-05 on July 28, 2017 15:41 UTC. Nespoli's mission to the ISS is called VITA. Vita is an acronym for Vitality, Innovation, Technology and Ability. In addition, in Italian it means life, reflecting the scientific experiments and the technologies needed for life in space. Additional activities will include outreach like Mission-X: Train Like an Astronaut, the European Astro Pi Challenge (where European students run their own code on Raspberry Pi <b>mini</b> <b>computers</b> installed on the ISS).|$|R
