500|$|In [...] "Cautionary Tales", Elle {{comes back}} to the United States. Former Company {{employee}} Noah Bennet captures Elle for collateral, as Bob had captured his daughter, Claire. He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties her bare feet together and puts them in a <b>metal</b> <b>dog</b> bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests the Haitian had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and West as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she can hurt him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, Mohinder Suresh, a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust.|$|E

40|$|Landmines are {{the most}} lethal form of soil contamination. Long after the ending of {{military}} conflicts buried landmines cause people to get maimed and killed. The widespread scattering of unexploded ordnance (UXO) around former conflict areas causes similar problems. An estimated total 100 million landmines are scattered in more than 60 {{countries around the world}} (ICBL, 2001). In the last decade the efforts for humanitarian demining have intensified. However, at the current rate of demining it will take ages for all mines to be removed. There have been widespread efforts to develop technologies that may aid or substitute sniffing <b>dogs,</b> <b>metal</b> detectors and prodding techniques, which are currently used to detect landmines. The fact that none of the proposed methods is used on a wide scale in field operations is partly due to the effect of spatial and temporal variability in soil and environmental conditions on the soil-minesensor system (Van Dam et al., In press). Among the proposed technologies for landmine detection are ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and thermal infrared imaging. A GPR antenna transmits electromagnetic waves between around 0. 1 to 5 GHz.

40|$|The safe, reliable, and {{efficient}} detection and subsequent removal of buried landmines or other unexploded ordnance (UXO) still remains a challenge. According to Landmine Monitor (2015), almost 60 states suffer {{the threat of}} antipersonnel mine contamination, while the total extent of contaminated areas {{is likely to be}} thousands of square kilometers and the total number of threat objects may be well over 100 million. In contrast, total annual clearing rates are in the order of about 230, 000 landmines and about 200 km 2 for the year of 2014, as the number of new contaminations continues to grow. Although non-technical surveillance for the identification of contamination improves slowly, more progress is needed in the basic detection of UXO. Although many new technologies have been investigated the last 20 years, the classical ones like <b>metal</b> detectors and <b>dogs</b> in cooperation with humans operators are still the most commonly ones used today. Hence, the detection process for many scenarios is unacceptably slow and dangerous for the operators, as they are typically less than 1 m away from the threats.

40|$|Dogs can be {{very good}} {{indicators}} for the environmental pollution. They share the same environment as humans and are exposed to action of the same pollutants. Contamination of the environment with heavy metals is performed by emissions of different origin, especially present in the urban areas. That is why it was great advantage to analyze the heavy <b>metal</b> levels in <b>dogs</b> from several urban areas in Macedonia. The objectives {{of this study were}} examination and analyzing the content of two heavy metals: cadmium and lead in dogs. For these purposes dog's hair samples were used. Samples were collected from 35 dogs from different localities. They were analyzed using the method of atomic absorption spectrometry. Statistical data processing was performed. Mean lead level in the hair samples from Veles, Bitola and Prilep were: 930. 15, 715. 66 and 525. 63 &# 956;g/kg; while for cadmium were: 54. 28, 42. 65 and 27. 82 &# 956;g/kg respectively. According to reference intervals for hair elements all the values are in normal ranges (for Cd < 100 &# 956;g/kg, and for Pb< 2000 &# 956;g/kg). Comparison of the results between these areas showed significance in arithmetic means (< 0. 05) between Veles and Prilep for Pb and absolute significance (< 0. 001) in arithmetic means for Cd between Veles and Prilep.

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 67 - 86. 1. Introduction [...] 2. Literature review [...] 3. Materials {{and methods}} [...] 4. Results [...] 5. Discussion [...] 6. Conclusions. Intense urbanization, {{industrial}} development {{and population growth}} is responsible for reducing environmental quality and in particular increasing the concentrations of contaminants in soils. Exposure to toxic metals and other contaminants in urban soils may be affecting not only the environment, but also the health of humans and other animals. This may especially be the case for those {{in cities such as}} Sydney who are living in residential developments that are in close proximity to past and present industrial centres. This research investigates the utility of domestic dog hair as a surrogate method to determine levels of contamination that may present risks to human health. Because domestic dogs live in the same environment as their owners, the presence of <b>metals</b> in <b>dog</b> hair may indicate a potential risk to human health through soil, dust and atmospheric emissions. Positive linear correlations were found between all metal(loid) s analysed (Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Pb and Hg) and domestic dog hair and soil (p < 0. 05). The strongest correlation between soil and hair concentrations was found for Cr (Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) 0. 355), while there was a weak to negligible relationship for Cu, Zn, As, Hg and Pb (PCCs 0. 090, 0. 084, 0. 137, 0. 089 and 0. 022, respectively). Linear regression analyses showed that correlations were significantly positive for Cr, Cu, Hg and Pb concentrations in dog hair and residential soil, very weakly positive for Zn concentrations and negative for As concentrations. The result also indicated that physiological, ecological and environmental parameters such as age, hair colour, gender and type of diet affected uptake of metals, although this the effect was less for Zn, which is present in most dry dog foods. While there are no national or international standards or guidelines for metal concentrations in hair, the use of hair as a biological matrix offers significant advantages in terms of ease of collection and ethics approval compared with blood and other body tissues. While the correlation between soil and hair concentrations for Pb, As and Hg was weak, any concentration of these metal(loids) in body tissue represents a health risk, and accordingly further research to develop guidelines for contamination exposure using hair has utility, as does the use of domestic dogs as a sentinel for potential human health risks.

40|$|Abstract. Some of {{the most}} perfidious {{remnants}} of war are mines threatening not only combating parties but also innocent civilian lives. Moreover, they make large areas inaccessible that otherwise could be used economically. This threat exists even long after cessation of hostile actions. Up to now, the range of tools for humanitarian demining is confined to mine detection <b>dogs,</b> <b>metal</b> detectors, prodders, manual excavation tools and mechanical clearance machines (flails and tillers). In 1999, this gave rise for the Board of Directors of the EFNDT to suggest whether detection methods commonly applied may also be helpful in detecting mines and the like. It was proposed to transfer existing NDT technology to these areas. As a consequence, Working Group 5 “Antipersonnel Landmine Detection (APLD) ” was founded to support this concept. As soon as the group {{became aware of the}} fact that mines were encountered not only in the soil but also elsewhere the name was changed to “Antipersonnel Mine Detection (APMD) ”. It now is becoming more and more obvious that vicious devises such as mines and bombs threatening lives everywhere represent an increasing risk to everybody. In contrast, the particular interest in antipersonnel mine detection is decreasing in favour of general security and safety. However, all these problems have in common that such devices need to be detected in time, i. e. before they become effective. This gives reason to extend the scope of the existing Working Group 5 accordingly. It is of advantage to exchange existing knowledge and there is a chance to keep the awareness of the mine problem alive by this way...|$|R
