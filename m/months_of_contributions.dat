3000|$|In {{traditional}} {{unemployment insurance}} schemes the eligibility for benefits – {{and often the}} level of benefits – depend {{on the number of}} <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions.</b> In fact, there is usually a minimum number of contributions that is needed, for instance six months, to qualify for benefits. These eligibility conditions are ad-hoc since they do not establish a transparent link between the contributions made by individuals and the benefits they receive. Yet, they are introduced as a mechanism to control costs and abuse. It is unclear, however, that the rule makes a big difference. As an illustration, take the case of a program that requires six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> to be eligible for, say, 3 months of unemployment benefits. With a contribution rate of 4 percent, under regular conditions, six <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> would be just enough to finance one quarter of a month’s salary. Implicitly, therefore, the UI system would be allowing borrowing for as much as 2.75 months of salaries. People in this situation, once re-employed, would regain eligibility for benefits after a contribution period of six months. Those who become unemployed after six months would then {{be able to have a}} negative balance equivalent to 5.5 months of salaries: 2.75 minus 0.25 resulting from the new contributions plus 3 more months of benefits. So under this type of rule, individuals who contribute the minimum to receive unemployment benefits and remain unemployed for the maximum period of time would accumulate an ever growing ‘debt.’ [...]...|$|E

3000|$|In Denmark in the 1990 s, {{the public}} support {{incentive}} structure has been classified {{as being too}} generous by numerous OECD reports. 11 To be entitled to unemployment benefit, the requirement is, besides the membership of an unemployment fund, {{at least six months}} of work within the last three years and availability to take on a job.

30|$|Unemployment {{individual}} {{savings accounts}} have both, proponents and opposers. The main advantage over UI {{which has been}} emphasized in the literature is that, because benefits are financed out of individuals' savings, workers have better incentives to seek and take jobs (Robalino et al. 2009). Indeed, balances in the individual account can, under certain conditions, be used to finance investments such as education or {{the purchase of a}} house, or to increase the pension’s value upon retirement. The main criticism, however, is that in their pure form they do not provide enough protection to workers, particularly low skilled workers who tend to have shorter contributions densities (and therefore lower savings) and might have more frequent periods of unemployment. The fact that benefits are often paid as a lump sum can also be problematic as there is a risk that workers over consume and run out of savings before having found a job. In addition, since benefits are financed only out of savings, contributions rates are usually high (e.g., 8 percent to finance one month of unemployment benefits after 12 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>contributions)</b> and this can reduce incentives to enroll or game the system. Below market interest rates on savings can have the same effect, particularly when access to credit is constrained and individuals cannot 'dis-save'. In the case of Brazil, for instance, there is evidence of increases in turnover as workers try to cash-out part of the savings in their accounts (World Bank 2009).|$|E

40|$|The Philippines has a {{publicly}} managed, defined-benefit old-age income scheme {{as part of}} its Social Security System (SSS), established in 1957. Participation is compulsory for all private sector employees and the self-employed with monthly earnings in excess of 1, 000 pesos. The system provides full retirement pension benefits at age 60 with 120 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>contribution.</b> Monthly pension benefits equal the average of a worker’s most recent 60 monthly salary credits multiplied by 2 % for each year of credited service, plus 300 pesos (29. 47 P = US $ 1. 00, 1997; 40. 89 P = US $ 1. 00, 1998). Minimum pensions of 1, 200 and 2, 400 pesos are available after at least 10 and more than 20 years of credited service, respectively. A thirteenth month pension is paid in December. Those who do not qualify for pensions receive a refund <b>of</b> all <b>contributions</b> with interest. Financing for the system comes from an 8. 4 % payroll tax on the first 12, 000 pesos of monthly earnings divided between employees (3. 33 %) and employers (5. 07 %).

The <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> maternal stimulation to toddler performance and whether associations among toddler abilities might be explained by maternal behaviors were also examined. Although measures of toddler language covaried, language-play associations in toddlers were specific to semantic aspects of language.

Moreover, relations among toddler abilities maintained after maternal influences were partialed. The multidimensional structure of language and specificities in language-play associations were discussed with reference to models of early representational development. Developmental psycholinguists theorize that nonlinguistic representations of the world contribute to, as well as constrain, the structure of child language and the course of its development (e. g., Bloom, 1973; Brown, 1973; de Villiers & de Villiers, 1992).

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{characteristics}} and prevalence of late potentials (LP) in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) etiologies and evaluate their value as targets for catheter ablation. BackgroundLP are frequently found in post-myocardial infarction scars and are useful ablation targets. The relative prevalence and characteristics of LP in patients with NICM is not well understood. MethodsThirty-three patients with structural heart disease (NICM, n = 16; ICM, n = 17) referred for catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia were studied. Electroanatomic mapping was performed endocardially (n = 33) and epicardially (n = 19). The LP were defined as low voltage electrograms (100 ms after the QRS. ResultsWe sampled an average of 564 ± 449 points and 726 ± 483 points in the left ventricle endocardium and epicardium, respectively. Mean total low voltage area in patients with ICM was 101 ± 55 cm 2 and 56 ± 33 cm 2, endocardial and epicardial, respectively, compared with NICM of 55 ± 41 cm 2 and 53 ± 28 cm 2, respectively. Within the total low voltage area, vLP were observed more frequently in ICM than in NICM in endocardium (4. 1 % vs. 1. 3 %; p = 0. 0003) and epicardium (4. 3 % vs. 2. 1 %, p = 0. 035).

The model includes vertical transport in form of eddy diffusion and deep convection, zonal transport by a vertically uniform wind, and a simplified chemistry of NO, NO 2 and HNO 3. The NO(x) sources considered are surface emissions (mostly from the combustion of fossil fuel), lightning, aircraft emissions, and downward transport from the stratosphere.

Objective The study {{examined}} the content and frequency of messages to an Internet support group, using a conceptual framework based on support-giving and emotional work. The main questions addressed concerned what correspondents seem to be gaining from their involvement and whether the high-frequency correspondents differ motivationally from the lower-frequency correspondents. Methods Messages to an Internet support group for women with breast cancer were collected over 12 <b>months.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>contributions</b> written by individual correspondents could be determined. Messages were reliably coded for their main themes in terms of seeking or providing support. Results The majority of correspondents (94 %) wrote fewer than 10 messages. Two high-frequency correspondents emerged whose messages significantly less often referred to seeking and more often to providing support than did the messages of the less-frequent correspondents. These volunteer emotion workers both reported gaining personal satisfaction from their role.

The instantaneous field of view of the instrument is 45 arcmin (FWHM) and its resolution ranges from 3 to 10 arcmin; larger fields can be imaged by mosaicing. At this frequency and resolution, the primary foreground is due to discrete extragalactic sources, which are monitored at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory and subtracted from the CBI visibility measurements.

To harness the potential of crowdsourcing, researchers have often relied and successfully used crowd marketplaces such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. However, in spite of a large worker base and past successes, these platforms come with their own limitations. 40 % of all the tasks are spam on Mechanical Turk; and it’s also difficult to accomplish tasks which require a broader participation base, or expert knowledge. Citizen crowd, at the same time, involves distributed group of people with diverse background and skills; who might organize to accomplish tasks or solve problems without engaging with paid crowd platforms. The motivation for them lies in reasons other than micro-payments. In this dissertation, I explore problems of varying size and duration, where mobilizing the citizen crowd can achieve worthwhile goals. To investigate the possibilities with citizen crowdsourcing, I built systems and ran initiatives that require different level of expertise.
