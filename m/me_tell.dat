5|$|There {{seems to}} prevail the opinion in some {{quarters}} that this meeting has been called {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike preparations on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

5000|$|... "Naked" [...] sampled two sound bits {{from the}} film Batman Forever. In the {{beginning}} of the song dialogue from the motion picture was included: [...] "Relax. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> your dreams, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> your fantasies, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> your secrets, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> your deepest, darkest, fears." [...] In the middle 8 of the song, the Riddler's growls were heard.|$|R

25|$|In December 2016, Schumer {{demanded a}} congressional inquiry into Russian meddling of U.S. affairs. In January 2017 he said “Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, {{you take on}} the {{intelligence}} community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you,” in response to those questioning the U.S. intelligence community over its assessments. Later that month he introduced legislation to limit executive action on Russian sanctions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] the {{policeman}} said, {{looking at me}} sulkily, [...] "she may open her door for that, but it'll no let <b>me</b> in. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> mair. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> wha the leddy at the manse is." ...|$|R

25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story {{in her own}} words, in the literal sense that she can use only the words she is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of {{events leading up to}} {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
500|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, though— there's a huge {{difference}} between the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix. They're {{not even close to}} the same. In one, the cobbles are used every day by the cars, and kept up, and stuff like that. The other one— it's completely different ... The best I could do would be to describe it like this— they plowed a dirt road, flew over it with a helicopter, and then just dropped a bunch of rocks out of the helicopter! That's Paris–Roubaix. It's that bad— it's ridiculous." [...] - Chris Horner ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} days of his treatment, Van Gogh {{repeatedly}} and unsuccessfully asked for Gauguin, who asked a policeman attending the case to [...] "be kind enough, Monsieur, to awaken this man with great care, and if he asks for <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> him I have left for Paris; the sight of me might prove fatal for him." [...] Gauguin fled Arles, never to see Van Gogh again. They continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin proposed they form a studio in Antwerp. Other visitors to the hospital included Marie Ginoux and Roulin.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> her that I did not like her, but I did not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E
500|$|St. Leger took {{advantage}} of his victory to deliver another demand for the fort's surrender, which Gansevoort also rejected. The next day St. Leger sent in a third surrender demand, which included (false) news that Burgoyne was in Albany as well as threats that the Indians would be permitted to massacre the garrison and destroy the Mohawk valley communities from which the garrison was drawn. [...] In an eloquent refusal, Lieutenant Colonel Willett responded, [...] "By your uniform you are British officers. Therefore let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you that the message you have brought is a degrading one for a British officer to send and by no means reputable for a British officer to carry." ...|$|E
500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you fire me or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} hospitable to him, and Lady Clara very kind, {{and he wrote}} to <b>me</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> of your kindness. Ahem! this is {{tolerable}} claret. I wonder where Clive gets it?" ...|$|R

"If {{you wish}} to criticize my work, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> you can predict and explain legal and related {{behavior}} better than I can. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> my work is not as testable as something else, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{it is not as}} general as something else, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> it is less elegant than something else, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that it has already been published, or just <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> it is wrong. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> something relevant to what I am trying to accomplish — something scientific." ...|$|R
2500|$|In his memoirs, A Moveable Feast, Ernest Hemingway {{wrote that}} [...] "Zelda Fitzgerald... {{leaned forward and}} said to <b>me,</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> her great secret, 'Ernest, don't you think Al Jolson is greater than Jesus?'" ...|$|R
500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> a story any better. It's not like I have a problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E
500|$|Pinter quoted Father John Metcalf {{speaking}} to Raymond Seitz, then Minister at the US Embassy in London, [...] "My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a cultural centre. We {{have lived in}} peace. A few months ago a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." [...] Seitz responded, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you something. In war, innocent people always suffer." [...] Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq [...] "an arbitrary military action inspired {{by a series of}} lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.|$|E
500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E

"Now, Ian," [...] said Victor, {{leaning against}} the wooden bar at his back, and resting his paddle across the canoe, [...] "Venus <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that the sun is about to bestir himself, and {{something}} within <b>me</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> that empty space is a bad stomachic; so, out with the pemmican bag, and hand over a junk." ...|$|R
500|$|She made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War. [...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you something: For {{the first time in my}} adult lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you what I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
6000|$|Imogene did {{not answer}} him at once. Then she turned upon him a face of radiant self-abnegation. [...] "I will do {{anything}} you <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> Only <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> things to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fainted! {{nearly in}} your arms! Oh, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all, Glastonbury,' exclaimed Ferdinand, {{starting}} {{up in his}} bed with an eager voice and sparkling eyes. 'Does she love me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me, [...] The call of my nearest lover, putting forth, alarm'd, uncertain, [...] The sea I am {{quickly to}} sail, come <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> [...] Come <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where I am speeding, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> my destination.|$|R
