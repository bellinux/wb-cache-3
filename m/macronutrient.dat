5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the lignin and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to lignin and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down lignin, which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important <b>macronutrient</b> influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionDifferent {{studies have}} shown the role of micro and <b>macronutrients</b> on {{cognitive}} function. <b>Macronutrients</b> {{have been involved in}} many metabolic activities of the body including oxidation and reduction reactions in the central nervous system. This involvement of <b>macronutrients</b> in the activities of central nervous system indicates its role in cognition. The present study is designed to know the role of <b>macronutrients</b> and its relation with cognition by using biological samples. Materials and methodsA total of 337 subjects {{with a mean age of}} 49 participated in the cross sectional study from different parts of Kerala state in India. Individuals participating in this study were administered a series of neuropsychological test batteries with major emphasis on 7 -min screen test. All test procedures were administered by standard protocol after a written consent was obtained from the participating subjects. Analysis of <b>macronutrients</b> level of magnesium, calcium and phosphorus was done by using serum samples and the data obtained were then statistically analyzed using SPSS software version 17. ResultsThe <b>macronutrients</b> magnesium, calcium and phosphorus were found to be significantly related to the cognitive score. Increasing magnesium and calcium level was associated with higher cognitive score (P< 0. 0031 and 0. 001 respectively), while lower phosphorus level was significantly associated with lower composite score (P< 0. 001). ConclusionThe results of our study give us an expression that <b>macronutrients</b> such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus may be associated with cognitive function in elderly population of our state. But further studies on a larger population are required to come out with a definite conclusion...|$|R

25|$|Fatty acids are {{a family}} of {{molecules}} classified within the lipid <b>macronutrient</b> class. One role of fatty acids in animal metabolism is energy production, captured {{in the form of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP). When compared to other <b>macronutrient</b> classes (carbohydrates and protein), fatty acids yield the most ATP on an energy per gram basis, when they are completely oxidized to CO2 and water by beta oxidation and the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids (mainly in the form of triglycerides) are therefore the foremost storage form of fuel in most animals, {{and to a lesser extent}} in plants. In addition, fatty acids are important components of the phospholipids that form the phospholipid bilayers out of which all the membranes of the cell are constructed (the cell wall, and the membranes that enclose all the organelles within the cells, such as the nucleus, the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus). Fatty acids can also be cleaved, or partially cleaved, from their chemical attachments in the cell membrane to form second messengers within the cell, and local hormones in the immediate vicinity of the cell. The prostaglandins made from arachidonic acid stored in the cell membrane, are probably the most well known group of these local hormones.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{health risk}} {{identified}} for trans fat consumption is an elevated risk of {{coronary artery disease}} (CHD). A 1994 study estimated that over 30,000 cardiac deaths {{per year in the}} United States are attributable to the consumption of trans fats. By 2006 upper estimates of 100,000 deaths were suggested. A comprehensive review of studies of trans fats published in 2006 in the New England Journal of Medicine reports a strong and reliable connection between trans fat consumption and CHD, concluding that [...] "On a per-calorie basis, trans fats appear to increase the risk of CHD more than any other <b>macronutrient,</b> conferring a substantially increased risk at low levels of consumption (1 to 3% of total energy intake)".|$|E
2500|$|Low-calorie diets {{are also}} {{referred}} to as balanced percentage diets. Due to their minimal detrimental effects, these types of diets are most commonly recommended by nutritionists. In addition to restricting calorie intake, a balanced diet also regulates <b>macronutrient</b> consumption. From the total number of allotted daily calories, it is recommended that 55% should come from carbohydrates, 15% from protein, and 30% from fats with no more than 10% of total fat coming from saturated forms. For instance, a recommended 1,200 calorie diet would supply about 660 calories from carbohydrates, 180 from protein, and 360 from fat. Some studies suggest that increased consumption of protein can help ease hunger pangs associated with reduced caloric intake by increasing the feeling of satiety. Calorie restriction in this way has many long-term benefits. After reaching the desired body weight, the calories consumed per day may be increased gradually, without exceeding 2,000 net (i.e. derived by subtracting calories burned by physical activity from calories consumed). Combined with increased physical activity, low-calorie diets are thought to be most effective long-term, unlike crash diets, which can achieve short-term results, at best. Physical activity could greatly enhance the efficiency of a diet. The healthiest weight loss regimen, therefore, is one that consists of a balanced diet and moderate physical activity.|$|E

The nutrient requirement of an animal is determined by the animal’s species, age, size, and production level. Young animals need nutrients for growth.
