500|$|In 1992 CMLL head writer Antonio Peña {{left the}} company to create his own wrestling {{promotion}} Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA; Spanish for [...] "Assistance, Consulting and Administration") promotion; Palomeque {{was one of the}} many young wrestlers who left CMLL to work for the newly formed AAA. In AAA, his ring personal was changed and he became [...] "Winners" [...] (sometimes written Winner's), a fan favorite character (known as a Técnico in Lucha Libre) who wore a silver bodysuit and mask. Palomeques work as [...] "Winners" [...] earned him a match on the very first Triplemanía where he teamed with Super Caló and El Salsero to defeat the team of May Flowers, Rudy Reyna, and Baby Sharon in a Six Man Tag Team match. The following year at Triplemanía II-A he teamed up with Rey Misterio and Rey Misterio, Jr. to defeat the team known as Los Destructores (Tony Arce, Vulcano, and Rocco Valente). In 1995, Winners participated in a Relevos Suicidas Tag Team match, in which the losing team members have a match of their own, with the loser of that encounter being forced to unmask. Winners team won the match, keeping him from having to defend his mask in a match. Eight days later at Triplemanía III-B, Winners' mask was on the line in a match against Marabunta; Winners defeated <b>Marabunta</b> in a Luchas de Apuestas, Mask vs. Mask match. On June 30, 1995, at Triplemanía III-C, Winners participated in another [...] "mask vs. mask" [...] match, his third in three weeks. This time, Winners was not successful, as he lost to Super Caló and was forced to unmask. The loss of the mask did not hurt Winners' popularity, on the contrary it intensified as the hansome Palomeque became even more popular with the female fans. Despite losing his mask to Super Caló the two continued to work together as a team. On June 15, 1996, Winners and Caló teamed up with Rey Misterio, Jr. and Oro, Jr. to defeat the team of Perro Silva, Halloween, Kraken, and Mosco de la Merced at Triplemanía IV-B. A month later, Winners, Caló, La Parka and El Mexicano defeated Jerry Estrada, Fishman, Villano IV, and May Flowers in one of the featured matches of Triplemanía IV-C.|$|E

2500|$|As is {{tradition}} with recent major AAA shows the wrestlers compete inside a hexagonal wrestling ring {{and not the}} four sided ring the promotion uses for television events and House shows.

2500|$|Triplemanía III-A was {{the first}} of three parts of the third Triplemanía wrestling show series {{promoted}} by Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA). 1995 was second year to feature the [...] "Triplemanía Series" [...] of shows with 3, referred to as III-A, III-B and III-C. The show took place on June 10, 1995 in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. The Main event featured a 13-wrestler Steel Cage Elimination match, Lucha de Apuestas [...] "Mask vs. Mask" [...] match featuring the [...] "Mini-Estrellas" [...] division. The participants included Ninjita, Espectrito I, Espectrito II, Jerrito Estrada, Fuercita Guerrera, Mascarita Sagrada, Mini Calo, Octagoncito, La Parkita, Payasito Rojo, Payasito Azul, Super Muñequito, and Torerito. This marked the first and so far only time that the [...] "Minis division" [...] was featured in the main event of a Triplemanía. The show also featured the first of three Lucha de Apuestas, mask vs. mask match series for the Triplemanía III shows as the culmination of a storyline feud between the tecnico team (faces, those that portray the good guys) of Super Caló and Winners against the Rudo (heels, those that portray the bad guys) team known as Los Diabolicos ("The Diabolical Ones"; Ángel Mortal and <b>Marabunta).</b> Six of the eight matches were later shown on AAA's weekly Televisa show.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} storylines that would {{highlight}} not only Triplemanía III-A but also Triplemanía III-B and Triplemanía III-C was the feud between the two masked, young técnicos, Super Caló and Winners, fighting against therudo team known as Los Diabolicos, {{in this case the}} two masked members <b>Marabunta</b> and Ángel Mortal. The basic storyline centered around two the [...] "veteran" [...] wrestlers in Los Diabolicos getting annoyed with the fan reaction Super Caló and Winners were getting without, in their opinion, earning it by proving themselves in the ring. In the weeks prior to Triplemanía Los Diabolicos had faced off against Super Caló and Winners, often in six-man tag team match with the third Diabolic Mr. Condor against Caló, Winners and various young tecnicos. During those matches Los Diabolicos would often either steal the mask of their opponents, or rip the masks apart during their matches. This led to all four wrestlers signing a contract for a series of Lucha de Apuesta, or bet matches, where each competitor would wager their mask on the outcome of the match. In Lucha Libre a Lucha de Apuestas match is viewed as more prestigious than a championship match and is often promoted as the main event of major shows. The three match series would mean that three out of the four wrestlers would be unmasked by the time the third and final Triplemanía III match was over.|$|E
