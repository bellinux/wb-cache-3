5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious <b>morale</b> <b>and</b> disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's <b>morale</b> <b>and</b> disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E
5|$|Two {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} against Adi Da {{and the church}} in California in 1985. The O'Mahoney suit was dismissed the next year.

5|$|Australian Prime Minister John Curtin officially {{announced}} {{the loss of}} the cruiser during the afternoon of 30 November. Sydneys destruction was a major blow to Australian <b>morale</b> <b>and</b> military capability: her ship's company made up 35% of the RAN's wartime casualties. The cruiser's loss did not have the same impact internationally; two British capital ships were destroyed during the same fortnight, and Japan entered World War II with attacks on Pearl Harbor and Singapore three weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Between September 1988 and January 1989, sailors aboard Iowa {{reportedly}} conducted little {{training with}} her main guns, {{in part because}} of ongoing, serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets.

5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} would at least be a blow to British <b>morale</b> <b>and,</b> perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{subsequently}} formed Army of the Potomac {{had high}} <b>morale</b> <b>and</b> was extremely {{proud of their}} general, some even referring to McClellan as the saviour of Washington.

5|$|In 'Empire Mode,' {{the player}} can choose a ruler for their forces, {{along with two}} main generals. Three minor lieutenants can also be chosen for support.

5|$|In response, the Athenian navy under Xanthippus {{joined with}} the Allied fleet off Delos.

5|$|The battle {{resulted}} in a major Wallachian victory and disaster for Charles Robert, becoming {{a turning point in}} the politics of Hungary, which had to abandon its hopes of extending the kingdom to the Black Sea.

5|$|The fall of Atlanta was {{especially}} noteworthy for its political ramifications. In the 1864 election, former Union general George B.

5|$|The mass {{influx of}} {{refugees}} presented various social issues for South Vietnam.

5|$|Although the UN {{casualties}} were moderate during the battle, the Third Battle of Seoul {{was a significant}} success for the Chinese military in Korea, and the UN forces' morale had sunk to its lowest point during the war. Ridgway was also extremely displeased {{with the performance of}} Eighth Army, which he had no control over due to the sudden death of Walker. Ridgway then took immediate steps to restore the <b>morale</b> <b>and</b> fighting spirit of the UN forces in Korea. With Ridgway leading the Eighth Army, MacArthur started to regain confidence in UN forces' ability to hold Korea, and the UN evacuation plan was abandoned on January 17.|$|E
