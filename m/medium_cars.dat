50|$|The Y-block {{engine is}} a family of {{overhead}} valve V8 automobile engines produced by Ford Motor Company. It was introduced in 1954 on Ford trucks and cars to replace the side-valved Ford Flathead V8, and replaced by the Ford FE engine (on <b>medium</b> <b>cars)</b> and the Ford Windsor engine (on small cars) in 1962, and lasted until 1964 in Ford trucks.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{with the}} benefit of today's {{technology}} (aftermarket rods and stroker cranks), the real limit of a Y-block is about 348 cid L, while the Chevrolet could be modified well past the factory limit of 400 cid L.

5000|$|The Mitsubishi GS platform, {{also known}} as [...] "Project Global", is used in compact cars in North America, small family cars in Europe, and lower <b>medium</b> <b>cars</b> in Japan. It was first {{developed}} during DaimlerChrysler's tenure as Mitsubishi's controlling shareholder between 2001 and 2005. Mitsubishi were also given responsibility for developing small and medium car platforms for the entire group during this time, although since the German and Japanese companies' divorce Chrysler, who were dependent on Mitsubishi, now claim greater autonomy in platform development. All Mitsubishi vehicles using the GS platform are made in Japan, beginning with the 2005 Outlander crossover SUV.|$|E

5000|$|There are diesel {{propulsion}} modules with [...] (since 2003) with 2 x [...] = [...] power available, {{and electric}} propulsion modules with [...] IGBT based traction converters together with asynchronous motors {{are used as}} drive units. The traction converters are manufactured by ABB at their site in Turgi, Switzerland and the motors by TSA Austria.By inserting a middle car (also with only one bogie) {{on one side of}} the propulsion module, the GTW 2/6 is expanded to GTW 2/8. Instead of the middle car, another drive module can also be inserted. Between the two modules are then either a trailer passenger car (GTW 4/8) or two <b>medium</b> <b>cars</b> and partitions (GTW 4/12). For operational flexibility up to four GTWs of the same pattern can be operated as a multiple unit.|$|E
50|$|Motometers were {{at first}} {{aftermarket}} devices. Later, vehicle builders (not only car manufacturers) began {{to offer them}} as standard or optional equipment, and dealerships began to offer them, too, sometimes as give-away or incentive items. The MotoMeter Company soon delivered these with metal dials inside that showed the make's or dealer's logo and script printed on it. The standard motometer came in three sizes for small cars, <b>medium</b> <b>cars,</b> and large cars and trucks. There were also slight changes {{to each of the}} original models and new designs and accessories like hood ornaments, toppers, illuminating devices or locks were added to the line of meters while some others were discontinued. Toppers are small metal castings that fit to a bracket on the motometer. They were used in a similar way as modern decals showing the vehicle owner's heritage, profession, preferences, or support his business, his preferred sports, or even a political statement. Toppers were also offered by other novelty producing companies, Ronson among them.Boyce kept several patents on its products and fought infringements.|$|E
5000|$|Mitsubishi {{developed}} the Magna {{as a replacement}} for the rear-wheel drive (RWD) Sigma. Previously, Mitsubishi had a larger family car {{in the form of the}} mainly six-cylinder Chrysler Valiant, inherited upon MMAL's takeover of Chrysler Australia's operations in 1980. Nevertheless, the Valiant was put out of production the following year, making the medium-sized Sigma MMAL's largest offering. When a replacement became due, MMAL opined that a car's width was a crucial factor to Australian buyers who have traditionally favoured large cars. As a result, to compete more effectively against the large RWD rivals, viz. the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore, former Chrysler engineers now working for MMAL, developed a wider mid-sized car specific to the Australian market. This model derived from the fifth-generation Japanese Mitsubishi Galant Σ (Sigma), a front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicle released in August 1983. Engineers accomplished this by splicing an extra 65 mm of width through the Galant's body and by strengthening it for Australian road conditions. Mitsubishi Motors codenamed these cars as [...] "YF" [...] and [...] "YFW"—"W" [...] for [...] "wide". To emphasise the size advantage of the Mitsubishi over other <b>medium</b> <b>cars,</b> it was named Magna—deriving from the Latin word , meaning [...] "big".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assessed}} the policy {{implications of the}} changing demand for passenger vehicles in Australia and debunked the myth that bigger vehicles are safer. In particular, we examined the increasing demand for small cars and four-wheel drive using the classic prisoners ' dilemma framework in game theory. We found that the current emphasis on occupant protection {{may result in a}} pareto inferior outcome whereas a shift in the emphasis towards non-aggressiveness of a vehicle would result in a pareto superior outcome. Among the pure strategy equilibria, the one with only small cars provides the lowest overall level of road trauma. Furthermore, we found no mixed strategy equilibrium that would produce a lower level of trauma than the pure strategy equilibria, implying that mixing vehicle type would definitely increase road trauma. In a mixed fleet, however, <b>medium</b> <b>cars</b> produced the least trauma and thus were the safest type of passenger vehicle...|$|E
30|$|The {{model is}} {{partially}} tested {{by comparing the}} simulation results with some qualitative analysis. On {{the basis of the}} analysis above, the extreme distance can be set as the maximum length of different types of small cars. Hence, the extreme distance is set to be 6  m in this test according to the official definition of small cars. Suppose that the critical distance, the feasible-passing distance, the safety distance, and the affected distance are 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 times as long as the extreme distance. The values of these distances are set solely to make a partial test to conduct a preliminary verification on the validity of our model. The annual average daily traffic volume of a two-way and four-lane freeway ranges from 25, 000 to 55, 000 veh/d [19], or 521 to 1, 146 veh/h. Therefore, the traffic volume in this test is set to 1, 050 veh/h, which is randomly picked out from the range [521, 1, 146]. In this way, the saturation of traffic flow is not low without congestion occurring. We make the speed limit 80 – 100  km/h for small cars, and 60 – 80  km/h for medium and large cars for the right lane. With regard to the left lane, the speed limit is 100 – 120  km/h for small cars, and 80 – 100  km/h for medium and large cars. Meanwhile, the ratio of probability of the arrival for large cars, <b>medium</b> <b>cars</b> and small cars is 1 : 2 : 6.|$|E

50|$|Two main {{factors have}} led to the recent decline of the straight-six in {{automotive}} applications. First, Lanchester balance shafts, an old idea reintroduced by Mitsubishi in the 1980s to overcome the natural imbalance of the inline-four engine and rapidly adopted by many other manufacturers, have made both inline-four and V6 engines smoother-running; the greater smoothness of the straight-six layout is no longer as great an advantage. Second, fuel consumption became more important, as cars became smaller and more space-efficient. The engine bay of a modern small or <b>medium</b> <b>car,</b> typically designed for an inline-four, often does not have room for a straight-six, but can fit a V6 with only minor modifications.|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{enormous}} growth {{has taken place}} in the hybrid vehicle sector; parallel architecture is the most widespread configuration regarding <b>medium</b> size <b>cars.</b> At the same time, storage systems and power electronics have experienced some important innovations. The development of supercapacitors has permitted management of high power with elevated efficiency. Moreover, the availability on the market of silicon carbide components has allowed a significant reduction of power electronic losses. These improvements may challenge the hybrid architecture used in <b>medium</b> size <b>cars</b> nowadays. On one hand, series architecture would relevantly benefit from an electric powertrain efficiency increase, on the other hand, these innovations would generate low benefits in parallel architectures. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate electric component average efficiency over different road missions, in order to estimate fuel economy over various working conditions and finally to establish which hybrid configuration is most efficient in vehicle applications...|$|R
50|$|Competing with {{mainstream}} {{and more}} affordable models in Western markets, for other export markets in Asia and Latin America, the Camry {{is seen as}} a luxury car where it sells strongly (and serves as Toyota's flagship vehicle along with the Land Cruiser). In the United States, except for 2001, the Camry was the best-selling passenger car from 1997 to 2016. The Camry also sells well in Australia where it has been the best selling <b>medium</b> <b>car</b> since 1993, and more recently in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Up until 2004, small numbers had been exported to Western Europe. Despite international success, and early success in Japan, the later wide-body models have been a low-volume model in its home market (as the Toyota Mark X, Subaru Legacy, Honda Accord/Inspire and Nissan Skyline/Teana generally offer better options in this entry-premium segment). However, since the introduction of the XV50 Camry in 2011, sales of the wide-body models in Japan have resurged, thanks, in large part, to the inclusion of Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system.|$|R
