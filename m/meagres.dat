This study is aimed at evaluating and adapting the general principles of the technique to teleosts. The study was performed on 15 subjects, belonging to different species and weight: five <b>meagres</b> (Argyrosomus regius), five carps (Cyprinus carpio), five common pandoras (Pagellus erythrinus). All the fishes examined were anaestetized with MS 222 (Tricaine methansulfonate) solution. The laparoscopy was carried out using a rigid cistoscope with an oblique vision at 30 degrees, 1. 9 mm in diameter, connected with a portable video system Medi PackTM by Storz. Our results confirm that laparoscopy could represent an imaging technique with high sensitivity to show and evaluate celomic organ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} of the Gironde Estuary, southwest of France, by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was assessed using six fish of high ecological and economic importance as bioindicator species. The concentrations of 21 PCB congeners and total fat contents were determined in the muscle and liver of eels (Anguilla anguilla), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), flounders (Platichthys flesus), <b>meagres</b> (Argyrosomus regius), mullets (Liza ramada), and soles (Solea vulgaris). In addition, information regarding the trophic ecology of the studied fish was obtained through the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (i. e., delta C- 13 and delta N- 15) in muscle. Results revealed high PCB concentrations in fish compared to monitored European estuaries. The muscle of eels {{was by far the}} most contaminated fish flesh (Sigma(7) PCBs = 1000 +/- 440 ng g(- 1), on a dry weight basis), while the higher PCB concentrations in liver were measured in flounder (Sigma(7) PCBs = 2040 +/- 1160 ng g(- 1), d. w.). A quantile regression approach allowed to investigate the fate of PCBs in the Gironde estuarine fish assemblage, and revealed a general process of trophic magnification. Finally, most of the analysed fish presented PCB concentrations in muscle meat above the current European maximum limits for sea products, while the derived "Toxic Equivalent Quantity" (TEQ) revealed human health concerns only for high-fat fish consumption...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{north-eastern}} Atlantic, meagre (Argyrosmus regius) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} fish living on the shelf and this species has important commercial interest. Over the past two decades, large variations in meagre abundance have been observed with pluri-annual cycles but the factors involved in such variations are still unclear. Trophic interactions between meagre and other species (both prey and competitors) might be one explanatory variable of the observed variations in meagre recruitment and abundance. In the present study, we described the diet of commercial-size meagre in the Bay of Biscay from stomach content and stable isotope analyses, and explored its dietary ontogeny. We found that commercial-size <b>meagres</b> were mostly piscivorous with a diet dominated by clupeiform fish (mainly anchovy and sardine) completed by demersal fish (mainly pout and whiting). Cannibalism also accounted for a non-negligible part of the diet. Interestingly, stable isotope and stomach content analyses showed only a very slight increase in prey length and trophic level during the ontogeny of large meagre after 50 cm of total length and despite a 3 fold-change of the individual length in our sampling. Our results suggested that specific trophic interactions (i. e., bottom-up control by clupeiform fish on meagre population, competitive effects on piscivorous populations or top-down control by meagre on clupeiform fish populations) may occur in the Bay of Biscay and can impact meagre abundance dynamics. Our study underlined the interest to enhance ecological knowledge of prey-predator relationships in the development of ecosystem-based approach to understand trophic controls impacting aquatic living resources and fishery economy...|$|E

However, farmed <b>meagre</b> might escape from net-pens of coastal floating facilities leading to economic losses for farmers, but also causing environmental problems on coastal ecosystems.

Therefore, the potential risks of escaped <b>meagre</b> might be higher than those reported for native species, although often unpredictable. <b>Meagre</b> escapees might spread diseases and pathogens to nearby farms or local fish populations, competing for natural resources (food and habitat) and predating on other species. Consequently, the interactions of escaped fish with wild populations might have also indirect socio-economic effects on local fisheries and consumers. Nevertheless, escape events from <b>meagre</b> aquaculture and they derived environmental and socio-economic interactions have been scarcely reported up today, and therefore, further studies are highly needed to understand and evaluate the potential consequences of what is being farmed in the Mediterranean...|$|R

40|$|Argyrosomus regius is an {{important}} fishing resource in the Gulf of Cádiz and from the Gulf of Guinea to the Bay of Biscay, including the Mediterranean Sea. Large adult <b>meagres,</b> c > 110 -cm total length (LT), apparently reproduce in coastal brackish waters. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyse maturity and growth in this species, and together with the analysis of landings, formulate a conceptual model of its life-history along the Spanish coast of the Gulf of Cádiz. Large A. regius were landed near estuaries from March to August, all of which were mature. Small (20 - 70 cmLT) A. regius were landed all year round; females were immature, whereas 26 % of the males presented precocious maturation. The estimated length-at-first maturity was 61. 6 cm for males and was inferred to occur within the 70 - 110 cm range in females. The estimated growth constant k and L∞ of the von Bertalanffy model were 0. 15 year- 1 and 171. 9 cmLT respectively. Estimates of relative yield-per-recruit suggest that growth overfishing is likely to occur under the current absence of regulations. According to the proposed conceptual model, A. regius spawns in estuaries from March to August. Early stages inhabit the estuaries and then recruit to coastal waters where they stay during the first 2 - 3 years of life. Thereafter, intermediate-size A. regius (70 - 110 cmLT) become unavailable to the local fishery. Once they mature, they migrate back to spawn, and to be fished again by the fishery. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The meagre, Argyrosomus regius, is a {{carnivorous}} {{fish with}} great potential to diversify finfish aquaculture in the Mediterranean. However, currently nothing {{is known about}} their essential fatty acid requirements. <b>Meagres</b> are marine fish but also display anadromous behaviour migrating to river estuaries to spawn, and thus may provide an insight {{to the influence of}} diadromy on biosynthetic ability for long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA). Our primary aim was to characterise key cDNAs (fatty acyl desaturases and elongases) of the biosynthetic pathway as a key step to establish the capacity of meagre for LC-PUFA biosynthesis from shorter chain PUFA. The cDNA sequences of a fatty acyl desaturase (Fads) and elongase of very long-chain fatty acids (Elovl) were obtained using PCR-based methodologies, and function of the proteins was investigated by expression of the coding sequences of the putative desaturase and elongase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The tissue distribution of both cDNAs was studied by reverse transcription PCR. Our results demonstrated that meagre possesses at least one fatty acyl desaturase and one elongase involved in the endogenous production of LC-PUFA. The meagre desaturase and elongase were identified as orthologues of Fads 2 and Elovl 5, respectively. Functionally, the desaturase had dual Δ 6 /Δ 8 activity, whereas the elongase exhibited high elongation efficiency for C 18 and C 20 PUFA with low activity towards C 22 PUFA. However, we also showed that the meagre Elovl 5 elongated 16 : 3 n - 3 to 18 : 3 n - 3, the first time that C 16 elongation activity had been demonstrated for a fish elongase. Similar to other marine teleosts, expression of fads 2 and elovl 5 transcripts was highest in brain. The functions and expression of the meagre Fads 2 and Elovl 5 proteins suggest that the meagre has a ‘marine type' LC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway, and that its anadromous behaviour has no major influence...|$|E

The <b>meagre</b> (Argyrosomus regius) {{is a large}} sciaenid from European and North African waters that, on its European range, supports regional small-scale and recreational fisheries and is considered a promising candidate species for aquaculture. However, its fisheries and ecology have remained poorly documented. The present work describes (1) progress made on raising scientific and societal awareness on this fish resource, (2) research carried out on the Portuguese fisheries targeting <b>meagre</b> and on the main biological {{parameters of}} the species in Portuguese waters. The study of fish remains from archaeological sites showed that both adult and juvenile <b>meagre</b> have been fished in Portuguese estuarine and coastal environments since, at least, the Mesolithic period. Today, two main commercial fisheries on <b>meagre</b> exist: one that targets <b>meagre</b> on the Western coast (within the Tagus estuary and off Peniche); and the other that captures the fish as by-catch in the Southeastern coast of Portugal. Using a new sampling methodology (commercial mark-recapture) a comprehensive set of otoliths and gonads was collected. Analyses of these samples showed that <b>meagre</b> is long-lived (up to 43 years old), displays fast juvenile growth and is reproductively active in spring and summer both in estuaries (Tagus and Guadiana) and adjoining coasts. Furthermore, it shows that both <b>meagre</b> males and <b>meagre</b> females display some signs of precocious maturity and that the <b>meagre</b> females are asynchronous batch spawners that likely have indeterminate fecundity. Moreover, microsatellite work showed that <b>meagre</b> populations in Europe and North Africa are highly fragmented.

Little is known about <b>meagre</b> escape incidents from farms. To evaluate escape impacts and develop mitigation measures, knowledge about the behaviour of escaped <b>meagre</b> is necessary. In this study, a rapid dispersion of escaped <b>meagre</b> was observed following a simulated escape incident in a coastal Mediterranean farm, using acoustic telemetry (acoustic tag: AT) and mark-and-recapture techniques (external tag: ET). A small proportion of AT <b>meagre</b> (22. 7 %) remained within the farm boundaries 24 h after the simulated escape. A total of 84 <b>meagre</b> (9. 2 %) were captured by local trammel netters nearby the farm facility within the first 48 h after escape.
