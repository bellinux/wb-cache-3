40|$|AbstractInspection {{techniques}} for aero-engine blades are {{a hot topic}} in industry. Since these blades have a sculptured surface and a small datum, measurement results may deviate from an actual position. There are few proper approaches compensating for non-uniform distribution errors that are within specified tolerance ranges. This study aimed to develop a <b>meshing</b> <b>structure</b> measuring approach for the distortion of blades via non-contact optical 3 D scanning. A rough measurement and a registration procedure are initially adopted to rectify the coordinate system of a blade, which avoids the initial coordinate system errors caused by the small datum. A measurement path with <b>meshing</b> <b>structure</b> is then unfolded on the blade surface. For non-uniform distribution errors, the <b>meshing</b> <b>structure</b> measurement is more visual and clear than the traditional constant height curves method. All measuring points take only 7 min to complete, {{and the distribution of}} error is directly and accurately presented by the <b>meshing</b> <b>structure.</b> This study provides a basis for future research on distortion control and error compensation...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I {{demonstrate}} that existing <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures</b> in computer graphics {{can be used}} to categorize and construct physical polygonal models. In this work, I present several methods based on <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures</b> for transforming 3 D polygonal meshes into developable multi-panels {{that can be used in}} physical construction. Using <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures,</b> I developed a system which provides a variety of construction methods. In order to {{demonstrate that}} <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures</b> {{can be used to}} categorize and construct physical polygonal models, this system visualizes the mathematical theory and generates developable multi-panels that can be printed and assembled to shapes similar to original virtual shapes. The <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures</b> include ones that are orientable: Quad-Edge, Half-Edge, Winged-Edge; and also one that is non-orientable: Extended GRS. The advantages of using <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures</b> as guides for physical construction include: There is no restriction on input design model as long as it is manifold, it can be of any genus with n-sided polygon faces; Different <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures</b> provide more options to better fit the input design while taking the physical constraints and material properties in consideration; Developable panels are easy to obtain from thin planar materials using a laser-cutter; When we use <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures,</b> it is also intuitive to assemble such planar panels using mesh information. Laser-cut developable panels based on <b>mesh</b> data <b>structures</b> provide, therefore, a cost-efficient alternative to 3 D printing when dealing with large structures...|$|R

40|$|In 1996, J. Pendry, an English {{theoretical}} physicist {{put forward}} {{an idea about}} the dependence of the effective electron mass on the magnetic field, while interpreting the dielectric response of metal wire <b>mesh</b> <b>structures.</b> The idea {{was based on the}} well-known relation between the kinematic and canonical momenta of a charged particle moving in the magnetic field. In this paper, proceeding from the universal character of that relation, the applicability of Pendry's effective electron mass m_eff to the problem of electrons in metal <b>mesh</b> <b>structures,</b> as well as to a wide class of problems for charges moving in the magnetic field, has been examined. The general properties of m_eff following directly from its definition were found, and an analogy between the effective electron mass m_eff and m^∗ known in the solid-state theory was established. A physical interpretation of m_eff was proposed. It was demonstrated in several examples that, despite the generality of the defining relation for the effective mass m_eff, the use of m_eff beyond the problem of the dielectric response of metal wire <b>mesh</b> <b>structures</b> leads to incorrect results...|$|R

The proposed technique is not memory bound and is capable of extracting <b>mesh</b> <b>structures</b> with billions of elements and nodes, provided there is enough disk space to store the mesh.

This also makes the refinement in the region where the geometry is to be captured more precisely. Figure 4 shows the use of block grid technique. The advantages of this technique are that its generation is easy, the equations that we work with are easily discretized and curved boundaries are easily accommodated. Different blocks can be handled with required degree of fineness in mesh.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new scheme that could {{automatically}} generate a hierarchical <b>mesh</b> <b>structure</b> {{for a real}} image and then use a nodal block matching to track this <b>mesh</b> <b>structure</b> in an image sequence. First, a three-layer pyramid is built by using a multi-resolution approach. For each layer, after extracting the high-curvature features, a linking procedure and a spliuing process are applied to generate a compact set of representative points. By adopting the constrained Delaunay triangulation algorithm, the selected points can be triangulated into meshes. Starting from the coarsest layer to the finest layer, we further eliminate the duplicate nodes and then form a hierarchical <b>mesh</b> <b>structure.</b> Based on the hierarchical <b>mesh</b> <b>structure</b> and the intensity value at the mesh nodes and, we can progressively reconstruct an image with simple linear interpolation.

40|$|Summary. Most finite element, or {{finite volume}} {{software}} {{is built around}} a fixed <b>mesh</b> data <b>structure.</b> Therefore, each software package can only be used efficiently for a relatively narrow class of applications. For example, implementations supporting unstructured meshes allow the approximation of complex geometries but are in general much slower and require more memory than implementations using <b>structured</b> <b>meshes.</b> In this paper we show how a generic mesh interface can be defined such that one algorithm, e. g. a discretization scheme, works on different mesh implementations. For a cell centered finite volume scheme we show that the same algorithm runs thirty times faster on a <b>structured</b> <b>mesh</b> implementation than on an unstructured mesh and is only four times slower than a non-generic version for a <b>structured</b> <b>mesh.</b> The generic mesh interface is realized within the Distributed Unified Numerics Environment DUNE. ...|$|R

However, the consistent feature in the melting behavior among the wire meshes with the same structure under the same boundary conditions will not change.
