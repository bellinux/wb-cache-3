5|$|In <b>mimesis</b> (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. <b>Mimesis</b> is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage can be {{achieved}} by different methods, described below. Most of the methods contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but <b>mimesis</b> and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied on their own or in combination.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mimesis</b> is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, a flower mantis mimics {{a particular kind}} of flower, such as an orchid. This tactic has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Protective {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} prey {{to avoid}} predation. It includes special protective resemblance, now called <b>mimesis,</b> where the whole animal looks like some other object, for example when a caterpillar resembles a twig or a bird dropping. In general protective resemblance, now called crypsis, the animal's texture blends with the background, for example when a moth's colour and pattern blend in with tree bark.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters {{is more like}} terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; <b>mimesis</b> by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
5|$|In its {{broadest}} definition, mimicry {{can include}} non-living models. The specific terms masquerade and <b>mimesis</b> are sometimes used when the models are inanimate. For example, {{animals such as}} flower mantises, planthoppers and geometer moth caterpillars resemble twigs, bark, leaves or flowers. Many animals bear eyespots, which are hypothesized to resemble the eyes of larger animals. They may not resemble any specific organism's eyes, {{and whether or not}} animals respond to them as eyes is also unclear. Nonetheless, eyespots are the subject of a rich contemporary literature.|$|E
5|$|The common cuckoo, a brood parasite, {{provides}} {{examples of}} <b>mimesis</b> {{both in the}} adult and in the egg. The female lays her eggs in nests of other, smaller species of bird, one per nest. The female mimics a sparrowhawk. The resemblance is sufficient to make small birds take action to avoid the apparent predator. The female cuckoo then has time to lay her egg in their nest without being seen to do so. The cuckoo's egg itself mimics the eggs of the host species, reducing its chance of being rejected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mimesis</b> is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving {{back and forth in the}} surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mimesis</b> or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become hard to see (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; <b>mimesis,</b> resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of varying coloration either rapidly {{or with the}} changing seasons has military applications. Active camouflage could in theory make use of both dynamic colour change and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since the Second World War. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their Adaptiv infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The Peltier plate panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (<b>mimesis),</b> when viewed in infrared.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (<b>mimesis).</b> Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mimēsis</b> is a concept, now popular {{again in}} {{academic}} discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed {{mainly in the}} Poetics. In Michael Davis's account {{of the theory of}} man in this work.|$|E
25|$|Despite his influence, however, Mazzoni {{has been}} subject to some criticism. Some see, for example, a contradiction in trying to assign both {{pleasure}} and social utility to poetry at the same time, while others question {{his use of the}} distinction between icastic and phantastic <b>mimesis</b> (Leitch, 301).|$|E
25|$|While it is {{believed}} that Aristotle's Poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic <b>mimesis.</b> He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its <b>mimesis</b> in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from Plato, {{is also important}} in Mazzoni’s work. Icastic imitation refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of a real person or {{the creation of a}} character based on a real person is icastic imitation. Phantastic imitation is the imitation of something completely the artist’s imagination. This distinction would {{play an important role in}} Mazzoni’s On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante, in which he would argue that the work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic <b>mimesis</b> because it imitates something “real.” This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed Dante’s work as lacking in verisimilitude and even claimed that the comedy was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision. Under Mazzoni’s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially <b>mimesis</b> made “persuasive” by the use of craft or art.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in works}} {{that do not}} {{consciously}} draw on Graeco-Roman literature, authors often employ concepts and themes originating in ancient Greece. The ideas expressed in Aristotle's Poetics, in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics. A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the Poetics by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages. Common Greek literary terms still used today include: catharsis, ethos, anagnorisis, hamartia, hubris, <b>mimesis,</b> mythos, nemesis, and peripeteia.|$|E
25|$|Mimicry and {{camouflage}} enable {{animals to}} appear to be other than they are. Prey animals may appear as predators, or vice versa; both predators and prey may be hard to see (crypsis), or may be mistaken for other objects (<b>mimesis).</b> In Batesian mimicry, harmless animals may appear to be distasteful or poisonous. In automimicry, animals may have eyespots in less important parts of the body than the head, helping to distract attack and increase the chance of survival.|$|E
25|$|The recent modern {{writings}} of Terrence Deacon and Merlin Donald, {{writing about the}} origin of language, also connect reason connected to not only language, but also <b>mimesis,</b> More specifically they describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality specific to humankind. Other results are consciousness, and imagination or fantasy. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic pre-disposition to language itself include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker, to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.|$|E
25|$|Walking sticks (order Phasmatodea), many katydid species (family Tettigoniidae), and moths (order Lepidoptera) {{are just}} a few of the plethora of insects that have evolved {{specialized}} cryptic morphology. This adaptation allows them to effectively hide within their environment because of a resemblance to the general background or an inedible object. When an insect looks like an inedible or inconsequential object in the environment that is of no interest to a predator, such as leaves and twigs, it is said to display <b>mimesis,</b> a form of crypsis.|$|E
25|$|Literary {{criticism}} {{is thought to}} have existed as long as literature. In the 4th century BC Aristotle wrote the Poetics, a typology and description of literary forms with many specific criticisms of contemporary works of art. Poetics developed {{for the first time the}} concepts of <b>mimesis</b> and catharsis, which are still crucial in literary studies. Plato's attacks on poetry as imitative, secondary, and false were formative as well. Around the same time, Bharata Muni, in his Natya Shastra, wrote literary criticism on ancient Indian literature and Sanskrit drama.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to criticisms that contemporaries such as Belisario Bulgarini leveled against his first effort, Mazzoni wrote the more extensive {{and more sophisticated}} On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante. In this work, before directly addressing Dante’s work, Mazzoni develops his theory of poetics, in which, drawing heavily from Plato and Aristotle, he discusses <b>mimesis,</b> the role of poetry, and the definition of poetry versus poetics (see Theory section, below). Though no complete English translation of Mazzoni’s text exists, excerpts from the Introduction and Summary have appeared in some anthologies, {{as well as in}} a partial translation by Robert L. Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|He {{says that}} Dewey {{was wrong to}} treat his {{definition}} of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases aesthetic experience accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has an undeniable value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension {{of the concept of}} art it “underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art” (i.e. aesthetic experience) and also helps to widen “the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as <b>mimesis,</b> poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world".|$|E
500|$|Commentary on the beheadings varied widely. One {{column in}} The West Australia found humour in them, {{referring}} to the head as a [...] "bonce" [...] and a [...] "noggin", and finished with a pun on [...] "skullduggery". Stephen Muecke calls this the [...] "satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns"; and Adam Shoemaker writes [...] "This {{is the stuff of}} light humour and comic relief. There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even less {{that it could have been}} motivated by malevolence... he piece has a definite authorising function". On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, David Martin described the decapitation as [...] "an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of <b>mimesis</b> to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own." ...|$|E
500|$|Although natural wonders are {{celebrated in}} the Psalms and the Book of Job, {{wilderness}} portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially {{in the works of}} the Romantic movement. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture. This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word <b>mimesis,</b> the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature. As David Rothenburg writes, [...] "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".|$|E
500|$|Transcending this [...] "dark {{circumstance}} of composition," [...] Crane had {{a particular}} telos and impetus for his creation: beyond the tautologies that all art is alterity and to some formal extent <b>mimesis,</b> Crane sought and obviously found [...] "a form of catharsis" [...] in writing. This view accounts for his uniqueness, especially as operative through his notorious [...] "disgust" [...] with his family's religion, their [...] "vacuous, futile psalm-singing". His favorite book, for example, was Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, in which God is mentioned only twice—once as irony and once as [...] "a swindle." [...] Not only did Crane call out God specifically with the lines [...] "Well then I hate thee / righteous image" [...] in [...] "The Black Riders" [...] (1895), but even his most hopeful tropes, such as the [...] "comradeship" [...] of his [...] "Open Boat" [...] survivors, make no mention of deity, specifying only [...] "indifferent nature." [...] His antitheism is most evident in his characterization {{of the human race}} as [...] "lice clinging to a space-lost bulb," [...] a climax-nearing speech in [...] "The Blue Hotel," [...] Ch. VI. [...] It is possible that Crane utilized religion's formal psychic space, now suddenly available resulting from the recent [...] "Death of God," [...] as a milieu for his compensative art.|$|E
2500|$|Imitation {{is found}} {{especially}} in monkeys and apes [...] <b>Mimesis</b> is {{fundamentally different from}} imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] <b>Mimesis</b> is not absolutely tied to external communication.|$|E
