40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{studying}} {{the influence of}} <b>baking</b> <b>temperature</b> and formulation on the formation of undesirable Maillard compounds called neoformed contaminants (NFC) in a model cookie system. Four NFCs were observed as furosine (FUR), carboxymethyllysine (CML), hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and acrylamide (ACR) for three <b>baking</b> <b>temperatures</b> – 150, 200 and 230 °C – and three recipe variables as sugar type, fat saturation level and leavening agent. The results showed significant accumulation of all neoformed contaminants along baking with specifically strong temperature dependence for HMF and ACR while CML and FUR were more time dependent. The type of sugar used is determinant regarding NFC formation: glucose tends to generate more HMF than sucrose at low <b>baking</b> <b>temperatures</b> and more CML whatever the <b>baking</b> <b>temperature.</b> The substitution of sugar by a sugar alcohol like maltitol, allows strongly limiting HMF production.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <b>baking</b> time and <b>temperature</b> on bread quality and its shelf life. In this study, the effect of three rates of oven temperature (top and under bread surface) and baking time levels on bread quality and its shelf life was investigated. <b>Baking</b> <b>temperature</b> and time were 300 and 280 °C for 3 minutes and 20 seconds, 300 and 350 °C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds and 350 and 380  °C for 2 minutes respectively. Soluble starch and staling factors of the samples were measured. The data was statistically analyzed by complete randomized design and comparison was made between the means via Duncan,s multiple range test at 5 % level. The results showed that the bread baked in various time–temperature conditions were different in moisture content. The bread baked at lower temperature and longer time had the lowest moisture.
