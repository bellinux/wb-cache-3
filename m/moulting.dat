5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four <b>moulting</b> stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further <b>moulting</b> and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by <b>moulting</b> into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moulting</b> {{serves a}} number of {{functions}} – firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by <b>moulting</b> is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed {{in the case of}} snakes.|$|E
40|$|Wing {{morphology}} strongly affects {{flight performance}} which may consequently decline during feather <b>moult</b> {{due to the}} creation of feather gaps in the wing. Hence, {{the size and shape of}} moult-related wing gap may directly affect flight capacity. Here I examined the rare divergent primary <b>moult</b> sequence compared to the more common descendant <b>moult</b> sequence. In the divergent <b>moult,</b> the focus of primary <b>moult</b> is shifted from P 1 (primary feather numbered descendantly) to another primary between P 2 and P 5, and then primaries are <b>moulted</b> in two concurrent waves, one descendant and the other ascendant. The result of this rare <b>moult</b> sequence is the splitting of the wing gap to two smaller gaps. Using a large <b>moult</b> database including 6, 763 individuals of 32 Western Palaearctic passerine species, I found evidence of divergent <b>moult</b> only among 27 individuals of 12 species. I examined the speed of wing-feather <b>moult</b> for each individual that <b>moulted</b> divergently compared to a control group of individuals at the same <b>moult</b> stage which <b>moulted</b> following the common descending sequence. The results indicate that the sequence of primary <b>moult</b> and <b>moult</b> speed are correlated. Individuals which <b>moulted</b> divergently <b>moulted</b> their primaries with higher <b>moult</b> speed than descendant moulters. The applicability of this study is weakened by the dearth of <b>moult</b> data, thus making it difficult to draw conclusions for a large range of species. Ornithologists and bird ringers are therefore encouraged to collect more basic <b>moult</b> data during their field study...|$|R
50|$|The white-plumed antbird uses {{a complex}} basic <b>moult</b> strategy, {{meaning that the}} {{juvenile}} performs a preliminary <b>moult</b> before it <b>moults</b> into its characteristic adult feathers. This first <b>moult</b> occurs soon after they begin to feed themselves. As adults, they perform at most one <b>moult</b> a year and plumage remains unchanging. A complete wing <b>moult</b> is quite variable, slow and irregular, especially in breeding birds. The <b>moult</b> takes approximately 301 days to complete, thus there can only be a single annual <b>moult.</b> <b>Moults</b> may not occur annually and can start {{at any time of}} year.|$|R
50|$|The {{non-migratory}} Prinia genus shows biannual <b>moult</b> {{which is}} rare among passerines.

5|$|The cuckoos {{show what}} is called saltatory or transilient wing moults. In simple forms this {{involves}} the <b>moulting</b> and replacement of odd-numbered primaries and then the even-numbered primaries. There are however complex variations with differences based on life history.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 study {{examined}} the histology of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the <b>moulting</b> would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of <b>moulting</b> may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E
5|$|When it {{finishes}} its <b>moult</b> migration, {{this bird}} <b>moults</b> its remiges between August and September, {{which makes it}} unable to fly.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{effects of}} testosterone treatment on timing {{and rate of}} <b>moult</b> of wing-feathers in male Shelducks Tadorna tadorna, and whether this treatment influences the timing of <b>moult</b> in untreated females. Three experimental treatments were conducted, each with two groups of sexual inactive male Shelducks, which were kept under natural photoperiods in The Netherlands. Each group consisted of two pairs and a single male. Males received implants with testosterone-proprionate for seven weeks shortly before the natural <b>moult</b> onset of wing-feathers. Start of treatment was 27 June (treatment I), 5 July (treatment II), and 18 July (treatment III). Males delayed their <b>moult</b> {{until the end of}} hormone treatment. The degree of delay in start of <b>moult</b> within the same treatment was related to androgen blood levels. The untreated females of the testosterone-treated males delayed also their onset of <b>moult.</b> The timing of the end of <b>moult</b> was unaffected by the hormonal treatment. Males that <b>moulted</b> late did not speed up the rate of <b>moult,</b> or changed the pattern of <b>moult,</b> but some of these birds stopped <b>moult</b> before completion. The data indicate that under natural photoperiods the statt of <b>moult</b> is quite flexible, requires low levels of androgens, and is under the influence of social factors, while the end of <b>moult</b> is fixed. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first report of {{complete}} overlap of breeding and <b>moult</b> in a shorebird. In southeastern Australia, Hooded Plovers Thinornis rubricollis spend their entire lives on oceanic beaches, where they exhibit biparental care. Population <b>moult</b> encompassed the 6 -month breeding season. <b>Moult</b> timing was estimated using the Underhill-Zucchini method for Type 2 data with a power transformation to accommodate sexual differences in rates of <b>moult</b> progression in the early and late stages of <b>moult.</b> Average <b>moult</b> durations were long in females (170. 3 ± 14. 2 days), and even longer in males (210. 3 ± 13. 5 days). Breeding status was known for most birds in our samples, and many active breeders (especially males) were also growing primaries. Females delayed the onset of primary <b>moult</b> but were able {{to increase the speed}} of <b>moult</b> and continue breeding, completing <b>moult</b> {{at about the same time}} as males. The mechanism by which this was achieved appeared to be flexibility in <b>moult</b> sequence. All <b>moult</b> formulae fell on one of two linked <b>moult</b> sequences, one faster than the other. The slower sequence had fewer feathers growing concurrently and also had formulae indicating suspended <b>moults.</b> Switching between sequences via common formulae is possible at many points during the <b>moult</b> cycle, and three of 12 recaptures were confirmed to have switched sequences in the same <b>moult</b> season. Hooded Plovers thus have a prolonged primary <b>moult</b> with the flexibility to change their rate of moult; this may facilitate high levels of replacement clutches that are associated with passive nest defence and low reproductive success. © 2014 British Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union...|$|R
5|$|Another {{example of}} {{differentiation}} of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers {{the eye of}} the snake. The brille {{is often referred to as}} a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during <b>moulting.</b>|$|E
5|$|From early November, chicks begin <b>moulting</b> into {{juvenile}} plumage, {{which takes}} {{up to two}} months and is often not completed {{by the time they}} leave the colony; adults cease feeding them during this time.

5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, {{at a time when there}} is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is <b>moulting</b> is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of <b>moulting</b> is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E

40|$|Adult Eastern Rosellas have {{a single}} post-breeding <b>moult</b> each year, from December to May.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Moult</b> is an {{important}} process in {{the life cycle of}} birds.

5|$|Moult is {{prolonged}} in all tubenoses, since they must maintain {{an ability to}} fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced <b>moulting</b> in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moulting</b> is {{very slow}} and complex. Black {{cockatoos}} appear to replace their flight feathers {{one at a}} time, their moult taking two years to complete. This process is much shorter in other species, such as the galah and long-billed corella, which each take around six months to replace all their flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|The hen alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch.

40|$|Over {{a period}} of 3 years 368 M. melanocephala were {{examined}} from study areas east and west of the Great Dividing Range in south-eastern Queensland. <b>Moult</b> was under way in 119 of them, and was recorded as a score from 0 to 5 {{for each of the}} remiges and rectrices. All populations sampled required about the same period for their members to complete their <b>moult,</b> averaging 153 days for primary feathers and 174 for all flight feathers. The sequence of <b>moult</b> was typically passerine. The estimated average duration for an individual 2 ̆ 7 s primary <b>moult</b> is 113 days, complete flight <b>moult</b> requiring 128. <b>Moult</b> occurs between late September and midMarch. It begins later in adult females than in adult males. It also tends to begin about 2 weeks earlier in eastern than western populations, but among eastern birds in 1969 <b>moult</b> began some 26 days later than in 1970 or 1971. A tenuous relation between early rainfall and this late <b>moult</b> is suggested. Immature miners <b>moult</b> in the same sequence as adults but begin by shedding primary 3, 4, or 5, not primary 1. Secondary <b>moult</b> of immatures is even more variable than that of adults, and shows little synchrony with primary <b>moult.</b> Their tail <b>moult</b> is more regular. The period of <b>moult</b> of M. melanocephala is longer than those of the few Australian passerines examined, and much longer than those of passerines from temperate localities. Miners show no cryptic behaviour during <b>moult,</b> and some continue to breed. Thus the prolonged <b>moult</b> is probably adaptive in avoiding interference with other behaviour...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the sequence {{and extent of}} the complex and little understood post-juvenile and post-breeding <b>moults</b> of Savi’s Warblers Locustella luscinioides. In contrast to previous studies, the post-juvenile <b>moult</b> occurred in at least 44 % of the birds, 5 % of which <b>moulted</b> some or all tertials and greater coverts. The timing of overlap between the filling and the post-juvenile <b>moults,</b> {{and the fact that}} later-moulting birds had no post-juvenile <b>moult,</b> strongly suggests that the <b>moult</b> extent is dependent on fledging date. From July onwards, all adult males overlapped breeding and <b>moult,</b> whereas only 11 % of the females did so. The start of <b>moult</b> varied from 6 June to 25 August, and was significantly earlier in males. Only 18 % of the birds completed the <b>moult,</b> whereas the remaining individuals retained a variable number of inner primaries and/or secondaries. Interestingly, not only was the number of retained primaries positively associated with the date of <b>moult,</b> but so too was the primary number of birds in which the <b>moult</b> started. We view this as an adaptation allowing the replacement of the most important feathers for flight when the time available for <b>moult</b> is short. Body condition did not vary with the progress of <b>moult</b> when date was taken into account, but fat reserves still tended to decrease and then increase.

5|$|The {{life span}} of P.fluviatile is {{typically}} 10–12 years. <b>Moulting</b> does not occur in winter. Mating lasts between 30min and 21hours, with spawning usually taking place in August.

5|$|The red wattlebird begins <b>moulting</b> {{after the}} {{breeding}} season, {{starting with the}} primary flight feathers in November or December and finishing between the following March and May.

40|$|In most waders (Charadrii) {{replacement}} of old by new feathers during <b>moult</b> of primaries {{occurs in a}} fixed order and {{in such a way}} that flight capacities are maintained. <b>Moult</b> of the secondaries of the Eurasian Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria deviates from this general pattern. The sequence of secondary <b>moult</b> is irregular and – in most cases – asymmetric between wings. In addition, only about half the secondaries are renewed every year. Secondary <b>moult</b> is arrested in October and not resumed in spring. This can be deduced from the <b>moult</b> scores of > 900 adults that were caught in autumn and spring when staging in the Netherlands, and from inspection of three birds caught on their nests in Iceland. It is also confirmed by the <b>moult</b> scores of seven birds (from a group of about 1, 500) that were recaptured after their first complete <b>moult.</b> As their juvenile secondaries had been marked with picric acid the year before, all non-dyed secondaries had evidently been renewed – and all dyed ones were old. As irregular <b>moult</b> of the secondaries also occurs in other Charadriidae plovers, this characteristic might have originated from a common ancestor.

40|$|Adult passerines {{renew their}} flight {{feathers}} {{at least once}} every year. This complete <b>moult</b> occurs either in the breeding areas, just after breeding (summer <b>moult),</b> or, in some long-distance migratory species, at the non-breeding areas, after arrival to the southern wintering area {{at the end of}} autumn migration (winter <b>moult).</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} relate <b>moult</b> strategies with the DMD, the difference in median migration date, through Israel, between juveniles and adults. Our data on autumn migration timing in juveniles and adults was based on ringing data of 49, 125 individuals belonging to 23 passerine species that breed in Europe and Western Asia and migrate through Israel. We found that DMD was associated with <b>moult</b> timing. In all species that perform a winter <b>moult,</b> adults preceded juveniles during autumn. Among migrants who perform a summer <b>moult,</b> we found evidence of both migration timing patterns: juveniles preceding adults or adults preceding juveniles. In addition, in summer moulters, we found a significant, positive correlation between mean breeding latitude and DMD. Although previous studies described that <b>moult</b> duration and extent can be affected by migration, we suggest that <b>moult</b> strategies affect both migration timing and migration strategy.
