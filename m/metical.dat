50|$|The <b>metical</b> (MZM) {{replaced}} the escudo at par on 16 June 1980. It {{was divided into}} 100 centavos. The <b>metical</b> underwent severe inflation. After the revaluation of the Romanian leu, the <b>metical</b> briefly became the least valued currency unit, at a value of about 24,500 meticais per USD, until the Zimbabwean dollar took the title in late August 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>metical</b> (plural: meticais) is the {{currency}} of Mozambique, abbreviated with the symbol MZN or MT. It is nominally divided into 100 centavos.The name <b>metical</b> comes from Arabic [...] (mithqāl), a unit of weight and an alternative name for the gold dinar coin that was used throughout much of Africa until the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|The metica (plural meticas) was a {{proposed}} currency for Mozambique. It {{was divided into}} 100 centimos. Coins were produced dated 1975 and banknotes dated 1976. However, these were not put into circulation and the escudo continued to circulate until 1980, when the <b>metical</b> was introduced.|$|E
5000|$|According to some sources, one rottolo (rotl) {{was equal}} to 1.1175 lb, and rotl sucky for meat, etc. was equal to 1.2582 lb, and one rotl ghredari for {{vegetables}} was equal to 1.4098 lb. [...] One <b>metical</b> for {{gold and silver}} was equal to 59.7 grains.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name was}} also applied as an {{alternative}} term for the gold dinar, a coin that was used {{throughout much of the}} Islamic world from the 8th century onward and survived in parts of Africa until the 19th century. [...] The name of Mozambique's currency since 1980, the <b>metical,</b> is derived from mithqāl.|$|E
50|$|On July 1, 2006, Mozambique redenominated the <b>metical</b> {{at a rate}} of 1000:1. The new ISO 4217 code is MZN. New {{coins and}} {{banknotes}} were introduced on July 1, 2006, and the transitional period during which both old and new meticais could be used lasted until December 31, 2006. During the conversion, the new currency was locally abbreviated as MTn, but has since largely returned to MT.|$|E
50|$|From July 1, 2006, new {{banknotes}} were issued in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 meticais. On October 1, 2011, Banco de Moçambique {{has issued a}} new family of banknotes {{that are similar to}} the 2006 series, but with enhanced security features. The three smaller denominations are now printed on polymer while the higher denominations remain printed on paper. The higher denominated <b>metical</b> banknotes are printed by De La Rue.|$|E
50|$|Mozambique {{was one of}} the world's poorest {{and most}} {{underdeveloped}} countries when it became independent of Portugal in 1975, the last colonial power to relinquish its African territories. A brutal civil war between the communist government and rebel forces from 1977-92 led to continuous inflation. The highest denomination in 1976 was 100 meticals. By 2004, it was 500,000 meticals. In the 2006 currency reform, 1 new <b>metical</b> was exchanged for 1,000 old meticals.|$|E
50|$|The escudo {{replaced}} the real {{at a rate}} of 1 escudo = 1000 réis. It was equal in value to the Portuguese escudo until 1977. Initially, Mozambique had its own paper money but used Portuguese coins. Only in 1935 were coins issued specifically for use in Mozambique. In 1975, the metica was proposed as a replacement for the escudo, but it was not used. The escudo was replaced by the <b>metical</b> in 1980 at par.|$|E
50|$|When the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries {{was founded}} in 1996, many Portuguese and Portuguese Brazilians arrived for {{economic}} and educational aid to Mozambique. They have helped increase Portuguese-language fluency especially in remote rural places and improved the economy, as the <b>metical</b> has a large value converted from the Euro. Many among them have adopted the country as their permanent home. Many more Portuguese settlers returned from Portugal, it is estimated by the Mozambican embassy that about 6,000 returned.|$|E
50|$|The First <b>Metical</b> {{had three}} issues of notes as follows:i. In 1980 (16 June 1980), notes were {{introduced}} in denominations of 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 meticais.ii The same notes and denominations were reissued in 1983 (16 June 1983) with the new state logo, 5,000 meticais notes {{were introduced in}} 1989 (3 February 1989).iii. In 1991 (16 June 1991) 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 notes were issued followed by 50,000 and 100,000 meticais in 1993 (16 June 1993), 20,000 meticais in 1999 (16 June 1999) and 200,000 and 500,000 meticais in 2003 (16 June 2003).|$|E
50|$|In 1980, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 50 centavos, 1, 2½, 5, 10 and 20 meticais. The 50 centavos, 2½ and 5 meticais were minted in aluminium, with the 1 <b>metical</b> in brass and the 10 and 20 meticais in cupro-nickel. In 1986, aluminium 1, 10, 20 and 50 meticais {{were introduced}}. A new coinage issued in 1994 was composed of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 meticais, with the lower four denominations in brass clad steel and the higher denominations in nickel clad steel. 5000 meticais coins {{were introduced in}} 1998, followed by 10,000 meticais in 2003.|$|E
50|$|After the {{withdrawal}} of the Portuguese colonial administration from Mozambique in 1974 following the handover of power to the FRELIMO liberation movement {{in the context of the}} Lusaka Accord, Cardoso was among the minority of white Mozambicans who remained in the country. He worked first in junior positions in government media and, from 1980, as editor of AIM, the government press agency. Following a brief spell of imprisonment, Cardoso worked also as an advisor to Samora Machel, but quit AIM in 1989 to work first as an artist, and later as founder of Mediacoop, an independent press co-operative. In 1992 he founded the weekly newspaper Savana, which he left in 1997 to found a new business newspaper <b>Metical.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{currency}} is the <b>Metical,</b> but the South African Rand and the US Dollar are also accepted. Shopping {{is very limited}} in Ponta. There is a petrol station, bank, pharmacy, hardware stores, bottle stores and other small shops in town. Fresh bread {{can be purchased at}} the local market. Basic food items like vegetables, fruits can be purchased at this market. No luxurious items are available anywhere in Ponta do Ouro. Holiday accommodation is readily available. There are 3 to 4 modern and comfortable resorts in Ponta on the beachfront and surrounding areas. Other resorts date from pre-war and although quite primitive with limited facilities are very popular with tourists due to reasonable pricing and excellent location on the beachfront. It is commonly referred to as 'Ponta' by visiting South Africans.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2000, white Mozambican Carlos Cardoso, 49, {{editor of}} the <b>Metical</b> daily {{newspaper}} specializing in investigating corruption, was investigating an alleged $14 million fraud at the Central Bank of Mozambique (BCM). On November 22, 2000, nearly 15 minutes after speaking to BBC reporters, he left his Maputo office {{in a car and}} was ambushed on the Avenue of the Martyrs by gunmen who blocked his escape routes with two cars. Later, trial judges adopted the version of events that dos Santos was driving the stolen ambush car that overtook Cardoso's Toyota and forced it to the curb; the shots were fired by another suspect. Witnesses said the shooters fired 10 shots, killing Cardoso and injuring his driver. The murder occurred two weeks after 26 people were killed in riots; Cardoso reported on the incident and was highly critical of both leading political parties' actions preceding the clashes. The murder and funeral of Cardoso [...] "produced a rare show of unity among political opponents"; president Joaquim Chissano and opposition leaders vowed to solve the murder.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{currency is}} the New <b>Metical</b> (as of November 2016, 1 USD is {{roughly equivalent to}} 75 New Meticals), which replaced old Meticals {{at the rate of}} a thousand to one. The old currency was redeemable at the Bank of Mozambique until the end of 2012. The US$, South African rand, and recently the euro are also widely accepted and used in business transactions. The minimum legal salary is around US$60 per month. Mozambique {{is a member of the}} Southern African Development Community (SADC). The SADC free trade protocol is aimed at making the Southern African region more competitive by eliminating tariffs and other trade barriers. The World Bank in 2007 talked of Mozambique's 'blistering pace of economic growth'. A joint donor-government study in early 2007 said 'Mozambique is generally considered an aid success story.' The IMF in early 2007 said 'Mozambique is a success story in Sub-Saharan Africa.' Yet, despite this apparent success, both the World Bank and UNICEF used the word 'paradox' to describe rising chronic child malnutrition in the face of GDP growth. Between 1994 and 2006, average annual GDP growth was approximately 8%, however, the country remains one of the poorest and most underdeveloped in the world. In a 2006 survey, three-quarters of Mozambicans said that in the past five years their economic position had remained the same or become worse.|$|E
40|$|Microstructure {{aspects of}} nominal {{exchange}} rate determination are less relevant {{in countries with}} embryonic financial markets. In less-developed economies, trade in goods and services is a more significant driver of currency demand than financial market speculation or hedging; and central banks actively set monetary variables. We develop a simple variation of the standard monetary model of exchange rate determination, incorporating interest rate rules but not relying on interest rate parity; and study the effect of monetary fundamentals on the Mozambican exchange rate. We find a long-run relationship between fundamentals and exchange rates, with coefficient signs in regression equations consistent with theoretic predictions. Moreover, the monetary model outperforms a random walk in predicting <b>metical</b> exchange rates out-of-sample at the four-quarter horizon. ...|$|E
40|$|Percussion {{pulse jet}} has {{powerful}} capabilities on hard <b>metical</b> fragmentation, such as rock, concrete and ceramics. However, its complicate generation process make the design works on this become hard. This {{is the reason}} why the development of this technique has been restricted for a long time. In presented works, a simplified finite difference model combined with multi-collision equations of pistons was put forward. The main hydrodynamic parameters and the motion of the pistons were numerically calculated. A hammer-driven percussion jet generator was designed and implemented for the tests under same operating conditions with modeling works. By comparing the pressure data and the numerical results, those were demonstrated that the mode was reasonable and the neglects were acceptable. Conducting numerical experiments using this model, valuable reference information can be achieved for percussion pulse jet design...|$|E

The geometry is modelled in three dimensions, so asymmetries in core texture can be taken into acount for nuclear and thermohydraulical calculations. A continuous simulation was performed during five years of AVR operation. The comparison between calculated and measured data was very satisfying.

40|$|This paper conducts an {{assessment}} of external price competitiveness for Mozambique. A variety of indicators suggest that Mozambique has recently lost external price competitiveness with respect to its major trading partners. Consistent with these indicators, an exchange rate assessment indicates that the <b>metical</b> is overvalued by 26 to 41 percent in real effective terms. If sustained, an overvaluation of this magnitude {{has the potential to}} retard economic growth and jeopardize external stability, calling for an adjustment of monetary policy to gradually restore external price competitiveness.

40|$|The Banco de Moçambique (Bank) was {{established}} in May 17, 1975. The 1920 Brussels Conference recommended that in countries without a central bank, it should be created. The ‘Bank’ followed the new model of emerging countries’ central banks (mid- 1950 s), where those central banks regulated and controlled an existing financial system and promoted {{the emergence of a}} money and capital market. From 1975 the Bank performed commercial functions until 1992, when the functions of commercial banking and central banking were separated. Mozambique tried to establish a socialist society. The prevailing financial system, primarily consisting of of expatriate banks, was reorganised under the state bank. This was a restructuring and integration process. In 1980 the <b>Metical,</b> the new currency of Mozambique, was introduced. In the 1980 s weakening economic conditions in Mozambique mandated the reconsideration of post-independence economic policies. In 1984 Mozambique accepted assistance from the Bretton Woods institutions and from 1987 the country embraced the Economic Rehabilitation Program. The Bank embarked on monetary, credit, supervisory and regulatory policies reforms, to consolidate conventional central bank functions. HistoryM. A. (History...|$|E
30|$|From {{the study}} of Brownbridge (2002), {{it is noted that}} loan term places an {{important}} element when it comes to lending issues. The loan term affects the revenue of lending institutions (banks), the repayment schedule of credit applicants, the financial cost of customers, and also the sustainability of the use of the finance products. It is further stated that in most cases the loan period and the size present obstacles for accessing bank financing and the interest rate affects access to finance in some few cases. Several studies (Kaufmann and Wilhelm, 2006; World Bank, 2003; USAID, 2005; USAID, 2007) found that the major problems concerning access to finance for small businesses in Mozambique are basically related with the high interest rate charged on financial products and the inefficient banking services, than would be justified by economic reasons. Thus, interest rates in Mozambique are at higher levels compared to other Sub-Saharan African countries. Furthermore, the differences in interest rates vary based on the currencies. The loans made on the domestic currency <b>Metical</b> (MZN) carry higher interest rates than those made in US dollar (USAID, 2007).|$|E
40|$|Mozambique, {{like many}} other parts of the low-income world, faces {{perennial}} challenges with food security. With a rapidly growing population and arable land on the decline, sustainable agriculture is vital to managing the already depleted natural resources of Sub-Saharan Africa more effectively while increasing food security. Food security issues for subsistence farmers in most low-income countries are a product of endogenous (crop yields) and exogenous (currency fluctuations as many agricultural inputs are imported) factors. In Mozambique the value of the local currency, meticals, has decreased by approximately 50 % since January 2015 compared to the U. S. dollar. While this makes exporting products out of Mozambique more attractive in a relative sense, it negatively effects those industries which rely on imported inputs such as animal feed and inorganic fertilizer. In response to this exogenous currency crisis, research was conducted in Nampula, Mozambique during the summer of 2016 on a method for implementing crop diversification to reduce the risk that accompanies the devaluation of the <b>metical.</b> This research was undertaken on a poultry operation which is heavily dependent on imported maize and soya. Similar to the market structure of the poultry industry in the United States, all birds are grown by individual out growers who typically also have small plots of land to farm. Objectives for the project included 1) perform on-site crop production evaluations, 2) determine profitability for various row crops, and 3) simulate alternative production practices to increase crop profitability. Of the crops grown (tomatoes, maize, and cabbage), maize required the least labor, lowest initial investment, and the highest probability of breaking even. This research concluded that if poultry producers in Mozambique who rely on imported feed grew maize simultaneously it would reduce the dependency on imported maize and reduce income variability associated with exogenous currency fluctuations. Implementing a program such as this could increase revenue streams as well as reduce variability, thereby enhancing regional food securit...|$|E
