25|$|Drawing {{molecules}} {{requires a}} transformation between molecular coordinates (usually, but not always, in Angstrom units) and the screen. Because many molecules are chiral {{it is essential}} that the handedness of the system (almost always right-handed) is preserved. In <b>molecular</b> <b>graphics</b> the origin (0, 0) is usually at the lower left, while in many computer systems the origin is at top left.

With projectors such as Barco, it was possible to project stereoscopic display onto special silvered screens and supply an audience of hundreds with spectacles. In this way <b>molecular</b> <b>graphics</b> became universally known within large sectors of chemical and biochemical science, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the backgrounds of many displays were black by default, it was common for modelling sessions and lectures to be held with almost all lighting turned off.|$|E
40|$|Certain saccharides, {{including}} trehalose, sucrose and glucose, stabilize lipid bilayers against dehydration. It {{has been}} suggested that these saccharides replace waters of hydration as the system is dried, thereby maintaining the headgroups at their hydrated spacing. The lipid acyl chains consequently have sufficient free volume to remain in the liquid crystallines state, and the processes that disrupt membrane integrity are inhibited. Initial <b>molecular</b> <b>graphic</b> investigations of a model trehalose/DMPC system supported this idea (Chandrasekhar, I. and Gaber, B. P. (1988) J. Biomol. Stereodyn, 5, 1163 – 1171). We have extended these studies to glucose and sucrose. A set of AMBER potential parameters has been established that reproduce simple saccharide conformations, including the anomeric effect. Extensive energy minimizations have been conducted on all three systems. The saccharide-lipid interaction energies become less stable in the order trehalose <sucrose<glucose.

40|$|The {{formation}} of the complexes of galangin (GAL) with native β-cyclodextrin (βCD), and with its substituted counterparts such as dimethyl-βCD (DMβCD) and hydroxypropyl-βCD (HPβCD), was studied by fluorescence spectra in aqueous medium. The binding association constants (Ka) of the complexes were determined at different temperatures. The formation constants obtained have the following trend upon complex formation at the three temperatures studied: HPβCD > DMβCD > βCD. The thermodynamic data {{for the inclusion of}} GAL in DMβCD and HPβCD indicated that is mainly enthalpy driven whereas for βCD it is an entropy-driven process. The antioxidant ability studies of GAL and CD complexes showed practically no change in its activity when the β-cyclodextrin complex is formed. The decrease in the Teq observed for GAL-DMβCD and GAL-HPβCD in comparison with GAL-βCD could be due to effective protection of the phenol group in the cyclodextrin cavity, which is in agreement with molecular modeling studies.

25|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>graphics</b> {{has always}} pushed {{the limits of}} display technology, and has seen a number of cycles of {{integration}} and separation of compute-host and display. Early systems like Project MAC were bespoke and unique, but in the 1970s the MMS-X and similar systems used (relatively) low-cost terminals, such as the Tektronix 4014 series, often over dial-up lines to multi-user hosts. The devices could only display static pictures but were able to evangelize MG. In the late 1970s, {{it was possible for}} departments (such as crystallography) to afford their own hosts (e.g., PDP-11) and to attach a display (such as Evans & Sutherland's PS-1) directly to the bus. The display list was kept on the host, and interactivity was good since updates were rapidly reflected in the display—at the cost of reducing most machines to a single-user system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{interpretation}} of the short-range static and/or dynamic disorder in a crystal structure from X-ray data is often a rather complex problem. Recently, we synthesized and characterized three co-crystalline complexes between fluorene, showing C 2 v symmetry, and three electron withdrawing D 2 h compounds, employing FTIR and Raman spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. The crystal structures of the complexes of fluorene with the three different electron withdrawing molecules are disordered in the solid state and only approximate structures were obtained by refinement of the single crystal data. Indeed, the fluorene moiety presents a very irregular geometry, showing for example C-C bonds ranging from 1. 25 Å to 1. 75 Å. Graphical inspection of the solved crystal structures indicates that the fluorene molecules in these co-crystalline complexes can assume two possible positions, both with 50 % population. A two-step procedure to improve the disordered models is described. At first, the two possible ordered structures, with the fluorene molecule in {{only one of the}} two populated positions, are "separated " by <b>molecular</b> <b>graphic</b> techniques and then their geometry is fully optimized employing the periodic ab initio “CRYSTAL ” code to obtain a chemically sensible model with reasonable distance...|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} {{study of}} the inclusion compound of tolbutamide (TBM) with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) was attempted by means of 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) experiments and computer molecular modelling. To establish the stoichiometry and stability constant of the beta-CD:TBM complex, the continuous variation method was used. The presence of true inclusion complexes between TBM and beta-CD or HP-beta-CD in solution was clearly evidenced by the 1 H-NMR technique. Changes in chemical shifts of H- 3 and H- 5 protons, located inside the CD cavity, associated with variations in the chemical shifts of TBM aromatic protons provided clear evidence of inclusion complexation, suggesting that the phenyl moiety of the drug molecule {{was included in the}} hydrophobic cavity of CDs. This view was further supported by the observation of intermolecular NOEs between TBM and beta-CD and by the aid of a molecular modelling program, which established the most probable structure of the complex. The <b>molecular</b> <b>graphic</b> computation confirmed that the minimum energy, positioning TBM relative to beta-CD, occurs when the aromatic ring of TBM is included within the beta-CD cavity by its wider side, leaving the aliphatic chain externally, which is in good agreement with the results of 1 H-NMR studie...|$|R

40|$|We have {{identified}} a new mutation in the FBP (fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate) aldolase A gene in a child with suspected haemolytic anaemia associated with myopathic symptoms at birth and with a subsequent diagnosis of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and pituitary ectopia. Sequence analysis of the whole gene, also performed on the patient’s full-length cDNA, revealed only a Gly 346 →Ser substitution in the heterozygous state. We expressed in a bacterial system the new aldolase A Gly 346 →Ser mutant, and the Glu 206 →Lys mutant identified by others, in a patient with an aldolase A deficit. Analysis of their functional profiles showed that the Gly 346 →Ser mutant had the same Km as the wild-type enzyme, but a 4 -fold lower kcat. The Glu 206 →Lys mutant had a Km approx. 2 -fold {{higher than that of}} both the Gly 346 →Ser mutant and the wild-type enzyme, and a kcat value 40 %less than the wild-type. The Gly 346 →Ser and wild-type enzymes had the same Tm (melting temperature), which was approx. 6 – 7 ◦C higher than that of the Glu 206 →Lys enzyme. An extensive <b>molecular</b> <b>graphic</b> analysis of themutated enzymes, using human and rabbit aldolase A crystallographic structures, suggests that the Glu 206 →Lys mutation destabilizes the aldolase A tetramer at the subunit interface, and highlights the fact that the glycine-to-serine substitution at position 346 limits the flexibility of the C-terminal region. These results also provide the first evidence that Gly 346 is crucial for the correct conformation and function of aldolase A, because it governs the entry/release of the substrates into/from the enzyme cleft, and/or allows important C-terminal residues to approach the active site...|$|R

2500|$|The {{requirements}} of macromolecular crystallography also drove MG because [...] the traditional techniques of physical model-building could not scale. The first two protein structures solved by <b>molecular</b> <b>graphics</b> {{without the aid}} of the Richards' Box were built with Stan Swanson's program FIT on the Vector General graphics display in the laboratory of Edgar Meyer at Texas A University: First Marge Legg in Al Cotton's lab at A solved the structure of staph. nuclease (1975) and then Jim Hogle solved the structure of monoclinic lysozyme in 1976. A full year passed before other graphics systems were used to replace the Richards' Box for modelling into density in 3-D.

40|$|PmGSTB 1 - 1 (Proteus mirabilis {{glutathione}} S-transferase B 1 - 1) has two tryptophan residues at positions 97 and 164 in each monomer. Structural {{data for}} this bacterial enzyme indicated that Trp 97 is positioned in the helix α 4, whereas Trp 164 {{is located at the}} bottom of the helix α 6 in the xenobiotic-binding site. To elucidate the role of the two tryptophan residues they were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. Trp 97 and Trp 164 were mutated to either phenylalanine or alanine. A double mutant was also constructed. The effects of the replacement on the activity, structural properties and antibiotic-binding capacity of the enzymes were examined. On the basis of the results obtained, Trp 97 does not seem to be involved in the enzyme active site and structural stabilization. In contrast, different results were achieved for Trp 164 mutants. Conservative substitution of the Trp 164 with phenylalanine enhanced enzyme activity 10 -fold, whereas replacement with alanine enhanced enzyme activity 17 -fold. Moreover, the catalytic efficiency for both GSH and 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene substrates improved. In particular, the catalytic efficiency for 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene improved for both W 164 F (Trp 164 →Phe) and W 164 A by factors of 7 - and 22 -fold respectively. These results are supported by <b>molecular</b> <b>graphic</b> analysis. In fact, W 164 A presented a more extensive substrate-binding pocket that could allow the substrates to be better accommodated. Furthermore, both Trp 164 mutants were significantly more thermolabile than wild-type, suggesting that the substitution of this residue affects the overall stability of the enzyme. Taken together, these results indicate that Trp 164 is an important residue of PmGSTB 1 - 1 in the catalytic process as well as for protein stability...|$|R
40|$|Thermodynamic {{properties}} and radial distribution functions for a water-pyridine mixture {{as a function}} of composition were calculated with the Monte Carlo method in the isothermal and isobaric ensemble at T = 298. 15 K and p = 1. 0 atm. The TIP 4 P model was used for water and optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field parameters were used for pyridine. The effect of including the hydrogen atoms of pyridine was explicitly investigated by comparing the results from calculations with six and eleven site models. The results obtained for the average configurational interaction energy {{as a function of}} the mole fraction are in good agreement with experimental data. The partitioning of the total configurational energy of the water-pyridine mixture is presented and compared with similar results from other systems. Comparatively low energy values were obtained for the water-pyridine interaction. This interaction becomes slightly more negative when the hydrogen atoms of pyridine are explicitly considered. The radial distribution functions for the water-pyridine interaction show characteristic features indicating the formation of hydrogen-bonded dimers. The amplitude of the peaks observed for these distribution functions depends on the particular model used to represent the pyridine molecule. Radial distribution functions and <b>molecular</b> <b>graphic</b> representations for water-water interaction indicate the formation of small clusters of water molecules in the bulk of the water-pyridine system. This clustering enhances the water-water coordination numbers and interaction energy. The contribution from solute-solvent electrostatic interaction to the free energy of solvation of water in pure water, pure pyridine and in the equimolar water-pyridine and water-methanol mixtures were calculated using statistical perturbation theory (SPT). The results obtained for the electrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation, in absolute values, are pyridine < water-pyridine < water-methanol < water. These free energy results indicate the migration of water molecules towards an environment rich in hydrogen bonds and explain the formation of water clusters in the bulk of water-pyridine mixtures...|$|R
