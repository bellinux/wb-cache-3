40|$|How do states {{perceive}} threats? Why are material forces {{sometimes more}} prominent in shaping threat perceptions, whereas ideational forces are the motivator in other instances? This article aims {{to move beyond}} the task of determining whether material or ideational factors matter to offer an integrated framework based on analytical eclecticism that specifies the conditions under which one of these two factors becomes salient in regimes’ threat perceptions. When regime identity is fixed and the material structure provides multiple <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> to ensure a state’s physical security, leaders perceive challenges to their identity as more salient. When a state's identity is fluid, providing multiple narratives, and the distribution of <b>military</b> capabilities constrains <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> for physical security, leaders perceive threats to their physical security as more prominent. As a result, the regime’s identity narrative is reframed to adapt to the constraints of the material structure. To examine the validity of this argument, I analyze the divergent Syrian and Saudi threat perceptions during the Iran–Iraq War (1980 – 1988) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{high level}} of {{competition}} and uncertainty forced firms to make right and on time strategic decisions in order to survive. The management practices for the stable environments are not suitable for the new dynamic environment. In order {{to respond to this}} dynamic and uncertain environment, managers and academicians focused on the organization’s strategic flexibility. According to the <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> view the main property of strategic flexibility is the ability to access to the resources and capabilities when they are needed (Sanchez, 1997). Strategic flexibility is defined as “condition of having <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> that are created through combined effects of an organization’s coordination flexibility in acquiring and using flexible resources ” (Sanchez, 1993). According to this definition in order to have strategic flexibility, firms need to have <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> and the main task of the managers is to define, develop, acquire and coordinate the resources and competencies that will optimize the value of <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> cluster. In order to optimize <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> cluster managers should effectively manage competence building and competence leveraging processes. In order to have effective competence building and competence leveraging processes we should answer the questions “What are the factors effecting these processes"? However, the selection of a suitable <b>strategic</b> <b>option</b> is not an easy decision, involving a lot of complex considerations. Therefore this study focuses on the factors effecting the exercising decision of a <b>strategic</b> <b>option.</b> An analytical hierarchy process is applied to selecting <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> that will be exercised...|$|R

From Taipei's perspective, the first <b>strategic</b> <b>option</b> is to maintain the interest of the US and this is largely done by emphasizing the threat posed by a rising China. The second <b>strategic</b> <b>option</b> relates to gaining more support from the US through highlighting the island republic's democratic credentials. Importantly, limitations exist in Taiwan's <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> in part because they are subject to positive responses from the US as well as reactions from China. For Taipei, a middle power, the key therefore is achieving an optimal mix of strategies while overcoming any deficiencies in order to enhance its national security...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the global}} climate change {{discussion}} and drastic challenges within the external operational environment, many traditional {{pulp and paper industry}} (PPI) companies are forced to search for new value creating business opportunities. This paper discusses this development in the PPI and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new <b>strategic</b> <b>options.</b> To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a PPI firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options in often thin (i. e., imperfect) intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained. The framework will be illustrated with <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> possible for the PPI the main focus being on the interface between the PPI and energy industry by means of a forest biorefinery case.

Based on Michael Codner’s theory of interoperability, this essay’s aim is to investigate if the Swedish and the Finnish currently are interoperable with each other, due to their <b>military</b> <b>strategic</b> concepts. According to Codner, similarities between the cooperating nation’s <b>military</b> <b>strategic</b> concepts are required in order to reach a high degree of interoperability. This essay will analyze and compare Sweden and Finland’s <b>military</b> <b>strategic</b> concepts, based on three categories; Global Projection, Territorial Defence and Combat Capability. The conclusion is that there are differences between the Swedish and the Finnish <b>military</b> <b>strategic</b> concepts in every category, of varying degrees.

Using this case we highlight the issues faced by a small entrepreneur in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based technologies in pharmaceuticals industry. The framework developed by Teece is used to analyze the <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> available to the entrepreneur in a weak appropriability regime. We also analyze a hypothetical scenario of <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> available to the entrepreneur if the appropriability regime was strong. Since traditional knowledge based entrepreneurial activities have significant scope in India, it is important to explore the policy and <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> that are available to us. In the context of the case study, the concluding part of the paper reviews these options and the associated implications for the holders of traditional knowledge. ...|$|R
