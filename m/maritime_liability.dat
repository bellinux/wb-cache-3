40|$|The {{principle}} of compulsory insurance was developed {{due to the}} huge and peculiar liabilities that {{may be involved in}} maritime incidents. This paper examines the evolving framework for compulsory insurance as part of the <b>maritime</b> <b>liability</b> regime. Although lacking a specific definition in the <b>maritime</b> <b>liability</b> conventions, it is clear that compulsory insurance falls within the framework of: (1) Specified liabilities; (2) a certain amount; and (3) the liability insurer, who can be sued directly by claimants. Our analysis of the {{principle of}} compulsory insurance and the effects brought about by it has led us to question whether it is necessary to propose first-party insurance; and whether it is feasible to impose a uniform system of compulsoiy insurance for maritime liabilities.

40|$|Following a {{description}} of the fundamental concepts and terms applicable in maritime risk management (MRM), the various methods by which shipowners might reduce their <b>maritime</b> <b>liability</b> risk are analysed. The advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods are addressed and examples of their potential use are provided. Based upon the premise of rational decision-making, an economic explanation for MRM is deduced from first principles and a distinction is drawn between the choice context of individual shipowners and that of maritime regulatory authorities. By integrating these two contexts, a conceptual approach to the application of cost-benefit analysis in maritime safety regulation is derived. The paper concludes by advocating the adoption of such an approach as a means of ensuring that safety regulation sets optimum targets such that the level of compliance yields maximum economic benefit and that the MRM which shipowners implement is effective in satisfying the regulatory targets that are set.

The fourth part deals with the possibility of contractual ensuring of <b>maritime</b> transport, <b>liability</b> of the carrier and conventions which govern this liability.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special <b>maritime</b> <b>liability</b> law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation of shipowners' liability. In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal of liability law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal of liability law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus of cargo liability law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals of liability law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect of liability law is affected by the availability of liability insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence of liability insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal of liability law...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{dangerous}} goods {{as it pertains}} to carriage by sea is of growing importance and concern because it impacts on safety as well as environmental issues. Both involve <b>liability</b> associated with <b>maritime</b> transportation and <b>liability</b> in respect of dangerous goods is a complex area of law both from an international as well as a domestic perspective. China is a rapidly emerging economic power and a major world player in shipping and seaborne trade including import and export of hazardous substances. Furthermore, China is undergoing remarkable reform and transformation in all respects, and legal regimes, especially in the maritime field, {{are in a state of}} evolution. This thesis presents a two-fold area of concentration, that is, the international regime and the domestic Chinese law, looking at the safety as well as the environmental dimensions of international carriage of dangerous goods by sea. In order to carry out a comparative analysis of the international and Chinese legal regimes pertaining to the issues of contractual and tortious liability, a relatively detailed analytical examination of the international regime has been completed. Following this, the legal regime under Chinese law concerning the sea carriage of dangerous goods is critically evaluated in terms of the evolution of the domestic maritime law and the issues of application of international law and domestic law from the perspectives of regulatory law and civil liability. The discussion on the existing issues liability is centered on the principles of liability in tort and contract borne by private parties and state responsibility in respect of damage arising from the maritime transportation of dangerous goods. Conclusions are drawn from the summaries of chapters highlighting the critical issues in light of the findings of the research; the appropriate recommendations and suggestions for improvements to the international regimes; and proposals for law reform in the form of new legislation or amendments to existing legislation with the aim of improving the domestic regime to bring it into closer alignment with international law on the carriage of dangerous goods by sea...|$|R
40|$|Civil {{liability}} for spills from oil rigs: {{the development of}} bilateral and regional principles Alexandra Wawryk * and Katelijn Van Hende † The pollution caused by the blowout of the Macondo well and explosion of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and the Montara blowout {{off the coast of}} northern Australia in 2009, exposed the lack of a uniform international civil liability regime for pollution caused by spills from offshore oil rigs. Despite calls to establish a global regime in this area, a multilateral treaty is not likely to materialise. Instead, the international community is cooperating on the development of principles addressing the civil {{liability for}} oil spills from offshore rigs to guide bilateral and regional arrangements. After a brief comparison of the principles that are already included in the national liability regimes of industrialised mature oil and gas nations, this article critiques recent efforts to develop statements of principles, concluding with recommendations. I. INTRODUCTION Oil exploration and production in the marine environment has led to many accidental spills. Accidental spills from offshore rigs do not respect the boundaries of a coastal state’s exclusive economic zone and territorial waters, and have the potential to inflict damage to 155.
