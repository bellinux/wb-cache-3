5|$|In 1951, Hammond {{resigned}} from Marsham's; {{his wife was}} homesick, leading Hammond to plan a business in South Africa with a partner. However, after moving to Durban, they realised they had insufficient money. He took a job with Denham Motors in Durban, where {{he was forced to}} work <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> in England. He lost his job in 1959 when the firm went out of business, and the Hammond family again found themselves in financial trouble.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|The Miller {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were unsatisfied with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the novels are made to look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers and pages darkened as though with time and use.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was noted}} {{to appeal to}} many types of riders, be they climbers, sprinters, or time trialists. The race had seven flat stages which figured into end in mass sprints, and the hilly mixed stages were {{inviting}} for breakaways. Sastre, {{one of the first}} riders to announce he would ride the Giro, commented that the route was <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> that of the 2009 Giro, and would demand a very strong climber to be its champion. Zomegnan concurred that the route favored climbers, noting that the distance spent time trialing was not great and that it would take errors from climbing specialists to allow a rider better suited for time trialing to be Giro champion.|$|E

In 1920 while on the coast he had occasion to see several professionals in action. He immediately became interested and decided to try his hand at the Scottish pastime, but he soon found that hitting the little white pill was <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> it appeared to be.|$|E

50|$|The Seven Second Summits are {{the second-highest}} {{mountains}} {{of each of}} the seven continents. All of these mountain peaks are separate peaks rather than a sub-peak of the continents' high point.

25|$|The German {{resistance}} in the eastern Carpathian region was <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> expected. The battle which began on 8 September would not see the Soviet forces {{on the other side}} of the pass until 6 October, and German forces would stop their heavy {{resistance in}} the region only around 10 October. Five days to Prešov turned into fifty days to Svidník alone with over 70,000 casualties on both sides. Prešov that was to be reached in six days remained beyond the Czechoslovaks' grasp for four months. The battle would be counted among one of the most bloody in the entire Eastern Front and in the history of Slovakia; one of the valleys in the pass near villages of Kapišová, Chyrowa, Iwla and Głojsce would become known as the Valley of Death.|$|E

She hopes {{for a change in}} attitude, noting how much change fellow medalist Benoit Huot has seen since the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney.|$|E
500|$|Seamounts often project upwards into {{shallower}} zones more {{hospitable to}} sea life, providing habitats for marine {{species that are}} not found on or around the surrounding deeper ocean bottom. Because seamounts are isolated from each other they form [...] "undersea islands" [...] creating the same biogeographical interest. As they are formed from volcanic rock, the substrate is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> the surrounding sedimentary deep sea floor. This causes {{a different type of}} fauna to exist than on the seafloor, and leads to a theoretically higher degree of endemism. However, recent research especially centered at Davidson Seamount suggests that seamounts may not be especially endemic, and discussions are ongoing on the effect of seamounts on endemicity. They have, however, been confidently shown to provide a habitat to species that have difficulty surviving elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|Lead {{developer}} Alan Flores {{has stated}} that {{the difficulty of the}} game is <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> previous games and is designed to challenge the hard-core player. [...] To meet the [...] "ferocity" [...] of Metallica's songs, the game features, in addition to the same five difficulty levels in World Tour, an [...] "Expert+" [...] mode for drummers that allows them to add a second bass drum pedal, though results of this mode is not tracked through online modes. [...] Additional drum pedals and a splitter, to allow two pedals to be used, were made available upon the game's release and as part of pre-ordering bonuses. While the game allows two guitar players to play lead and bass guitar, it does not give the players the option to play lead and rhythm guitar, which does not allow for notable [...] "Hetfield/Hammett riff-trading" [...] on certain songs. [...] Lead designer Alan Flores explained that the decision not to track the lead and rhythm (in addition to the single player guitar, bass, drums, and vocals) [...] "was simply a workload issue." ...|$|E
500|$|The monastery {{was damaged}} {{as a result}} of the 2011 Van earthquake. According to Ara Sarafian, [...] "parts of the main church collapsed, while other parts were {{significantly}} weakened. Old cracks got bigger, new ones appeared." [...] Turkish engineers reportedly inspected it and announced that they would commence restoration work in the spring of 2012. Sarafian wrote that [...] "such promises have been made in the past and one needs to be a little skeptical. The current state of the church makes such work <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> at any time in the past." [...] He noted in a 2012 article that the local and provincial governments supported the preservation and restoration of the monastery. In October 2012, the artist Raffi Bedrosyan, who contributed to the restoration of the St. Giragos Church in Diyarbakır, stated that he had hoped to restore Varagavank and added that [...] "Both Ankara and Van agreed to launch the restoration project, but social and natural obstacles delayed the process.". In 2017 it was documented that the remaining stones of the monastery are torn down bu the authorities and local government to build a local mosque and other developments with them.|$|E
500|$|Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker {{originally}} {{suggested the}} genus name Utahraptor {{for a new}} dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in Utah. Bakker {{was at the time}} consulting with the designers of the Jurassic Park film, whose largest portrayed Velociraptorcalled the [...] "big female" [...] in the scriptwas coincidentally {{the same size as the}} newly discovered Utahraptor. Bakker was motivated to write the book by both his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment, saying that [...] "nature is a drama. It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You've got life and death and sex and betrayal and the best way to approach it is through individual animals." [...] According to Bakker, [...] "It was fun to put myself in the mind of a raptor, especially since being a top predator is so challenging ... <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> [...] a herbivore." [...] He credited the turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton's works that focused on life from the perspectives of grizzly bears and wolves as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur's point of view.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career in far-right politics, Tyndall became less outspoken on race after his {{prosecution}} under the race relations legislation. In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used Spearhead to claim that [...] "the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure" [...] than white Europeans. In 1988, Tyndall described his crime as having [...] "dared to publish an honest and frank opinion on the relative merits of Whites and Negroes." [...] Tyndall argued that non-whites were unassimilable to Britain and that those living in Britain should be repatriated. Tyndall strongly objected to interracial relationships and miscegenation and remarked in his book The Eleventh Hour: [...] "I feel deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage, but I can have no sympathy whatever for the parents... They produced an offspring that will never wholly fit, and will undoubtedly face a life <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> the normal person born of pure race." [...] In contrast to his views on non-white migration, he spoke positively of white immigrants from Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic states, regarding them as being racially similar and sharing the [...] "same basic culture" [...] as the British and were thus easily able to assimilate [...] "within a generation or two".|$|E

It’s quite an intense track and an indication of the kind of rocky sound people can expect.|$|R

The NFLPA reportedly threatened to sue {{the city for the}} poor conditions, and many sports agents told the Eagles not to even consider signing or drafting their clients. The Eagles, for their part, complained to the city on numerous occasions about the conditions at the stadium. Baseball players also complained about the surface.

Guidobaldo da Montefeltro and Giovanni Maria da Varano returned to Urbino and Camerino, and Fossombrone revolted. The fact that his subjects had enjoyed his rule thus far meant that his opponents had to work <b>much</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> they would have liked.
