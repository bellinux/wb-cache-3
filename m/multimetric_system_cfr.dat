40|$|Within the {{ecological}} assessment of running waters based on benthic macroinvertebrates {{different levels of}} taxonomic resolution (species, genus, family and higher) are in use. Although assessment systems are often developed with detailed data on species level, water managers and other end-users could like to use data on higher taxonomic levels to assess {{the ecological}} quality of a water body because of limited human or money resources. The question that arises is, if an assessment system built with species level data is also applicable using data with a higher taxonomic resolution. Within the AQEM project a <b>multimetric</b> assessment <b>system</b> was developed to evaluate the ecological quality classes (from bad (1) to high (5) ecological quality) of different stream types throughout Europe. The present study focuses on the question whether the resulting water quality class changes using the AQEM Assessment Software (AAS) with different taxonomic resolutions and if yes, how large the deviations of ecological quality classes from the original classes are and if the deviations are unidirectional. For analyses data from four Austrian and two Dutch stream types were used. It is demonstrated that the assignment of a site to an ecological quality class may change if different taxonomic levels are used. Deviations in both directions (higher/lower ecological quality class) were observed. In most cases the divergence was only one ecological quality class, but also larger deviations occasionally occurred. The causes {{of changes in the}} assessment were investigated by separately looking into the underlying metrics of the <b>multimetric</b> <b>system.</b> Some of the evaluated metrics rely on autecological information on species level and are simply not applicable on higher taxonomic levels. Other metrics worked on higher taxonomic levels as well and showed more or less good distinctions between ecological quality classes.

The metrics were assessed against the following criteria: (1) predictable response to the impact of human activity; (2) highest taxonomic resolution, and (3) operational and theoretical simplicity. We found that 18 metrics were correlated with the environmental and spatial predictors used, and seven of these satisfied the selection criteria and are thus candidates for inclusion in a <b>multimetric</b> <b>system</b> to assess low-order streams in So Paulo State.

40|$|AbstractThe European Water Framework Directive {{requires}} that member states assess all their surface waters {{based on a}} number of biological elements, including macroinvertebrates. Since 1989, the Flemish Environment Agency has been using the Belgian Biotic Index for assessing river water quality based on macroinvertebrates. Throughout the years, the Belgian Biotic Index {{has proven to be a}} reliable and robust method providing a good indication of general degradation of river water and habitat quality. Since the Belgian Biotic Index does not meet all the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, a new index, the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for evaluating rivers and lakes was developed and tested. This index was developed in order to provide a general assessment of ecological deterioration caused by any kind of stressor, such as water pollution and habitat quality degradation. The MMIF is based on macroinvertebrate samples that are taken using the same sampling and identification procedure as the Belgian Biotic Index. The index calculation is a type-specific <b>multimetric</b> <b>system</b> based on five equally weighted metrics, which are taxa richness, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, number of other sensitive taxa, the Shannon–Wiener diversity index and the mean tolerance score. The final index value is expressed as an Ecological Quality Ratio ranging from zero for very bad ecological quality to one for very good ecological quality. The MMIF correlates positively with dissolved oxygen and negatively with Kjeldahl nitrogen, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrite, total phosphorous, orthophosphate and biochemical and chemical oxygen demand. This new index is now being used by the Flemish Environment Agency as a standard method to report about the status of macroinvertebrates in rivers and lakes in Flanders within the context of the European Water Framework Directive...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the European Union (EU) funded project AQEM 1 {{was to develop a}} framework of an assessment system for streams in Europe based on benthic macroinvertebrates that fulfils the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive. Initial assessment methods for 28 European stream types and more generally applicable tools for stream biomonitoring in Europe were generated. The development of the system was based on a newly collected data set covering stream types in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. Altogether, 901 benthic invertebrate samples were taken using a standardised multi-habitat sampling procedure and a large number of parameters describing the streams and their catchments was recorded for all sampling sites. From the stream and catchment characteristics measures of stress were derived. A large number of metrics was tested independently for each of the stream types, to identify the response of each metric to degradation of a site. This process resulted in up to 18 core metrics for the individual stream types, which were combined into a different multimetric index in each country. The <b>multimetric</b> AQEM assessment <b>system</b> is used to classify a stream stretch into an Ecological Quality Class ranging from 5 (high quality) to 1 (bad quality) and often provides information on the possible causes of degradation.

MB has also been proposed as a brain metabolic enhancer because of its action on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. We used in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine how MB affects brain metabolism and hemodynamics. For in vitro, we evaluated the effect of MB on brain mitochondrial function, oxygen consumption, and glucose uptake. For in vivo, we applied neuroimaging and intravenous measurements to determine MB’s effect on glucose uptake, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in rats. MB significantly increases mitochondrial complex I–III activity in isolated mitochondria and enhances oxygen consumption and glucose uptake in HT- 22 cells. Using positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we observed significant increases in brain glucose uptake, CBF, and CMRO 2 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Further, MRI revealed that MB dramatically increased CBF in the hippocampus and in the cingulate, motor, and frontoparietal cortices, {{areas of the brain}} affected by Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.

40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{the study}} was to develop a <b>multimetric</b> {{assessment}} <b>system</b> for macroinvertebrate communities of small and mid-sized streams in Germany in accordance with the Water Framework Directive of the European Union. The system should be applicable by water authorities, capable of distinguishing between different impacts, and specifically adapted to all types of small and mid-sized rivers in Germany. An assessment system has been developed consisting of two modules based on the established indices for saprobic degradation and acidity, and a third module covering general degradation. For the third module a new multimetric index (MMI) was developed and tested using preclassifications for stream hydromorphological degradation, land use and general impairment as impact measures. More information on sampling method, season and the type of dominating human impairment allowed to further analyse the index' capabilities and sensitivity. It performed well in all seasons and detected all types of impairment except acidity. The usefulness of the impact measures used in this study is discussed with regard to the development of a multimetric index. The comparison of the new index with other indices showed that it is especially sensitive in detecting macroinvertebrate community responses to hydromorphological degradation and pollution such as the German AQEM index, while IBI 12 and Renkonen's similarity more reflect general community shifts caused by any type of disturbance.

METHODS: Fifteen relevant metrics had been identified for diagnostic hysteroscopy by means of hierarchical task decomposition. They were grouped into four modules (visualization, ergonomics, safety, and fluid handling) and individually weighted, building the MMSS for this study. In a first step, 24 novice medical students and 12 experienced gynecologists went through a self-paced teaching tutorial, in which all participants received clearly stated goals and instructions on how to carry out hysteroscopic procedures properly for this study. All subjects performed five repeated trials on two different exercises on HystSim (exploration and diagnosis exercises). After each trial the results were presented to the participants {{in the form of an}} automated objective feedback report (AOFR). Construct validity for the MMSS and learning curves were investigated by comparing the performance between novices and experienced surgeons and in between the repeated trials. To study the effect of repeated practice, 23 of the novices returned 2 weeks later for a second training session. RESULTS: Comparing novices with the experienced group, the ergonomics and fluid handling modules resulted in construct validity, while the visualization module did not, and for the safety module the experienced group even scored significantly lower than novices in both exercises. The overall score showed only construct validity when the safety module was excluded. Concerning learning curves, all subjects improved significantly during the training on HystSim, with clear indication that the second training session was beneficial for novice surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Construct validity for HystSim has been established for different modules of VR metrics on a new MMSS developed for diagnostic hysteroscopy.

BackgroundCoronary flow reserve {{has been reported to}} have important clinical implications for the evaluation and treatment of coronary artery disease. MethodsUsing a pressure guide wire, coronary pressure distal to the stenosis was measured at rest and during hyperemia in seven dogs with various degrees of stenosis and in 30 patients with angina (29 and 34 stenoses in total, respectively). Pressure {{at the tip of the}} guiding catheter was also recorded with a fluid-filled transducer <b>system.</b> Pressure-derived <b>CFR</b> was calculated by the square root of the pressure gradient across the stenosis (ΔP) during hyperemia divided by ΔP at rest, using a proprietary software system. At the same time, coronary flow was monitored proximal to the stenosis with a flow meter in the experimental dogs, and coronary flow velocity distal to the stenosis was assessed using a Doppler guide wire in patients with angina. Flow-derived (or velocity-derived) CFR was compared with pressure-derived CFR. ResultsExcept for one stenosis that showed no ΔP at rest, a significant correlation was obtained between pressure- and flow-derived CFR in the animal study (y = 1. 05 x − 0. 03, r = 0. 92, p = 0. 0001). A significant correlation was also seen between pressure- and velocity-derived CFR in the human study, except in three stenoses with no resting ΔP (y = 0. 70 x + 0. 37, r = 0. 85, p = 0. 0001).

Ground water in the uppermost aquifer was contaminated by uranium processing activities at the Spook site, which is in Converse County, approximately 48 miles (mi) (77 kilometers [km]) northeast of Casper, Wyoming. Constituents from the site infiltrated and migrated into the uppermost aquifer, forming a plume that extends approximately 2500 feet (ft) (800 meters [m]) downgradient from the site. The principal site-related hazardous constituents in this plume are uranium, selenium, and nitrate. Background ground water in the uppermost aquifer at the site is considered limited use.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD; EU, 2000) is to attain a good status for all surface waters in the European Union by the end of 2015. To this end, the ecological status of natural surface waters should be assessed, based on a number of biological quality elements which depend on the category of surface water (rivers, lakes, transitional waters or coastal waters). For each of these elements, member states must choose or develop a classification method, taking into account a set of parameters depending on the quality element and on the surface water category (EU, 2000). The assessment system must be differentiated among the types of water bodies within a category. The method must be in agreement with an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) showing relative proportion of the index compared to the reference conditions. This EQR ranges from zero to one, respectively corresponding to a bad and a very good ecological status. This interval is divided into five classes reflecting bad, poor, moderate, good and high ecological status (EU, 2000). For the categories rivers and lakes, one of the relevant biological quality elements is the “benthic invertebrate fauna” (EU, 2000), commonly referred to as macroinvertebrates. For this quality element, the parameters “taxonomic composition and abundance”, “ratio of disturbance sensitive to insensitive taxa” and “diversity” should be taken into account. In Flanders, Belgium, the Belgian Biotic Index (BBI; De Pauw and Vanhooren, 1983), based on macroinvertebrates, has been applied in routine monitoring schemes by the Flemish Environment Agency (VMM) since 1989, confirming the reliability and robustness of this biological quality index. However, with respect to the application of this index for rivers and lakes within a WFD context, not all technical requirements are met by the BBI. The abundance, {{which is one of the}} relevant parameters imposed by the WFD, is not taken into account in the BBI calculation, and this index is not explicitly based on a reference condition approach. Furthermore, it is not a type-specific method, in other words, all types of rivers are evaluated by means of the same criteria, and the BBI was intended as an assessment system for watercourses only, not for lakes (De Pauw and Vanhooren, 1983). Two general problems are identified that are associated with taxonomic resolution in water quality assessment based on macroinvertebrates. These are explored by means of analysis of the BBI index calculation method. A first difficulty is caused by possible changes in taxonomy over time, giving rise to inconsistencies in index calculation. A second problem is due to the introduction of exotic species. Both problems can introduce a bias in calculation of the index. To avoid this problem in future assessment methods, it is proposed to use a taxa list to which no changes are made except for the addition of newly introduced exotic species. Since the BBI does not meet all the requirements of the WFD, a new index, the Multimetric Macroinvertebrate Index Flanders (MMIF) for assessing rivers and lakes is proposed. This index is developed using the database of macroinvertebrate samples provided by the VMM. The MMIF is calculated based on macroinvertebrate community data obtained using the same sampling and identification procedure as the BBI. The index calculation is a type-specific <b>multimetric</b> <b>system</b> based on five equally weighted metrics, which are taxa richness, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and/or Trichoptera taxa, number of other sensitive taxa, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and the mean tolerance score. The final index value is expressed as an EQR ranging from zero for bad status to one for high status. The MMIF combines the robustness of the BBI and the long-term experience in Flanders with the flexibility of multimetric indices, while at the same time taking into account the technical requirements of the WFD. To ensure that boundary values for the national biological assessment methods are comparable along all member states in Europe, regional intercalibration exercises were envisaged by the WFD for each quality element and for each category of water body. For river macroinvertebrates, the relevant regional intercalibration exercise for Flanders was coordinated by the so-called Central-Baltic Geographical Intercalibration Group (CB-GIG, 2006). Flanders contributed to this intercalibration exercise, using VMM sampling data, in order to compare the Flemish boundary values to those of the other participating countries and regions and, if necessary, to adjust them to ensure inclusion in the intercalibration decision of the European Commission (EU, 2007). This exercise for river macroinvertebrates essentially consisted in a regression of each participating member states’ national method against a common, generally applicable index. This regression is carried out separately by each member state using a national dataset. Based on the obtained regression equation, each country converts its national boundary values into values on the scale of the common index for subsequent comparison. The mean value of the converted national boundaries is calculated and the rescaled national boundaries should be within a certain range of this mean value in order to be considered as comparable (CB-GIG, 2006). Two major problems emerged with regard to the Flemish contribution. First, the derivation of reference values for the metrics of the common index was not possible using field data because no reference sites are present in Flanders. To overcome this problem, an alternative and transparent way of deriving reference values was used in order to have reference values comparable to those of the other member states (Gabriels, 2007). The second problem concerned the boundary values, which clearly fell below the comparability interval. Therefore, alternative boundary values were proposed. This adjustment of the MMIF class boundaries for rivers was formally accepted by the steering group of the intercalibration exercise (CB-GIG, 2007). The adjusted values were adopted in the draft version of the intercalibration decision of the European Commission (EU, 2007), of which the official publication is foreseen for the end of 2007...|$|R

Although the mulching increased the cost of production for AWD and AR, the gross income of these systems was also improved significantly. The gross income from mulched plots of AWD and AR was higher than non-mulched plots of the same systems. In conclusion, AWD and AR effectively reduce cost of production by economizing the water use.

30|$|Concerning {{the service}} {{connectivity}} of the network, the connection-level QoS requirements were achieved through admission control (AC) and resource reservation (RR) [4], whose performance can be evaluated by following metrics: handoff connection dropping rate (CDR), new connection blocking rate (CBR), ongoing connection failure rate (CFR). There are many tradeoffs among these metrics for designing AC and RR schemes. For AC, too stringent restrictions for accepting new/handoff connections {{will reduce the}} CFR {{at the cost of}} deteriorating CBR, CDR, and resource utilization. Even though looser restrictions indicate lower CBR and CDR, too much accepted services may cause <b>system</b> overload, and <b>CFR</b> will greatly increase when the channel condition becomes seriously deteriorated. Since blocking a new connection is more acceptable than dropping a handoff connection from the user viewpoint, performing RR for handoff connections can effectively reduce the CDR. However, over-reservation will deteriorate the CBR and the resource utilization while insufficient reservation cannot achieve prospective CDR target. Therefore, a good AC and RR scheme should well balance these tradeoffs to guarantee the system stability. As for the AC schemes proposed for IEEE 802.16 BWA networks, the authors of [5, 6] did not consider the handoff situation, which is a crucial characteristic of IEEE 802.16 e. The authors of [7 – 10] took the handoff requirements in to account regardless of the channel condition. For the general AC schemes proposed in [4, 11 – 18], the time-variant channel conditions were not considered either. In [19], the authors modified the handoff-prioritized AC scheme considering AMC over the unreliable wireless channel, but few QoS-adaptive characteristics were discussed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEffective {{ecosystem}} {{management in the}} face of human alterations depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among impact levels and types. We reviewed the literature on biological responses of freshwater biota to human disturbances over the last century. Many of the main methods for assessing ecological integrity originated in Europe [e. g., Saprobien Index, Trent Biotic Index, Biological Monitoring Working Party, River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System, multiple traits] or in North America [e. g., Index of Biotic Integrity, leaf-litter breakdown, functional feeding groups]. We used bibliometric data to detail the contribution of J-NABS to developments in assessment of ecological integrity. A total of 225 bioassessment articles were published in J-NABS from 1986 to 2007. This total was ½ of the number of bioassessment articles published over the same period in Freshwater Biology (FWB; another leading freshwater journal used for comparison), but the proportion of bioassessment articles in the 2 journals was similar (20 %). The proportion of bioassessment articles in J-NABS has increased over the last 25 y. This trend indicates the growing interest in the topic and the delay (30 y since the Clean Water Act) of scientific action in response to water legislation. Taxonomic composition and multivariate techniques, <b>multimetric</b> indices, lotic <b>systems,</b> macroinvertebrates, land use, and overall human impacts were major themes in J-NABS bioassessment articles. Progress in bioassessment is needed in 3 main areas. First, bioassessments done at large spatial scales are needed to meet requirements of new environmental policies. Second, bioassessment should shift from consideration of taxon losses to losses of ecological functions. Third, statistical techniques are needed for predictive assessment of deviation in ecological integrity between expected (natural) and observed (natural or impacted) conditions. Assessment of functional integrity based on multiple traits is a promising area because biological traits represent universal biological characteristics that are connected to ecosystem functions. However, the relationships between ecophysiological traits of individuals and ecosystem-scale responses must be properly defined for specific types of human impairment, and utility of the approach for routine bioassessments applied by managers must be tested...|$|R
40|$|Copper sulfate {{is listed}} as allowed for use in crop <b>systems</b> in 7 <b>CFR</b> 205 for plant disease control, with a {{restriction}} that it {{be used in a}} manner that minimizes copper accumulation in the soil. It is also listed for use as a micronutrient with a testing requirement for documented deficiency. The petition is for use as an algicide and to control invertebrates, specifically tadpole shrimp in rice production. This material has been historically widely used for organic crop disease control in the US and internationally, but the EU has proposed a complete ban on all copper use scheduled to take effect in May 2002. Reviewers were concerned primarily about effects of this use on the aquatic environment, impact on aquatic organisms, and soil accumulation. Reviewers cited concerns about negative effect on mosquito fish, pond snails, and amphibians at the requested rate of use. The literature indicates that while copper sulfate is relatively immobile in soil and becomes quickly bound or adsorbed to organic or clay fractions in the soil, it is also highly water soluble. Some research indicates this may be of concern in marshland ecosystems subject to flooding and drying conditions. While all three reviewer shared concerns about impact on aquatic organisms, one felt that the use of the material should be permitted with strict limitations. Two reviewers found this material not compatible with sustainable systems and recommended against this use. The petitioner proposes listing for this use, with possible restrictions to limit the use to one application per year not to exceed rates of 10 lbs /acre (copper pentahydrate form) ...|$|R
40|$|Layer {{parallel}} shortening (LPS) is {{an expression}} of compressive strain that occurs parallel to bedding surfaces. LPS is chiefly expressed by chemical changes to sediment volume, including stylolitization, porosity reduction and impingement of grains. This strain is typically omitted in the process of cross-section restoration {{due to a lack of}} understanding of spatial and temporal LPS accommodation. Bulk shortening calculated is considered to be a minimum shortening estimate. However, dismissing this inaccuracy due to shortening can lead to significant error in subsurface predictions and reconstructions. To address this problem, a combination of thin section analysis and analog modeling assessed the amount of LPS across the central Colorado Front Range (<b>CFR)</b> <b>system.</b> A geologic cross-section of the eastern CFR was built using field data and a minimum bulk shortening was calculated. A scaled analog model was deformed incrementally in accordance with the cross-section restoration and Colorado’s well-constrained tectonic history. Cross-sections from the model were restored and compared to the cross-section of the CFR. LPS results from the analog model and from thin sections show a complex relationship between LPS and geologic setting. LPS is variable with respect to depth in the stratigraphic column, with respect to divisions of mechanical strength in the stratigraphy, and in proximity to meso- and macroscale structures. Thus, there is no single rule for spatial and temporal LPS accommodation that can be applied to any deformed belt. LPS needs to be treated separately in each stratigraphic or mechanical unit and varies with increasing distance from major structural features such as faults. LPS is measurable, and can be addressed with strategic sampling using oriented core in any region dominated by sandstone and limestone. Adviser: Caroline M. Burberr...|$|R
40|$|This {{initial report}} is being {{submitted}} pursuant to Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) {section} 761. 75 (c) to request authorization {{to allow the}} disposal of transuranic (TRU) wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which are duly regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Approval of this initial report will not affect the disposal of TRU or TRU mixed wastes that do not contain PCBs. This initial report also demonstrates how the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) meets or exceeds the technical standards for a Chemical Waste Landfill. Approval of this request will allow the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to dispose of approximately 88, 000 cubic feet (ft 3) (2, 500 cubic meters [m 3]) of TRU wastes containing PCBs subject to regulation under the TSCA. This approval will include only those PCB/TRU wastes, which the TSCA regulations allow for disposal of the PCB component in municipal solid waste facilities or chemical waste landfills (e. g., PCB remediation waste, PC B articles, and bulk PCB product waste). Disposal of TRU waste by the DOE is congressionally mandated in Public Law 102 - 579 (as amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, Pub. L. 104 - 201, {{referred to as the}} WIPP Land Withdrawal Act [LWA]). Portions of the TRU waste inventory contain hazardous waste constituents regulated under 40 CFR Parts 260 through 279, and/or PCBs and PCB Items regulated under 40 CFR Part 761. Therefore, the DOE TRU waste program must address the disposal requirements for these hazardous waste constituents and PCBs. To facilitate the disposal of TRU wastes containing hazardous waste constituents, the owner/operators received a Hazardous Waste Facility Permit (HWFP) from the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) on October 27, 1999. The permit allows the disposal of TRU wastes subject to hazardous waste disposal requirements (TRU mixed waste). Informational copies of this permit and other referenced documents are available from the WIPP website. To facilitate the disposal of TRU wastes containing PCBs, the owner/operators are hereby submitting this initial report containing information required pursuant to the Chemical Waste Landfill Approval requirements in 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 (c). Although WIPP is defined as a miscellaneous unit and not a landfill by the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act, WIPP meets or exceeds all applicable technical standards for chemical waste landfills by virtue of its design and programs as indicated in the Engineering Report (Attachment B). The layout of this initial report is consistent with requirements (i. e., Sections 2. 0 through 12. 0 following the sequence of 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [c][i] -[ix] with sections added to discuss the Contingency and Training Plans; and Attachment B of this initial report addresses the requirements of 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][1] through [9] in this order). This initial report includes a description of three proposed changes that will be subject to ''conditional approval. '' The first will allow the disposal of remote-handled (RH) PCB/TRU waste at WIPP. The second will allow the establishment of a central confirmation facility at WIPP. The third will allow for an increase in contact-handled Working Copy Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Initial Report for PCB Disposal Authorization DOE/WIPP 02 - 3196 (CH) waste storage capacities. These proposed changes are discussed further in Section 3. 3 of this initial report. ''Conditional approval'' of these requests would allow these activities at WIPP contingent upon: - Approval of the HWFP modification (NMED) and Compliance Certification Application (CCA) change request (Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]) - Inspection of facility prior to implementing the change (if deemed necessary by the EPA) - Written approval from the EPA This initial report also includes the following three requests for waivers to the technical requirements for Chemical Waste Landfills pursuant to 40 CFR {section} 761. 75 (c) (4) : - Hydrologic Conditions (40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][3]) - Monitoring <b>Systems</b> (40 <b>CFR</b> {section} 761. 75 [b][6]) - Leachate Collection (40 CFR {section} 761. 75 [b][7]) The details explaining the purpose and scope of these waivers are addressed by Attachment B to this initial report...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 6, 2016 - October 6, 2018 Accumulating human impacts on freshwater ecosystems have created a biodiversity crisis for freshwater fishes while conservation efficacy remains hampered by the Linnaean shortfall, the ignorance of many species {{that have yet to}} be discovered and described. The past discovery of most freshwater fish species was simply a matter of collecting in taxonomically blank or poorly explored places on the map and then describing whatever looked different. Increasingly, especially in well-sampled areas, undescribed species are likely to be morphologically cryptic and are only discovered after intensive research. Fortunately, biogeography has arranged biodiversity into patterns that, if revealed and understood, can be used to straighten the path to discovery. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of the southwestern and southern coast of South Africa is famous for its 6, 200 species of endemic plants but its coastal river systems contain only 19 primary freshwater fish species according to traditional (morphological) taxonomy. However, 16 of them are endemic and recent studies have revealed additional, cryptic species within them. Understanding how biogeographical processes have generated this endemic cryptic diversity could inform the search for species in other coastal regions around the world. This dissertation is focused on one primary freshwater fish, the Cape Kurper, Sandelia capensis (Cuvier 1829), a climbing gourami (Anabantidae) found in coastal river <b>systems</b> across the <b>CFR.</b> The results of previous studies suggest that it may also include undescribed cryptic species, and its ubiquity in the CFR makes it an excellent model species for studying the biogeographic processes that generate endemic species in coastal river systems. After collecting a large number of specimens and tissue samples from across the geographic range of S. capensis, the first step was to obtain mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences and produce a molecular phylogeny and haplotype network. Based on these results I hypothesized that S. capensis sensu lato is actually comprised of three cryptic species: Sandelia sp. [West Coast], Sandelia sp. [Klein River], and Sandelia sp. [South Coast]. Using fossil calibrations I generated a dated phylogeny which provided divergence times for the three putative species and the various lineages within them. The divergence times and phylogeographic patterns were then compared to the history of geology, climate, and sea level to evaluate the relative significance of four biogeographic processes in driving the evolution and distribution of S. capensis lineages. The results indicate that the distribution of lineages is most consistent with a history of rare transdivide dispersal by river captures with a smaller role for dispersal via paleoriver confluences during low sea levels brought about by the Pleistocene glacial periods. Due to the narrow and steep continental shelf along the coast west of Cape Agulhas (the southern extreme of Africa) and north of the Cape of Good Hope, paleoriver dispersal was only likely to the east where the continental shelf is wide. However, S. capensis apparently did not use some paleoriver confluences, possibly because of intervening paleowaterfalls or fast currents. The divergence of the cryptic species, and the lineages within them, is mostly due to long isolation within coastal river systems. This isolation was maintained by the marine environment, the paucity of usable paleoriver confluences, and persistent drainage divides due to the relatively stable geology and dry climate which limit river capture events. There was little support for the influence of marine transgressions which could have isolated populations in tributaries by drowning the confluences between them. The second phase of this research was an analysis of morphological variation based on linear morphometrics, meristics, and geometric morphometrics. The goal was to determine whether morphology supported the species hypotheses, and to discover diagnostic characters. While there was statistical and diagnostic support for all three species, the differences were very subtle. There was more variation within species than between them. The fact that 35 – 40 linear measurements, or 20 meristic counts, were needed in the discriminant functions indicated very strong morphological stasis. The relatively stable geomorphology and climate, the broad niche of S. capensis sensu lato, and the dearth of fish competitors and predators, point to niche conservatism as the most likely explanation for the cryptic nature of the three putative species. Finally, in a revision of S. capensis sensu lato, I describe Sandelia sp. [Klein River] from the 980 km² Klein River basin, Sandelia sp. [West Coast] from the Langvlei, Verlorenvlei, Berg, and Diep river systems on the west coast, and Sandelia [South Coast] from drainages on the south coast other than the Klein River system. I also evaluate the conservation implications of this revision. Considering population losses already brought about by alien bass and trout, water extraction, and habitat degradation, I recommend prompt population assessments and strong protection, particularly for Sandelia sp. [Klein River] and Sandelia sp. [West Coast]...|$|R
