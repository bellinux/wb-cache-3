For this reason, this paper aims at proposing a new multi-scale model as a way to provide a better structuring, better perception and better description of the many aspects involved in a product design and its <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plan.</b> The product and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plan</b> models are based on different scale representations, characterized through “representation axes”, where the knowledge is decomposed and commit.

The transfer of the condition dimensions in manufacturing dimensions is therefore not always direct because the setup operator might also want to control the position of the unfinished surfaces during the adjustment of the machine.

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} the product design {{consists}} in {{a plan for the}} product, its components and subassemblies. To obtain the physical entity building a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plan</b> is needed. The activity of developing such a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>plan</b> is name process planning. Process planning is the relation between design and <b>manufacturing.</b> Process <b>planning</b> consists in defining the sequence of the steps that should be taken to make the product. Process planning is referring to the engineering and technological issues of how to make it. Process Planning Process planning involves determining the most appropriate manufacturing and assembly processes and the sequence in which they should be produced to result a part or product according to specifications set in the product design documentation. The processes that can be planned are generally limited by the available equipment and technological capabilities of the company. Parts that can not be made internally must be purchased from outside the company. It should be mentioned that variety of processes planned is also limited by the details of the product design. Process planning is usually accomplished by production engineers. The production engineer can be named manufacturing engineer, industrial engineer. The process planner must know in detail...|$|R

ETO environments are complex and require sophisticated planning techniques. In fact, the shortcomings of planning and scheduling systems are exacerbating the ability of ETO companies to reduce manufacturing cycle times. This thesis presents an overview of ETO environments and related <b>manufacturing</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling systems. The reasons for the failure of present MRP systems to address ETO environments are discussed along with an analysis of the planning systems of real companies. A new framework for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>planning</b> and scheduling in ETO environments is proposed. It addresses the importance of coordinating planning and scheduling among engineering, material procurement and the shop floor. It incorporates finite capacity scheduling into MRP systems to overcome load fluctuations. It also has scheduling mechanisms to address the dynamic nature of ETO environments...|$|E
