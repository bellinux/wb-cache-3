5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be <b>methylated</b> to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|In eukaryotes, {{modifications}} of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60–300nt), {{found in the}} nucleolus and cajal bodies. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs can also be the target of base modification. RNA can also be <b>methylated.</b>|$|E
5|$|While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25nt) {{are often}} {{produced}} by breakdown of viral RNA, {{there are also}} endogenous sources of siRNAs. siRNAs act through RNA interference in a fashion similar to miRNAs. Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they target to be <b>methylated,</b> thereby decreasing or increasing transcription of those genes. Animals have Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA; 29-30nt) that are active in germline cells and {{are thought to be}} a defense against transposons and play a role in gametogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the RITS complex induces heterochromatin formation and organization is not well understood. Most {{studies have focused on}} the mating-type region in fission yeast, which may not be representative of activities in other genomic regions/organisms. In maintenance of existing heterochromatin regions, RITS forms a complex with siRNAs complementary to the local genes and stably binds local <b>methylated</b> histones, acting co-transcriptionally to degrade any nascent pre-mRNA transcripts that are initiated by RNA polymerase. The formation of such a heterochromatin region, though not its maintenance, is dicer-dependent, presumably because dicer is required to generate the initial complement of siRNAs that target subsequent transcripts. Heterochromatin maintenance has been suggested to function as a self-reinforcing feedback loop, as new siRNAs are formed from the occasional nascent transcripts by RdRP for incorporation into local RITS complexes. The relevance of observations from fission yeast mating-type regions and centromeres to mammals is not clear, as heterochromatin maintenance in mammalian cells may be independent of the components of the RNAi pathway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylated</b> DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP), {{analogous}} to chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunoprecipitation {{is used to}} isolate <b>methylated</b> DNA fragments for input into DNA detection methods such as DNA microarrays (MeDIP-chip) or DNA sequencing (MeDIP-seq).|$|E
25|$|High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRM or HRMA), is a post-PCR {{analytical}} technique. The target DNA {{is treated}} with sodium bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils, while <b>methylated</b> cytosines are preserved. PCR amplification is then {{carried out with}} primers designed to amplify both <b>methylated</b> and unmethylated templates. After this amplification, highly <b>methylated</b> DNA sequences contain a higher number of CpG sites compared to unmethylated templates, which results in a different melting temperature {{that can be used}} in quantitative methylation detection.|$|E
25|$|Differentially <b>methylated</b> {{regions are}} {{generally}} segments of DNA rich in cytosine and guanine nucleotides, with the cytosine nucleotides <b>methylated</b> on one copy {{but not on}} the other. Contrary to expectation, methylation does not necessarily mean silencing; instead, the effect of methylation depends upon the default state of the region.|$|E
25|$|Phosphatidylcholine {{can also}} be {{produced}} by the methylation pathway, where phosphatidylethanolamine is sequentially <b>methylated.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP), {{which is}} based on a {{chemical}} reaction of sodium bisulfite with DNA that converts unmethylated cytosines of CpG dinucleotides to uracil or UpG, followed by traditional PCR. However, <b>methylated</b> cytosines will not be converted in this process, and primers are designed to overlap the CpG site of interest, which allows one to determine methylation status as <b>methylated</b> or unmethylated.|$|E
25|$|This coupled {{expression}} is only lost {{in cases of}} loss of imprinting (inherited CpG <b>methylated)</b> or promoter mutation.|$|E
25|$|N-acetylserotonin is <b>methylated</b> at the {{hydroxyl}} {{position by}} S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to produce S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and melatonin.|$|E
25|$|Choriocarcinomas, in {{contrast}} to adrenal carcinomas, have upregulated H19 and downregulated IGF2 expression. The upregulated H19 expression, however, came from alleles that were fully <b>methylated.</b> Surgically removed choriocarcinomas from human patients also exhibited a heavily <b>methylated</b> H19 promoter with enhanced H19 expression. This led researchers Arima et al. to suggest that in cases of choriocarcinomas, the H19 promoter was mutated, allowing it to overcome the transcriptional repression of promoter CpG methylation.|$|E
25|$|The DNA {{methylation}} {{landscape of}} vertebrates is very particular {{compared to other}} organisms. In vertebrates, around 60–80% of CpG are <b>methylated</b> in somatic cells and DNA methylation appears as a default state {{that has to be}} specifically excluded from defined locations. By contrast, the genome of most plants, invertebrates, fungi or protists show “mosaic” methylation patterns, where only specific genomic elements are targeted, and they are characterized by the alternation of <b>methylated</b> and unmethylated domains.|$|E
25|$|GLAD-PCR assay, {{which is}} based on new type of enzymes – {{site-specific}} methyl-directed DNA endonucleases, which hydrolyze only <b>methylated</b> DNA.|$|E
25|$|In DNMT-null mice, the {{paternal}} allele of IGF2 is also silenced as the paternal H19 promoter is {{no longer}} <b>methylated</b> and repressed.|$|E
25|$|The HELP assay, {{which is}} based on {{restriction}} enzymes' differential ability to recognize and cleave <b>methylated</b> and unmethylated CpG DNA sites.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a CpG site, in plants the cytosine can be <b>methylated</b> at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but not guanine. Overall, Arabidopsis DNA is highly <b>methylated,</b> mass spectrometry analysis estimated 14% of cytosines to be modified.|$|E
25|$|If {{homocysteine}} {{is produced}} the thiol group is <b>methylated,</b> yielding methionine. Two methionine synthases are known, one cobalamin (vitamin B12) dependent and one independent.|$|E
25|$|Similar to mammals, {{chickens}} seem to use CpG islands (segments of Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine {{that are}} more readily <b>methylated</b> and silenced than other DNA segments) to regulate gene expression. One study found that CpG islands were found primarily in compensated areas of the Z chromosome—areas that are differentially expressed in male and female chickens. Thus {{it is likely that}} these CpG islands are locations where genes on the male Z chromosome are <b>methylated</b> and silenced, but which stay functional on the female Z chromosome.|$|E
25|$|The second {{way is the}} {{addition}} of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at CpG sites, to convert cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. 5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing with a guanine in double-stranded DNA. However, {{some areas of the}} genome are <b>methylated</b> more heavily than others, and highly <b>methylated</b> areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from one parent or the other (genetic imprinting).|$|E
25|$|Two of DNA's four bases, {{cytosine}} and adenine, can be <b>methylated.</b> Cytosine methylation {{is widespread}} in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, {{even though the}} rate of cytosine DNA methylation can differ greatly between species: 14% of cytosines are <b>methylated</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana, 8% in Physarum, 4% in Mus musculus, 2.3% in Escherichia coli, 0.03% in Drosophila, 0.006% in Dictyostelium and virtually none (< 0.0002%) in Caenorhabditis or yeast species such as S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (but not N. crassa). Adenine methylation has been observed in bacterial, plant and recently in mammalian DNA, but have received considerably less attention.|$|E
25|$|In 29–66% of glioblastomas, DNA repair is {{deficient}} due to epigenetic methylation of the MGMT gene, {{which reduces}} protein expression of MGMT. However, for 28% of glioblastomas, the MGMT protein is deficient, but the MGMT promoter is not <b>methylated.</b> In glioblastomas without <b>methylated</b> MGMT promoters, {{the level of}} microRNA miR-181d is inversely correlated with protein expression of MGMT and the direct target of miR-181d is the MGMT mRNA 3'UTR (the three prime untranslated region of MGMT mRNA). Thus, in 28% of glioblastomas, increased expression of miR-181d and reduced expression of DNA repair enzyme MGMT may be a causal factor.|$|E
25|$|Adenine or {{cytosine}} methylation {{is part of}} {{the restriction}} modification system of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are <b>methylated</b> periodically throughout the genome. A methylase is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not <b>methylated</b> in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific restriction enzymes and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by bacteriophage.|$|E
25|$|Restriction {{landmark}} genomic scanning, {{a complicated}} and now rarely used assay based upon restriction enzymes' differential recognition of <b>methylated</b> and unmethylated CpG sites; the assay {{is similar in}} concept to the HELP assay.|$|E
25|$|A good initial Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) and MGMT {{methylation}} {{are associated}} with longer survival. A DNA test can be conducted on glioblastomas {{to determine whether or}} not the promoter of the MGMT gene is <b>methylated.</b> Patients with a <b>methylated</b> MGMT promoter have longer survival than those with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, due in part to increased sensitivity to temozolomide. This DNA characteristic is intrinsic to the patient and currently cannot be altered externally. Another positive prognostic marker for glioblastoma patients is mutation of the IDH1 gene, which can be tested by DNA-based methods or by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against the most common mutation, namely IDH1-R132H.|$|E
25|$|Studies in {{experimental}} {{animals and humans}} show that both inorganic arsenic and <b>methylated</b> metabolites cross the placenta to the fetus, however, {{there is evidence that}} methylation is increased during pregnancy and that it could be highly protective for the developing organism.|$|E
25|$|Other uses of {{fluorescein}} include {{using it}} as a water-soluble dye added to rainwater in environmental testing simulations to aid in locating and analyzing any water leaks, and in Australia and New Zealand as a <b>methylated</b> spirit dye.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{was probably}} present at some extent in very early eukaryote ancestors. In virtually every organism analyzed, methylation in promoter regions correlates negatively with gene expression. CpG-dense promoters of actively transcribed genes are never <b>methylated,</b> but reciprocally transcriptionally silent genes {{do not necessarily}} carry a <b>methylated</b> promoter. In mouse and human, around 60–70% of genes have a CpG island in their promoter region {{and most of these}} CpG islands remain unmethylated independently of the transcriptional activity of the gene, in both differentiated and undifferentiated cell types. Of note, whereas DNA methylation of CpG islands is unambiguously linked with transcriptional repression, the function of DNA methylation in CG-poor promoters remains unclear; albeit {{there is little evidence that}} it could be functionally relevant.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine is a prodrug, a {{substance}} {{that is not an}} active drug itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; at first it is slowly and almost completely converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by reductive cleavage of the thioether (–S–). This is mediated by glutathione and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver and on red blood cells, without the aid of enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) and thio-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) via thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is <b>methylated.</b> The end products of azathioprine metabolism are thiouric acid (38%) and various <b>methylated</b> and hydroxylated purines, which are excreted via the urine.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine and {{phenylalanine}} {{serve as}} the metabolic precursors to synthesis of mescaline. Tyrosine can either undergo a decarboxylation via tyrosine decarboxylase to generate tyramine and subsequently undergo an oxidation at carbon 3 by a monophenol hydroxylase or first be hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase to form L-DOPA and decarboxylated by DOPA decarboxylase. These create dopamine, which then experiences methylation by a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) by an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent mechanism. The resulting intermediate is then oxidized again by a hydroxylase enzyme, likely monophenol hydroxylase again, at carbon 5, and <b>methylated</b> by COMT. The product, <b>methylated</b> at the two meta positions {{with respect to the}} alkyl substituent, experiences a final methylation at the 4 carbon by a guaiacol-O-methyltransferase, which also operates by a SAM-dependent mechanism. This final methylation step results in the production of mescaline.|$|E
25|$|Even snRNAs and snoRNAs {{themselves}} undergo {{series of}} modification {{before they become}} part of functional RNP complex. This is done either in the nucleoplasm or in the specialized compartments called Cajal bodies. Their bases are <b>methylated</b> or pseudouridinilated {{by a group of}} small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs), which are structurally similar to snoRNAs.|$|E
25|$|Telithromycin is a semi-synthetic {{erythromycin}} derivative. It {{is created}} by substituting a ketogroup for the cladinose sugar and adding a carbamate ring in the lactone ring. An alkyl-aryl moiety is attached to this carbamate ring. Furthermore, the carbon at position 6 has been <b>methylated,</b> {{as is the case}} in clarithromycin, to achieve better acid-stability.|$|E
25|$|Dimethyl sulfate also methylates adenine in {{single-stranded}} {{portions of}} DNA (e.g., those with proteins like RNA polymerase progressively melting and re-annealing the DNA). Upon re-annealing, these methyl groups interfere with adenine-guanine base-pairing. Nuclease S1 {{can then be}} used to cut the DNA in single-stranded regions (anywhere with a <b>methylated</b> adenine). This is an important technique for analyzing protein-DNA interactions.|$|E
25|$|MethylCpG Binding Proteins (MBPs) and fusion {{proteins}} containing {{just the}} Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) {{are used to}} separate native DNA into <b>methylated</b> and unmethylated fractions. The percentage methylation of individual CpG islands can be determined by quantifying {{the amount of the}} target in each fraction. Extremely sensitive detection can be achieved in FFPE tissues with abscription-based detection.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} about 60% of human protein coding genes are {{regulated}} by miRNAs. Many miRNAs are epigenetically regulated. About 50% of miRNA genes {{are associated with}} CpG islands, that may be repressed by epigenetic methylation. Transcription from <b>methylated</b> CpG islands is strongly and heritably repressed. Other miRNAs are epigenetically regulated by either histone modifications or by combined DNA methylation and histone modification.|$|E
25|$|Molecular break light assay for DNA adenine methyltransferase {{activity}} – an assay {{that relies}} on the specificity of the restriction enzyme DpnI for fully <b>methylated</b> (adenine methylation) GATC sites in an oligonucleotide labeled with a fluorophore and quencher. The adenine methyltransferase methylates the oligonucleotide making it a substrate for DpnI. Cutting of the oligonucleotide by DpnI {{gives rise to a}} fluorescence increase.|$|E
