5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere and the German army invasion, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Viipuri on 8 April. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April 1918 (Edvard Gylling alone stood by his warriors). The escape of the Red {{leadership}} imbittered the Red troopers. Thousands of them, without true leadership, tried {{to flee to}} Russia, but <b>most</b> <b>the</b> refugees were besieged by the White and the German troops. The Reds surrendered on 1–2 May in the Lahti area.|$|E

Of the largely circulated Nepali newspapers Himalay Darpan, Swarnabhumi and some Sikkim-based Nepali newspapers like Hamro Prajashakti and Samay Dainik are read <b>most.</b> <b>The</b> Tibet Mirror was the first Tibetan-language newspaper published in Kalimpong in 1925. while Himalayan Times was the first English to have come out from Kalimpong in the year 1947, it was closed down in the year 1962 after the Chinese aggression but was started once again and is now in regular print. It is known for its bold and aggressive stand on all local issues.|$|E

5|$|During {{the chaos}} of the battle, Major General Yu Jai Hung of the ROK II Corps did not receive news from the front line until midnight of November 25 — five hours after the Chinese had entered the Korean rear. Responding to the crisis, Hung {{committed}} the ROK 2nd Infantry Regiment of the 6th Infantry Division to block the Chinese divisions. As the 2nd Infantry Regiment marched towards the front on the morning of November 26, the PVA 113th Division intercepted the regiment and destroyed its command post, scattering the ROK II Corps' entire reserve in the process. With <b>most</b> <b>the</b> ROK II Corps' units destroyed by November 27, the UN right flank had fallen to the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At <b>most,</b> <b>the</b> Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E
60|$|As for the {{reasonableness}} {{of such a}} demand, I {{can only}} say--what has been said elsewhere--that {{the present state of}} things, 'in which the franchise is considered as something so important and so sacred that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> virtuous, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pious, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> learned, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wealthy, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> benevolent, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> justly powerful woman, is refused it, as something too precious for her; and yet it is entrusted, freely and hopefully, to any illiterate, drunken, wife-beating ruffian who can contrive to keep a home over his head,' is equally unjust and absurd.|$|R

5|$|In {{the wider}} area of {{operations}} were the Partisan 5th Corps commanded by Slavko Rodić and 8th Corps commanded by Vlado Ćetković. The 5th Corps was deployed to the northeast and northwest of Drvar with its headquarters south of the Mrkonjić Grad–Ključ road, and the 8th Corps was positioned to the southeast with its headquarters in the mountains between the Glamoč and Livno valleys. Importantly for the coming battle, the 4th Krajina Division of the 5th Corps was deployed between Bihać and Bosanski Petrovac. Two brigades of the 4th Krajina Division and one brigade from the 39th Krajina Division formed a defensive arc north of Drvar, running from Bihać through Krupa to Sanski <b>Most.</b> <b>The</b> 9th Dalmatian Division of the 8th Corps was deployed to the south between Livno and Bosansko Grahovo.|$|E

In three seasons at Everton, McCall played 103 league games as well as earned his first caps with Scotland but he failed to lift any trophies as the club finished eighth, sixth and ninth in the league. Apart from the FA Cup final defeat in 1989, the closest he came to winning a trophy at Everton was in the 1989–90 season, when Everton topped the league in late autumn and remained in contention for the title for the <b>most</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the season}} until disappointing form in the run-in saw them finish sixth.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre Ini (also Niuserre Ini or Neuserre Ini; in Greek {{known as}} Rathurês, ´Ραθούρης) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the sixth {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He is {{credited}} with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar, and likely lived {{in the second half}} of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II, and the brother of the short-lived king Neferefre. He may have succeeded his brother directly, as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have reigned between the two as advocated by Miroslav Verner, albeit only for a few weeks or months at the <b>most.</b> <b>The</b> relation of Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu, who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre.|$|E

Administration was delegated to the IAR. Permanent buildings were constructed that were opened in 1948 and 1950, and subsequently named Wilhelm Hall and Spedding Hall.

She begins {{an affair with a}} famous and fading movie star, and follows her to California, only to return to be more honest about what she wants in her life.|$|E
5|$|That day, the 5th Corps {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Sanski Most, employing OGs Centre and South {{to capture the}} town. The assault, spearheaded by the 502nd and 510th brigades, penetrated VRS defences manned by the 15th Bihać and 17th Ključ Brigades, forcing Zeljaja to withdraw his troops to the town itself to avoid encirclement. On 10 October, elements of the VRS 43rd Motorised and 11th Dubica brigades {{launched a}}n unsuccessful attempt to halt the ARBiH advance {{on the outskirts of}} Sanski <b>Most.</b> <b>The</b> 502nd Brigade, the Guards Brigade and the 5th Military Police Battalion subsequently captured the town.|$|E

5|$|The 32nd Battalion {{was raised}} on 9 August 1915 in Mitcham, South Australia, for {{overseas}} service with the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Donald Coghill.

5|$|The Grimaldi's {{occupation}} of their palace is also unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, {{the absence of}} alternative palaces and land shortages have resulted {{in their use of}} the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected {{in the evolution of the}} palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons, and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the <b>most</b> <b>the</b> Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or, as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of Monaco, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated 700 years of rule from the same palace.|$|E
