The animals photoinduced with chemicals reacted to long-wavelength ultraviolet (UVA) radiation in the absence of test materials at the challenge stage. The sensitivity of the animals to UMA persisted for more than 1 year. The <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> to UVB of animals in the treated group was less than that the main factors influencing the elicitation of persistent light reaction were the amount of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) used to enhance the allergic response in animals, and the UVA dose at the induction stage. Based on these findings, we have developed a method to make animals persistent light reactors with high frequency. This method consists of 1 intradermal injection of 1. 2 ml emulsified FCA, 5 irradiations with 20. 4 J/cm 2 of UVA, and topical applications of 5 % p-aminoethylbenzoate (benzocaine) at the induction stage.

The <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) of UVB radiation was also determined by exposing sites to graduated doses of 304 nm radiation. The order of exposure of distinct anatomic areas was as follow: (1) UVB followed by IPD induction; (2) IPD induction followed by UVB; (3) IPD induction followed 3 h later by UVB; and (4) UVB only. Erythema responses induced by UVB were graded by inspection 24 h later and the MEDs in the 4 areas were compared. The induction of IPD before UVB exposure caused no significant change in the MED compared to sites receiving UVB only, or receiving UVA radiation after UVB, confirming that the IPD reaction does not protect against UVB-induced erythema.

There was no significant difference in either low- or high-Km cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity between control and UVB-treated skin at 1 - 2 MEDs.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that polymorphic light eruption (PLE) is characterized by a failure of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) -induced immunosuppression, resulting in a type-IV hypersensitivity response to photoinduced antigens. We measured the effect of solar-simulated radiation (SSR) on the elicitation phase of contact hypersensitivity to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), in ten PLE patients and 11 controls. Subjects were given a sensitizing dose of DNCB, and 3 wk later were exposed to 0. 75 and 2 <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> (MED) of SSR on the upper inner arm. Immediately and 24 h later these sites, and a non-irradiated control site, were challenged with DNCB. The resulting increase in skin thickness was measured with high-frequency ultrasound. Overall, 2 MED caused 17 %â€“ 20 % suppression of elicitation responses (compared with 93 % suppression of sensitization reported previously), but the effect of SSR varied greatly between subjects, with some subjects showing potentiated responses, which may be of relevance to false-positive reactions in photopatch testing. In a repeated measures general linear model, SSR overall caused significant suppression of responses (p< 0. 001); there was less suppression in older subjects (p= 0. 009) but {{there was no significant difference}} between PLE patients and age-matched normal controls. These results contrast with our previous finding of a resistance to UVR-induced suppression of sensitization to DNCB in PLE. This difference may reflect the greater importance of Langerhans cells in the sensitization phase, and is consistent with the hypothesis that PLE arises from impaired suppression of Langerhans cell activation or migration...|$|R

40|$|Phototherapy with {{narrow-band}} UVB (NB-UVB), with a peak exclusively at 311 nm wavelength, {{has been}} found to be more effective in treating a variety of skin diseases than conventional broad-band UVB (BB-UVB). To assess the difference in carcinogenic activity between NB-UVB and BB-UVB, we investigated skin tumor formation by irradiating albino hairless, Ogg 1 knockout mice and C 57 BL/ 6 J wild counterparts with these two UV sources. We found that the ratio of malignant skin tumors induced by NB-UVB was significantly higher than that induced by BB-UVB. There was no significant difference in carcinogenicity of skin tumor induced by NB-UVB between Ogg 1 knockout and wild-type mice. To investigate the possible cause of different carcinogenic activity by the different UV sources, we examined three types of DNA damage: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), (6 - 4) photoproduct, and 8 -oxoguanine (8 -oxoG) induced by each UV source. We found that CPD formation following a <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) by NB-UVB was significantly higher than that following 1 MED by BB-UVB, whereas the formation of (6 - 4) photoproducts and 8 -oxoG following BB-UVB was significantly higher than those following NB-UVB exposure. These results suggest that CPD formation is closely related to the higher carcinogenic characteristics of NB-UVB.

The purpose of our investigation was to compare the susceptibility of cultured melanocytes and keratinocytes to UV-induced DNA damage per <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) and {{to determine whether the}} predictions made with action spectra agree with the damage actually induced. Genetic damage was measured as the number of T 4 -endonuclease V-sensitive sites (ESS). Predictions made with the action spectrum for the induction of DNA damage in melanocytes after irradiation with sunlight and a solar simulator were 15. 9 and 13. 2 ESS per 108 daltons per MED, respectively; with the action spectrum for the induction of DNA damage in keratinocytes the predictions were 12. 1 and 9. 8 ESS per 108 daltons per MED, respectively. To determine the actual damage per MED, cultured cells were irradiated with sunlight or a solar simulator, and MED was determined with an erythema UV meter. The induction of DNA damage in melanocytes after sunlight and solar simulator irradiation was 8. 01 and 6. 7 ESS per 108 daltons per MED, respectively, and in keratinocytes 7. 49 and 7. 12 ESS per 108 daltons per MED, respectively. This was considered to be in agreement with the predicted data. The use of action spectra for risk estimates in melanocytes appears justified...|$|E
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that polymorphic light eruption {{is characterized by}} a partial failure of ultraviolet radiation-induced immunosuppression, resulting in a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to photo-induced antigens. We aimed to study the susceptibility of PLE patients to UVR-induced immunosuppression, by measuring the strength of sensitization to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene after UVR exposure, and to diphenylcyclopropenone without UVR exposure, in subjects with PLE and controls. Thirteen PLE patients and 11 controls were exposed to 1 <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) of UVR delivered from Waldmann UV- 6 bulbs to the upper inner arm. Twenty-four hours later at the same site they were exposed to a sensitizing dose of 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene. One week later they were exposed to a sensitizing dose of diphenylcyclopropenone at a nonirradiated site. Three weeks later all subjects were challenged with four doses of 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene and four doses of diphenylcyclopropenone. The resulting increase in skin thickness was measured with Harpenden callipers and summed over the four doses, to give a single value representing the reactivity of the subject to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (Î£DN) and diphenylcyclopropenone (Î£DP). Among all subjects, there was a very strong correlation between Î£DN and Î£DP (Pearson correlation 0. 56, p= 0. 004). The strength of the reaction to 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene relative to the reaction to diphenylcyclopropenone was significantly greater among PLE patients than controls (p= 0. 04 independent samples t test of Î£DPâ€“Î£DN). We conclude that induction of sensitization by 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene is suppressed less by UVR in patients with PLE than in healthy controls...|$|E

40|$|After {{ultraviolet}} exposure Langerhans cells (epidermal CD 1 a+ cells) {{disappear from}} the healthy skin, and CD 11 b+ macrophage-like cells, which are reported to produce interleukin- 10, appear {{in a matter of}} days. These phenomena are related to the ultraviolet-induced local suppression of contact hypersensitivity reactions. A defect in this suppression might allow inadvertent immune reactions to develop after ultraviolet (over) exposure; i. e., it could cause ultraviolet-B-induced polymorphous light eruption. In order to test this we first exposed buttock skin of eight healthy volunteers to six minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> from Philips TL 12 lamps, and indeed observed a dramatic disappearance of CD 1 a+ cells 48 and 72 [*]h later, at which time the number of CD 11 b+ cells increased in the dermis, and some occurred in the epidermis. The epidermis thickened and showed large defects, filled by CD 11 b+ cells, just below the stratum corneum. In 10 patients with polymorphous light eruption (five with a normal minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> and five with a low minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose)</b> CD 1 a+ cells were present in the epidermis {{as well as in the}} dermis before exposure.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the effect of egg shell membrane hydrolysates (ESMH) on wrinkle, UV, and mois-ture protection for cosmetic use. ESMH were fragmented as whole ESMH (before fractioning), Fraction I (> 10 kDa), Frac-tion II (3 - 10 kDa), and Fraction III (< 3 kDa). In order to test whether fractionated ESMH can be used for functional cosmetic materials, we examined not only the level of hyaluronic acid and collagen production, but also the MMP- 1 activity using a HaCaT and CCD- 986 Sk cell line. Our study treated each sample of fractionated ESMH with different concentrations (0. 01, 0. 1, 1 mg/mL). In our in vivo research, we used hairless mice that had been exposed to UV-B to induce wrinkles for 7 wk, then applied Fraction I to the treatment group for 5 wk and then tested skin thickness, <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> and moisture content. In addition, Fraction I was high in collagen and HA biosynthesis and it was better than TGF-Î² in improv-ing of the skin. When TNF-Î± caused MMP- 1 activity in the CCD- 986 Sk cells, the whole ESMH and Fraction I proved to be effective in hindering the induction of collagenase depending on the concentration, and also showed outstanding effects in the suppression of skin aging. We found that the treatment group miceâ€™s UV-B radiation-induced skin damage was largely mitigated compared to that of the non-treatment group mice. Thus, we have concluded that EMSH helps to mitigate UV-B radiation-induced wrinkles, collagen, HA, MMP- 1 activity and can be used for functional cosmetic materials.

Ultraviolet B {{is known}} to suppress certain aspects of cell mediated immunity. Using three ultraviolet lamps (the broad-band ultraviolet B TL- 12, the narrow-band ultraviolet B TL- 01 and an ultraviolet AI source), we investigated the dose and waveband dependencies for the suppression of contact hypersensitivity to oxazolone and delayed-type hypersensitivity to herpes simplex virus, plus the formation of cis-urocanic acid in C 3 H/HeN mice. A single exposure of 1500 [*]J/m 2 TL- 12 or 10, 000 [*]J/m 2 TL- 01 or 500, 000 [*]J/m 2 ultraviolet AI corresponded to 1 <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> in this mouse strain. The percentage of cis-urocanic acid of the total urocanic acid rose from a background level of 1. 7 % to 40 % with 1000 [*]J/m 2 TL- 12 or 10, 000 [*]J/m 2 TL- 01, but only 17 % cis-urocanic acid was obtained with 500, 000 [*]J/m 2 ultraviolet AI. The contact hypersensitivity response was significantly suppressed after a minimum dose of 5000 [*]J/m 2 TL- 12 or 50, 000 J/m 2 TL- 01 or 500, 000 [*]J/m 2 ultraviolet AI. The delayed-type hypersensitivity response was suppressed by a minimum dose of 100 [*]J/m 2 TL- 12 or 10, 000 J/m 2 TL- 01 or 1000 [*]J/m 2 ultraviolet AI. So, whereas a low dose of ultraviolet AI reduced the delayed-type hypersensitivity response, a 500 -fold higher dose was required to suppress contact hypersensitivity. There was no correlation between the[*]suppression of these responses and the concentration of cis-urocanic acid in the skin.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} causes immunosuppression {{that contributes}} to skin cancer growth. Photoprotective strategies initially focused on the more erythemogenic ultraviolet B. More recently, the relationship of ultraviolet A and skin cancer has received increased attention. We hypothesized that if ultraviolet A contributes significantly to human ultraviolet-induced immune suppression, then increased ultraviolet A filtration by a sunscreen would better protect the immune system during ultraviolet exposure. Two hundred and eleven volunteers were randomized into study groups and received solar-simulated radiation, ranging from 0 to 2 <b>minimum</b> <b>erythema</b> <b>dose,</b> on gluteal skin, with or without sunscreen, 48 h prior to sensitization with dinitrochlorobenzene. Contact hypersensitivity response was evaluated by measuring the increase in skin fold thickness of five graded dinitrochlorobenzene challenge sites on the arm, 2 wk after sensitization. Clinical scoring using the North American Contact Dermatitis Group method was also performed. Solar-simulated radiation doseâ€“response curves were generated and immune protection factor was calculated using a nonlinear regression model. Significance of immune protection between study groups was determined with the Mannâ€“Whitneyâ€“Wilcoxon exact test. The sunscreen with high ultraviolet A absorption (ultraviolet A protection factor of 10, based on the in vivo persistent pigment darkening method) and a labeled sun protection factor of 15 demonstrated better immune protection than the product that had a low ultraviolet A absorption (ultraviolet A protection factor of 2) and a labeled sun protection factor of 15. Nonlinear regression analysis based on skin fold thickness increase revealed that the high ultraviolet A protection factor sunscreen had an immune protection factor of 50, {{more than three times}} its sun protection factor, whereas the low ultraviolet A protection factor sunscreen had an immune protection factor of 15, which was equal to its labeled sun protection factor. This study demonstrates that ultraviolet A contributes greatly to human immune suppression and that a broad-spectrum sunscreen with high ultraviolet A filtering capacity results in immune protection that exceeds erythema protection. These results show that high ultraviolet A protection is required to protect against ultraviolet-induced damage to cutaneous immunity...|$|E

We assessed the ability of two sunscreens, with different spectral profiles, to inhibit DNA photodamage in human epidermis in situ. One formulation contained the established ultraviolet B filter octyl methoxycinnamate, whereas the other contained terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid, a new ultraviolet A filter. Both formulations had sun protection factors of 4 when assessed with solar simulating radiation in volunteers of skin type I/II. We tested the hypothesis that sun protection factors would indicate the level of protection against DNA photodamage. Thus, we exposed sunscreen-treated sites to four times the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> of solar simulating radiation, whereas vehicle and control sites were exposed to one minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose.</b> We used monoclonal antibodies against thymine dimers and 6 â€“ 4 photoproducts and image analysis to quantify DNA damage in skin sections.

Mean skin type IV minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> was 1. 8 -fold greater than for skin type II. Compared to skin type II, solar simulated radiation treatments produced less erythema and more tanning in skin type IV. To assess DNA photodamage, biopsies were taken and prepared for paraffin sections that were stained with a monoclonal antibody for thymine dimers. Thymine dimers were quantified by image analysis. The single exposure data (0. 65 and 2 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose)</b> showed that DNA damage was related to physical dose (J per cm 2) independent of skin type. Our data also showed that DNA photodamage accumulates in both skin types with repeated, suberythemal doses of solar simulated radiation. On day 12, there were more thymine dimers in skin type IV than skin type II, again indicating that physical rather than biologic dose determines the level of DNA damage. Comparisons on days 12 and 19, however, showed a much greater loss of thymine dimers in skin type IV, suggesting better thymine dimer repair. Protection factors for erythema and thymine dimers were calculated and shown to be about 2 in both skin types.

Non-exposed skin (buttocks from 20 individuals) was exposed to 10 doses of ultraviolet, which corresponded to three to four minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>doses</b> of solar-simulating radiation, and biopsies were taken at 24 h within the half and one minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> sites and a nonirradiated, adjacent control area. We report that even suberythemal doses of ultraviolet radiation are capable of inducing substantial DNA damage, namely pyrimidine dimers, p 53 induction, and the DNA base-modified product generated by oxidative stress, 8 -hydroxy- 2 â€²-deoxyguanosine. All three lesions are induced in a dose-dependent manner. An additional eight individuals were treated with either ultraviolet B or ultraviolet B + ultraviolet A sunblock (sun protection factor 15) and exposed to 7 Â½ and 15 times the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> on each individual, with biopsies taken at 24 h post-ultraviolet. Pyrimidine dimer and p 53 expression were rarely seen in nonirradiated skin but occasional staining was seen in all normal skin for 8 -hydroxy- 2 â€²-deoxyguanosine. Applications of sunscreens to human skin before irradiation were shown to attenuate erythema but did not completely eliminate all three types of cellular damage when tested up to their sun protection factor 15. Furthermore, ultraviolet B + ultraviolet A sunscreens were less efficient than the ultraviolet B alone formulation for protection against all three lesions.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which topical and {{intradermal}} corticosteroids and topical indomethacin suppress sunburn erythema was investigated in human volunteers. Both agents retarded the onset and decreased the magnitude of delayed erythema. Suppression by corticosteroids was not demonstrable with ultraviolet doses larger than 2 MEDs (minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose).</b> Below 2 MEDs, topical betamethasone valerate produced a dose-related suppression of erythema. Indomethacin was more effective and produced a measurable dose-dependent suppression against 3 and 6 MEDs. Despite significant inhibition of erythema. Sunburn damage to epidermal cells was not altered by these drugs...|$|R
40|$|The minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) {{and minimal}} phototoxic dose (MPD) have been {{evaluated}} in 20 patients undergoing photochemotherapy or phototherapy. MPD and MED have been performed both at 30 and at 60 cm from the lamp {{in order to determine}} variations depending on the exposure time. Results have shown that MED values obtained at 60 cm from the lamp were higher than at 30 cm with a medium average of 60 mJ/cm 2. Moreover, the MPD values at 60 cm were higher than at 30 cm with a medium average of 2 J/cm 2...|$|R
40|$|Repeated skin {{exposure}} to ultraviolet radiation leads to increased tolerance for erythema. Whether this tolerance {{is accompanied by}} a significant protection against epidermal DNA injury has never been thoroughly investigated. In a first set of experiments we irradiated 25 healthy volunteers three times a week for 3 wk using solar-simulating tanning lamps. In addition, all individuals were exposed to a (challenge) dose of three times the initial minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> on a small area of skin before the first and after the final exposure. On both occasions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were quantified in biopsies. As expected, repeated ultraviolet exposures resulted in increased epidermal pigmentation and thickness. The ultraviolet sensitivity for erythema decreased on average by 75 %. The cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation was reduced on average by 60 %. In a second set of experiments, with a group of 13 subjects, DNA repair kinetics were assessed. Within a period of 5 d after a single, slightly erythemal dose (1. 2 minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose),</b> levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and p 53 -expressing cells were determined in skin biopsies. Both markers of DNA damage were elevated upon the single ultraviolet exposure and returned to background levels after 3 â€“ 4 d. This information is important when trying to minimize the risk of DNA damage accumulation after repeated exposures during a tanning course...|$|R
40|$|Pigmentary {{phenotype}} {{is a key}} {{determinant of}} an individual's response to ultraviolet radiation {{with the presence of}} phaeomelanin thought to be of particular importance. Reports of minimal erythema testing, however, have failed to show a consistent difference between skin type I and other skin types. The melanocortin 1 receptor is a key genetic determinant of the cutaneous response to ultraviolet radiation. In this study we investigate the relation between experimentally induced erythemal response to ultraviolet radiation and the melanocortin 1 receptor genotype. Phototesting was performed in 20 redheads and 20 nonredheaded subjects, the majority of whom were also screened for the presence of melanocortin 1 receptor variants. The majority of redheads sequenced (89 %) had two melanocortin 1 receptor variants previously found to be associated with red hair compared to none of the controls. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups in minimal erythema dose: the median minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> in redheads was 44 mJ per cm 2 (interquartile range 34 â€“ 56) and in the nonredheaded group was 40 mJ per cm 2 (interquartile range 40 â€“ 56). Objective measurements of ultraviolet-B-induced erythema were performed using reflectance instrument measurements of erythema intensity and doseâ€“response curves constructed for each subject. The slope of the doseâ€“response curve in the redheaded group was statistically greater than in the nonredheaded group (median in redheads 4. 08 vs 3. 56 for controls, 95 % confidence interval for the difference between the medians being 0. 01 â€“ 1. 23, p = 0. 043). In addition the ratio D 0. 05 :D 0. 025 was significantly lower for the redheaded group (median in redheads 1. 22, interquartile range 1. 18 â€“ 1. 26; median in nonreds 1. 28, interquartile range 1. 23 â€“ 1. 32; p < 0. 05). Thus, although the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> values were not different, subjects with red hair develop greater intensity of erythema than nonredheaded individuals when doses greater than the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> are given. Importantly, when analyzed by genotype alone rather than phenotype, the slope of the erythema doseâ€“response differed between those persons who were homozygous or heterozygous mutants and wildtype/pseudo-wildtype (p = 0. 026) ...|$|R
40|$|We report our {{experience}} {{in the treatment of}} four patients with pruritus associated with polycythaemia vera with UVB phototherapy. A bank of six 40 -W tubes (Philips TL 12) with an emission spectrum ranging from 290 to 320 nm (peak at 300 nm) was employed. The first irradiation dose was two-thirds of the minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED). The treatment schedule consisted of three irradiation sessions per week with dose increments equal to 2 each session. A complete remission of pruritus was achieved in three of the four patients after a mean of 24 treatments (total dose 11. 94 J/cm 2) ...|$|R
40|$|For fair Caucasian skin, {{the minimal}} delayed <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) 24 hr after {{exposure}} to broadband UVA is about 1200 {{times greater than}} the MED of broadband UVB, for both single and multiple daily exposures. Repeated daily exposure to doses less than MED results in cumulative effects manifest by gradual lowering of the daily dose threshold for delayed erythema and pigmentation induced by UVA or UVB. At threshold doses, UVB is more erythemogenic than melanogenic; the opposite is true for UVA. Repeated daily UVA exposure greatly enhances melanogenesis such that markedly suberythemogenic exposure doses of UVA result in true melanogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In view {{of recent}} reports of {{increased}} tanning in hemiplegic limbs, we have investigated ultraviolet (u. v.) minimal <b>erythema</b> <b>dose</b> (MED) in hemiplegia using the bilateral comparison technique. Seven of 10 patients {{had a lower}} MED in the hemiplegic arm compared to the normal side, the mean reduction being 16 % (range 0 - 33 %, P = 0. 003). No patients had a higher MED in the hemiplegic arm. We review the literature regarding other non-neurological features of hemiplegia, in particular asymmetry of temperature, oedema, and finger clubbing, and we propose a vasomotor or trophic aetiology for these findings...|$|R
