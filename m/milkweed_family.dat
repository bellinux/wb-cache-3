Species of this genus bear similarities to the carrion flowers or stapelias. There are more than 180 known species and more are being discovered and described regularly. They are distributed throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar to the Arabian Peninsula, southeast Asia, the Canary Islands, the tropical Pacific, and Australia.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>milkweed</b> and spurge <b>families,</b> on {{the other}} hand, the laticiferous system is formed quite differently. Early in the {{development}} of the seedling latex cells differentiate, and as the plant grows these latex cells grow into a branching system extending throughout the plant. In many euphorbs, the entire structure is made from a single cell - this type of system is known as a non-articulated laticifer, to distinguish it from the multi-cellular structures discussed above. In the mature plant, the entire laticiferous system is descended from a single cell or group of cells present in the embryo.|$|R

5000|$|Botany is {{study of}} plants. [...] "Plants," [...] to most people, means {{a wide range}} of living organisms from the {{smallest}} bacteria to the largest living things - the giant sequoia trees. By this definition plants include: algae, fungi, lichens, mosses, ferns, conifers and flowering plants.collections at the Academy, which are housed in the Philadelphia Herbarium (PH), include some of the oldest and most important botanical collections in the Americas. Notable early collectors include Benjamin Smith Barton, Constatine Rafinesque, Thomas Meehan, Thomas Nuttall, and Fredrick Pursh. The current curator, Tatyana Livshultz, studies the systematics of and the development of flowers in the Apocynaceae (<b>milkweed</b> or dogbane <b>family).</b> The herbarium contains approximately 1.5 million specimens of vascular plants, fungi, lichens, algae, and fossil plants. It also contains some special collections, including the plants collected by Johann and Georg Forster during the voyages of Captain James Cook, and by Meriwether Lewis during the Lewis and Clark expedition (Corps of Discovery).|$|R

50|$|Dodsonian mimicry, {{named after}} American botanist, orchidologist, and taxonomist, Calaway H. Dodson, {{is a form}} of {{reproductive}} floral mimicry, but the model belongs to a different species than the mimic. By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense, a species of epiphytic orchid of the genus Epidendrum that occurs in Trinidad, French Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, and northern Brazil, resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica (commonly called Mexican butterfly weed, blood-flower, scarlet milkweed, or tropical milkweed), both are species of flowering plant with the first in the verbena family, while the latter belongs to the <b>milkweed</b> <b>family,</b> and both are native to the American tropics. Epidendrum ibaguense is pollinated by monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and perhaps hummingbirds. Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though, for example a Lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{adapted for}} {{pollination}} by birds in diverse and intricate ways. Here I describe an extraordinary example of these adaptations. The flowers of Microloma sagittatum, {{a member of}} the <b>milkweed</b> <b>family,</b> clip parcels of pollen precisely onto the tongues of sunbirds. The pollen parcels are carried inside the bird's mouth to the next flower where they are detached mechanically. This is, {{to the best of my}} knowledge, the first evidence for pollen transfer on the tongues of birds, a phenomenon that might be more widespread...|$|E
40|$|Description: An {{herbaceous}} perennial vine in the <b>milkweed</b> <b>family</b> (Asclepiadaceae) {{growing to}} {{a height of}} 2 - 6 feet at maturity. Leaves are simple, opposite, 3 inches long, waxy and oblong to ovate with pointed tips. Leaf stems emit a pungent herbal smell when crushed. Stems grow 3 – 6 feet long and may be climbing or creeping and twine around themselves and other plants. Flowers are purplish black with yellow centers and have 5 petals with small hairs. Flowers bloom from June to mid-August and emit a slight rotting odor. Seed pods split open from August to October releasing windborne seeds. Plants produce up to 2, 000 seeds. The root system {{is made up of}} a massive collection of roots and rhizomes. Habitat: It is located in oak or mixed hardwood forests to heavily shaded woods. It can be found in disturbed sunny areas, prairies, savannas, fields, roadsides, edges of woods, pastures, fence-rows, rocky areas and disturbed sites. It has a wide tolerance to light and moisture conditions, but not found i...|$|E
40|$|The exotic plant, Swallow- wort, a twining {{perennial}} of the <b>Milkweed</b> <b>family,</b> {{has become}} increasingly invasive in some place of Iran, especially orchards. Increased knowledge of wort germination biology would facilitate development of an optimum control program. Germination of Swallow wort seeds as affected by environmental factors was studied under controlled-environment growth chamber conditions. The following studies were conducted in plant Pests & Diseases Research Institute during the years 2003 - 4 : 1 - Effect of constant temperature on germination that including 10, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 ˚C; 2 - Effect of light on constant germination; 3 - Effect of temperature fluctuations on seed germination: 15 / 7, 20 / 12, 25 / 17 and 30 / 22 ˚C. All experiments were conducted with 8 replications. Swallow wort seeds showed no dormancy when detachment from mother plant. Seed germination was strongly influenced by temperature. Light did not {{play a crucial role}} on seed germination of this weed. Therefore Swallow wort seeds were not photoblastic and temperature fluctuations did not increase seed germination of Swallow wort. The above characteristics are very important in making swallowwort an invasive weed. Having precise information of these traits enables us to a better management and control of this troublesome weed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{years ago}} a brief article in Science raised the {{questions}} {{as to whether or}} not the advent of transgenic crops, in particular glyphosate resistant corn and soybeans, might mean the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.) is in trouble (Anon. 1999). It is well known that the larvae of the Monarch butterfly feed exclusively on a few species of the <b>milkweed</b> <b>family.</b> In our part of the world, their food is essentially common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.). The article estimated that nearly half the monarc s in North America migrate to overwintering sites in Mexico through the Midwest region. They also assumed that much of the milkweed that monarch larvae depend on was found in crop land that would be treated with glyphosate and this could “ [...] . devastate monarch food supplies. ” After this article appeared, the focus of transgenic crops and monarch butterflies rapidly shifted to the impact that pollen from Bt corn might have on the monarch larvae feeding on milkweed covered with Bt pollen. The issue of herbicide resistant crops and their possible impact on monarchs was quickly relegated to the back burner, but the question remains and needs to be considered. In this paper I will address the following questions related to milkweeds and monarchs: How important are milkweeds in Wisconsin’s agriculture? Do herbicide resistant crops give us new milkweed control options? If there are fewer milkweeds in cropped land, will there be fewer monarchs? Are most milkweeds found in cropped o...|$|E
