40|$|SummaryWe {{evaluated}} an endobronchial <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> in {{the treatment}} of surgically created air leak or pneumothorax by eliminating antegrade flow. MethodsSix sheep underwent general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation and left thoracotomy. After division of the mediastinal pleura, the contralateral cranial lobe was identified and a 2. 5 cm× 1. 5 cm laceration created with resultant air leak. Using bronchoscopy, we deployed a <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> in the bronchus of the injured segment. Chest drainage tube was placed and the thoracotomy closed. At 1 week (n= 3) and 4 weeks (n= 3), the animals underwent general anesthesia, bronchoscopy and right thoracotomy. ResultsAll animals survived the procedure. Bronchoscopic <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> placement in the segmental bronchus resolved the air leak immediately. After closure of thoracotomy, the chest tube demonstrated minimal drainage with no air leak. At 1 and 4 weeks, bronchoscopy showed no change in device location, and the treated segments were atelectatic with fibrous scar at the injured site. ConclusionsCollapse of a selected lung segment with resolution of air leak can be achieved using bronchoscopically implanted <b>valve</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> may facilitate treatment of patients with post-surgical or post-traumatic persistent air leak...|$|R

40|$|We have {{fabricated}} a microfluidic gel <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> {{that used}} reversible sol-gel transition of methyl cellulose (MC). A microheater and a microtemperature sensor were implemented in each microchannel in the gel <b>valve</b> <b>device.</b> Before evaluating {{the performance of}} the gel <b>valve</b> <b>device,</b> various properties of the MC solution were investigated using viscometer, spectrophotometer, and NMR. Gelation temperature was increased as the MC concentration was increased. Clear gel, an intermediate state between clear sol and turbid gel, was found at the temperature range from 30 - 40 °C to 50 - 60 °C. Temperature at each microchannel of the device was measured and the effect of the temperature difference on the valve operation was elucidated. In order to have normal operation of the gel valve, it was important to keep the temperature of the heated microchannel around 60 °C while keeping the temperature of the flowing microchannel below 35 °C. The temperature difference between two microchannels was about 23 K when fan forced cooling (FFC) method was used. For normal performance of the gel <b>valve</b> <b>device,</b> a temporary pause of fluid flow for at least 5 s was required to complete the local gelation in the microchannel. Stable gel valve performance was obtained at the flow rates larger than 5 μl/min. The gel <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> showed no leakage up to 2. 07 × 104 Pa. close 6...|$|R

40|$|Spin <b>valve</b> <b>devices,</b> {{consisting}} of a free magnetic layer, a spacer layer, and a pinned magnetic layer, are widely used in magnetic sensors and nonvolatile magnetic memories. However, even a slight bending deformation can affect the magnetization direction of the free magnetic layer, which will change the magnetoresistance signal of the devices. Therefore, {{it is a challenge}} to develop a flexible spin <b>valve</b> <b>device</b> with controllable performance. Here, an enhanced stress-invariance of the magnetization direction in amorphous CoFeB magnetic films on flexible polyimide substrates is achieved. The uniaxial anisotropy is induced by growing on the bent substrate under a magnetic field, which aligns more magnetic domains with easy axes along the direction perpendicular to the subsequently applied stress. Theoretical calculations indicate that pre-induced anisotropy with an easy axis perpendicular to the applied stress effectively resists the change in the magnetization direction during bending. These results are of importance for realizing better performance of flexible spin <b>valve</b> <b>devices</b> and the development of flexible spintronics. Published by AIP Publishing...|$|R

The average flow rate exceeded 8, 000 gallons per minute (gpm) when the average head was above 30 ft and the <b>manual</b> <b>valve</b> opened 80 degrees. Opening the valve to 90 degrees increased the flow rate to over 9, 700 gpm. The velocity of the flushing wave was 8. 5 fpm with a flow depth of 3. 5 in.

40|$|The beam pipe of the TESLA cryomodule {{is closed}} off by <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> {{on both sides}} of the string of 12 cavities. Compared to the <b>manual</b> <b>valves</b> with spring type rf-shield which are {{presently}} used in the linac of the TESLA Test Facility a simplified version will be needed by cost reasons for the TESLA linear collider. Therefore wakefield induced losses for two simplified valve geometries have been studied in detail. Three types of losses are distinguished: transient and resonant losses due to wake fields induced by the valves themselves and losses due to wakes induced in the cavities. The calculations have been done for two different operation modes - linac operation and FEL operation. In addition the transverse kick has been calculated and compared with the strongest kick from a nine cell cavity. The results show, that the losses from a valve with simplified rf-shield are acceptable. 1...|$|R
