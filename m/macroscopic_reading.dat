40|$|Standard {{methods for}} {{titrating}} and typing enteroviruses and other viruses, or for assaying antibodies against them, {{are based on}} observation of metabolic inhibition of infected cells or on direct microscopic reading of cytopathogenic effects. Incubation of cell cultures {{for at least a}} week, with two or three readings during this period, is usually required before assessment is completed. This report describes a vertical-tube method in which cell monolayers are confined to the bottom end of a serological tube; an agar overlay is used after virus or virus-serum inoculation. The reduced monolayer area allows seeding with only about 30 % of the cells required for standard tube cultures, and 5 % of those required for plaque assay in bottle cultures. The new method requires only a single <b>macroscopic</b> <b>reading</b> one to three days after the test is set up. This method has proved economical, simple and rapid in epidemiological studies on rapidly growing viruses of the entero-, reo-, herpes-, myxo- and poxvirus groups, and for tests of the genetic markers of live poliovirus vaccine...|$|E
40|$|THE FIRST PART OF THIS THESIS DEALS WITH TOXOPLASMA GONDII AND HUMAN AS WELL AS ANIMAL TOXOPLASMOSIS. IN THE SECOND PART THE DIFFERENT METHODS USED FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTITOXOPLASMA ANTIBODIES ARE DESCRIBED. IN THE THIRD PART AFTER A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DIRECT AGGLUTINATION AND INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE,RESULTS OF TESTING 194 HUMAN SERA BY THE DIRECT AGGLUTINATION METHOD HAVE BEEN COMPARED TO THOSE OBTAINED BY STANDARD PROCEDURES I. E. DYE TEST AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE. FROM THIS COMPARATIVE STUDY THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN: 1. RESULTS OBTAINED BY DIRECT AGGLUTINATION AND SABIN FELDMAN TEST CORRELATE FAIRLY WELL (86, 7 %). 2. AN EXCELLENT CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN DIRECT AGGLUTINATION AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE (93, 5 %). 3. DIRECT AGGLUTINATION WAS FOUNDMORE SENSITIVE THAN DYE TEST. 4. DIRECT AGGLUTINATION IS AT LEAST EQUALLY SPECIFIC AS DYE TEST. 5. THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PERFORMANCE OF DIRECT AGGLUTINATION, IN WHICH THE ONLY REAGENTS ARE THE ANTIGEN AND THE SERUM, IS CERTAINLY AND ADVANTAGE OF THE METHOD. 6. THE USED OF DEAD PARASITES AS ANTIGEN, COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, IS ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF THIS METHOD. 7. THE <b>MACROSCOPIC</b> <b>READING</b> OF THE DIRECT AGGLUTINATION IN CONTRAST TO THE OTHER TWO METHODS AS WELL AS ITS SENSITIVITY RENDER IT THE METHOD OF CHOICE. 8. THE MACROSCOPIC DIRECT AGGLUTINATION HAVING CERTAIN ADVANTAGES OVER THE DYE TEST AND THE IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE SEROLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS OF TOXOPLASMOSIS BY THE CLINICAL LABORATORY. ...|$|E
40|$|Exploiting the {{potential}} of nanoscale devices for logic processing requires the implementation of computing functionalities departing from the conventional switching paradigm. We report on the design and the experimental realisation of a probabilistic finite state machine in a single phosphorus donor atom placed in a silicon matrix electrically addressed and probed by Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS). The single atom logic unit simulates the flow of visitors in a maze whose topology {{is determined by the}} dynamics of the electronic transport through the states of the dopant. By considering the simplest case of a unique charge state for which three electronic states can be resolved, we demonstrate an efficient solution of the following problem: in a maze of four connected rooms, what is the optimal combination of door opening rates in order to maximize the time that visitors spend in one specific chamber? The implementation takes advantage of the stochastic nature of electron tunneling while the output remains the <b>macroscopic</b> current whose <b>reading</b> can be realized with standard techniques and does not require single electron sensitivity.
