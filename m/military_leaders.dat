5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability {{by the political}} and <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was {{a disaster for the}} ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E
5|$|The Hòa Hảo {{initially}} {{engaged in}} large-scale clashes with the Việt Minh in 1945, but by mid-1946 {{the two groups}} had agreed to stop fighting each other and fight the French instead. However, in June 1946, Sổ became estranged from his <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> and started the Dân Xã (Social Democratic Party). Because of his charisma, the Việt Minh saw Sổ as a threat and assassinated him, leaving the Hòa Hảo leaderless and causing Sổ's <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> to go their separate ways. The split caused an increase in violence as the various Hòa Hảo factions engaged in conflicts among themselves.|$|E
5|$|Although some Japanese {{soldiers}} were taken prisoner, most fought {{until they were}} killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99% of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April–June 1945, 94% were killed. American <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> used these figures to estimate high casualties among American soldiers in the planned invasion of Japan.|$|E

5|$|The fear of {{national}} disintegration were played upon <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> close to Suharto and remained {{as one of}} Indonesia's strongest justifications for refusing to entertain the prospect of East Timorese independence or even autonomy until the late 1990s. The military intelligence organisations initially sought a non-military annexation strategy, intending to use APODETI as its integration vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} on Hill 303 led UN commander, General Douglas MacArthur, to broadcast to the North Korean Army on August 20, denouncing the atrocities.

MacArthur warned {{that he would}} hold North Korea's senior <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> responsible for the event and any other war crimes.|$|E

5|$|Both armies used child soldiers, mainly between 14 and 17 {{years of}} age. The usage of {{juvenile}} soldiers was not rare in World War I; {{children of the}} time were under the absolute authority of adults and generally were not shielded against exploitation. In the Finnish case, the <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> took whoever they could get their hands on, at the less organised start of the war. In the Red Guards there was the chance for salary and food.|$|E
5|$|By July 22, with Dean still missing, Eighth Army {{appointed}} Church {{commander of}} the 24th Infantry Division and promoted him to major general. Dean was widely {{believed to have been}} killed until October 1950, when US forces captured a North Korean soldier named Lee Kyu Hyun near P'yongyang. Lee had been assigned to live with Dean for a month as an interpreter. Lee was interviewed throughout late 1950 but US <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> still generally thought Dean was dead.|$|E

5|$|French {{civilian}} administrators {{struggled with}} the <b>military</b> <b>leaders,</b> and the two forces went {{through a number of}} leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892. Archinard led military campaigns against Samori Ture, Ahmadu Tall, and other resistant leaders in the region, with varying success. Archinard's campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without civilian oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard's control over the area with a civilian governor, Louis Albert Grodet.|$|E
5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles {{as they left the}} country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Evita set her {{sights on}} earning {{a place on}} the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president. This move angered many <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Perón's death was not something the military could accept.|$|E

5|$|In April 1949, Truman {{appointed}} Radford to {{the position}} of Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. A staunch anticommunist, Radford saw the greatest threat to U.S. security coming from Asia, not Europe. He traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as South Asia and the Far East. He became acquainted with political and <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Burma, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Formosa, and Japan, and learned about the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In a {{book titled}} Militarism U.S.A. (1970), Shoup and Donovan {{elaborated}} their criticisms. Shoup said the country was seeking military solutions to issues that could be resolved politically. He accused <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> of propagating the war for their own career advancement, and accused the veterans group Veterans of Foreign Wars of propagandizing for the armed forces establishment. Shoup blamed the American education system for {{what he saw as}} discouraging independent thought and stressing obedience.|$|E
5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi <b>military</b> <b>leaders</b> and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E
