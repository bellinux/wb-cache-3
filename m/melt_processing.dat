40|$|In this work, the microstructures of {{superalloy}} specimens produced using selective {{electron beam}} melting additive manufacturing were characterized. The materials were produced using a CMSX- 4 powder. Two selective electron beam <b>melting</b> <b>processing</b> strategies, which result in higher and lower effective cooling rates, are described. Orientation imaging microscopy, {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} and conventional high resolution transmission electron microscopy are used to investigate the microstructures. Our results suggest that selective electron beam <b>melting</b> <b>processing</b> results in near equilibrium microstructures, as far as γ′ volume fractions, the formation of small amounts of TCP phases and the partitioning behavior of the alloy elements are concerned. As expected, higher cooling rates result in smaller dendrite spacings, which are two orders of magnitude smaller than observed during conventional single crystal casting. During processing, columnar grains grow in directions, which are rotated with respect to each other. There are coarse γ/γ′ microstructures in high angle boundary regions. Dislocation networks form low angle boundaries. A striking feature of the as processed selective {{electron beam melting}} specimens is their high dislocation density.

40|$|Blends of starch and zein {{plasticized}} with glycerol {{were prepared}} by <b>melting</b> <b>processing</b> in an intensive batch mixer {{connected to a}} torque rheometer at 160 °C. The resulting mixtures were compression molded and then characterized by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, wide-angle X ray diffraction and water-absorption experiments. The blends were immiscible, showing two distinct phases of starch and zein. The water uptake at equilibrium and its diffusion coefficient were determined. The water uptake at equilibrium decreased with increasing zein content. The diffusion coefficient fell sharply on addition of 20 % zein and remained constant as zein content was increased. No appreciable effect of zein on starch crystallization was observed by X ray diffraction.

50|$|Al-Ca {{composite}} conductor {{was invented by}} Russell and Anderson at Ames Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy {{with the goal of}} developing the next generation power transmission cables. Al/Ca composite is produced by powder metallurgy and severe deformation processing (extrusion, swaging, wire drawing). This process would be roughly two to three times more expensive than conventional <b>melt</b> <b>processing</b> for ACSR. But the cost saving on tower construction is projected to be substantially larger than the extra cost of the conducting cables. During deformation processing, the Ca powder particles deform into filaments surrounded by the Al matrix, which avoids exposing calcium, a reactive element, to air and moisture. The corrosion resistance of this composite {{has been found to be}} similar to that of pure aluminium.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{when the}} use of fillers is considered, a {{compromise}} {{has to be made}} between the improved mechanical properties in the solid state {{on one side and the}} increased difficulty in <b>melt</b> <b>processing,</b> the problem of achieving uniform dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix and the economics of the process due to the added step of compounding on the other. The rheological properties of filled polymers are determined not only by the type and amount of filler, but also by the shape, size and size distribution of its particles. The viscosity of filled systems generally increases with increasing filler fraction. This can be partially ameliorated via broad particle size distributions via the Farris effect. An additional factor is the stress transfer at the filler-polymer interface. The interfacial adhesion can be substantially enhanced via a coupling agent that adheres well to both the polymer and the filler particles. The type and amount of surface treatment on the filler are thus additional parameters affecting the rheological and material properties of filled polymeric systems.|$|E
50|$|BSCCO was {{the first}} HTS {{material}} {{to be used for}} making practical superconducting wires. All HTS have an extremely short coherence length, of the order of 1.6 nm. This means that the grains in a polycrystalline wire must be extremely good contact - they must be atomically smooth. Further, because the superconductivity resides substantially only in the copper-oxygen planes the grains must be crystallographically aligned. BSCCO is therefore a good candidate because its grains can be aligned either by <b>melt</b> <b>processing</b> or by mechanical deformation. The double bismuth oxide layer is only weakly bonded by van der Waals forces. So like graphite or mica, deformation causes slip on these BiO planes and grains tend to deform into aligned plates. Further, because BSCCO has n=1, 2 and 3 members these naturally tend to accommodate low angle grain boundaries so that indeed they remain atomically smooth. Thus first-generation HTS wires (referred to as 1G) have been manufactured for many years now by companies such as American Superconductor Corporation (AMSC) in the USA and Sumitomo in Japan - though AMSC has now abandoned BSCCO wire in favour of 2G wire based on YBCO.|$|E

Based on these results, a method for enhancing the amount of grafting has been pursued by varying the combination of dibasic acid anhydrides and monoepoxides. The resulting reactive meltprocessing method allows preparation of biodegradable cellulosic plastics using practical process conditions.

50|$|The {{sol-gel process}} {{has a long}} history of use for {{synthesis}} of silicate systems and other oxides and it has become a widely spread research field with high technological relevance, for example for the fabrication of thin films, coatings, nanoparticles and fibers. Sol-gel processing technology at low temperatures, an alternative to traditional <b>melt</b> <b>processing</b> of glasses, involves the synthesis of a solution (sol), typically composed of metal-organic and metal salt precursors followed by the formation of a gel by chemical reaction or aggregation, and lastly thermal treatment for drying, organic removal, and sometimes crystallization and cooling treatment. The synthesis of specific silicate bioactive glasses by the sol-gel technique at low temperatures using metal alkoxides as precursors was shown in 1991 by Li et al. For the synthesis of bioactive glasses, typical precursors used are tetraethyl orthosilicate, calcium nitrate and triethylphosphate. After hydrolysis and poly-condensation reactions a gel is formed which subsequently is calcinated at 600-700̊ C to form the glass. Based on the preparation method, sol-gel derived products, e.g. thin films or particles are highly porous exhibiting a high specific surface area. Recent work on fabricating bioactive silicate glass nanoparticles by sol-gel process has been carried out by Hong et al. In their research, nanoscale bioactive glass particles were obtained by the combination of two steps; sol-gel route and co-precipitation method, wherein the mixture of precursors was hydrolyzed in acidic environment and condensed in alkaline condition separately, and then followed by a freeze-drying process. The morphology and size of bioactive glass nanoparticles could be tailored by varying the production conditions and the feeding ratio of reagents.|$|E
