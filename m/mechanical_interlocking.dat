25|$|Although 169 Queensland railway {{stations}} had interlocking by 1918, <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> technology {{eventually became}} obsolete, as electrical interlocking or electro-pneumatic systems replaced it.

25|$|The van der Waals {{force of}} {{adhesion}} is also {{dependent on the}} surface topography. If there are surface asperities, or protuberances, that result in a greater total area of contact between two particles or between a particle and a wall, this increases the van der Waals force of attraction {{as well as the}} tendency for <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking.</b>|$|E
25|$|All LIRR trains have a Train Engineer who {{operates}} the train, and a Conductor {{who is responsible}} for the safe movement of the train, fare collection and on-board customer service. In addition, train may have one or more assistant conductors to assist with fare collection and other duties. The LIRR {{is one of the last}} railroads in the United States to use <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> control towers to regulate rail traffic.|$|E
30|$|Bond {{resistance}} of reinforcing bars {{embedded in concrete}} depends primarily on frictional resistance and <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock.</b> Chemical adhesion provides withholding property between steel and concrete. Frictional bond provides initial resistance against loading and further loading mobilizes the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> between the concrete and bar ribs. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>interlocks</b> lead to inclined bearing forces which in turn lead to transverse tensile stresses and internal inclined splitting (bond) cracks along reinforcing bars. These cracks are commonly referred as Goto cracks (Goto 1971).|$|R

50|$|Sound-on-disc is a {{class of}} sound film {{processes}} using a phonograph or other disc to record or play back sound in sync with a motion picture. Early sound-on-disc systems used a <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> with the movie projector, while more recent systems use timecode.|$|R
500|$|The exact {{details of}} the {{sticking}} mechanism remain controversial. Possibilities include <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking,</b> sintering, electrostatic attraction {{as well as the}} existence of a [...] "sticky" [...] liquid-like layer on the crystal surface. The individual ice crystals often have hexagonal symmetry. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles. The shape of the snowflake is determined broadly by the temperature and humidity at which it is formed. Rarely, at a temperature of around , snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry — triangular snowflakes. The most common snow particles are visibly irregular, although near-perfect snowflakes may be more common in pictures because they are more visually appealing. It is unlikely that any two snowflakes are alike due to the estimated 1019 (10 quintillion) water molecules which make up a typical snowflake, which grow at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through {{on its way to the}} ground.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{installation}} of the first full <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> system at Lambton Station in Wellington, a smaller system was installed at Kaitoke. [...] A signal box was built {{at the south end of}} the platform, and two arm bracket signals for both [...] "home" [...] and [...] "starting" [...] were provided for trains travelling in both directions. [...] Later, up and down [...] "distant" [...] signals were added. [...] Balanced arm semaphore signals replaced the earlier slotted-post design.|$|E
2500|$|To {{coordinate}} signals {{so that it}} {{is impossible}} to give a [...] "clear" [...] signal to a train unless the route is actually clear, the signals could be interlocked. An interlocked yard is a railway yard where semaphore or coloured light signals are controlled in such a way that the signals will not allow a train to proceed unless the points that operate in conjunction with the signals are correctly set. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> device, located under a mechanical signal frame, is a system of rods, sliding bars and levers that are configured so that points cannot be changed in conflict, thus preventing movements that may cause a collision or other accident.|$|E
30|$|The most {{important}} aspect to note {{with reference to the}} functionality of A. minus is {{that there is not a}} critical geometrical relationship between the hook and a particular fibre. The hook accepts all fibre diameters for the purposes of <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock,</b> i.e. it is non-specific.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe metal was locally {{structured}} by {{pulsed laser}} radiation producing microscopic patterns on its surface. In a second step {{the opposite side}} of the micro-structured metal was irradiated by a continuous wave (CW) fiber laser to achieve the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> between the two materials. A tight relationship between the microstructure parameters and pull-out test performance was observed. The greatest strength was achieved when the distance between subsequent grooves was minimized. The T-joint mechanical performance did not reveal any significant dependence on the considered range of joining areas. The morphological and topographical features of the detached surfaces showed that the micro-structured grooves were completely filled during the laser conductive joining process. Different alignment angles of patterns produced different failure modes although there was no evidence of an additional <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock...</b>|$|R
30|$|The burdock hook (span ~ 250  μm, shaft {{diameter}} ~ 200  μm) is desiccated when mature, without any secretory organs. The full action of <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> {{can take place}} in both a wet and dry environments; thus, the scaling effects are limited to those of size, friction, moisture, inertia and gravity.|$|R
2500|$|As best {{as can be}} determined, {{the layout}} of the yard on the {{commencement}} of operations in 1878 consisted of the main line, two loops, a short siding from the main line on the north side and a siding to a small engine shed opposite. [...] The capacity of the loops was 33 and 17 wagons respectively, and on the sidings, four and eight wagons. [...] In the early 1880s, safety sidings were laid {{at both ends of the}} yard, and in 1898 more sidings were provided. [...] Increasing traffic levels prompted a major reorganisation of the yard in 1903, with the north end extended and a new approach curve established, more sidings laid, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking</b> installed with a new signal box for the lever frame and associated equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Cross Creek {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{stations}} on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with the Working Timetable of 1887 being the first to list them. [...] Instructions for the crossing of trains laid down that southbound trains were to take the siding or loop, and northbound trains were to take the main line. [...] There were two safety sidings, each of which had a ground disc to indicate its position. [...] A home signal was also installed at the foot of the incline, and a starting signal controlled trains leaving for Featherston at the other end of the yard. [...] Though there was a building next to the station in which a lever frame was used to set some points using <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlocking,</b> this was never as extensive as at other stations.|$|E

40|$|Tungsten {{embedded}} {{composite of}} copper (C 1100) was fabricated through probeless tool aided friction stir forming (FSF). The heat input conditions and forging {{were determined to}} be most effectively controlled by the tool rotation speed. A void-free and continuously bonded Cu–W interface was established at the parameter combination of 1200 rpm tool rotation speed with 100 mm min− 1 traverse speed, 0. 05 mm plunge and 3 ° tool tilt angle. The Cu–W interface was characterized via SEM and EDS analysis and {{was determined to be}} a purely <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> due to the absence of new phases. Microstructure of the friction stir formed copper near the interface was examined by optical microscopy. Mechanical properties of the processed copper were investigated by Vickers indentation and shear punch tests, and they showed good correlation with the microstructure. Grain refinement induced work hardening was observed in the copper close to the interface. Cu–W interface remained intact during the shear punch testing and failure occurred in the grain coarsened region of the copper 1 mm away from the interface.

40|$|Self-piercing {{riveting}} (SPR) is {{a method}} used for joining sheet materials by creating a <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> between the sheets. SPR is of increasing interest in automobile industries due to its suitability for joining lightweight, high strength and dissimilar materials. The quality of an SPR joint from cross-sectional perspective is primarily characterized {{by the amount of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> known as rivet flaring. Other parameters, such as rivet head height, bottom thickness and effective length of the rivet in the bottom sheet are also considered as quality parameters. However, the many factors that determine the quality of an SPR joint are poorly described in the literature and, as a consequence, the opportunities to develop new product and optimize the process are limited. In this paper, several of the key parameters that affect the quality of an SPR joint are described and some assistive technologies that have the potential of improving the quality of a joint are discussed. This is a zone in the field of SPR joining which has plenty of research opportunities. Innovative progress will be achieved by a combination of techniques, together with industrial trials and laboratory simulations...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{compatibility}} of {{the wood}} veneer and HDPE film was improved under thermal treatment, this is by increasing the ability of HDPE molecules to fill the small cavities on the veneer to form <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock.</b> The bonding interface remained poor {{as reflected in the}} gap on the interface in Fig.  7 c and the relatively low <b>mechanical</b> properties. Enhanced <b>interlock</b> and a stronger wood/plastic interface were observed in the silane-treated PBWC sample (Fig.  7 d). This clearly demonstrated that silane A- 171 successfully improved interfacial adhesion by tethering one end to the veneer surface allowing the functionality at the other end to react with the HDPE in the presence of peroxide initiators, which should increase the mechanical properties of the composites, as shown in Table  1.|$|R
40|$|Good {{long term}} {{outcomes}} in prosthetic dentistry {{depends on the}} stability of its abutment-implant construct. One of the abutment designs normally used is a cylindrical taper where interference fit is achieved on large contact pressure and frictional resistance at the interface. Other designs include the screw and a combination of screw and taper. The stability of the implant body relative to the bone is also crucial because inadequate fixation would prevent bone integration. This study analysed a concept design where the abutment is locked mechanically once inserted into the dental implant body. Non-linear finite element contact analysis was carried out on the new design, {{as well as on}} a design based on a simple taper for comparison. Three dimensional model of the mandible was reconstructed from CT dataset and a section of the mandible was chosen for analysis. Pressure was applied on the top surface of the abutment simulating the normal biting force. Results showed that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock</b> design was 5 times more stable than the simple taper design. However, the threshold limit for osseointegration was not exceeded for both implants. Stresses exerted on the distal region of the abutment for the taper design was an order of magnitude higher than the one found on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>interlock...</b>|$|R
