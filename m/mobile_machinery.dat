30|$|The {{tractor-trailer}} is {{the most}} complicated machine to simulate as it has the most degrees of freedom of all <b>mobile</b> construction <b>machinery.</b> <b>Mobile</b> construction <b>machinery</b> can be classified into three different types: wheel, track, and chain. The wheel type includes typical construction machinery such as a truck. The track type refers more to heavy construction machinery such as an excavator. The chain type consists of multiple rigid bodies and connections such as a tractor-trailer. The chain type {{is the most}} complicated because its motion has the most degrees of freedom. Once the accessibility method for simulating the tractor-trailer is established, the user can easily apply it to other kinds of <b>mobile</b> construction <b>machinery.</b> A tractor-trailer is composed of multiple rigid bodies and connections. Mathematical equations {{can be used to}} represent the relationships between the connections of rigid bodies, which are controlled by the rules of physics. We used the concept of multi-body dynamics, which are commonly used for simulating and modeling the dynamic motions of articulated mechanisms or equipment (Hung & Kang 2009). We also provided a mathematical model to compare with the developed model to verify its feasibility.|$|R

50|$|Hybrid power trains use {{diesel-electric}} or turbo-electric {{to power}} railway locomotives, buses, heavy goods vehicles, <b>mobile</b> hydraulic <b>machinery,</b> and ships. A diesel/turbine engine drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump, which powers electric/hydraulic motor(s) - strictly an electric/hydraulic transmission (not a hybrid), unless it can accept power from outside. With large vehicles conversion losses decrease, and the advantages in distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical elements become more prominent, especially when powering multiple drives — e.g. driven wheels or propellers. Until recently most heavy vehicles had little secondary energy storage, e.g. batteries/hydraulic accumulators — excepting non-nuclear submarines, {{one of the}} oldest production hybrids, running on diesels while surfaced and batteries when submerged. Both series and parallel setups were used in WW2 submarines.|$|R

40|$|Multidisciplinary {{effort is}} usually {{required}} {{in the evaluation of}} comfort problems in the working environment of <b>mobile</b> agricultural <b>machinery</b> workers. Comfort can be partly assessed from the study of the pressure distribution of the human-seat interface. Four combine foam seats and a new air-based seat were compared with regards to static buttocks and back support pressures. Within and between subject variability and the issue of measurement repeatability were addressed. Significant differences were found in the maximum pressure profiles of the four seating systems with seats 2 and 3 performing better than seat I (seat 4 showed no significant difference when compared to the other seats). There is an almost linear relationship between mean pressure and body mass index. In all cases the air seating system performed better with regards to the static pressure gradients. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Within a {{continuous}} development of <b>mobile</b> agricultural <b>machinery</b> the application and further introduction of electronic controls is offering the fare most potential for working processes optimization. The article gives {{an introduction to}} tractor and implement controls, especially targeting implement guided tractor control, underlined with two executed examples for this advanced control design. A structured development model and basic knowledge on safe and robust control loop set-ups were developed. Potential conflict scenarios within the multi master control system of driver, tractor, implement and independently pre-planned task control were identified and solved by arbitrational state strategies. The two exemplarily executed demonstration examples utilize different control commands to functions and interfaces of the tractor. One example is an implement guided headland management; {{the other is a}} PTO torque guided tractor speed control. Both automation strategies have been pre-simulated and implemented introducing ISO 11783 communication protocol. Results from final field tests are closing the paper...|$|R

50|$|Non-road engine (which {{may include}} non-road {{equipment}} and non-road vehicle) is an {{internal combustion engine}} or a gas turbine engine used for other purposes than being an engine of a vehicle operated on public roadways. The term is commonly used by regulators to classify the engines {{in order to control}} their emission. Non-road engines are used in an extremely wide range of applications which may include machinery and engines of vehicles in other modes of transportation with different fuel types such as gasoline and diesel fuel. In many jurisdictions, the term non-road engine is assumed to refer to the engines that have mobility or portability which is separated from the term stationary engine. The definition of non-road engine may explicitly exclude certain non-road vehicles such as aircraft, locomotives, and ocean-going marine vessels. In Europe, the regulations are specifically clarified on the mobility by using the term non-road <b>mobile</b> <b>machinery</b> (NRMM). In Australia, the definition includes some stationary engines such as electric generators and pumps.|$|E
40|$|Hybridization and {{electrification}} of <b>mobile</b> working <b>machinery</b> {{are becoming}} promising {{areas of research}} and development for the off-highway industry. In this context, numerical modeling plays a fundamental role in predicting the performance of the vehicle transmission system and in optimizing its operation. A good design of the mechanical and electrical components of a hybrid transmission can be achieved only through an integrated approach. Regarding the hybrid electric traction, by means of the Ph.

40|$|Increased {{capacity}} of <b>mobile</b> agricultural <b>machinery</b> and higher driver comfort requirements force manufacturers to incorporate dynamic behavior explicitly into the design. Therefore, vibration tests should {{be carried out}} during the design phase. Because many of these manufacturers are small, they lack the know-how and equipment to perform these tests. Transportation to and from specialized companies to evaluate the vibrational characteristics is costly and time-consuming {{because of the size}} and weight of most agricultural <b>machinery.</b> A low-power <b>mobile</b> electro-hydraulic shaker allows such analysis to be performed on the factory floor Such a device can be created by putting an air spring parallel to the actuator of an electro-hydraulic shaker resulting in considerable power savings.
