40|$|The {{application}} of Riemann Methods formulated in the Lagrangian reference frame to the numerical simulation of non-linear events in solid materials is investigated. Here, solids are characterised by {{their ability to}} withstand shear distortion since they possess material strength. In particular, numerical techniques are discussed for simulating the transient response of solids subjected to extreme loading. In such circumstances, the response of solids will often be highly non-linear, displaying elastic and plastic behaviour, and even moderate compressions will produce strong shock waves. This work reviews the numerical schemes or 'hydrocodes' which have been adopted {{in the past in}} order to simulate such systems, identifying the advantages and limitations of such techniques. One of the most prominent limitations of conventional Lagrangian methods is that the computational mesh or grid has fixed-connectivity i. e. mesh nodes are connected to the same nodes for all time. This has significant disadvantages since the computational mesh can easily become tangled as the simulated material distorts. The majority of conventional hydrocodes are also constructed using outdated artificial viscosity schemes which are known to diffuse shock waves and other steep features which may be present in the solution. In the work presented here, a novel two-dimensional Lagrangian solver has been developed Vucalm-EP which overcomes many of the limitations of conventional techniques. By employing the Free-Lagrange Method, whereby the connectivity of the computational mesh is allowed to evolve as the material distorts, problems of arbitarily large deformation can be simulated. With the implementation of a spatially second-order accurate, finite-volume, Godunov-type solver, non-linear waves such as shocks are represented with higher resolution than previously possible with contemporary schemes. The Vucalm-EP solver simulates the transient elastic-perfectly plastic response of solids and displays increased accuracy over alternative Lagrangian techniques developed to simulate large <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> such as Smoothed particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Via a variety of challenging numerical simulations the Vucalm-EP solver is compared with contemporary Euler, fixed-connectivity Lagrangian, and meshless SPH solvers. These simulations include the solution of one- and two dimensional shock tube problems in aluminium, simulating the collapse of cylindrical shells and modelling high-velocity projectile impacts. Validation against previously published results, solutions obtained using alternative numerical techniques and analytical models illustrates the versatility and accuracy of the technique. Thus, the Vucalm-EP solver provides a numerical scheme for the Lagrangian simulation of extensive <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> in materials with strength, which has never previously been possible with mesh-based techniques...|$|E
30|$|Consequently, {{this study}} {{considers}} {{the ramifications of}} uncertainties in void ratio, Poisson ratio and elastic modulus. These are sensitive properties with significant corollaries that reflect in the trend of other properties. The elastic modulus {{is a function of}} the compressive strength and strain of the rock. It is a deformation parameter as it determines the extent of <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> for given imposed stress conditions. The void ratio is a measure of consistency and packing of the rock grains and has several ramifications through, for example, estimates of porosity, specific gravity, density and saturation. The Poisson ratio defines the attributes of alterations in the morphology of the rock under imposed stress conditions. The relationships between the elastic, bulk and shear moduli are readily quantifiable where appropriate estimates of the Poisson ratio and its uncertainties are available. In place of quadratic polynomial functions, the response surface in this study is characterised explicitly by a finite element geo-mechanical wellbore model. A linkage allows the exchange of information between the finite element wellbore model and the stochastic model. Traditional Monte Carlo simulations are also replaced by quasi-Monte Carlo simulations which circumvent the need for large samples.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of metal forming processes often breaks down due to severe mesh distortion. Since 1993, meshless methods have been considerably developed for structural applications. The main feature of these methods is that {{the domain of the}} problem is represented by a set of nodes, and a finite element mesh is unnecessary. This new generation of computational methods reduces time-consuming model generation and refinement effort, and it provides a higher rate of convergence than that of the conventional finite element methods. A meshless method based on the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) is applied to metal forming analysis. The displacement shape functions are developed from a reproducing kernel approximation that satisfies consistency conditions. The use of smooth shape functions with large support size are particularly effective in dealing with large <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> in metal forming analysis. In this work, a collocation formulation is used in the boundary integral of the contact constraint equations formulated by a penalty method.

This paper conducts a case study on Hungarian law and examines how Europeanization of unfair commercial practices has changed the Hungarian model of law enforcement.

The machining of lightweight materials, specialty metals, ceramics, and advanced metal matrix composites requires careful machining strategy to maximize performance, minimize tool wear and avoid <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> or destruction due to thermally induced oxidation, shear stresses, thermal stresses, vibration. It will be of great importance to develop a machine tool that is less sensitive to material properties, has virtually no thermal effects, imposes minimal stresses, is free of vibrations and provides acceptable surface finish.

An explicit finite element analysis (FEA) of a single abrasive particle impact on stainless steel in abrasive water jet (AWJ) machining. In the experimental verification, the shapes of craters on the workpiece material were observed and compared with FEA simulation results by means of crater sphericity.

The grammar here outlined and explored presents developments in compositional procedure resulting from re-considering acts of musical transformation in terms of erosion and encrustation. Within the terminologies of this thesis, erosion and encrustation are understood as classes of compositional action (applied to musical materials) defined by operations of erasure/removal and addition/accrual respectively. Using examples from the visual arts as a mechanism for discussion, the thesis develops a wider conceptual understanding of these terms, allowing them to be considered no longer as opposites but as intertwined mechanisms mutually achieving a state of <b>material</b> <b>distortion.</b> A compositional scenario is thus derived in which the sonic surface of a given instance of a composition can be understood as being comprised of the debris resulting from such processes.

The <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> {{is a serious problem}} in precision manufacturing and mass production. The exact definition of a distortion and the lack of understanding of distortion, the formation of distortion in the CNC manufacturing are critical problem. The existing distortions strongly affect the product quality and assembly process, understanding the formation of distortion and its dominant parameters is essential for predicting and reducing distortion. Manufacturing process today is required to be, among many things, low cost and reliable process on the Factory floor. It is possible that distortion can be reduced by using nitriding as a process parameter, the nitriding cycle preceded by suitable heat treatments. A general comparison of nitriding material and raw material reflects the results on nitriding material, as well as the effect of nitriding temperature on depth of case.

40|$|The 1 - 3 {{connectivity}} composite transducers comprise active piezoceramic pillars {{within a}} passive polymer matrix. The first stage in manufacturing the 1 - 3 material {{is to produce}} a bristle block (comprising a solid stock of active material with protruding pillars) by injection moulding or by dicing a piece of ceramic using precision sawing equipment. The bristle block is filled with a reactive polymer liquid that produces the passive polymer phase, and the filled block is machined to the desired dimensions. For optimum performance, the polymer phase should have complementary interaction with the ceramic phase as well as imparting dimensional stability. Epoxy-based polymers are the most usual passive materials because of their low viscosity in the uncured state and solvent resistance, coupled with their excellent adhesive, mechanical, and electrical properties. However, the curing of epoxy resins results in shrinkage of the polymer matrix and internal stress within the passive phase. This can lead to prestressing of the active ceramic <b>material,</b> <b>distortion</b> of pillars, reduction in the parallelism between the sides of pillars, acid, in certain circumstances, warpage of transducers. This is particularly evident when the solid stock in the bristle block is relatively thin.

Internal stress measurements are presented to quantify the influence of this modification via a reduction of internal stress within the polymer matrix.

40|$|The {{directive}} on Unfair Commercial Practices {{seeks to}} protect consumers by prohibiting, inter alia, misleading practices, which {{are defined as}} practices {{that are likely to}} mislead the average consumer and thereby likely to cause him to take a transactional decision he would not have taken otherwise (directive 2005 / 29 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council). While determinations of what constitutes average consumer behavior, what misleads consumers, or how consumers make transactional decisions all can be made as a matter of law, based on anecdotal observations, intuitions or theoretical assumptions, an empirical behavioral foundation can put consumer law on firmer ground and increase its efficacy. The Commission in its 2009 guidance explicitly noted, in fact, that the directive sought to take into account knowledge of how consumers actually make decisions in the market, including behavioral economic insights (guidance on the implementation/Application of directive 2005 / 29 /EC on Unfair Commercial Practices). Nevertheless, a closer evaluation of the behavioral literature shows that the task of incorporating behavioral findings in the application of the directive is more complex than it may initially appear. Consumer law should not ignore relevant research findings – empirical and theoretical – on consumer behavior, particularly those regarding systematic and predictable deviations from normative models of strict rationality that scholars have identified. At least at first blush, such findings suggest concerns for consumer law in some situations where the behavior of perfectly rational actors would not have been distorted, say, because relevant product information is readily available. Nonetheless, to apply these findings correctly, consumer law and policy must overcome a number of significant challenges. After offering some background on relevant behavioral findings, these remarks thus focus on two key challenges to a behaviorally-informed approach to the directive: (1) the <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> challenge of determining which deviations from strict rationality indeed are errors that legitimately concern consumer law; and (2) the average consumer challenge of accounting for the complex effects of consumer laws on a behaviorally-heterogeneous population with a differential susceptibility to different commercial practices...|$|E

Having tools which can predict at least the final grain size distribution for these materials is strongly required. It is in this frame that ACF worked for several years with other industrial and academic partners such as INDUSTEEL CRMC, Aubert & Duval, Ascometal, CEA Valduc and CEMEF Mines ParisTech on the simulation of the recrystallization (ReX) of 304 L austenitic stainless steel. Recent developments allowed simulation in a full-field context of the static recrystallization (SRX) of 304 L stainless steel including a crystal plasticity formulation in a finite element (FE) context in order to model precisely the grain deformation anisotropy. This crystal plasticity model includes a decomposition of the dislocation density in SSDs (Statistically Stored Dislocations) and GNDs (Geometrically Necessary Dislocations). Including the GNDs gave better results on the localization of the strain but also allowed to define more relevant nucleation criteria. During and after ReX, the grain growth phenomenon due to capillarity effects is also modelled. To take into account capillarity effects enables to reproduce precisely the final microstructure morphology (shape of the grains, equilibrium angles at multiple junctions [...] .). This full-field approach gives very good results for the modelling of 304 L stainless steel SRX. In parallel, at plants, forging and rolling processes need to be simulated in order to optimize fabrication sequences in terms of <b>material</b> <b>distortion</b> capability versus rheological properties of these materials and in terms of grain size with potential impact on ultrasonic inspection performance. In order to verify the process capability, a reduced ¼ scale component of 304 L stainless steel primary pipes has been fabricated in a similar forging sequence. Study of the recrystallization aspect at different locations of the component was part of the objectives of the project. The paper gives a view of all combined approaches: theoretical approach by recrystallization modeling as well as simulation of forging and rolling sequences with Forge® software (coupled to a mean-field metallurgical model called Thermide) and fabrication of a reduced scale part with nozzles as a test before the fabrication of the final component...|$|E
40|$|In many {{optical and}} {{precision}} engineering applications, low thermal <b>distortion</b> <b>materials</b> {{need to be}} bonded together reliably. Since high temperature bonding process ultimately introduce stresses in the bond, rendering it dimensionally instable, room temperature or near room temperature processes are preferred. Low thermal <b>distortion</b> <b>materials</b> such as silicon carbide and low thermal expansion glass ceramics are bonded at room temperature using hydroxide catalysis bonding with a silicate bonding material. The bonding procedure is explained and fracture toughness results are presented for SiC-SiC, Zerodur-Zerodur and SiC-Zerodur bonds. A surface treatment technique for hydrating the SiC surface is presented, which {{eliminates the need for}} pre-oxidized SiC surfaces when using HCB bonding. The bonds between surface treated bare SiC surfaces and thermally oxidized SiC surfaces are found to have comparable fracture toughness. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We have {{obtained}} a 45 sec resolution, Nyquist-sampled map in CO J = 1 - 0 covering approximately a 3 deg x 3 deg {{region of the}} giant molecular cloud Monoceros R 2. The map consists of 167, 000 spectra observed with the 15 element focal-plane array system on the FCRAO 14 m telescope. The data reveal that the large-scale structure of Mon R 2 is dominated by a is approximately 30 pc diameter largely hemispherical shell containing approximately 4 x 10 (exp 4) solar mass of molecular material and expanding at approximately 3 - 4 km s(exp - 1) with symmetric axis roughly {{along the line of}} sight. The dynamical timescale of the shell is estimated to be approximately 4 x 10 (exp 6) yr, which is consistent with the age of main-sequence stars powering the clusters of reflection nebulea in this region. There is no evidence for a redshifted shell {{on the far side of}} the interior 'bubble,' which is largely devoid of molecular <b>material.</b> <b>Distortions</b> of the shell are obvious, suggesting inhomogeneity of the cloud and possible presence of a magnetic field prior to its formation. Dense clumps in Mon R 2, including the main core and the GGD 12 - 15 core, appear to be condensations located on the large shell. The reflection nebulea with their illuminating stars as well as embedded IRAS sources suggest that triggered star formation has taken place over a large part of the Mon R 2 shell...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} the variable temperature infrared {{response of the}} spin ladder candidate (DTTTF) 2 Cu(mnt) 2 in order to distinguish between two competing ladder models, rectangular versus zigzag, proposed for this family of <b>materials.</b> The <b>distortion</b> along the stack direction below 235 K {{is consistent with a}} doubling along b through the metal-insulator transition. While this would agree with either of the ladder models, the concomitant transverse distortion rules out the rectangular ladder model and supports the zigzag scenario. Intramolecular distortions within the DTTTF building block molecule also give rise to on-site charge asymmetry. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Solid State Science...|$|R
