5000|$|Measuring the {{inclination}} of a wellbore (its {{deviation from the}} vertical) is comparatively simple, requiring only a pendulum. Measuring the azimuth (direction {{with respect to the}} geographic grid in which the wellbore was running from the vertical), however, was more difficult. In certain circumstances, magnetic fields could be used, but would be influenced by metalwork used inside wellbores, as well as the metalwork used in drilling equipment. The next advance was in the modification of small gyroscopic compasses by the Sperry Corporation, which was making similar compasses for aeronautical navigation. Sperry did this under contract to Sun Oil (which was involved in a lawsuit as described above), and a spin-off company [...] "Sperry Sun" [...] was formed, which brand continues to this day, absorbed into Halliburton. Three components are measured at any given point in a wellbore in order to determine its position: the depth of the point along the course of the borehole (measured depth), {{the inclination}} at the point, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>azimuth</b> at the point.

Spectro-polarimetric observations with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on the Hinode satellite {{were carried out}} with a cadence of about 30 seconds for both plage and quiet regions located near disk center. We select THMFs that have net linear polarization (LP) higher than 0. 22 %, and an area larger {{than or equal to}} 3 pixels, and compare their occurrence rates and distribution of <b>magnetic</b> field <b>azimuth.</b> We obtain probability density functions (PDFs) of magnetic field strength and inclination for both regions. The occurrence rate in the plage region is the same as for the quiet Sun. The vertical magnetic flux in the plage region is ~ 8 times larger than in the quiet Sun. There is essentially no preferred orientation for the THMFs in either region. However, THMFs in the plage region with higher LP have a preferred direction consistent with that of the plage-region's large-scale vertical field pattern. PDFs show that there is no difference in the distribution of field strength of horizontal fields between the quiet Sun and the plage regions when we avoid the persistent large vertical flux concentrations for the plage region. The similarity of the PDFs and of the occurrence rates in plage and quiet regions suggests that a local dynamo process due to the granular motion may generate THMFs all over the sun. The preferred orientation for higher LP in the plage indicates that the THMFs are somewhat influenced by the larger-scale magnetic field pattern of the plage.

40|$|Magnetic field {{measurements}} {{in the upper}} chromosphere and above, where the gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio β is lower than unity, are essential for understanding the thermal structure and dynamical activity of the solar atmosphere. Recent developments in the theory and numerical modeling of polarization in spectral lines have suggested that information on the magnetic field of the chromosphere-corona transition region could be obtained by measuring the linear polarization of the solar disk radiation {{at the core of}} the hydrogen Lyman-α line at 121. 6 nm, which is produced by scattering processes and the Hanle effect. The Chromospheric Lyman-α Spectropolarimeter (CLASP) sounding rocket experiment aims to measure the intensity (Stokes I) and the linear polarization profiles (Q/I and U/I) of the hydrogen Lyman-α line. In this paper we clarify the information that the Hanle effect can provide by applying a Stokes inversion technique based on a database search. The database contains all theoretical Q/I and U/I profiles calculated in a one-dimensional semi-empirical model of the solar atmosphere for all possible values of the strength, inclination, and <b>azimuth</b> of the <b>magnetic</b> field vector, though this atmospheric region is highly inhomogeneous and dynamic. We focus on understanding the sensitivity of the inversion results to the noise and spectral resolution of the synthetic observations as well as the ambiguities and limitation inherent to the Hanle effect when only the hydrogen Lyman-α is used.

40|$|The average {{polarization}} {{properties of}} conal single and double profiles directly reflect the polarization-modal {{structure of the}} emission beams which produce them. Conal component pairs exhibit large fractional linear polarization on their inside edges and virtually complete depolarization on their outside edges; whereas profiles resulting from sightline encounters with the outer conal edge are usually very depolarized.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this report is "Effect of Drilling Fluid Content on Directional Drilling - Shielding of Directional Magnetic Sensor in MWD Tools" {{and it has been}} {{prepared}} {{as a part of the}} course TPG 4910 Petroleum Engineering - Drilling Engineering, Master Thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The magnetic property of the drilling fluid is one of the substantial error sources for the determination of azimuth while drilling deviated wells. These errors may be in the range of 1 - 2 [2] causing errors of 1 - 200 meter when drilling long, deviated intermediate sections. Therefore, these effects represent a significant cost to be mitigated. The error becomes even more pronounced if drilling occurs in arctic regions close to the magnetic North pole. Added clays, weight materials and tubular wear are anticipated to distort the geomagnetic field at the location of the magnetometers. The effect on the magnetometer readings is obviously linked to the amount of magnetic material in the drilling fluid. The problem has been studied both by laboratory experiments and analyses of down hole survey data. However, there are several inconsistencies in the results, and the phenomenon is not fully understood. In the present report it is shown how the magnetic distortion relates to some drilling fluid additives. A series of experiments have been conducted to increase the understanding of the effects. First a series of fresh water based bentonite drilling fluids were investigated to see the effect of bentonite on magnetic shielding. Thereafter, a series of fresh oil based drilling uidswere evaluated to observe the magnetic shielding effect of organophilic clays. Eroded steel (swarf) collected from the ditch-magnet of an offshore drilling location was added to the oil based drilling fluid to investigate how swarf and steel fines content of drilling fluids affects magnetic shielding. Finally, used oil and water based drilling fluids were investigated. The measurements done on the water based bentonite drilling fluid showed a shielding effect for the whole series of fluids. The highest shielding effect was 2. 2 %. This is high enough to cause significant errors on the <b>magnetic</b> survey <b>azimuth</b> calculations [3]. Ferreous components in the bentonite clay are the main suspects in causing shielding of the earth's magnetic field in the fresh water based drilling fluid. The measurements done with the oil based drilling fluid showed little or no shielding effect for the series of fluids tested. The shielding effect peaked at 0. 22 %, considerably less than for the water based bentonite drilling u-ids. The synthetically made organophilic hectorite clay in the oil based fluidis believed to contain little or no ferreous components capable of magnetic shielding. However, when swarf from an offshore drilling location was added to the oil based drilling fluid the shielding effect was 25 %. This is a consider-able shielding effect of the earth's magnetic field, likely to cause substantial errors on the directional magnetic sensor in MWD tools. For the used oil based drilling fluid, the measurements showed a small, close to negligible, shielding effect on the earth's magnetic field. The shielding was 0. 26 %, a result similar to the fresh oil based drilling fluid. None of the used water based drilling fluids showed any signs of affecting the earth's magnetic field. </p...|$|R
