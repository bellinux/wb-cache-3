500|$|The European Union (EU) {{signed a}} {{comprehensive}} package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16December 2002. With this agreement, the EU {{was given the}} possibility to use NATO assets in case it wanted to act independently in an international crisis, {{on the condition that}} NATO itself did not want to act—the so-called [...] "right of first refusal". For example, Article 42(7) of the 1982 Treaty of Lisbon specifies that [...] "If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>shall</b> have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power". The treaty applies globally to specified territories whereas NATO is restricted under its Article 6 to operations north of the Tropic of Cancer. It provides a [...] "double framework" [...] for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} Luxembourg Summit {{was further}} {{elaborated}} at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the Maastricht Treaty. The European Council agreed to create [...] "a European police office (Europol) the initial function {{of which would be}} to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>shall</b> regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E
