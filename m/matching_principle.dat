Feasability of our processing approach is shown by presenting the application of TMPL to two real-world scenarios and examining the differences to conventional processing methods...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : ConferenceInternational audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a new {{technique}} for indexing and search in a database that stores songs. A song is represented by a high dimensional binary vector using the audio fingerprinting technique. Audio fingerprinting extracts from a song a fingerprint which is a content-based compact signature that summarizes an audio recording. A song can be recognized by matching an extracted fingerprint to a database of known audio fingerprints. In this paper, we are given a high dimensional binary fingerprint database of songs and focus our attention {{on the problem of}} effective and efficient database search. However, the nature of high dimensionality and binary space makes many modern search algorithms inapplicable. The high dimensionality of fingerprints suffers from the curse of dimensionality, i. e., as the dimension increases, the search performance decreases exponentially. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a new search algorithm based on inverted indexing, the multiple sub-fingerprint <b>match</b> <b>principle,</b> the offset <b>match</b> <b>principle,</b> and the early termination strategy. We evaluate our technique using a database of 2, 000 songs containing approximately 4, 000, 000 sub-fingerprints and the experimental result shows encouraging performance...|$|R

Itisamazingly simple, expresses one of the most basic primitives in mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (counting) and, for these reasons, is probably the most extensively studied combinatorial principle. In this survey we try to summarize what is known about its proof complexity, and what we would still like to prove.

30|$|To {{deal with}} the {{uncertainties}} brought by real-time data prediction, future work will compare another two existing techniques to validate {{the efficiency of the}} RHO scheme. One is a scenario-based approach [32], in which the possible uncertainties are realized by generating multiple scenarios. Scenario-generation methods include Monte Carlo sampling, moment <b>matching</b> <b>principles</b> and other methods motivated by stability analysis. The limitation of this method is the significant increase in the computation burden and scale. Another method is interval optimization [33], in which confidence intervals in terms of upper and lower bounds are used to represent the uncertainty spectrum. While this method does not need assumed probability distribution for uncertainties, it needs to carefully select the uncertainty intervals.|$|R

Accuracy of intersection point calculation could be controlled by set step size of torque and rotational speed. The problem of multiple roots and instability of intersection point calculation could be avoided.

By this method, any hydrodynamic torque converter and engine with given performance, input and output cooperating characteristic could be derived accurately, rapidly and stably...|$|R

Human performance is modeled by CLARET, a machine learning and matching system, based on inductive logic programming and graph <b>matching</b> <b>principles.</b> The model is applied to data of a learning experiment addressing the role of prior experience in the ontogenesis of men-tal object representations. Prior experience was varied in terms of sensory modality, i. e. visual versus haptic versus visuohaptic. The analysis revealed distinct differences between the representational formats used by subjects with haptic versus those with no prior object experience. These differences suggest that prior haptic exploration stimulates the evolution of object representations which are characterized by an increased differentiation between attribute values and a pronounced structural encoding...|$|R

50|$|The revenue {{recognition}} principle is {{a cornerstone of}} accrual accounting together with the <b>matching</b> <b>principle.</b> They both determine the accounting period, in which revenues and expenses are recognized. According to the principle, revenues are recognized when they are realized or realizable, and are earned (usually when goods are transferred or services rendered), no matter when cash is received. In cash accounting - in contrast - revenues are recognized when cash is received no matter when goods or services are sold.|$|E

40|$|The Kalman filter (KF) is used {{extensively}} for state estimation. Among its requirements are {{the process and}} observation noise covariances, which are unknown or partially known in real-life applications. Uncertain and biased values of the covariances result in KF performance degradation or divergence. Unlike previous methods, we are using {{the idea of the}} recursive estimation of the KF to develop two recursive updating rules for the process and observation covariances, respectively designed based on the covariance <b>matching</b> <b>principles.</b> Each rule has a tuning parameter that enhances its flexibility for noise adaptation. The proposed adaptive Kalman filter (AKF) proves itself to have an improved performance over the conventional KF and, in the worst case, it converges to the KF. The results show that the AKF estimates are more accurate, have less noise, and are more stable against biased covariances...|$|R

50|$|Deferrals are the {{consequence}} of the revenue recognition principle which dictates that revenues be recognized in {{the period in which}} they occur, and the <b>matching</b> <b>principle</b> which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. Deferrals are the result of cash flows occurring before they are allowed to be recognized under accrual accounting. As a result, adjusting entries are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either liabilities or assets. Because of the similarity between deferrals and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.|$|E
50|$|Because of the <b>matching</b> <b>principle</b> of accounting, {{revenues}} and expenses should be {{recorded in the}} period in which they are incurred. When a sale is made on account, revenue is recorded along with account receivable. Because there is an inherent risk that clients might default on payment, accounts receivable have to be recorded at net realizable value. The portion of the account receivable that is estimated to be not collectible is set aside in a contra-asset account called Allowance for doubtful accounts. At the end of each accounting cycle, adjusting entries are made to charge uncollectible receivable as expense. The actual amount of uncollectible receivable is written off as an expense from Allowance for doubtful accounts.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{fingerprint}} matching algorithm based on graph <b>matching</b> <b>principles.</b> We define a new representation called K-plet to encode the local neighborhood of each minutia. We also present CBFS (Coupled BFS), a new dual graph traversal algorithm for consolidating all the local neighborhood matches and analyze its computational complexity. The proposed algorithm is robust to non-linear distortion since only local neighborhoods are matched at each stage. Ambiguities in minutiae pairings are solved by employing a dynamic programming based optimization approach. The coupled BFS algorithm provides a very generic way of consolidating the local matches. No explicit alignment is required during the entire matching process. We present an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach and showed that it exceeds {{the performance of the}} NIST BOZORTH 3 [9] matching algorithm. The paper also provides an extensive survey and taxonomy of existing minutiae based matching algorithms. ...|$|R
