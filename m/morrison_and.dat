5|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Morrison was given a one-year qualifying offer with a reported value of approximately US$500,000. With the Devils unwilling to increase their offer, he left in September 1999 for Třebíč, Czech Republic, where fellow Devils restricted free agent Patrik Eliáš was also holding out. While overseas, <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> Eliáš played for Czech teams SK Horácká Slavia Třebíč and HC Pardubice {{as they waited for}} contract negotiations to resume. Morrison was pointless in two games with Třebíč and recorded seven points in five games with Pardubice. On October 24, 1999, <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> Eliáš agreed to new contracts with the Devils. After recording 26 points over 44 games with the Devils, Morrison was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on March 14, 2000, alongside centre Denis Pederson, in exchange for winger Alexander Mogilny.

5|$|Before {{they formed}} a partnership, John <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> The Miz were opponents, {{competing}} for the ECW Championship in October 2007. On the November 16, 2007, episode of SmackDown!, then-rivals <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> The Miz were paired together to face Matt Hardy and MVP in a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, which they subsequently won after MVP turned on Hardy. After winning the title, <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> The Miz brought the title to the ECW brand. Soon after winning the WWE Tag Team Championship, the two were no longer portrayed as enemies, but rather as trusting friends. They would defend the title on numerous occasions on both ECW and SmackDown as well as multiple pay-per-views against opponents like Shannon Moore and Jimmy Wang Yang, Jesse and Festus, and Tommy Dreamer and Colin Delaney. The team's gimmick was further expanded upon when {{they were given a}} show on WWE.com called The Dirt Sheet. During the sixth annual WWE Draft on June 23, 2008, on Monday Night Raw, the duo defeated the Hardys (Matt and Jeff) which earned ECW its only draft pick, {{which turned out to be}} Matt Hardy. At the Great American Bash in July, <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> The Miz lost the title in a four team tag match to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder; however, neither The Miz nor Morrison were pinned during the match.|$|E

In December, Moore and Yang challenged John <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> The Miz for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful, igniting a feud between the two teams. The following week on ECW, Moore and Yang defeated <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> The Miz in a non-title match, to earn a rematch for the championship. On January 1, 2008, Moore and Wang Yang once again beat <b>Morrison</b> <b>and</b> the Miz, this time in a six-person tag team match also involving Layla and Kelly Kelly. The following week, in a Fifteen Minutes of Fame Match, Moore and Wang Yang tied the champions on pinfalls, meaning Miz and Morrison retained the championship. Throughout late January and February, Moore and Yang moved into a feud with Deuce 'n Domino, defeating them two weeks in a row.
