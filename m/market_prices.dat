5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E
5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock <b>market</b> <b>prices,</b> {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Vizzini was the undisputed head of the Mafia in Villalba. The war provided the mafiosi with new opportunities for self-enrichment when the Italian Army requisitioned horses and mules in Sicily for the cavalry and artillery. Vizzini came to {{an agreement with the}} Army Commission to delegate the responsibilities to him. He collected a poll tax on the animals whose owners wanted to avoid requisition. He was also the broker for animals that were rustled for the occasion, buying at a low price from the hustlers and selling at <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> to the Army.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Kenneth Lay merged {{the natural}} gas {{pipeline}} companies of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form Enron. In the early 1990s, he helped to initiate the selling of electricity at <b>market</b> <b>prices,</b> and soon after, the United States Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets {{made it possible for}} traders such as Enron to sell energy at higher prices, thereby significantly increasing its revenue. After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying on the part of Enron and others prevented such regulation.|$|E

5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E

40|$|This work {{considers}} a stochastic {{model in which}} the uncertainty is driven by a multidimensional Brownian motion. The <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk process makes the transition between real world probability measure and risk neutral probability measure. Traditionally, the martingale representation formulas under the risk neutral probability measure requires the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk process to be bounded.

30|$|The initial {{number of}} {{generated}} scenarios for demand, day-ahead <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> intraday <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and real time <b>market</b> <b>price</b> is 50 (1200), 50 (1200), 50 (1200) and 50 (1200) {{for one hour}} (one day), respectively. Moreover, the initial number of scenarios simulated to characterize the wind speed between the closures of day-ahead market and intraday market is 25 (600). In addition, 50 (1200) scenarios are generated for wind speed realization after intraday market. The large number of original total scenarios yields an optimization problem which is intractable. To achieve tractability, the size of scenarios is reduced through Kantorovich distance approach. Consequently, the number of scenarios is reduced to 5, 10, 10, 10 scenarios for demand, day-ahead <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> intraday <b>market</b> <b>price</b> and real time <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> respectively. In addition, the number of scenarios for wind speed is reduced to 3 and 5 {{for the first and}} second time durations, respectively. As a result, total number of reduced scenarios equals to 75000 scenarios which is tractable.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|During 2006, Teaneck {{underwent}} a revaluation of all privately owned real estate, as required periodically by the state. This revaluation adjusted property values to <b>market</b> <b>prices,</b> ensuring that taxes are equitably allocated. The average property in Teaneck was assessed at approximately $417,900, {{an increase of}} 132.1% from the prior year's average. The new valuations took effect for the 2007 tax year. In {{the wake of the}} revaluation implemented in 2007, a wave of tax appeals hit the township, resulting in a loss of about $110 million in ratables and costs to the township of $2.2 million for the 2012 tax year. The township agreed to complete a revaluation by October 2014 that would go into effect in 2015, awarding a $710,000 contract to perform the necessary home visits and determine property values.|$|E
5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. <b>Market</b> <b>prices</b> fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E

After several decades’ development, organic farming {{has become an}} important part of global agricultural markets, and besides, organic vegetables are also the largest part of organic sales. The study tends to find the significant factors that exert influence on the market. What’s more, carrot, Broccoli and Banana are the examples in the study. The results show that the increase of the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of organic fruits and vegetables is influenced by the PPI, the number of stores, and the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of non-organic fruits and vegetables, which is directive for the farmers who plant banana, carrot, and broccoli, and is especially conducive to their quarterly planting plan.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk for discount bond prices under an affine term structure of interest rates. The usual relation plays two roles. First, {{it is the}} definition of <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk and, second, it provides a no arbitrage condition for the discount bond market. Here the relation defines the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk for more general situations, but includes the processes which give rise to markets with no arbitrage. This allows a separate study of the no arbitrage condition. We solve for the parameters in the general case of affine term structure with constant parameters. The parameters depend explicitly on the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk. Moreover, observations of the yield rate process do not, in general, uniquely determine the <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk...|$|R

5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders is the perception of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching.|$|E
5|$|The {{increases}} of the 1630s corresponded with {{a lull in}} the Thirty Years' War. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace of Prague (1635) the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> (at least initially) were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, the fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.|$|E
