5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they <b>may</b> <b>go</b> dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of IIH is {{the prevention of}} visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control. IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and, where applicable, weight loss. IIH may resolve after initial treatment, <b>may</b> <b>go</b> into spontaneous remission (although it can still relapse at a later stage), or may continue chronically.|$|E

5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people <b>may</b> <b>go</b> on to receive additional chemotherapy or a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, as well as how long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Nri hegemony in Igboland <b>may</b> <b>go</b> {{back as far as}} the 9th century, and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century. Eri, the god-like founder of Nri, is believed to have settled the region around 948, with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century. The first eze Nri (King of Nri), Ìfikuánim, follows directly after him. According to Igbo oral tradition, his reign started in 1043. At least one historian puts Ìfikuánim's reign much later, around 1225 CE.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, <b>may</b> <b>go</b> through up {{to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and detach to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E

5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be further complicated by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months <b>may</b> <b>go</b> by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} <b>may</b> <b>go</b> too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and <b>May</b> <b>go</b> on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E

5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or <b>may</b> <b>go</b> {{to the person}} but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail {{to return to their}} previous play. These children {{are more likely to have}} later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS <b>may</b> <b>go</b> unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom <b>may</b> <b>go</b> unrecognized.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that <b>may</b> <b>go</b> into that.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} falafel is unknown and controversial. A common {{theory is that}} the dish {{originated}} in Egypt, possibly eaten by Copts as a replacement for meat during Lent. As Alexandria is a port city, it was possible to export the dish and name to other areas in the Middle East. The dish later migrated northwards to the Levant, where chickpeas replaced the fava beans. It has been speculated that its history <b>may</b> <b>go</b> back to Pharaonic Egypt.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations <b>may</b> <b>go</b> into a torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day}} and feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E

5|$|When {{decompression}} planning {{software is}} used to produce a schedule for a planned dive, the necessary input includes a definition of the dive profile. This may be in as much detail as the user is prepared to provide and the program is capable of using, but will always specify at least maximum depth and bottom time, and <b>may</b> <b>go</b> into detail regarding recent dive history, multiple levels, gas switches, altitude and personal conservatism factors. Many dive computers have a dive planning function for which the diver selects a maximum depth and the computer displays the maximum bottom time for which no decompression stops are required.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{are used for}} a wide variety of purposes. All biological species including those of birds are represented by a holotype, the vast majority of which are full specimens (mostly skins) and in modern times explicitly designated in the original description of the taxon. All other putative members of the species may be compared to the holotype to confirm their identification. Rigorous studies of avian taxonomy are based on specimens from bird collections. Taxonomic studies rely on morphological and genetic characters to determine species limits and evolutionary relationships. Museum specimens have been the preferred source for scoring these s, as they allow studies to be replicated – anyone <b>may</b> <b>go</b> back and repeat the study using the same specimens to verify the conclusions. However, it has alternatively been argued that such re-examination can be undertaken from archived photographs without killing the study piece.|$|E
5|$|Claims that {{termites}} emerged earlier {{have faced}} controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner {{indicated that the}} Mastotermitidae termites <b>may</b> <b>go</b> back to the Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. Termites {{are thought to be}} the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus. The folded wings of the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina, arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1aand 2a, resemble those seen in Mastotermes, the only living insect with the same pattern. Krishna et al., though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.|$|E
