5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy loads of conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other <b>model.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat searchlights.|$|E
5|$|Coandă was {{interested}} in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. It was around this time that Coandă's interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|At lower Reynolds numbers, such {{as those}} seen with <b>model</b> <b>aircraft,</b> it is {{relatively}} easy to maintain laminar flow. This gives low skin friction, which is desirable. However, the same velocity profile which gives the laminar boundary layer its low skin friction also causes it to be badly affected by adverse pressure gradients. As the pressure begins to recover over the rear part of the wing chord, a laminar boundary layer will tend to separate from the surface. Such flow separation causes a large increase in the pressure drag, since it greatly increases the effective size of the wing section. In these cases, it can be advantageous to deliberately trip the boundary layer into turbulence at a point prior to the location of laminar separation, using a turbulator. The fuller velocity profile of the turbulent boundary layer allows it to sustain the adverse pressure gradient without separating. Thus, although the skin friction is increased, overall drag is decreased. This is the principle behind the dimpling on golf balls, as well as vortex generators on aircraft. Special wing sections have also been designed which tailor the pressure recovery so laminar separation is reduced or even eliminated. This represents an optimum compromise between the pressure drag from flow separation and skin friction from induced turbulence.|$|E

25|$|Whittle {{hated the}} strict {{discipline}} imposed on apprentices and, convinced {{there was no}} hope of ever becoming a pilot he at one time seriously considered deserting. However, throughout his early days as an aircraft apprentice (and at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell), he maintained his interest in <b>model</b> <b>aircraft</b> and joined the <b>Model</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Society, where he built working replicas. The quality of these attracted the eye of the Apprentice Wing commanding officer, who noted that Whittle was also a mathematical genius.

40|$|In 1955, {{work was}} {{started on the}} {{conversion}} of a subsonic wind tunnel to a 16 -foot transonic tunnel with Freon- 12 or air as the test medium. The new facility, designated the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT), became fully operational in 1960. A description is presented of aeroelastic testing and research performed in the TDT since 1960. It is pointed out that wind-tunnel tests of aeroelastic models require specialized experimental techniques seldom found in other types of wind-tunnel studies. Attention is given to model mount systems, launch vehicle <b>models,</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>models,</b> <b>aircraft</b> buffet, gust response, stability derivative measurements, and subcritical testing techniques. Aspects of vehicle development testing are considered along with aeroelastic 'fixes', aeroelastic 'surprises', approaches for controlling aeroelastic effects, and unsteady pressure measurements...|$|R
