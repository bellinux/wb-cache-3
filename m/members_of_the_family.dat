5|$|Much like {{fathers are}} {{depicted}} primarily in recreational activities with their children, other male <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> including sons and male grandchildren, are portrayed in play activities {{the majority of}} the time. Interestingly, young female <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> are depicted similarly in play activities, but nevertheless tend to be more likely shown in activities related to chores and child-care. In addition, the image of the grandparent has been largely nonexistent in advertising.|$|E

Long {{considered a}} <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Timaliidae (Old World babblers), Chrysomma {{is actually quite}} {{closely related to the}} typical warblers and even closer to the parrotbills, and is therefore a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Sylviidae.|$|R
5|$|After the war, {{the family}} {{returned}} to the newly independent Poland, only to find their estates ruined.

5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} of <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site {{with the tip of}} her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the most}} frugivorous <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Lemuridae, {{consuming}} {{an average of}} 74–90% fruit, ruffed lemurs also consume nectar (4–21%), and supplement {{the rest of their}} diet with young leaves (3–6%), mature leaves (1%), flowers (3–6%), and some seeds. Ruffed lemurs have also been reported to come to the ground to eat fungi and exhibit geophagy.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{relatively}} few studies {{of learning and}} cognition have been performed on strepsirrhine primates, including ruffed lemurs. However, a study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve demonstrated that ruffed lemurs, along with several other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Lemuridae, could understand the outcome of simple arithmetic operations.|$|E

5|$|<b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Theridiidae weave irregular, tangled, {{three-dimensional}} webs, {{popularly known}} as cobwebs. There {{seems to be an}} evolutionary trend towards a reduction in the amount of sticky silk used, leading to its total absence in some species. The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb-webs, and may take several days.|$|E
5|$|Phellodon species, {{like other}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Bankeraceae, are {{sensitive}} to air pollution and soil pollution, and are in general decline in western Europe.

The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In most <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which {{reduces the risk of}} desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
