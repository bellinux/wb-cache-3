5|$|The initial 777-200 {{made its}} <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> on June 12, 1994 and was first {{delivered}} to United Airlines on May 15, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft, registered N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of design work, KnAAPO constructed the first prototype, which was finished in mid-2007. The prototype, Su-35-1, was then transferred to the Gromov Flight Research Institute at Zhukovsky Airfield, in preparation for its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight.</b> On 19 February 2008, Sergey Bogdan took the aircraft aloft for its 55-minute first flight from Zhukovsky, accompanied by an Su-30MK2 acting as a chase plane. Bogdan later piloted the second prototype on its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> on 2 October from KnAAPO's Dzyomgi Airport. The flight-test programme was expected to involve three flying prototypes, but on 26 April 2009, a day before its scheduled <b>maiden</b> <b>flight,</b> the fourth Su-35 (there's a static test aircraft) crashed during a taxi run at Dzyomgi Airport. The aircraft struck a barrier {{at the end of}} the runway and was destroyed by fire; the pilot ejected and sustained burn injuries. A commission was opened to investigate the crash, but several sources initially speculated that the incident had been the result of a brake failure or a faulty fuel pump.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was also}} used for the flight testing of the Gloster E28/39 in 1942 after it had made its <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> at RAF Cranwell.|$|R
50|$|Geoffrey de Havilland Jr. became de Havilland's Chief Test Pilot {{and made}} the <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> of both the de Havilland Mosquito and the de Havilland Vampire.|$|R
25|$|Compared {{with recent}} 3-4 hour <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> of western types, this first flight was brief at 30-minute and low, {{reaching}} a 1,000 m altitude and 300 km/hour.|$|R
5|$|Although final {{assembly}} of A320 family aircraft {{takes place in}} Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile, Alabama, USA, {{final assembly}} of the Airbus A318 was in Hamburg, Germany. The <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> of the Airbus A318 took place from Finkenwerder airfield in Hamburg on 15 January 2002. The first customer delivery was on 22 July 2003 to Frontier Airlines.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2005, Boeing {{announced}} it was launching the 747 Advanced as the Boeing 747-8. The last 747-400s were completed in 2009. , most orders of the 747-8 {{have been for the}} freighter variant. On February 8, 2010, the 747-8 Freighter made its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight.</b> The first delivery of the 747-8 went to Cargolux in 2011. The 1,500th produced Boeing 747 was delivered in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|The A330-200F {{made its}} <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> on 5 November 2009. This marked {{the start of}} a four-month, 180-hour {{certification}} programme. JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April. The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division, Etihad Cargo, in July 2010.|$|E
5000|$|He {{later became}} the head of flight test for Douglas Aircraft and flew the <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> of {{commercial}} aircraft like the DC8, DC9 and DC10 from the Douglas Long Beach Facility.|$|R
5000|$|Alvin Swauger [...] "Al" [...] White (December 9, 1918 - April 29, 2006) was an American {{test pilot}} and {{mechanical}} engineer. He flew the <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> of both XB-70 Valkyrie aircraft, the first 2,000 mph flight, and all subsequent Mach 3 exploration flights.|$|R
50|$|Ilyushin had a {{prominent}} {{career as a}} test pilot and lieutenant general in the Soviet Air Force. He piloted the <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> of the Sukhoi's Su-11 (1958), Т-5 (1958), Su-15 (1962), Su-17 (1966), Su-24 (1967), Т-4 (1972), Su-25 (1975) and the famous Su-27 (1977).|$|R
5|$|The first {{production}} VH-71A, Pilot Production #1 (PP-1), {{made its}} <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> on 22 September 2008 from Yeovil. The US Air Force transported the helicopter in a C-17 Globemaster III to Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland for further testing. The first production VH-71 joined the test program at NAS Patuxent River, beginning ground testing in early December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Beset {{by early}} {{construction}} problems, the first FSD aircraft {{was transferred to}} Groom Lake in May1981 inside a C-5. Further problems, this time with fuel leaks, delayed the first flight. Under the control of Harold Farley, the aircraft took off on 18June for its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight,</b> nine months after the July1980 first flight originally envisaged. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October1983; the 59th and last F-117 was delivered in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Following its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> in March 1958, {{evaluation}} of the RP-77D by the U.S. Army took place throughout the remainder of that year, nearly 40 test flights being conducted. Although the test results were generally satisfactory, {{it was determined that}} the performance of the aircraft was an insufficient improvement over existing types in service to have the aircraft ordered into production, and the project was cancelled, along with the improved RP-86, a dedicated reconnaissance variant.|$|E
50|$|Jacques Rosay was Vice President Chief Test Pilot of the {{aircraft}} manufacturer Airbus. He has piloted the <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> of several Airbus airliners, including the A318, A340-500, and A380 Superjumbo. He was born in 1949 in Valréas (Vaucluse), France, and died on 12 June 2015.|$|R
5000|$|In total, MLP-2 {{has been}} used for forty four Shuttle launches, {{starting}} in 1983. All of the orbiters except [...] made their <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> from MLP-2. It was also the launch site for the ill-fated STS-51L mission, when [...] disintegrated shortly after launch, killing all seven crew.|$|R
5000|$|After {{retiring}} from NASA, Fulton hired {{on as the}} Flight Operations Director and Chief Research Pilot for Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites. There, he flew the <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> on the Advanced Technology Tactical Transport and the Scaled Composites Triumph twin engine executive jet. In 1999, he {{was inducted into the}} National Aviation Hall of Fame ...|$|R
5|$|In {{presence}} of then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and the Prince and Princess of Wales, the first A320 was {{rolled out of}} the final assembly line on 14 February 1987 and made its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> on 22 February in 3 hours and 23 minutes from Toulouse. The flight test programme took 1,200 hours on 530 flights, European Joint Aviation Authorities certification was delivered on 26 February 1988. The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March 1988.|$|E
5|$|On 20July1951, the P.1067 {{made its}} <b>maiden</b> <b>flight,</b> flown by Neville Duke, from RAF Boscombe Down, {{powered by a}} single 6,500lbf (28.91kN) Avon 103 engine. The second prototype, which was fitted with production-standard avionics, {{armament}} and a 7,550lbf (33.58kN) Avon 107 turbojet, first flew on 5May1952. As an insurance against development problems {{on the part of}} the Avon engine, Hawker modified the design to accommodate another axial turbojet, the 8,000lbf (35.59kN) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101. Fitted with a Sapphire, the third prototype flew on 30 November 1952.|$|E
5|$|The A330-300, {{the first}} variant, took its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> in November 1992 and entered {{passenger}} service with Air Inter in January 1994. Airbus {{followed up with}} the slightly shorter A330-200 variant in 1998. Subsequently-developed A330 variants include a dedicated freighter, the A330-200F, a military tanker, the A330 MRTT, and a corporate jet, ACJ330. The A330 MRTT {{formed the basis of}} the proposed KC-45, entered into the US Air Force's KC-X competition in conjunction with Northrop Grumman, where after an initial win, on appeal lost to Boeing's tanker.|$|E
50|$|Like other Procellariforms, {{introduced}} predators (rats and cats) must {{be their}} main threats at breeding colonies. In addition, fledglings {{are attracted to}} artificial lights at night during their <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> from nests to the sea. On Tenerife, Canary Islands, a decline {{on the number of}} birds attracted to lights have been reported, suggesting a population decline on the island.|$|R
25|$|On August 10, 1972, the new heavy-lift SLV FB-1 {{made its}} <b>maiden</b> test <b>flight,</b> with only partial success.|$|R
50|$|NAMC {{succeeded in}} {{achieving}} its goal, even besting it by 3 months. On December 11, 1958 the initial mock-up was completed at {{a factory in}} Yokohama. On August 30, 1962 the first two YS-11s, numbered 1001 and 1002, launched on their <b>maiden</b> <b>flights</b> {{and by the time}} NAMC halted the production line in 1974, they had built and sold a total of 182 aircraft for airlines both in Japan and abroad.|$|R
5|$|The XB-70's <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first}} flight test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The first Su-27K prototype, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov, {{made its}} <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> on 17 August 1987 at the NITKA facility; the second {{followed}} on 22 December. Flight tests continued at NITKA, where Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks demonstrated and validated {{the feasibility of}} ski-jump operations. The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck. It was another {{two years before the}} Tbilisi, subsequently renamed Admiral Kuznetsov, left the shipyard.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight test}} {{programme}} started in 1985 with the <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> of a converted Tu-142M fitted with the advanced avionics; state acceptance trials began within two years. Test results proved excellent, as the aircraft successfully tracked nuclear-powered submarines of the Northern and Pacific Fleets. The aircraft became operational with Russian Naval Aviation (AV-MP) in 1993. The last Tu-142MZ {{rolled off the}} Taganrog production line the following year, bringing an end to a 26-year production run during which 100 Tu-142s were produced.|$|E
50|$|On June 1st 2017, Swiss' first CS300 entered {{revenue service}} with its <b>maiden</b> {{commercial}} <b>flight</b> from Geneva to London Heathrow.|$|R
50|$|The An-30 {{has also}} {{been used as a}} weather control {{aircraft}} as the An-30M. Some have been fitted with frozen tanks of carbon dioxide to be ejected into the sky to form artificial rain clouds. These An-30s have also been put to use to avoid crop-damaging hailstorms and also to maintain good weather for, as examples, new airplane <b>maiden</b> <b>flights,</b> important parades like the 1st of May and the 850th anniversary of Moscow in September 1997.|$|R
2500|$|The Wib 12 Sirocco, {{a single}} engine, two seat, parasol wing fighter was a {{structurally}} much revised {{development of the}} similarly configured Wib 8 Simoun, following it through the Avions Marcel Wibault works {{with less than a}} month between their <b>maiden</b> <b>flights.</b> They were externally very similar but the more refined structure of the Wib 12 made it both stronger and 12% lighter than its predecessor. [...] One major change was the replacement of the Wib 8's box spars with ones of I-section.|$|R
5|$|The <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> of the Airbus A321 came on 11 March 1993, {{when the}} prototype, {{registration}} F-WWIA, flew with IAE V2500 engines; the second prototype, equipped with CFM56-5B turbofans, flew in May. Lufthansa and Alitalia {{were the first}} to order the stretched Airbuses, with 20 and 40 aircraft requested, respectively. The first of Lufthansa's V2500-A5-powered A321s arrived on 27 January 1994, while Alitalia received its first CFM56-5B-powered aircraft on 22 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} freighter model, the 777F, {{rolled out}} on May 23, 2008. The <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> of the 777F, which used the structural design and engine specifications of the -200LR along with fuel tanks {{derived from the}} -300ER, occurred on July 14, 2008. FAA and EASA type certification for the freighter was received on February 6, 2009, and the first delivery to launch customer Air France took place on February 19, 2009.|$|E
5|$|There were {{plans to}} {{establish}} mass ("serial") {{production of the}} model at the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant (later renamed as Antonov Serial Production Plant), which was associated with but separate from the Antonov Design Bureau, and at the Samara Aircraft Production Plant (later reorganised as Aviakor) in Samara, Russia. At one stage during early development, Russia was showing reluctance at supporting {{the development of the}} An-70, and so Uzbekistan sought, unsuccessfully, to establish a final assembly plant in the capital at the Tashkent Aircraft Production Plant, where the production of the An-70's wings and the Il-76 were taking place. Construction of the first prototype had started in Kiev in 1991. The <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> of the aircraft had originally been scheduled for late 1992. However, due to financing and design issues, this was pushed back until 1994. In particular, the weakened national currency diminished the firm's ability to pay for the aircraft's components, especially those sourced from Russia, and workers' salaries. In addition, engineers discovered numerous design and manufacturing deficiencies during the final ground checks, the majority of which were non-critical yet necessitated lengthy corrections. In the end, the aircraft made its <b>maiden</b> <b>flight</b> on 16 December 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Bayraktar Block A {{with its}} 450 kg MTOW and 9 meter wing span made its <b>maiden</b> {{autonomous}} <b>flight</b> on 8 June 2009 at Kesan Airport, Turkey.|$|R
25|$|Vickers-Armstrongs (VA) {{established}} a major aircraft shadow factory at Squires Gate in 1940 {{for the production}} of large numbers of Vickers Wellington medium bombers. Vickers took over most of the existing facilities at Stanley Park Aerodrome and used them, and five newly erected temporary Bellman hangars, to house a secondary assembly line. Because of the airfield's short grass runways, the Wellingtons landed at the larger Squires Gate facility after their <b>maiden</b> <b>flights.</b> A total of 2,584 Wellingtons were completed at the two Blackpool aerodromes between September 1940 and summer 1945.|$|R
50|$|On 21 October 2014, NASA {{conducted}} the <b>maiden</b> test <b>flight</b> of a one-third scale {{model of the}} twin fuselage glider using NASA Armstrong's DROID aircraft, an autonomous airplane. The flight was successful.|$|R
