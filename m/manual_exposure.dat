25|$|Video {{functionality}} {{has continued}} to improve since {{the introduction of the}} HDSLR, including higher video resolution (such as 1080p24) and video bitrate, improved automatic control (autofocus) and <b>manual</b> <b>exposure</b> control, and support for formats compatible with high-definition television broadcast, Blu-ray disc mastering or Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI). The Canon EOS 5D Mark II (with the release of firmware version 2.0.3/2.0.4.) and Panasonic Lumix GH1 were the first HDSLRs to offer broadcast compliant 1080p24 video, and since then the list of models with comparable functionality has grown considerably.|$|E
50|$|Exposure {{compensation}} is particularly useful {{in combination with}} auto-exposure mode, as it allows the photographer to bias the exposure level without resorting to full <b>manual</b> <b>exposure</b> and losing the flexibility of auto exposure.

50|$|It is {{considered}} easiest {{to have a}} manual winding camera for double exposures. On automatic winding cameras, {{as soon as a}} picture is taken the film is typically wound to the next frame.

50|$|The Nikon F3 was Nikon's third {{professional}} single-lens {{reflex camera}} body, preceded by the F and F2.

50|$|Like the Nikon F4, the F-801 is broadly {{compatible}} with most Nikon AI and AF F-mount lenses, though some features are unavailable {{depending on the}} lens type.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{view of the}} {{conflicting}} opinions published, a meta-analysis was undertaken on epidemiological studies {{in order to assess}} any association between Dupuytren's contracture and work exposure. Methods Using the key words: "occupational disease", "work" and "Dupuytren contracture" without limitation on language or year of publication, epidemiological studies were selected from four databases (Pub-Med, Embase, Web of science, BDSP) after two rounds (valid control group, valid work exposure). A quality assessment list was constructed and used to isolate papers with high quality methodological criteria (scores of 13 or above, HQMC). Relevant associations between <b>manual</b> work, vibration <b>exposure</b> (at work) and Dupuytren's contracture were extracted from the articles and a metarisk calculated using the generic variance approach (meta-odds ratios, meta-OR). Results From 1951 to 2007, 14 epidemiological studies (including 2 cohort studies, 3 case-control studies, and 9 cross-sectional studies/population surveys) were included. Two different results could be extracted from five studies (based on different types of exposure), leading to 19 results, 12 for manual work (9 studies), and 7 for vibration exposure (5 studies). Six studies met the HQMC, yielding 9 results, 5 for manual work and 4 for vibration exposure. Five studies found a dose-response relationship. The meta-OR for manual work was 2. 02 [1. 57; 2. 60] (HQMC studies only: 2. 01 [1. 51; 2. 66]), and the meta-OR for vibration exposure was 2. 88 [1. 36; 6. 07] (HQMC studies only: 2. 14 [1. 59; 2. 88]).

50|$|Built-in {{flash with}} a zoom head, {{programmed}} AE and metered <b>manual</b> <b>exposure</b> {{out of the}} box, adding the A/S expansion card provided two additional AE modes, Shutter-priority and Aperture-priority. A fairly direct replacement for the earlier 5000.|$|E
50|$|The only auto-exposure mode {{supported}} was {{aperture priority}} AE. The camera would choose an appropriate shutter speed.

50|$|Canon {{also sold}} a manual-focus camera, the Canon EF-M, which {{used the same}} EF lens mount as the EOS cameras.

40|$|Epidemiological {{evidence}} points {{strongly to}} a hazard of hip osteoarthritis from heavy <b>manual</b> work. Harmful <b>exposures</b> {{may be reduced}} by the elimination or redesign of processes {{and the use of}} mechanical aids. Reducing obesity might help to protect workers whose need to perform heavy lifting cannot be eliminated. Particularly high relative risks have been reported in farmers, and hip osteoarthritis is a prescribed occupational disease in the UK for long-term employees in agriculture. Even where it is not attributable to employment, hip osteoarthritis impacts importantly on the capacity to work. Factors that may influence work participation include the severity of disease, the physical demands of the job, age {{and the size of the}} employer. Published research does not provide a strong guide to the timing of return to work following hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis, and it is unclear whether patients should avoid heavy manual tasks in their future employment...|$|R
40|$|Long-lasting {{and intense}} {{vibration}} {{of the hand}} and the arm can cause serious diseases. The estimation of risks {{with respect to the}} hand and arm vibration can be achieved by the consideration of exposure duration and vibration intensity. <b>Manual</b> assessment of <b>exposure</b> durations and used tools is expensive, disturbs and the workflow or may be performed only sporadically and rarely due to high costs. Robust and cheap smart watches including a plurality of integrated sensors are available on the market. Although smart watches provide accurate acceleration, rotation rate, acoustic sensors and a powerful processing unit, it is so far unclear whether these systems can be used to assess hand-arm vibration (HAV). In a feasibility study, it was evaluated if vibration pattern and sound features are suitable to identify the used tools under laboratory conditions and in field trials. As a result of the evaluation, the possibilities and constraints for an individual determination of hand-arm vibration have been worked out...|$|R
5000|$|The R9 was an {{evolutionary}} step from the R8 and appears superficially very similar; {{enough so that}} some have opined {{that it should have}} been simply a Mark II of the R8, or in Leica nomenclature, an [...] "R8.2".2 The silver top-plate color available on the R8 was replaced by an 'Anthracite' color on the R9; black remained available. Another external change was the addition of an LCD frame counter on the top plate between the wind lever and the shutter-speed dial. The mode selector dial gained a lock, after many R8 user complaints that it was too easily moved from the desired setting when handling the camera. The rear LCD display gained a backlight so it could be viewed in dim lighting. The mass of the R9 was reduced by 100g (to 790g) from the R8, achieved by switching to a magnesium casting for the top plate (formerly zinc alloy) and substituting aluminum for steel at the bottom plate's frame. Electronic changes included the ability to tune the sensitivity of matrix metering in steps of 0.1 EV independently of the other metering modes, and several improvements to the flash support. Metz's HSS (High Speed Sync) flash mode was now supported, allowing fill flash at shutter speeds greater than the X-sync speed by the use of many repeated small flashes of the electronic flashgun. This mode could be used from 1/360 to the camera's shortest 1/8000 of a second shutter speed. Also improved was the use of fill-flash at slower shutter speeds and wider apertures, by enabling lower-power illumination modes on modern Metz equipment. The <b>manual</b> flash <b>exposure</b> compensation ability in Program mode was improved, and AE lock was now possible in all automated modes.|$|R
