5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} World WarII, the Ministry of Education {{has issued}} {{statements}} and regulations to promote the usage of both the Hinomaru and Kimigayo at schools under their jurisdiction. The first of these statements was released in 1950, stating that it was desirable, but not required, to use both symbols. This desire was later expanded to include both symbols on national holidays and during ceremonial events to encourage students on what national holidays are and to promote defense education. In a 1989 reform of the education guidelines, the LDP-controlled government first demanded that the flag must be used in school ceremonies and that proper respect <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> to it and to Kimigayo. Punishments for school officials who did not follow this order were also enacted with the 1989 reforms.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.|$|E

5|$|The Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General P. P. Kumaramangalam was due {{to retire}} in June 1969.

Despite this, Manekshaw was appointed as the 8th Chief of the Army Staff on 8 June 1969. As the Chief of the Army Staff, he developed the Indian Army into an efficient instrument of war. During his tenure as COAS, he was instrumental in stopping the implementation of reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the army. Though he was Parsi, a minority group in India, Mankeshaw felt that implementing reservations would compromise the ethos of the army; he also felt all <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> an equal chance.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{is popular}} with {{pleasure}} boaters, {{as much of}} it is pleasantly rural, with added interest provided by the city of Chester and Ellesmere Port with its waterways museum. The towpath through Chester provides an attractive route for walkers. The canal is well connected, with links to the Trent and Mersey Canal via the Middlewich Branch to the east, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal via the former Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to the south, and provides a route to the Llangollen Canal, from which the Montgomeryshire Canal, which is the subject of an ongoing restoration scheme, can be accessed. Boaters can also access the River Dee at Chester, although advance notice <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>given,</b> and the river is only accessible for four hours either side of high tide. At Ellesmere Port, the canal has connected to the Manchester Ship Canal since its opening in 1894. For many leisure cruisers, the requirements of the ship canal company for taking small boats onto a large commercial waterway are too daunting, and Ellesmere Port acts as the end of their journey.|$|E
