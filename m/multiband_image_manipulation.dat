40|$|In {{the last}} decade, Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) has been {{accepted}} as an effective method for processing high spatial resolution <b>multiband</b> <b>images.</b> This image analysis method is an approach that starts with the segmentation of the image. Image segmentation in general is a procedure to partition an image into homogenous groups (segments). In practice, visual interpretation {{is often used to}} assess the quality of segmentation and the analysis relies on the experience of an analyst. In an effort to address the issue, in this study, we evaluate several seed selection strategies for an automatic image segmentation methodology based on a seeded region growing-merging approach. In order to evaluate the segmentation quality, segments were subjected to spatial autocorrelation analysis using Moran's I index and intra-segment variance analysis. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using an aerial <b>multiband</b> <b>image...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract- We {{present a}} fast and {{efficient}} method to derive and apply natural colours to nighttime imagery from multiband sensors. The colour mapping {{is derived from}} the combination of a <b>multiband</b> <b>image</b> and a corresponding daytime colour reference. The mapping optimizes the match between the <b>multiband</b> <b>image</b> and the reference, and yields a nightvision image with colours similar to the daytime image. The mapping procedure is simple and fast. Once it has been derived the colour mapping can be deployed in realtime. Different colour schemes can be used tailored to the environment and the application. The expectation is that by displaying nighttime imagery in natural colours human observers will be able to interpret the imagery better and faster, thereby improving situational awareness and reducing detection times...|$|R

Following the method recently developed by Wei et al., the generalized Sylvester matrix equation {{associated with the}} <b>multiband</b> <b>image</b> fusion problem is solved in a more robust and efficient way by exploiting the Woodbury formula, avoiding any permutation operation in the frequency domain {{as well as the}} blurring kernel invertibility assumption required in their method. Thanks to this improvement, the proposed algorithm requires fewer computational operations and is also more robust with respect to the blurring kernel compared with the one developed by Wei et al. The proposed new algorithm is tested with different priors considered by Wei et al. Our conclusion is that the proposed fusion algorithm is more robust than the one by Wei et al. with a reduced computational cost...|$|R
