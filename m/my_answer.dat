25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E
500|$|Warren retains fond {{memories}} of Beacham's [...] "very professional" [...] performance, and remarks that, [...] "with tongue firmly in cheek, she would often wind me up by asking what her motivation was for a particular action, just as I about to call 'Action!', {{knowing full well that}} <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> would be, 'Because it's in the script'." [...] Beacham, a mother of two infant children, agreed to appear in the film to support her family: [...] "I had to choose between a play that I really, really wanted to do, which would have paid me £65 a week, and this script for a film called Inseminoid. Hey! No choice. Two pink babies asleep upstairs! No choice!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the first}} episode in which Kit Harington and Iwan Rheon filmed scenes {{together}} and met on-screen. Rheon {{said that he had}} always wanted to film scenes with Jon Snow: [...] "Anyone who has asked me, 'Who would you like Ramsay to meet?' <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> has always been, 'Jon Snow.' He's the antithesis of Ramsay. They're almost a yin and a yang. They both come from such a similar place yet they're so different. And even though they're enemies, they've both risen so far as bastards, which is almost incomprehensible, and now they're both here facing each other. They couldn't be any more different, yet more similar." [...] In an interview, Harington talked about the fight scene with Rheon: [...] "I actually did punch Iwan in the face twice by accident, which he took really well. He was really nice about it." [...] According to Rheon, [...] "The way I see it, if you don't get hit a couple of times doing that, you're not doing it properly." ...|$|E

40|$|Leonard R. N. Ashley {{presented}} a quiz titled 2 ̆ 2 The Proper Name in the Proper Use 2 ̆ 2 in the February 1995 issue of Word Ways. I worked it. I did my best, and although <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> differ somewhat from Ashley 2 ̆ 7 s {{anyone who has}} (or has had) a teenage daughter and/or son will surely agree that <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> come {{as close to the}} mark (whoever she is) as Ashley 2 ̆ 7 s...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mason took {{occasion}} once {{to question}} me on what I knew. Some of <b>my</b> <b>answers,</b> in especial those relating {{to my knowledge}} of the Bible, surprised him. Others made him sad.|$|R
2500|$|I {{was obliged}} to read it because {{everybody}} was asking me about it. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> is that Dan Brown {{is one of the}} characters in my novel Foucault's Pendulum, which is about people who start believing in occult stuff.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Brian Houston {{discussed}} {{being more}} understanding of gay people. Later, he clarified his position after being criticised by some Christians for allegedly supporting homosexuality. In a statement released on Hillsong's website, he stated: [...] "Nowhere in <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> did I diminish biblical truth or suggest that I or Hillsong Church supported gay marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to her Majesty's command for {{my return}} to England, assist {{me that she}} may yield me her favour and liberty of {{conscience}} in religion[...] [...] [...] If this cannot be done, then solicit her for my enjoying my small living on this side the sea, whereby I may be kept from necessity, which otherwise will force me to seek relief of some foreign prince.|$|E
6000|$|... "Modesty {{prevents}} <b>my</b> <b>answering,</b> because <b>my</b> partners {{leave me}} {{to put up the}} hash. I'll admit it might be better; but our passengers wouldn't find that out until we got them away at sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|BRODIE. Here are <b>my</b> <b>answers.</b> (Producing {{purse and}} dice.) These are both too light. This purse is empty, these dice are not loaded. Is it indiscretion to inquire how you share? Equal with the Captain, I presume? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was ashamed}} {{to give the}} true reason--it seemed so utterly unworthy of a man of any sense or spirit. Noticing my hesitation, she insisted on <b>my</b> <b>answering</b> her; she forced me to make my humiliating confession.|$|R
2500|$|Benny {{was profoundly}} shaken by Allen's sudden {{death of a}} heart attack in 1956. In a {{statement}} released on the day after Allen's death, Benny said, [...] "People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> is always the same. You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post, on December 29, 2005, reported: [...] "Jack Abramoff {{liked to}} slip into {{dialogue}} from The Godfather as he led his lobbying colleagues in planning their next conquest on Capitol Hill. In a favorite bit, he would mimic an ice-cold Michael Corleone facing down a crooked politician's demand for a cut of Mafia gambling profits: 'Senator, you can have <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> now if you like. My offer is this: nothing.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>My</b> <b>answer</b> {{to readers}} {{who want to}} know whether I am [...] "really" [...] an insider or an {{outsider}} to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both [...] that how I look at things depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological and Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is not about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, and being able to shift easily from one to the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no harm in}} <b>my</b> <b>answering</b> you," [...] said Amelius. [...] "The dream {{really had}} {{something}} to do with her trusting me. You may not think quite so unfavourably of her conduct now you know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so, Jim; my {{questions}}," [...] I repeated. [...] "I put {{questions as}} well as yourself; and however little I may have satisfied Mamie with <b>my</b> <b>answers,</b> I beg {{to remind you that}} you gave me none at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Countess of Croye," [...] said Quentin, [...] "is best judge if I have {{rendered}} any service, {{and to her}} I {{refer you}} on that matter. <b>My</b> <b>answers</b> you will yourself judge of when you ask me your questions." ...|$|R
2500|$|Romney said of {{the measure}} overall, [...] "There really wasn't Republican or Democrat in this. People ask me if this is {{conservative}} or liberal, and <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> is yes. It's liberal {{in the sense that}} we're getting our citizens health insurance. It's conservative in that we're not getting a government takeover." [...] The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office. [...] When Romney's official portrait was made for the Massachusetts State House, the composition included a leather binder with a medical seal representing the healthcare legislation.|$|E
2500|$|The Giles Report, {{a private}} {{report on the}} Black Diaries written in 2002 (and {{published}} in 2005 by The Royal Irish Academy, Dublin), was reviewed by two US forensic document examiners, who were both [...] critical of it. James Horan stated, [...] "As editor of the Journal of Forensic Sciences and The Journal of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners, I would not recommend publication of the Giles Report because the report does not show how its conclusion was reached. To the question, 'Is the writing Roger Casement's?' {{on the basis of}} the Giles Report as it stands, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> would have to be I cannot tell." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the win Jwala at a {{press conference}} stated, [...] "It's unbelievable. I think it was long pending for me. I am quite emotional. The feeling is yet to sink in. Ashwini played {{exceptionally}} well and we hope to continue the good work, I want to dedicate the medal to my family who stood by me, my coaches, especially SM Arif, Atik Jauhari and all the team members, Gopi. I owe this medal to all who helped me," [...] and added that [...] "This medal will silence my critics. This is <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to them to whatever happened.

60|$|A {{long and}} {{confining}} illness has prevented <b>my</b> <b>answering</b> {{all the good}} letters sent me--unless stamps were enclosed--but from now on I {{hope to be able}} to give prompt attention to each and every letter with which my readers favor me.|$|R
40|$|I {{welcome the}} {{opportunity}} {{to appear before the}} Committee to Investigate a Balanced Federal Budget. Few subjects have received more attention and provoked more controversy than the subjects of budget deficits and deficit finance. I have tried to respond to many of the questions in Dr. Noller 2 ̆ 7 s letter by providing some background against which <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> may be interpreted. I discuss the effect of the budget on inflation first. Then I discuss the budget and interest rates and the problem of 2 ̆ 2 crowding out. 2 ̆ 2 I will be pleased to develop <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> more fully or to respond to other questions as time and your interest permit...|$|R
25|$|But {{though these}} <b>my</b> <b>Answers</b> are not laid downe in a Schollerlik way, {{but by the}} plaine truth of holy Scripture; yet I beseech thee have the {{patience}} to take the paynes to reade them, and spare some time to consider them...|$|R

He is my favourite comedian and I hope to be his friend until he is forty. That will be forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{private sector}} {{should be given}} more {{autonomy}} to direct matters that deal directly with youth empowerment and job creation. In this regard, NASSI will lead a networking initiative that will include value chain-related organisations along with states and local governments. NASSI will, through this partnership, adequately address the issues and factors that militate against the growth of SMEIs and work out positive and workable frameworks that will {{once and for all}} ensure the growth of SMEIs. Government can not create jobs in a sustainable way. There is need to boost production and ensure that small-scale industries contribute 90 to 95 per cent to GDP. That is why I ask you, can government actually create jobs? To this particular question, <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> is no! And I speak as an expert on this matter. The other sustainable way I know is to create a powerful private sector-driven entrepreneurial base, propelled and predicated on small and medium scale industries and the informal sector." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As {{far as the}} {{expression}} 'Failure is not an option,' you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on 'What are the people in Mission Control really like?' One of their questions was 'Weren't there times when everybody, {{or at least a}} few people, just panicked?' <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> was 'No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.' I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, 'That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now we just have to figure out who to have say it.' Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history." ...|$|E
60|$|Placing {{the paper}} upon his knees, he wrote me the {{following}} lines, which together with <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> I preserve by me, for their rarity, {{to this very}} day, and which I have transcribed word for word, as they form a little series of dialogue.|$|R
5000|$|... "Undoubtedly the {{conclusions}} which I have reached {{as a result}} of my investigations. Two questions are raised in this book: (1) Who were the Shudras? and (2) How they came to be the fourth Varna of the Indo-Aryan society? <b>My</b> <b>answers</b> to them are summarised below.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will excuse <b>my</b> <b>answering</b> that question, sir," [...] said Morton; [...] "the same cogent reasons which induced me {{to afford}} him {{hospitality}} {{at considerable risk}} to myself and my friends, would command me to respect his secret, if, indeed, he had trusted me with any." ...|$|R
