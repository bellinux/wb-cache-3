Indeed, in these cases, the joule effect due to fretting voltage increases, leading to heat the contact zone with some consequences like increasing oxidation, or softening Sn coating. Furthermore, higher voltage (up to 14 V), induces large voltage fluctuations and subsequent arcing occurrence are observed.
