[...] However, he {{believed that}} radio programming should be based upon what listeners in the mass wanted to hear, and not upon what some central authority (such as the BBC in the English model) {{thought they would be}} best off hearing.|$|E
500|$|After {{being dropped}} from Epic Records {{shortly after the}} reissued edition of Apartment Life (1997), Ivy began {{recording}} new material for their upcoming studio album. However, the recording process halted after a fire closed down the New York City studio where they regularly recorded. While writing songs for Long Distance, Andy Chase stated that they tried writing [...] "more commercial" [...] material for the album, in hopes that it would [...] "mean the difference between <b>making</b> <b>our</b> next album or not".|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Breyer {{released}} a second book, <b>Making</b> <b>Our</b> Democracy Work: A Judge's View. [...] There, Breyer argued that judges have six tools {{they can use}} to determine a legal provision's proper meaning: (1) its text; (2) its historical context; (3) precedent; (4) tradition; (5) its purpose; and (6) the consequences of potential interpretations. [...] Textualists, like Scalia, only feel comfortable using the first four of these tools; while pragmatists, like Breyer, believe that [...] "purpose" [...] and [...] "consequences" [...] are particularly important interpretative tools.|$|E

[...] He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was peculiar for the United States {{that it was a}} [...] "harmonious" [...] benefit for the country. Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country, and urged immigrants to reject [...] "race hatreds" [...] and [...] "prejudices".|$|E

In a 2011 {{interview}} with Magnet, Chase stated that while writing [...] "Edge of the Ocean", they tried [...] "to go 100 percent" [...] with creating a lyrical balance that [...] " [...] from a specific place and yet remain general, even vague, enough that they can apply to anyone". In a previous interview with Spinzone, Chase and Durand said that they hoped that [...] "Edge of the Ocean" [...] would prove commercial enough to [...] "mean the difference between <b>making</b> <b>our</b> next album or not".|$|E

500|$|Four {{days before}} the race, the September 11 attacks took place, causing most major American {{sporting}} events scheduled on the same weekend as the German 500 to be postponed, including National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB) games, and a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race, the New Hampshire 300, at New Hampshire Motor Speedway. The Italian Grand Prix, a Formula One race, was held that weekend. According to Ronald Richards, {{the vice president of}} CART, the series decided to continue with the race prior to the cancellation of that week's NFL games, a decision followed by other American leagues. Richards acknowledged that [...] "We wish we would have had the input regarding the NFL's decision prior to <b>making</b> <b>our</b> decision." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done {{a pretty good job of}} <b>making</b> <b>our</b> show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{stresses}} Delius's {{role as an}} innovator: [...] "The best of Delius {{is undoubtedly}} {{to be found in}} those works where he disregarded classical traditions and created his own forms". Fenby echoes this: [...] "the people who really count are those who discover new ways of <b>making</b> <b>our</b> lives more beautiful. Frederick Delius was such a man". [...] Palmer writes that Delius's true legacy is the ability of his music to inspire the creative urge in its listeners and to enhance their awareness of the wonders of life. Palmer concludes by invoking George Eliot's poem The Choir Invisible: [...] "Frederick Delius... belongs to the company of those true artists for whose life and work the world is a better place to live in, and of whom surely is composed, in a literal sense, 'the choir invisible/Whose music is the gladness of the world'".|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Ingels {{released}} a video entitled [...] {{as part of}} the Future of StoryTelling summit, which introduced his concept of creating architecture that focuses on turning [...] "surreal dreams into inhabitable space". Citing the power of alternate reality programs and video games, like Minecraft, Ingels' 'worldcraft' is an extension of 'hedonistic sustainability' and further develops ideas established in his first book, Yes Is More. In the video (and essay by the same name in his second book, Hot to Cold: An Odyssey of Architectural Adaptation) Ingels notes: [...] "These fictional worlds empower people with the tools to transform their own environments. This is what architecture ought to be..." [...] "Architecture must become Worldcraft, the craft of <b>making</b> <b>our</b> world, where our knowledge and technology doesn't limit us but rather enables us to turn surreal dreams into inhabitable space. To turn fiction into fact." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Schlesinger, Ivy then {{signed with}} Nettwerk because [...] "their roster {{was similar to}} Ivy across the board". After being {{released}} prematurely in Japan on November 8, 2000, the album was a quick success. Nettwerk's head of marketing, Marie Scheibert, stated that Long Distance became one of Amazon.com's top imports. The album was released in the United States on July 10, 2001, eight months later. During recording sessions, Durand, Schlesinger and fellow band member Andy Chase decided [...] "to go one hundred percent" [...] {{on one of the}} tracks, which would later become [...] "Edge of the Ocean". Ivy stated that the song, which would later be released as the album's third single, was created in hopes that it would [...] "mean the difference between <b>making</b> <b>our</b> next album or not". Along with [...] "Edge of the Ocean", the trio started writing songs that were [...] "less atmospheric" [...] than those on Apartment Life, but contained more [...] "infectious melodies", which the band preferred.|$|E
500|$|The {{establishment}} of the plan was received positively by many Canadian NGOs and law enforcement officials. Within a day of its establishment, the plan had received support from the parents of human trafficking victims.

[...] Around the same time, the EFC voiced its support for the plan, specifically praising the commitments to create a national human trafficking law enforcement taskforce, to raise awareness, to invest in prevention, to care for victims, and to consult with stakeholders on an ongoing basis. The EFC's policy analyst Julia Beazley said that the organization was [...] "particularly pleased with the proposals aimed at combatting sexual exploitation, and with the focus given to our Aboriginal communities, which are particularly vulnerable to trafficking." ...|$|E

500|$|Breyer wrote separately, {{concerned}} that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from Ginsberg and Miller. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: [...] "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with {{an image of a}} nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?" [...] Breyer further argued that [...] "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," [...] believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to [...] "raise future generations committed cooperatively to <b>making</b> <b>our</b> system of government work," [...] and that [...] "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression." [...] Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 Federal Trade Commission study.|$|E
500|$|In her review, Petit of GameSpot {{felt there}} were misogynistic {{undertones}} {{in the treatment}} of women as [...] "strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humourless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists", and that the satirical representation of misogyny legitimises it. Her review was met with backlash as users responded with 20,000 largely negative comments on the webpage and a Change.org petition for her firing. Petit's comments and the backlash against them prompted a wider discussion about {{the role of women in}} Grand Theft Auto V and the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Helen Lewis of The Guardian felt Petit's observations were valid, but were stigmatised by gamers who have become [...] "hyper-sensitive to criticism". Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph felt that the backlash against Petit was predicated on an audience that has become accustomed to women being [...] "shallow and sidelined" [...] in the game. Rob Fahey of GamesIndustry.biz felt that debate about games' thematic concerns could become stigmatised if gamers opposed criticism, writing, [...] "This isn't just about women—it's robbing every single one of us of the opportunity to have intelligent, interesting discussions about how our medium deals with..... complex topics..... It's frustrating, it's stupid, and it's downright boring—and it risks <b>making</b> <b>our</b> games stupid and boring too". Journalist Tom Bissell agreed with Petit's [...] "defensible position", and wrote that gamers respond to game criticism more aggressively than fans of other entertainment mediums. Over a year after publication of her review, Petit stated in her personal blog that the [...] "average straight male player" [...] opposes sociopolitical criticism of video games because Grand Theft Auto Vs satire reinforces their own worldview and [...] "political agenda". She stated that the prominence of [...] "straight white men" [...] in online forums marginalises women, different ethnic groups and the LGBT community, and that those who attack video game criticism should [...] "put themselves in the shoes of people different from themselves".|$|E
