5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view the Pleiades through a telescope. He thereby discovered that the cluster contains <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> too dim {{to be seen with}} the naked eye. He published his observations, including a sketch of the Pleiades showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains <b>many</b> <b>stars,</b> deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.|$|E
5|$|Mario Party 4 {{features}} eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Princess Daisy and Waluigi {{from the}} Mario series, {{who can be}} directed as characters on six themed game boards in the game. The objective {{of the game is}} to earn as <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> as possible, which are obtained by purchase from a single predefined space on the game board. Each character's movement is determined by a roll of a die, with a roll from each player forming a single turn. Each turn in Mario Party 4 is followed by a minigame in which characters compete for coins they can use to purchase items and stars.|$|E

5|$|The {{luminosity}} {{of a star}} is {{the amount}} of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. <b>Many</b> <b>stars</b> do not radiate uniformly across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, for example, has a higher energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.|$|E
5|$|As the club's {{fortunes}} declined, {{they found}} themselves unable to attract <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> (Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception), while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs. Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958–59 and fifth in both 1955–56 and 1956–57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951–52, Arsenal would not get beyond the quarter-finals again until 1970–71. To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.|$|E
5|$|M34 is an {{open cluster}} that appears at {{magnitude}} 5.5, and is approximately 1,500 light-years from Earth. It contains about 100 stars scattered over a field of view larger {{than that of the}} full moon. M34 can be resolved with good eyesight but is best viewed using a telescope at low magnifications. IC 348 is a somewhat young open cluster that is still contained within the nebula from which its stars formed. It is located about 1,027 light-years from Earth, is about 2 million years old, and contains <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> with circumstellar disks. Many brown dwarfs have been discovered in this cluster due to its age; since brown dwarfs cool as they age, it is easier to find them in younger clusters.|$|E

5|$|Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic {{names to}} <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> {{that are still}} used today and they invented {{numerous}} astronomical instruments that could compute {{the positions of the}} stars. They built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing Zij star catalogues. Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy). According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and also gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{frustrating}} for the midfielder, who was sidelined {{for two months}} by knee and head injuries and first considered retirement in April 2005. Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006, the titles were revoked after the Calciopoli match fixing scandal. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Juventus' relegation from Serie A despite its first-place finish, <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> (such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram) left the club and the remaining players' future was uncertain. After the 2006 World Cup, Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A, citing {{his family and his}} commitment to the club as reasons for his decision. He received a five-match ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006, and repeated his threat to retire. However, he remained with the club {{until the end of the}} season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006–07 Serie B.|$|E
5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the gate {{at the end of}} each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate, they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found, as well as how <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars. Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world.|$|E

5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to {{thermonuclear}} fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of <b>many</b> <b>stars</b> against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
