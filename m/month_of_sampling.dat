Design: Cross-sectional data of Belgian participants of the EU 6 th Framework Programme IDEFICS (Identification and Prevention of Dietary- and Lifestyle-Induced Health Effects in Children and Infants) Study. Setting: 25 -Hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) was measured using RIA. Vitamin D status was categorized as deficient (= 75 nmol/ 1). Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, waist and hip circumferences and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses. Subjects: Children (n 357) aged 4 - 11 years. Results: Serum 25 (OH) D) ranged from 13. 6 to 123. 5 nmol/ 1 (mean 47. 2 (SD 14. 6) nmol/ 1); with 5 % deficient, 53 % insufficient, 40 % sufficient and 2 % optimal.

An inverse relationship between coal rank and free radical intensities in PM emissions was observed, which was in contrast with the pattern of radical intensities in the source coals. The strong correlation between intensities of free radical and elemental carbon in PM emissions suggests that the radical species may be carbon-centered. The increased g-factors, 2. 0029 - 2. 0039, over that of purely carbon-centered radicals may indicate the presence of vicinal oxygen heteroatom.

40|$|Kale {{production}} in Kenya is being hindered by declining soil fertility among other factors. A study {{was done on}} ways of improving soil fertility, quality and yield of kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) in Kabete - Kenya, through use of farmyard manure and Minjingu rock phosphate with integration of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and white lupin (Lupinus albus cv. Amiga) either as an intercrop or in rotation. The study was carried out for two seasons during the long rains of 2014 and short rains of 2014. Experimental layout was a Randomized Complete Block Design with a split plot arrangement replicated thrice. The main plots were cropping systems; (Crop rotation, Monocropping and intercropping). The split plots were organic fertilizers (Farmyard Manure and Minjingu rock phosphate) whereas the test crop was kale. Soil organic carbon, N, P, and mineral N were tested at an interval of 1, 2 and 3 months of kale development. Kale N, P, K and yield were measured at an interval of 1, 2 and 3 months on kale leaves. The determination of nitrogen fixed by legumes under different organic fertilizers and cropping systems was done using the extended difference method where wheat was sown as a reference crop and sampling done at the late pod fill stage of the legumes. As part of the study, once the legumes were harvested, they were put in litterbags incorporated into soil for determination of their decomposition and mineralization rates. The study was done to address the asynchrony of nutrients between legume nutrient release and kale nutrient uptake. The decomposition and mineralization rate of the legumes was done by taking weights after every retrieval and chemical analysis done in the laboratory at an interval of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 days. The decay formula was adopted (y =y 0 *e-kt) for determining the rate of decomposition and mineralization. The half life’s for the legumes was determined (time when half of the nutrients are released) by calculating using t 1 / 2 =In (2) /k. The cropping system white lupine-kale rotation (FYM) (0. 59 %) significantly increased the amounts of soil available nitrogen in the 1 st season. Soil available phosphorus was significantly higher in white lupine/kale intercrop (MRP) (21. 83 ppm) at the 3 rd <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> Mineral nitrogen was significantly highest where white lupine-kale rotation (FYM) at the 3 rd <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> During the short rain season, {{there was a significant}} (P≤ 0. 05) increase in the level of organic carbon under white lupine-kale rotation (FYM) (3. 16 %).

Phosphorus concentrations during season one was increased in the order, monocrop (FYM, MRP and Control) (50 ppm, 63 ppm and 47 ppm); chickpea/kale and lupin/kale intercrop (FYM, MRP and control), the same trend was recorded in season two where, chickpea-kale rotation(FYM, MRP and control); white lupine-kale rotation(FYM, MRP and Control). There was a significant (P≤ 0. 05) effect of cropping systems with organic fertilizers where, white lupine-kale rotation (FYM) (3. 68 t/ha). Number of nodules was significantly affected by application of organic fertilizers in the different cropping systems, white lupine-kale rotation (Control (32); white lupine/kale intercrop (Control) (31) and the chickpea/kale intercrop (MRP) (27). Lupin significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) higher amounts of N 2 (62 - 86. 13 kgha- 1) as compared to chickpea (50. 4 - 82. 16 kgha - 1) in both seasons with significantly higher amounts fixed in white lupine/kale intercrop (FYM, MRP and CNTRL), chickpea/kale intercrop (FYM, MRP and CNTRL). White lupin-kale rotation (CNTRL, FYM) (3076. 8 kgha- 1, 2348. 9 kgha- 1) yield was higher as compared to white lupine/kale intercrop (MRP) (1798. 44 kgha- 1), chickpea had significant high yields chickpea-kale rotation (MRP, FYM) (1024 kgha- 1, 845 kgha- 1) in season one whereas in the second season, white lupine/kale intercrop (CNTRL, FYM and MRP) (3324. 5 kgha- 1, 2346. 9 kgha- 1 and 1987. 3 kgha- 1); Chickpea/kale intercrop (MRP, FYM) (1287 kgha- 1 and 768 kgha- 1) had significant higher yields more than those of season one. The fresh weights (tha- 1) across treatments and cropping systems increased, white lupine-kale rotation (CNTRL, FYM, MRP) (15. 37 tha- 1, 13. 53 tha- 1 and 13. 13 tha- 1), chickpea-kale rotation (MRP, FYM and CNTRL) (9. 31 tha- 1, 6. 05 tha- 1 and 6 tha- 1) while intercrops recorded lower biomass during both seasons. The lowest green matter content was recorded under white lupine/kale intercrop (FYM) (2. 01 tha- 1). For the decomposition and mineralization of legume residues, weights dropped after every retrieval and chemical compositions of the residues also declined with time. After 120 days of incubation, the white lupin had. 24 % of N, 16 %P, 16 % K of the initial weight, whereas for chickpea was 19 % N 15 % P and 9 % K. A 50 % in weight loss of the legumes was found after 9 days of incorporation in the soils for the two legumes. A 50 % loss in N, P and K release of the legume residues was found at day 18 (N) 23 (P) and 11 (K) for chickpea and day 14 (N), 11 (K) and 25 (P) for white lupin. Use of organic methods for enhanced soil fertility and improved kale quality and yield, can always be achieved by the small scale farmers. Integration of legumes (lupine) in a kale production systems and use of organic fertilizers (farm yard manure) led to increased yields of kale an improvement in the nutrient status of the kales. Application of organic fertilizers is a better solution for improved soil nutrients. Use of MRP with a lupin as an intercrop, more nitrogen was fixed as compared to chickpea. Determination of the mineralization rates of chickpea and lupine residues shows the farmer’s adequate time for application of the residues for maximum synchrony between nutrient release and nutrient uptake...|$|E

Based on this we investigated seasonal variation in serum BDNF concentrations in 2, 851 persons {{who took part in}} the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). Analyses by <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> (monthly n’s. 196) showed pronounced seasonal variation in serum BDNF concentrations (P,. 0001) with increasing concentrations in the spring-summer period (standardized regression weight (ß) = 0. 19, P,. 0001) and decreasing concentrations in the autumn-winter period (ß = 20. 17, P,. 0001). Effect sizes [Cohen’s d] ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 66 for monthly significant differences. We found similar seasonal variation for both sexes and for persons with a DSM-IV depression diagnosis and healthy control subjects. In explorative analyses we found that the number of sunshine hours (a major trigger to entrain seasonality) in the week of blood withdrawal and the 10 weeks prior to this event positively correlated with serum BDNF concentrations (Pearson’s correlation coefficients ranged: 0. 05 – 0. 18) and this could partly explain the observed monthly variation. These results provide strong evidence that serum BDNF concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of acetone, dettol, ethyl acetate, ethyl alcohol, phenyl and methanol against bacterial contaminants in H. armigera {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (NPV) was evaluated. All the preservatives reduced bacterial contamination and the associated bad odour problem during storage.

40|$|Abstract: The rep-PCR {{fingerprinting}} method, {{with the}} support of ERIC and REP primers, was used to analyse the genomic diversity of 93 E. coli strains isolated from lake water samples drawn at two different depths. The applied UPGMA for DNA analysis did not reveale any genomic similarities between the 48 E. coli strains derived from the subsurface-zone water and the 43 of the bottom-zone water. The considerable genomic diversity of the E. coli of the surface zone was expressed as a dendrogram in the form of 8 similarity groups comprising strains isolated from samples drawn over one month. The bottomzone strains, which display a lesser degree of genomic diversity (5 similarity groups), showed distinct common features in their DNA fingerprints. In the similarity dendrogram for the bottom-zone, strains derived in different <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> were segregated into the same similarity groups. Applying REP primers in rep-PCR generates more complex fingerprints increasing the discriminatory power of the analysis, whereas the ERIC primer generates less complex fingerprint patterns, and is thus clearer to interpret.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} some {{preliminary}} fossil specimens are presented. They represent a collection sampled by Belo Monte’s Programa de Salvamento do Patrimônio Paleontológico (PSPP), which includes unprecedented invertebrate fauna and fossil vertebrates from Pitinga, Jatapu, Manacapuru, Maecuru e Alter do Chão formations from Amazonas basin, Brazil. The Belo Monte paleontological salvage {{was able to}} recover 495 microfossil samples and 1744 macrofossil <b>samples</b> on 30 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> activities, {{and it is still}} ongoing. The macrofossils identified are possible plant remains, ichnofossils, graptolites, brachiopods, molluscs, athropods, Agnatha, palynomorphs (miosphores, acritarchs, algae cysts, fungi spores and unidentified types) and unidentified fossils. However, deep scientific research {{is not part of the}} scope of the program, and this collection must be further studied by researchers who visit Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, where the fossils will be housed. More material will be collected until the end of the program. The collection sampled allows a mosaic composition with the necessary elements to assign, in later papers, taxonomic features which may lead to accurate species identification and palaeoenvironmental interpretations...|$|R
40|$|Scalloped perchlet, Ambassis nalua, {{is one of}} fishes in Pabean Bay, Indramayu. This {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the reproductive aspects of Ambassis nalua in Pabean Bay Indramayu including sex ratio, spawning season, first maturity, fecundity and spawning pattern. Fish samples were collected by trap net and trammel net at three sites in Pabean Bay from April to October 2015. A total of 424 of A. nalua were caught, consist of 114 males and 310 females; with total length ranged from 38. 04 to 112. 63 mm and total weight ranged from 0. 37 to 25. 44 g. Sex ratio of mature fish was 1 : 1. 9. The mature males and females were found in every <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> period. The gonado-somatic index (GSI) ranged from 0. 40 to 0. 83 and 2. 36 to 4. 54 {{for male and female}}, respectively. The peak of spawning season was found in September. The first maturity (Lm 50) for male and female were 79. 17 mm and 91. 25 mm, respectively. The fecundity varied from 3, 451 – 32, 465 eggs. Egg diameter distribution shows that spawning pattern of A. nalua was batch spawner...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} plasma vitamin D and cross-linked C-telopeptides of type I (CTx-I) and type II (CTx-II) collagen concentrations in males with lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration (IVD) compared to healthy controls. Improved knowledge might suggest {{to optimize the}} vitamin D status of IVD patients and contribute to clarify mechanisms of cartilage degradation. Methods: 79 Italian males with lumbar IVD assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 79 age, sex and BMI-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Plasma 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D), CTx-I and CTx-II were measured by immunoassays. Circannual seasonality, correlation between biomarkers concentrations and clinical variables were assessed. Results: overall subjects 25 (OH) D and CTx-II showed month rhythmicity with acrophase in August/September and October/November, and nadir in February/March and April/May, respectively. An inverse correlation between 25 (OH) D and CTx-I, and a direct correlation between CTx-II and CTx-I were observed. IVD patients, particularly with osteochondrosis, showed higher CTx-II than healthy controls. Conclusions: <b>Month</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> may affect plasma 25 (OH) D and CTx-II concentrations. The correlation between CTx-I and CTx-II suggests an interplay between the osteo-cartilaginous endplate and the fibro-cartilaginous disc. The {{results of this study}} highlighted that osteochondrosis associates with increased cartilaginous catabolism. Vitamin D supplementation seems more necessary in winter for lumbar IVD patients...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} years, healthy food has gained {{interest}} among consumers, {{especially with regard}} to the fat content of livestock products which has been associated to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Individual milk samples (n = 12, 624) of 2, 977 Holstein-Friesian (HF), Brown Swiss (BS) and Simmental (SI) cows from 39 multibreed herds were analyzed for fat content, protein content, casein content and somatic cell count using mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS). Daily milk yield was also recorded. Groups of fatty acids (FA), expressed as percentage of milk fat, were predicted by MIRS: they were saturated (SFA), unsaturated (UFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) FA. Data were analyzed with a linear mixed model including the fi xed eff ects of <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling,</b> parity, days in milk (DIM), herd, breed, and interactions between parity and breed, and DIM and breed. Th e random eff ects were cow nested within breed and residual. Milk of HF cows exhibited the lowest percentage of SFA (70. 45 %) and the highest of UFA (31. 20 %), and milk of SI cows was intermediate between that of HF and BS breeds for all groups of FA. Th e values of groups of FA across DIM were similar for the diff erent breeds. Results fro...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} water sampler {{was established}} in 2000 on the main stem of the White River at the Wyman Road Bridge. The Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) was approved by EPA Region six on April 2000 and sampling was begun at that time. This station is coordinated with a USGS gauging station at the same location. This station was instrumented to collect samples at sufficient intervals across the hydrograph to accurately estimate the flux of total suspended solids, nitrogen and phosphorus into {{the upper end of}} Beaver Lake from the White River. The Upper White was designated as the states highest priority watershed in the 1999 Unified Watershed Assessment. Accurate determination of stream nutrients and sediment is critical for future determinations of TMDLs, effectiveness of best management practices and trends in water quality. The Wyman Bridge was torn down for reconstruction in early 2002. For this reason, sampling was discontinued at the end of 2001 after 21 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> collection. This report details the sampling and results for that period of time...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the {{temporal and spatial}} variability of bacterial communities within a combined sewer system in England. Sampling was conducted over 9  months in a sewer system with intensive monitoring of hydraulic conditions. The bacterial communities were characterized by 16 S rRNA gene-targeted terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis. These data were related to the hydraulic data as well as the sample type, location, and time. Temporal and spatial variation was observed between and within wastewater communities and biofilm communities. The bacterial communities in biofilm were distinctly different from the communities in wastewater and exhibited greater spatial variation, while the wastewater communities exhibited variability between different <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> This study highlights the variation of bacterial communities between biofilm and wastewater, and has shown both spatial and temporal variations in bacterial communities in combined sewers. The temporal variation is of interest for in-sewer processes, for example, sewer odor generation, as field measurements for these processes are often carried out over short durations and may therefore not capture the influence of this temporal variation of the bacterial communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour of {{the endangered}} Australian skink (Liopholis slateri) was investigated through detailed observation of a subpopulation of lizards during seven <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> Slater’s skinks primarily exhibited ambush predation, darting from burrow entrances to distances of up to 4 m with a success rate of ~ 70 %. The direction of darting was often straight ahead and almost always in an 180 ° arc {{in front of the}} burrow entrance. Juveniles foraged more frequently and further from burrows than adults. Ants were the most common prey item taken and juveniles targeted small ants as prey more often than adults and often moved further to capture these prey. The spread of introduced buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) in central Australia in recent decades is a possible contributing factor to the decline of L. slateri. A wide field of view appears to be critical for the success of the sit-and-wait foraging strategy employed by the skinks and additional research is required to determine whether further encroachment of buffel grass around burrow systems will impede visibility and directly affect foraging behaviour of these skinks...|$|R
