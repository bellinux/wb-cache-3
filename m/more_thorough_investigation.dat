25|$|In 1910, the {{decision}} was made to do a second Court of Inquiry. The reasons for this were the recovery of the bodies of the victims, so they could be buried in the United States and also a desire for a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>investigation.</b> The fact that the Cuban government wanted the wreck removed from Havana Harbor might also have played a role: it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898, while simultaneously obliging the Cubans. Wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the pending risk of war, which had been the case in 1898, lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously. Moreover, since several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers, they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than the line officers of the 1898 board had been.|$|E

The essay had only received 390 points out of a possible 1000, and Burke contended that it had been scored improperly. He was well within his rights to contest the score; however, Gerhard Fischer, President of Wisconsin Academic Decathlon, said that the way Burke handled the appeal was [...] "highly questionable" [...] and inflammatory. Though Burke was reprimanded, parents of Catholic Memorial students believed the punishment, a three-year suspension for Burke and a one-year suspension for Catholic Memorial, was due to personality differences between Burke and Wisconsin Academic Decathlon officials. The controversy eventually led to a <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>investigation</b> of previous issues involving Burke.

40|$|International audienceMajor {{issues in}} Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) include low {{usability}} and poor user performance. This paper tackles them by ensuring the users {{to be in}} a state of immersion, control and motivation, called state of flow. Indeed, in various disciplines, being in the state of flow was shown to improve performances and learning. Hence, we intended to draw BCI users in a flow state to improve both their subjective experience and their performances. In a Motor Imagery BCI game, we manipulated flow in two ways: 1) by adapting the task difficulty and 2) by using background music. Results showed that the difficulty adaptation induced a higher flow state, however music had no effect. There was a positive correlation between subjective flow scores and offline performance, although the flow factors had no effect (adaptation) or negative effect (music) on online performance. Overall, favouring the flow state seems a promising approach for enhancing users’ satisfaction, although its complexity requires <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>investigations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Hans Morgenthau's {{concept of}} power is widely debated among {{scholars}} of International Relations. Superficial accounts present Morgenthau's concept {{of power in the}} Hobbesian tradition as a means of self-preservation; however, <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>investigations</b> demonstrate Morgenthau's psychogenic and praxeological understanding. By referring to Sigmund Freud and Max Weber, such accounts identify Morgenthauian power as the ability to dominate others. This article contributes to this discourse by demonstrating that Morgenthau separated power into two dualistic conceptualisations. Although analytically Morgenthau worked with a concept of power understood as domination, normatively – in reference to Friedrich Nietzsche and Hannah Arendt – he promoted a concept of power that focused on the will and ability to act together. Elaborating this dualistic concept has wider implications for current International Relations because it reminds scholars to be self-reflexive. In addition, it is argued that a Morgenthauian scholarship helps scholars to gain a more profound understanding of depoliticising tendencies in Western democracies...|$|R
40|$|In this report, {{two cases}} {{of death in}} {{patients}} diagnosed with multi-systemic AA amyloidosis at autopsy were investigated for any medical errors that {{may have contributed to}} their deaths. The patients developed nephrotic syndrome post-operatively and following trauma. The second patient had been on hemodialysis for idiopathic kidney disease prior to the trauma she sustained. Complete autopsies with immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were used to show the extracellular deposits of amyloid in the kidneys and also in other organs, including the heart. Cardiac involvement for this type of amyloidosis has never been reported in the literature. Post-mortem analysis showed multi-systemic AA amyloidosis as the cause of nephrotic syndrome, and ultimately the cause of worsening clinical outcomes, for the two patients. A comprehensive histopathological study led to a peculiar organ-specific observation of AA amyloidosis, which requires <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>investigations</b> by clinicians and must be considered in the evaluation by forensic pathologists in cases of professional liability...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a reformulation strategy for solving multidimensional Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). This strategy operates by iteratively considering, in isolation, {{each one of}} the uni-dimensional constraints in the problem, and exploits the approximate symmetries induced by the selected constraint on the domains in order to enforce this constraint on the simplified problem. We use the game of SET, a combinatorial card game, as a toy problem to motivate our strategy and to explain and illustrate its operation. However, we believe that our approach is applicable to more complex domains of scientific and industrial importance, and deserves <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>investigations</b> in the future. Our approach sheds a new light on the dynamic reformulation of multidimensional CSPs. Importantly, it advocates that modeling tools for Constraint Programming should allow the user to specify the constraints directly on the attributes of the domain objects (i. e., variables and values) so that their multi-dimensionality can be exploited during problem solving...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study by Ginther et al., the {{probability}} of receiving a U. S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) RO 1 award was related to the applicant's race/ethnicity.

For this we conducted a small-scaled formative user study with nine participants to fundamentally assess users' acceptance and the qualification of these freehand gestures for pan-and-zoom operations. As a result, a simple forward and backward hand movement for zooming and a joystick metaphor for panning yielded in the best overall results. Especially the seamless integration of continuous pan and zoom was positively highlighted by participants. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To {{highlight}} two often forgotten nasal functions, olfaction and nasal {{nitric oxide}} production, which have both received more attention {{over the last}} two decades with consequent findings that are now entering the routine clinical setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Olfactory measurements have been optimized and normative data are available, giving clinicians the possibility of testing olfactory function quickly within a patient's workup. The results can lead to <b>more</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>investigations</b> if necessary. Olfactory disorders concern more than just a few people, and these disorders can be a very early sign of Parkinson's disease. Nasal nitric oxide is hypothesized to play a role as an airborne messenger and as an antiinfectious agent in the nose and sinuses and to contribute to the mucociliary clearance. Evidence is growing that the nasal nitric oxide level is a good parameter for diagnosis of ciliary beat impairments and a suitable parameter to monitor treatment success in chronic rhinosinusitis.

40|$|As {{a result}} of a number of large multiwavelength {{monitoring}} campaigns that have taken place since the late 1980 s, there are now several very large data sets on bright variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that are well-sampled in time and can be used to probe the physics of the AGN continuum source and the broad-line emitting region. Most of these data sets have been underutilized, as the emphasis thus far has been primarily on reverberation-mapping issues alone. Broader attempts at analysis have been made on some of the earlier IUE data sets (e. g., data from the 1989 campaign on NGC 5 548), but much of this analysis needs to be revisited now that improved versions of the data are now available from final archive processing.

40|$|Following {{a review}} of {{previous}} studies on diphthongs and coarticulation, evidence is presented showing radical differences between Japanese and English in the temporal properties of vowel sequences which are not adequately accounted for by conventional views of vowel-to-vowel coarticulation. It is hypothesized that these differences are related to language-specific differences in timing which may be partly prosodic in nature. Why and how such differences come about are issues which are discussed, but firm conclusions must await more exhaustive empirical findings and more detailed studies of the respective vocalic and prosodic systems. Two studies are reported. These attempt to clarify the issues using(l) spectrography to measure actual Japanese and English diphthongs, and (2) speech synthesis to test perception. One interesting result was that Japanese listeners tolerated faster VV transitions than English listeners. There are implications for our understanding of coarticulation and prosody, especially concerning mora and non-mora timing, and also for the teaching of English in Japan.
