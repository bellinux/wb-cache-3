40|$|A {{substantial}} {{minority of}} restaurant guests {{would be willing}} to pay separately for <b>a</b> restaurant <b>reservation,</b> while <b>a</b> much larger group is not supportive of this approach, according to an online survey of 297 U. S. residents. Those respondents who are most likely to accept the idea of paying for <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> represent customers who are also relatively familiar with this practice. The survey respondents were reacting to three possible scenarios for unbundling the value of the reservation from that of the meal itself. Based in part on actual industry practice, the three scenarios are (1) <b>a</b> <b>reservations</b> company charges for <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> but does not share the proceeds with the restaurant; (2) <b>a</b> <b>reservations</b> company charges for <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> and shares the revenue with the restaurant; and (3) the restaurant charges <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> fee without involving a third party. For revenue management purposes, familiarity with the unbundling practice is related to guest acceptance of that practice. Since numerous companies now sell prime restaurant <b>reservations</b> as <b>a</b> separate product, it seems likely that over time the guests’ familiarity with paying for at least some reservations will grow, along with their acceptance of the practice...|$|R

In depth data was collected through semi-structured interviews, observations, documentation, and most importantly a survey administered on the chain’s website with respondents in the process of making a booking. The findings indicate that the price paid for a room has a direct and positive effect on behavioral intentions of customers who have successfully made a booking. However, customers who declined <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> offer or were denied <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> request because of the quoted price, displayed negative behavioral intentions. N/A 22 p.

50|$|In effect, <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> {{allows the}} state to be {{a party to the}} treaty, while {{excluding}} the legal effect of that specific provision in the treaty to which it objects.States cannot take reservations after they have accepted the treaty; <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> must be made {{at the time that the}} treaty affects the State. The Vienna Convention did not create the concept of reservations but codified existing customary law. Thus even States that have not formally acceded to the Vienna Convention act as if they had. <b>As</b> <b>reservations</b> are defined under the Vienna Convention and interpretative declarations are not, the two are sometimes difficult to discern from each other. Unlike <b>a</b> <b>reservation,</b> <b>a</b> declaration is not meant to affect the State's legal obligations but is attached to State's consent to a treaty to explain or interpret what the State deems unclear.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} the Internet, the flexibility of IP, and the wide deployment of IP technologies, {{as well as the}} growth of mobile communications have driven the development of IP-based solutions for wireless networking. The introduction of IP-based transport in Radio Access Networks (RANs) is one of these networking solutions. When compared to traditional IP networks, an IP-based RAN has specific characteristics, due to which, for satisfactory transport functionality, it imposes strict requirements on resource management schemes. In this paper we present the Resource Management in DiffServ (RMD) framework, which extends the DiffServ architecture with new admission control and resource reservation concepts, such that the resource management requirements of an IP-based RAN are met. This framework aims at simplicity, low-cost, and easy implementation, along with good scaling properties. The RMD framework defines two architectural concepts: the Per Hop Reservation (PHR) and the Per Domain <b>Reservation</b> (PDR). <b>As</b> part of the RMD framework a new protocol, the RMD On DemAnd (RODA) Per Hop Reservation (PHR) protocol will be introduced. A key characteristic of the RODA PHR is that it <b>maintains</b> only <b>a</b> single <b>reservation</b> state per PHB in the interior routers of a DiffServ domain, regardless of the number of flows passing through...|$|R
