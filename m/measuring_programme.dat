40|$|Measuring the {{strength}} of public health programmes may reveal whether and how some programmes {{have an impact on}} target populations and others do not. Programme implementation strength (also known as programme intensity) refers to quantitative measure reflecting programme inputs, processes, and their duration. <b>Measuring</b> <b>programme</b> strength requires an understanding of how programmes work and involves defining measurable concepts, identifying sources of programme data and close programme follow-up. There are no standardized methods for <b>measuring</b> <b>programme</b> strength. This thesis developed and tested an approach for estimating programme strength for use in evaluating large-scale maternal health programmes in low- and middle-income countries. It used focused antenatal care (FANC) and emergency obstetric care (EmOC) as tracer programmes, with WHO’s health-system-building blocks as programme components. The thesis used mixed methods including: developing a weighting scheme through opinions from maternal health experts, collecting FANC and EmOC data from 23 districts on programme strength, programme coverage, and programme contextual factors, using government official statistics, and using routine data from a central database. The thesis also tested the content and face validity of the approach. Results from experts showed that, even though all six WHO blocks were required in programme implementation, human resources was given relatively higher weights than the other programme components. While the overall programme strength in districts scored an average of 41 % (FANC) and 40 % (EmOC), the overall programme coverage scored an average of 80 % (FANC) and 64 % (EmOC). Contextual factors significantly associated with the programmes included: total fertility rate, female literacy, water, sanitation, and famine. The content and face validity were both rated “very good”. This work aims to contribute towards an efficient way of evaluating large-scale maternal health programmes in low- and middle-income countries. The approach could also be of interest especially to district health management authorities for improving health programmes...|$|E

40|$|Carousels {{have been}} {{developed}} {{in an attempt to}} approach the in situ hydrodynamic conditions and to obtain arealistic simulation of the erosion and deposition processes of cohesive sediments. The main advantage of a carousel over straight flumes is that effects of inflow and outflow are absent and no circulation pumps are needed which would break up sediment flocs. Figure 1. 1 represents the flume, of the carousel type, in the Laboratory of Hydromechanics Delft University of Technology. The purpose of this guide is to contribute to carousel experiments on natural cohesive sediment in the Laboratory of Hydromechanics. The use of standardised international accepted methodologies is advocated herein, thereby following the ECMAST-I programme (1993), in order to make comparisons possible between present results and the results obtained at other institutes. Chapter 2 of this guide presents a short description of the characteristic properties of mud and their role in the erodibility of the mud. Some differences between the soil mechanical approach and the hydromechanical approach are explained. Chapter 3 briefly describes the carousel and the most important properties of flow structure in it. An operating strategy is provided, which minimizes undesirable secondary flow cells (Booij, 1994) and the minimum measuring frequency needed for calculating the Reynolds shear stress and the turbulence intensities.

40|$|Energy plants, {{cultivated}} on set-aside land, could substitute nearly 3 % of {{the primary}} energy in Germany and could raise the income of farmers. However, the substitution of fossil fuels by plants requires the selection of plant species with high site suitability, an ecologically benign farming system and high yields.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Undernutrition affects ∼ 165 million {{children}} globally and contributes up to 45 % of all child deaths. India {{has the highest}} proportion of global undernutrition-related morbidity and mortality. This protocol describes the planned economic evaluation of a community-based intervention to improve growth in children under 2  years of age in two rural districts of eastern India. The intervention is being evaluated through a cluster-randomised controlled trial (cRCT, the CARING trial). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis nested within a cRCT will be conducted from a societal perspective, <b>measuring</b> <b>programme,</b> provider, household and societal costs. Programme costs will be collected prospectively from project accounts using a standardised tool. These will be supplemented with time sheets and key informant interviews to inform the allocation of joint costs. Direct and indirect costs incurred by providers will be collected using key informant interviews and time use surveys. Direct and indirect household costs will be collected prospectively, using time use and consumption surveys. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated for the primary outcome measure, that is, cases of stunting prevented, and other outcomes such as cases of wasting prevented, cases of infant mortality averted, life years saved and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of results. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: There {{is a shortage of}} robust evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of strategies to improve early child growth. As this economic evaluation is nested within a large scale, cRCT, it will contribute to understanding the fiscal space for investment in early child growth, and the relative (in) efficiency of prioritising resources to this intervention over others to prevent stunting in this and other comparable contexts. The protocol has all necessary ethical approvals and the findings will be disseminated within academia and the wider policy sphere. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 51505201; pre-results...|$|E

Since the 1950s, the country had undergone a speedy industrialisation and became an industrial paradise in Asia.

40|$|The {{sediment}} transport {{of the highly}} regulated lower Ebro River is estimated {{on the basis of}} a <b>measuring</b> <b>programme</b> carried out between 2002 and 2004. Total {{sediment transport}}, including both suspended load and bedload, was measured upstream and downstream from the Mequinenza and Riba-roja reservoirs, with special attention to the transport during floods. Annual total load upstream from the dams is estimated at around 1. 64 ? 106 t, of which at least 99 % is transported in suspension. Annual total load downstream from the dams is estimated at around 0. 45 ? 106 t, of which 60 % is transported in suspension and the remaining 40 % as bedload (mean D 50 -bl in the range of 32 mm). Total load represents 3 % of what was transported at the beginning of the 20 th century in the delta plain. Sediment yield is three to four times lower below the dams, a fact that is caused by the trapping of sediment within the reservoirs (around 90 % in the case of suspended sediment and 100 % in the case of bedload). As a consequence, sediment that is transported downstream from the dams is all entrained from the riverbed and eroded from the banks. The sediment deficit causes a mean riverbed incision of 30 mm per year, as estimated from bedload measurements and by means of scour chains and painted pebbles located between the lowermost dam and the measuring section 28 km downstream. Since floods have been reduced on average by 25 % but sediment supply from upstream has been reduced to almost nothing, the river channel of the lower Ebro River will continue exporting sediment both during floods (N 2000 m 3 /s, mostly bedload) and frequent high flows (1000 m 3 /s to 2000 m 3 /s), making the incision progressive unless restoration steps are taken...|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{contains}} {{general information}} on formaldehyde concerning the current standards and guidelines, emissions, exposure levels and effect levels. The document {{is to be}} considered as a start for the national discussion during an exploratory meeting to determine whether evaluation at the level of an integrated criteria document is required. Formaldehyde is naturally produced as a degradation product of methane largely determining the background concentration at the global scale. Regionally and locally other sources are important: in the Netherlands the most important emission source to surface water is the chemical industry whereas to air the use as disinfectant (lifestock farming) and combustion processes (traffic) play an important role. Information on the occurrence of formaldehyde in the various environmental compartments is very limited, hampering a sound risk evaluation. Based on animal data formaldehyde {{is considered to be a}} carcinogen, causing tumours on the side of entry (nasal cavity). The threshold value is assumed to correspond with the threshold value for cytotoxic effects. For inhalatory exposure the recommendation of the Health Council is followed (95 and 98 percentile 24 hr average of 30 and 40 mug. m- 3, respectively). Based on model calculations these values may be exceeded in hundreds of streets on kerbsides and near building facades in inner cities due to traffic. Also in the indoor environment the limit values may be exceeded, probably largely as a result of indoor emission sources like smoking, and building and insulation materials. In contrast to this the risk of oral exposure through food and drinking water is considered negligible. The aquatic ecosystems may be at risk in the vicinity of the major point sources, whereas effects on vegetation alongside busy traffic roads can not be excluded. Taking into account the uncertainties in the exposure levels it is recommended to initiate a <b>measuring</b> <b>programme</b> to determine the exposure levels in outdoor air and water at strategic sites. Further the estimated emission figures on livestock farming need to be checked...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to typical building constructions, where the stress factors {{as well as}} building material characteristics are known, one can only estimate many of the parameters needed for static stability investigations in tunnel construction. Along with this {{is the fact that}} the resulting stress and the behaviour of the materials is dependent on time. Therefore the only possibility is, based on the results structured geotechnical measurements, to draw conclusions regarding the stability of the shotcrete outer shell and with that the combined outer/inner shell support system. For this investigation, the results of 1491 convergence cross-sectional measurements were taken from tunnel constructions of the northern section of the newly build DB line (German rail network) from Hannover to Wuerzburg. With the help of model calculations for an embedded circular girder, the utilization factor of the shotcrete outer shell can be determined. Subsequently using a continuum model, the support effect of the outer/inner shell support system was investigated. Taking into account the capacity of the outer shell at the time of installation of the inner shell results in a utilization factor for the combined outer/inner shell support system. The investigations lead to the conclusion that when dimensioning the inner shell of a two shell tunnel it is absolutely essential to consider the deformation of the outer shell as being dependent on time and thus, the strain on the shotcrete at the time of installation of the final construction be taken into account, in order to obtain evidence of the predicted support reserves of the combined outer/inner shell support system. Only with an inverse calculation of the actual measured vertical and horizontal deformations can the utilization of the outer shell be determined. In conclusion, recommendations for a <b>measuring</b> <b>programme</b> are given, setting the conditions for dimensioning of the inner shell using the above mentioned procedure. (orig.)
