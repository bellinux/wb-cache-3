25|$|A new train system, dubbed AeroTrain and {{developed}} by Mitsubishi, began in 2010 to transport passengers between the concourses {{and the main}} terminal. The system, which uses rubber tires and travels along a fixed underground guideway, {{is similar to the}} people mover systems at Singapore Changi Airport, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Denver International Airport. The train is intended to replace the mobile lounges, which many passengers found crowded and inconvenient. The initial phase includes the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>station,</b> a permanent Concourse A station, a permanent Concourse B station, a permanent midfield concourse station (with access to the current temporary C concourse via a tunnel with moving walkways), and a maintenance facility. Mobile lounges continue to service the D Concourse from both the main terminal and Concourse A. Even after AeroTrain is built out and the replacement Concourses C and D are built, the mobile lounges and plane mates will still continue to be used, to transport international arriving passengers to the International Arrivals Building, as well as transport passengers to aircraft parked on hardstands without direct access to jet bridges. Dulles has stated that the wait time for a train does not exceed four minutes, compared to the average 15-minute wait and travel time for mobile lounges.|$|E

50|$|The {{discovery}} of tin at Stanthorpe prompted {{the government to}} make surveys for extending the train line from Warwick to Stanthorpe in 1873.

In 1885 this second station became the <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>station</b> at Warwick and has remains so to this day. The extension of railway was opened on 3 May 3, 1881 at which time a platform and closets were erected. A shelter shed was erected on the site in 1882.|$|E

2500|$|The {{legacy of}} the Railway Mania can still be seen today, with {{duplication}} of some routes and cities possessing several stations on the same, or different lines - sometimes with no direct connection between them, although {{a significant amount of}} this duplication was removed by the Beeching Axe in the 1960s. [...] The best example of this is London, which has no fewer than twelve <b>main</b> line <b>terminal</b> <b>stations</b> serving its dense and complex suburban network - basically the result of the many competing railway companies during the Mania that were competing to run their routes in the capital.|$|R

50|$|The Dual Mode P32AC-DM {{is unique}} {{as it is}} {{equipped}} with GE's GEB15 AC (alternating current) traction motors, rather than DC (direct current) motors as used in the other subtypes. It is also only one of two modern American electro-diesel locomotives with third-rail capability, along with the EMD DM30AC operated by the Long Island Rail Road. The British Rail Class 73 and Class 74 also have this capability, and New Jersey Transit and AMT's Bombardier ALP-45DP electro-diesel locomotive can operate from overhead catenary electrification. The model is confined to services operating from New York City, where diesel emissions through its two fully enclosed <b>main</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>stations</b> are prohibited. P32AC-DMs are seen only on Amtrak's Empire Corridor between Penn Station& Grand Central Terminal and Buffalo, the Ethan Allen Express, Lake Shore Limited (New York section), Adirondack, and Maple Leaf services. However, sometimes the P32AC's are traded out for a P42DC at Albany. This {{is due to the}} requirement for the P32AC-DM engines exclusively in this section of rail, and the higher horsepower rating of the P42DC. Metro-North's push-pull trains to and from Grand Central Terminal also utilize P32AC-DM units, and, unlike Amtrak's units, Metro-North's units have an escape hatch in the nose. As of July, 2017 Amtrak rerouted 3 Empire Corridor trains a day to run into Grand Central to reduce train traffic at Penn Station. Metro North Engineers take over from the Amtrak ones at Yonkers as the Amtrak Engineers are not qualified to run into Grand Central.|$|R
