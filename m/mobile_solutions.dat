In this paper, we refine our <b>mobile</b> <b>solution</b> using two mappings: namely, a portable-IP mapping and a mobile mapping. We also explicitly distinguish our two mapping approach from the existing mobile-IP solutions which are of a single mapping scheme. The portable-IP mapping is supported using DHCP and DNS functions and requiring no modifications to the TCP/IP protocols. The mobile mapping is implemented in the socket layer. Our <b>mobile</b> <b>solution</b> achieves high compatibility with the current TCP/IP systems mainly because that no special functionality is required to support mobility in the network and the transport layers.
