25|$|The {{development}} of commercial <b>marine</b> <b>radar</b> {{entered a new}} phase in the 1980s when raster-scan displays that were compliant with the IMO Performance Standards were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Several battalions were {{supplied}} with rigid Dory craft for patrolling waterways {{shared with the}} Republic of Ireland {{in an attempt to}} prevent gun running across these narrow channels (such as Carlingford Lough). Assisted by land based Decca <b>Marine</b> <b>radar,</b> these fast boats were armed with general purpose machine guns and carried a Carl Gustav 84mm anti tank weapon in addition to the rifles and sub-machine guns normally carried by soldiers. After a report submitted by 3 UDR in 1972 HQ Northern Ireland requested a navy patrol vessel to be permanently stationed in the centre of Carlingford Lough to assist with suppression of gun-running. This suggestion was adopted and {{to the end of the}} security situation a small warship was on station off the coast off the Warrenpoint/Rostrevor shoreline. This intervention was called Operation Grenada. Gun-running across these coastal estuaries ceased as a result.|$|E
500|$|The Croatian Coast Guard {{was formed}} in October 2007, and Šolta was {{assigned}} to the 1st Division, based in Split. During the same year the ship underwent a modernisation that included the installation of a new Sperry <b>Marine</b> <b>radar,</b> gyrocompass and GPS. [...] A second refit that occurred sometime between 2007 and 2013 included the deletion of the Strela launcher and the stern 20mm M-75 gun to create space needed for a RHIB and a hydraulic crane used to lower it into the sea. The pennant number was changed from OB-62 to OB-02.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>radars</b> {{are used}} by ships for {{collision}} avoidance and navigation purposes. The frequency band of radar used on most ships is x-band (9 GHz/3 cm), but s-band (3 GHz/10 cm) radar is also installed on most oceangoing ships to provide better detection of ships in rough sea and heavy rain condition. Vessel traffic services also use <b>marine</b> <b>radars</b> (x or s band) for tracking ARPA and provides collision avoidance or traffic regulation of ships in the survallence area.|$|R
50|$|Sperry Marine Northrop Grumman {{offers a}} range of marine {{navigation}} products and solutions including <b>Marine</b> <b>Radars,</b> Gyrocompasses, Steering Systems, Autopilots and Integrated Bridge Systems.|$|R
50|$|The Radar Surveillance System {{operates}} X-band <b>marine</b> <b>radars</b> {{from the}} Dongtudi tower {{and from the}} Nanjiang MSA base, and the associated ARPA system monitors ship tracks and provides collision early warning.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>marine</b> <b>radar</b> with {{automatic}} radar plotting aid (ARPA) capability can create tracks using radar [...] The system can calculate the tracked object's course, speed and [...] (CPA), thereby knowing {{if there is}} a danger of collision with the other ship or landmass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{availability}} of low cost microprocessors {{and the development}} of advanced computer technology during the 1970s and 1980s have made it possible to apply computer techniques to improve commercial <b>marine</b> <b>radar</b> systems. Radar manufacturers used this technology to create the Automatic Radar Plotting Aids. ARPAs are computer assisted radar data processing systems which generate predictive vectors and other ship ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the magnetron's output make radar use of the device somewhat problematic. The first of these factors is the magnetron's inherent instability in its transmitter frequency. This instability results not only in frequency shifts from one pulse to the next, but also a frequency shift within an individual transmitted pulse. The second factor is that {{the energy of the}} transmitted pulse is spread over a relatively wide frequency spectrum, which requires the receiver to have a correspondingly wide bandwidth. This wide bandwidth allows ambient electrical noise to be accepted into the receiver, thus obscuring somewhat the weak radar echoes, thereby reducing overall receiver signal-to-noise ratio and thus performance. [...] The third factor, depending on application, is the radiation hazard caused by the use of high power electromagnetic radiation. In some applications, for example a <b>marine</b> <b>radar</b> mounted on a recreational vessel, a radar with a magnetron output of 2 to 4 kilowatts is often found mounted very near an area occupied by crew or passengers. In practical use these factors have been overcome, or merely accepted, and there are today thousands of magnetron aviation and <b>marine</b> <b>radar</b> units in service. [...] Recent advances in aviation weather avoidance radar and in <b>marine</b> <b>radar</b> have successfully replaced the magnetron with semiconductor microwave oscillators, which have a narrower output frequency range. [...] These allow a narrower receiver bandwidth to be used, and the higher signal to noise ratio in turn allows a lower transmitter power, reducing exposure to EMR.|$|E
25|$|The mid-1990s {{marked the}} {{development}} of smaller more efficient <b>marine</b> <b>radars.</b> While such <b>marine</b> <b>radars</b> are illegal if used in land-mobile situations, a number of chasers were quick to adopt them {{in an effort to}} have mobile radar. These radars have been found to interfere with research radars, such as the Doppler on Wheels (DOW) utilized in field projects. The first personal lightning detection and mapping devices also became available and the first online radar data was offered by private corporations or, at first with delays, with free services. A popular data vendor {{by the end of the}} 1990s was WeatherTAP.|$|R
50|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>radars</b> are X band or S band radars {{to provide}} bearing and {{distance}} of ships and land targets in vicinity from own ship (radar scanner) for collision avoidance and navigation at sea.|$|R
50|$|A radar can {{be useful}} in {{detecting}} ice, but the returning signal which bounces of ice (even icebergs) is very faint, much lower than from ships. Conventional <b>marine</b> <b>radars</b> are designed for target detection and avoidance. Enhanced <b>marine</b> <b>radars</b> provide a higher definition image of the ice that the vessel is transmitting and will result in a much clearer image. This image can be used to identify the quantity and sort of ice that has to be dealt with. In standard radar, sea clutter affects the ability to see in the near vicinity of the vessel. An X-band radar set to a short pulse can give improved results.|$|R
2500|$|A combat data system (or combat {{management}} system, CDS/CMS) {{is considered}} a force multiplier and another revolution of military affairs after World War II, because CDS automates C4I system by integrating information gathered by separate ship-borne sensors into a coherent overall picture, and assisting decision making, and thus boosting the war-fighting capability of ships equipped with such system. However, until the 1980s, Chinese naval vessels {{has yet to be}} equipped with such systems. The first combat data system for Chinese navy was indigenous, and subsequent systems trace their origin from Italian and French systems purchased. Three western combat data systems were known to be purchased by China, including British Racal <b>Marine</b> <b>Radar</b> CTC-1629, Italian Alenia SADOC 2, and French Thomson-CSF TAVITAC.

Unfortunately, to provide a sufficient ranging accuracy, FM chirp-based interrogation signals must be wideband {{at the expense of}} a high-noise level that must be counteracted by adopting extremely high transmitter power levels (> 1 KW) and mechanical-steered high-directional antennas. This prevents the exploitation of FM chirp-based radars for localization in multistatic configurations with fixed antennas.|$|R

Nowadays, this method is used in operational applications, being considered as a standard method for wave analysis using non-coherent X-band marine radar-based sensors in the literature.|$|R
