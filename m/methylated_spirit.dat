25|$|A {{widely used}} old {{adhesive}} that is orange or very dark brown in appearance. Once dried, the adhesive {{is very hard}} and becomes increasingly more brittle over time. Shellac does not break down easily with commercially available products. Additionally, the resin has naturally-occurring dyes that can stain ceramic pink or black. The solvent that works best on this resin is Industrial <b>methylated</b> <b>spirit</b> or (IMA). Shellac is prepared by dissolving flakes of shellac in hot alcohol. The properties of shellac make it vulnerable to climatic conditions and inclined to deteriorate over time. Damage can even occur to shellac under the hot light of photography.|$|E
2500|$|Specifically, {{application}} of <b>methylated</b> <b>spirit,</b> nail polish remover, turpentine or ti-tree oil {{is thought to}} irritate the tick and make it inject more of the noxious substances. Spreading butter or oil over the tick is no longer recommended either. Application of pyrethrin (or pyrethroid) insecticides has been suggested 'as a narcotic and a toxicant, which prevents the tick from injecting its saliva' [...] but with this method the tick may remain physically attached for 24 hrs before it drops off dead.|$|E
40|$|This is an {{exploratory}} study {{to research the}} nature, development and relation of <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits</b> to the abuse of alcohol. The specific aims {{of the study were}} 1) to explore the socio-demographic characteristics and drinking patterns of drinkers of methylated spirits; 2) the possibility of the respondents regarding the drinking of <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits</b> as deviant, and 3) the possibility that psycho-social factors identified in South African research as contributing to alcohol abuse, particularly alcoholism, could influence the consumption of <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} [...] "spirit stove" [...] (alcohol or <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits)</b> {{consists of}} a small reservoir or fuel tank raised above and {{to the side of}} the burner.

In 2003 a new Liquor Act which outlaws the [...] "dop" [...] system was adopted by the South African Parliament. The bill states that [...] "an employer must not supply liquor or <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits</b> to any person as an inducement to employment; supply liquor or <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits</b> to an employee as or in lieu of wages or remuneration; or deduct from an employees’ wages or remuneration any amount relating to the cost of liquor or <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits.</b>|$|R

50|$|Rarely, {{blindness}} {{is caused}} by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is methanol, which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death. When competing with ethanol for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed. Methanol is commonly found in <b>methylated</b> <b>spirits,</b> denatured ethyl alcohol, to avoid paying taxes on selling ethanol intended for human consumption. <b>Methylated</b> <b>spirits</b> are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol alcoholic beverages.|$|R

Scrape {{the roof of the}} mouth of the frog gently, to obtain ciliated epithelium; and mount in very weak salt solution-- the cilia will still be active. Squamous epithelium may be seen by the student similarly scraping the interior of his own cheek. Take a piece of muscle from one of the frog's limbs, tease out with needles upon a glass slip, and examine. To see the striations clearly, the high power will be needed. Compare a piece of muscle from the wall of the alimentary canal. Similarly examine nerve and connective tissue.|$|E
