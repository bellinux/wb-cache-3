30|$|Logically, lung {{resection}} {{decreases the}} volume of EVLW. Two experimental studies [55, 56] showed that EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> transpulmonary thermo-dye dilution or thermodilution decreased after pneumonectomy, but was correlated with the gravimetric EVLWI measurement. Nevertheless, the absolute value of EVLWI measured by transpulmonary thermodilution was overestimated compared with the EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> gravimetry [55]. Similarly, a recent experimental study demonstrated that EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> transpulmonary thermodilution was significantly affected by 1 -lung ventilation [57]. Thus, in ARDS patients with pneumonectomy or 1 -lung ventilation, EVLWI <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> transpulmonary thermodilution should be interpreted with caution, though {{the ability of the}} technique to measure changes in EVLWI should be unaffected.|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{variability}} and systematic differences in polyp measurements on optical colonoscopy and CT colonography. Gastroenterologists measured 51 polyps by visual estimation, forceps comparison and linear probe. CT colonography observers randomly assessed polyp size two-dimensionally (abdominal and intermediate window) and three-dimensionally (manually and semi-automatically). Linear mixed models {{were used to}} assess the variability and systematic differences between CT colonography and optical colonoscopy techniques. The variability of forceps and linear probe measurements was comparable and both showed less variability than <b>measurement</b> <b>by</b> visual assessment. <b>Measurements</b> <b>by</b> linear probe were 0. 7 mm smaller than <b>measurements</b> <b>by</b> visual assessment or by forceps. The variability of all CT colonography techniques was lower than for <b>measurements</b> <b>by</b> forceps or visual assessment and sometimes lower (only 2 D intermediate window and manual 3 D) compared with <b>measurements</b> <b>by</b> linear probe. All CT colonography measurements judged polyps to be larger than optical colonoscopy, with differences ranging from 0. 7 to 2. 3 mm. A linear probe does not reduce the measurement variability of endoscopists compared with the forceps. Measurement differences between observers on CT colonography were usually smaller than at optical colonoscopy. Polyps appeared larger when using various CT colonography techniques than when measured during optical colonoscop...|$|R
