I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb. You're on the cliff, you tip your hat to yourself and you go. That’s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that in [...] "Hunter", Björk {{incorporates}} Iceland into the track with techniques that derive from Icelandic folk music and traditional stories. She uses the interval of a fifth continuously throughout the song, like the cellos during the first 30 seconds of the track; fifths were common in Icelandic folk songs, their use being particularly relevant to performance. Björk has also said: [...] "'Hunter' is based on what <b>my</b> <b>grandma</b> told me at Christmas; about {{two different types of}} birds. One bird always had the same nest and partner all their lives. The other was always travelling and taking on different partners. At some point there was a conscious decision made to remain a hunter." [...] Elements of Maurice Ravel's Boléro were also noted. René T. A. Lysloff and Leslie C. Gay, Jr. wrote: [...] "one of the three main sections of the whole song is the Bolero ostinato (0:00-1:36).

Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated that the people are violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t <b>my</b> <b>grandma,</b> I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get out of my house you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the {{mechanisms by which}} intergenerationally gifted assets are transformed into inalienable wealth and describes how such gifts convey and transfer meaning within families. The study's findings reveal that individuals employ indexical accounts to allocate assets in support of relational goals and employ prosaic accounts to achieve utilitarian goals. These findings contribute to inter-generational gifting theories by demonstrating how an asset transitions between inalienable and alienable states, identifying antecedents and consequences of pro-saic and indexical accounts, explaining the interactions between inalienable and alienable states and between indexical and prosaic account allocations, and dis-cussing the implications of labeled assets on consumer behavior. <b>My</b> <b>grandma's</b> getting older [...] "You know what?

[...] Homer Johnsen of HipHopDX also gave a three out of five star review stating, [...] "Benton’s array of flows is very impressive, but his rhymes are oftentimes more for shock value than true creativity. For some, this will likely limit the album’s replay value. It is as if his darker motives are justified by these flashes of artistic ingenuity, and his occasional touches of humor keep the listener interested." ...|$|R
