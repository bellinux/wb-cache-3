40|$|Speech in a noisy {{background}} {{presents a}} challenge for the recognition of that speech both by human listeners and by computers tasked with understanding human speech (automatic speech recognition; ASR). Years of research have resulted in many solutions, though none so far have completely solved the problem. Current solutions generally require some form of estimation of the noise, in order to remove it from the signal. The limitation is that noise can be highly unpredictable and highly variable, both in form and loudness. The present report proposes a method of recording a speech signal in a noisy environment that largely prevents noise from reaching the recording microphone. This method utilizes the human skull as a noise-attenuation device by placing the microphone in the ear canal. For further noise dampening, a pair of noise-reduction earmuffs are used over the speakers' ears. A corpus of speech was recorded with a microphone in the ear canal, while also simultaneously recording speech at the <b>mouth.</b> <b>Noise</b> was emitted from a loudspeaker in the background. Following the data collection, the speech recorded at the ear was analyzed. A substantial noise-reduction benefit was found over mouth-recorded speech. However, this speech was missing much high-frequency information. With minor processing, mid-range frequencies were amplified, increasing the intelligibility of the speech. A human perception task was conducted using both the ear-recorded and mouth-recorded speech. Participants in this experiment {{were significantly more likely}} to understand ear-recorded speech over the noisy, mouth-recorded speech. Yet, participants found mouth-recorded speech with no noise the easiest to understand. These recordings were also used with an ASR system. Since the ear-recorded speech is missing much high-frequency information, it did not recognize the ear-recorded speech readily. However, when an acoustic model was trained low-pass filtered speech, performance improved. These experiments demonstrated that humans, and likely an ASR system, with additional training, would be able to more easily recognize ear-recorded speech than speech in noise. Further speech processing and training may be able to improve the signal's intelligibility for both human and automatic speech recognition...|$|E

The paper particularly focuses on the methodology and the scenario made to collect a spontaneous corpus of human-robot interactions. Through a Wizard of Oz platform (EmOz), which was specifically developed for this issue, a robot is introduced as an intermediary between the technological environment and some elderly who have to give vocal commands to the robot to control the Smart Home. The robot vocal productions increases progressively by adding prosodic levels: (1) no speech, (2) pure prosodic <b>mouth</b> <b>noises</b> {{supposed to be the}} "glue's" tools, (3) lexicons with supposed "glue" prosody and (4) subject's commands imitations with supposed "glue" prosody.

The actual corpus is still on recording process and is motivated to collect data from socio-isolated elderly in real need...|$|R
40|$|National audienceThis article {{reports a}} study on the perceptual {{identification}} of language and culture, the level of certainty in this choice, and at the same time, the degree of extroversion perceived by 45 French and 45 Italian judges. Judgments are made on non-lexical audible and visible micro-events (e. g. <b>mouth</b> <b>noises,</b> grunts, bursts, interjections and fillers) of 6 French subjects, placed in human-computer interac-tion. These events were ordered and displayed on a 24 stimuli axis by their increasing control of prosody (from an absence of this control) and by their distance from phonological sounds. There were 3 modalities of the test: audio only (A), video only (V) and audio-visual (AV). For each modality 15 judges of each nationality were in-terviewed. The results show that judges from both nation-alities clearly identify the subjects as French. However, while the judgement V modality is mainly based on the subject's appearance (invariable selection of judges {{from the beginning of the}} experiment), in the A and AV modal-ities the emergence of prosodic control corresponds to "point of stability" in the culture and language identifica-tion and in the level of certainty in this choic...|$|R

50|$|With the woodwinds, {{aside from}} the flute, piccolo, and recorder, the sound is {{generated}} by a reed and not with the lips. The embouchure is therefore based on sealing {{the area around the}} reed and the mouthpiece. This serves to prevent air from escaping while simultaneously supporting the reed allowing it to vibrate, and to constrict the reed preventing it from vibrating too much. With woodwinds, it is important to ensure that the mouthpiece is not placed too far into the mouth, which would result in too much vibration (no control), often creating a sound an octave (or harmonic twelfth for the clarinet) above the intended note. If the mouthpiece is not placed far enough into the <b>mouth,</b> no <b>noise</b> will be generated, as the reed will not vibrate.|$|R

The present study investigates an alternative explanation based on the weighted averaging halo model of IIT (Anderson, 1981), which assumes no interaction among components. The issue of context effects has always been present in the study of faces. Typically, context information makes reference to context outside the face, acknowledging the fact that faces seldom stand in isolation but are commonly met instead in rich interactive settings. The ubiquity of outer contexts also draws attention to the fact that, however important as a communicative device, the face is one of manifold channels of communicative signs (e. g., postures, gestures, prosody, proxemics, verbal utterances, etc.). By far, the dominant question posed by research has concerned the relative importance of contextual information (regardin...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the presence of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in children with headaches in a neuropediatric ambulatory. METHOD: Fifty patients between 4 and 18 years of age were examined: 31 had headaches (24 migraine, 4 tension type and 3 unspecific headache) and 19 formed the control group. The data collection was comprised of a structured questionnaire answered by the children's parents, and a subjective evaluation about the childrens emotional state. A specific questionnaire for TMD was applied, followed by a clinical dental examination of the children. As signs of TMD, mouth opening limitation, mandibular trajectory deviation in opening <b>mouth,</b> and joint <b>noise</b> were considered. As symptoms, pain on palpation of masseter and temporal muscles and on the poromandibular joint. RESULTS: A significant increase in signs and symptoms of TMD was found in patients with headaches when compared to the control group. There was also a significant difference in signs and symptoms of TMD according to age (increased with age) and emotional state (tense> calm). CONCLUSION: There is a higher frequency of TMD in pediatric patients with headaches; thus, it is important to look for TMD signs and symptoms in this population...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of modern VVA systems recently offered new potentialities in improving fuel consumption for sparkignition engines at low and medium load, while granting higher volumetric efficiencies and performance at high load. The recently introduced ‘Multi-Air’ system, by Fiat Powertrain Group, enhanced this concept through {{the possibility of}} contemporary modify the intake valve opening, closing and lift, leading to the {{development of}} ‘throttle-less’ engines. However, at very low loads, the control of air-flow motion inside the cylinder may require to select a proper combination of butterfly throttling and intake valve control, to get the best BSFC improvement. Moreover, a reduced throttling, while improving the fuel consumption, may also produce a higher gasdynamic noise at the intake mouth. To this aim, a ‘Multi-lift’ strategy, along a single intake stroke can be analyzed, too. Of course, the introduction of new degrees of freedom for the engine control also poses new problems in terms of engine calibration and tuning. To best exploit the potential offered by these systems, new methodologies and development tools must be utilized, too. In this paper, an optimization procedure is presented, aiming to select the best combination of control parameters of a twincylinder turbocharged engine in different operating conditions. A detailed 1 D simulation model of the whole engine is firstly developed and validated against experimental data in WOT conditions and in predefined low load operating points. The model is developed within GT-Power, commercial code environment, but employs a in-house developed routine to simulate the combustion process. The latter takes into account the effects on heat release induced by variations on in-cylinder flow field and gas composition. Both of them, in fact, are substantially modified by the actual strategy specified for the intake valve control. The 1 D model is then coupled to an external optimizer (ModeFRONTIER) to perform the minimization of the fuel consumption at defined low-load operating points, with imposed constraints on the intake <b>mouth</b> radiated gasdynamic <b>noise.</b> An external module is employed to predict the overall intake valve lift profile as a function of two control parameters of the system (φ 1 and φ 2). The optimization procedure then selects the best combination of the above parameters together with the spark advance and WG / butterfly valve opening degree. The procedure validated against experimental data gives the possibility to perform a pre-calibration of the engine on a completely theoretical basis, and proves to be very helpful in reducing the experimental costs and time-to-market of new engine prototypes...|$|R
