5|$|As a {{young and}} {{promising}} defenceman, Bourdon was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions. <b>Most</b> <b>significantly,</b> he was speculated {{to be part of}} a package in exchange for Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brad Richards. Although Bourdon had a powerful shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster. He began to show signs of improvement and maturity as the Canucks used him more in the 2007–08 season.|$|E

5|$|However, Gandhi had sound {{reasons for}} his decision. The salt tax was a deeply {{symbolic}} choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the <b>most</b> <b>significantly.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Larkin turned sixty. This {{was marked}} <b>most</b> <b>significantly</b> by a {{collection}} of essays entitled Larkin at Sixty, edited by Anthony Thwaite and published by Faber and Faber.

5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>significantly</b> {{affected}} by the storm was Martinique, which received 26.8in (680mm) of rainfall in a 24‑hour period. The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, resulting in about $34million in damage (1970USD); 186homes were destroyed, and 700people were left homeless. The flooding killed up to 50people on the island. Elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles, the storm killed one person on Dominica from heavy rainfall, and in Guadeloupe heavy damage to the banana crop was reported.|$|E
5|$|Other accomplishments during Brittain's {{administration}} {{included a}} doubling of Georgia Tech's enrollment, the first ROTC unit in the Southern United States, accreditation for the Institute by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, {{and the creation of}} a new ceramic engineering department, building, and major that attracted the American Ceramics Society's national convention to Atlanta. Perhaps <b>most</b> <b>significantly,</b> Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a new focus on science and technology research.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, <b>most</b> <b>significantly,</b> causal.|$|E

This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{minorities in}} Poland were <b>most</b> <b>significantly</b> affected, whereas Poland's multiethnic diversity reflected in prior national censuses {{was all but}} gone within several years after the war.

5|$|The {{reforms of}} Sejanus <b>most</b> <b>significantly</b> {{included}} {{the founding of}} the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, and the rulers were equally {{at the mercy of the}} Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.|$|E

The floods in May generally affected the northern portion of the island, and the October event generally affected southern Puerto Rico, although the town of Barceloneta experienced floods in both events. Several rivers exceeded their banks, and the Toa Vaca reservoir filled to its capacity {{for the second time}} since it was constructed in 1972.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. <b>Most</b> <b>significantly,</b> {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of campaign finance reform passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E
