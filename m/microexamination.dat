40|$|This article empirically {{examines}} {{office rent}} determinants in distinct periods {{of a market}} cycle. The study uses a dataset of office properties located in a large metropolitan area and spanning a six-year period. During this period, office rents experienced a significant decline and recovery. A time-varying parameter rent index identifies three distinct periods of the cycle: decline, trough and recovery. Tests of structural change conclude that market participants value the determinants of office rents differently during the periods. A <b>microexamination</b> of each rent determinant over the periods of the market cycle provides {{a greater understanding of}} how rents vary over time and the factors that influence them. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Unexpected tube {{failure is}} the major factor causing {{unreliability}} in utility boilers. The first step in analyzing tube failures is to identify the active damage mechanisms. Three tube damage mechanisms related to overheating are presented and possible root causes are discussed to resolve these tube failures. Damage mechanisms can be recognized by metallurgical evaluation, comprising {{a combination of both}} visual and <b>microexamination,</b> complemented by chemical analyses of tube or fireside deposits, as appropriate. Characterizing the degree of microstructural degradation can also help to confirm and separate various potential high temperature tube damage modes, such as long or short term overheating, as well fuel ash attack. Carbon steel is the standard tube material for high pressure boilers (typically up to 625 psig steam) and has a normal design temperature limit of about 440 ºC. However, microstructural changes occurring as a result of higher temperature exposures in service can include carbide spheroidization, graphitization and other transformations. Metallography is powerful tool for evaluating overheated failures and also for fire damage assessment. Evaluating overheated steel microstructures utilizes the principles of steel heat treatment and application of the iron-iron carbide equilibrium diagram...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} 2 anthelmintics (ivermectin and levamisole) against Baylisascaris transfuga migrating and encapsulated larvae was studied in mice. A total of 60 BALB/c mice inoculated each with about 1, 000 embryonated B. transfuga eggs were equally divided into 6 groups (A-F) randomly. Mice of groups A and B {{were treated with}} ivermectin and levamisole, respectively, on day 3 post-infection (PI). Mice of groups A-C were killed on day 13 PI. Similarly, groups D and E were treated with ivermectin and levamisole, respectively, on day 14 PI, and all mice of groups D-F were treated on day 24 PI. The groups C and F were controls. <b>Microexamination</b> was conducted to count the larvae recovering from each mouse. The percentages of {{reduction in the number}} of migrating larvae recovered from group A (ivermectin) and B (levamisole) were 88. 3 % and 81. 1 %, respectively. In addition, the reduction in encapsulated larvae counts achieved by ivermectin (group D) and levamisole (group E) was 75. 0 % and 49. 2 %, respectively. The results suggested that, to a certain extent, both anthelmintics appeared to be more effective against migrating larvae than encapsulated larvae. However, in the incipient stage of infection, ivermectin may be more competent than levamisole as a larvicidal dru...|$|E
40|$|Al- 2124 alloy {{reinforced}} with 17 % vol. SiC particles with three sizes 3, 13, 37 µm (MMCs) were tested under impact compression using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar(SHPB) system. <b>Microexaminations</b> of tested samples revealed microscopic {{characteristics of the}} formation of shear bands occurring in the MMCs. As a comparison, the matrix material, Al- 2124 alloy was also tested. Shear bands formed more readily in Al- 2124 /SiCp {{reinforced with}} 3 µm particles than in Al- 2124 alloy and the alloy reinforced with 13 or 37 µm SiC particles. The relations between microstructural distributions, spacing of SiC particles and formation of shear bands have been analysed...|$|R
40|$|Consulting and {{scholarly}} research often {{have very different}} objectives with respect to advancements in practice, theory, and observation (e. g., data collections). For example, consulting often emphasizes immediate benefits, specialized applications, and a focus on only the key variables. Scholarly research often emphasizes replicability, generalizability, and introducing previously uninvestigated variables. However, these activities complement each other, and each activity {{is important for the}} advancement of the other. Benefiting from that complementarity requires the literature to bridge knowledge gained from each activity. It is unnecessary for every researcher to try to bridge theory and practice by working on the interface between academics and practice. However, it is critical that some researchers do so. This issue of examines several excellent applications of that provide detailed <b>microexaminations</b> of the fundamental marketing practices that we seek to understand and improve. Beyond demonstrating how to solve specific problems in practice, in my opinion, the articles and commentaries in this issue also illustrate at least the following ideas: Short-term tactics can produce significant short-term advantages. Existing models in the literature can be useful with proper implementation. State-of-the-art research is most useful for infrequent decisions. Finally, knowing the decision-making context is essential for determining which variables to include in the analysis. marketing models, scholarly research, industry practice, academic consulting, theory...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} “starting mechanism” and {{pathological}} process of knee cartilage injury in different movement training with high intensity. Materials and Methods: 72 New Zealand white rabbits {{were divided into}} 3 groups randomly: Untreated Control Group (CTRL, n= 8), animals were untreated by any intervention processing; Running Training Group (RG, n= 32), animals were trained running in a treadmill daily; Jumping Training Group (JG, n= 32), animals were trained jumping in an electric stimulation cage daily. Rabbits in RT and JT were euthanized at 4 week and 8 week respectively, and knee joints were taken out to be examined histologically. GAG content, thickness of cartilage and subchondral bone, dead cell ratio and Mankin grades were measured respectively. Results: By <b>microexaminations,</b> different pathological changes of early sport injury of knee cartilage in RG and JG were found. Animals receiving jumping training displayed a significantly higher degree of grossly and cartilage matrix detectable degeneration on the weight-loading region of the femur condyles than did animals receiving running training; on the contrary, animals receiving running training displayed a significantly higher degree of chondrocyte damage than did animals receiving jumping training in the earlier stage (4 -week). Conclusions: Repetitive and high-intensity jumping exercise can do more harm to cartilage matrix than to chondrocyte in knee joint, the pathogenesis displays as “cartilage matrix starting mechanism”; on the contrary, running exercise can do more harm to chondrocyte than to cartilage matrix, the pathogenesis displays as “chondrocyte starting mechanism”. In addition, the difference in pathogenesis and cartilage damage phenotype by different exercises may have a close correlation with the different loading rate of stress on knee cartilage surface...|$|R
