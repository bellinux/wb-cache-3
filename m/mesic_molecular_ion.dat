Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The desorption/ionization of volatile hydrocarbons by Plasma Desorption (PD) produces a series of <b>molecular</b> <b>ions.</b> Among these are deprotonated <b>molecular</b> <b>ions,</b> which are not usually observed in PD. The H-loss phenomenon was examined as a function of structural features, i. e., the length of the alkane chains, and the size, saturation and nature of the substitution groups on aliphatic or aromatic rings. Specifically, the following compounds were studied: n-decane, n-octane, n-hexane, n-pentane, cyclooctane, cyclohexane, cyclohexene, 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene, benzene, toluene, ortho- xylene, meta-xylene, and para-xylene. PDMS is best carried out on solids; accordingly, the samples were frozen. The experiments were run using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer with a 252 Cf source providing the fission fragments for PD. The event-byevent mode of desorption and detection was exploited with coincidence counting to study relationships between deprotonated <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> and H+. The results show that the H-loss is related to the structural features of the volatile hydrocarbons. Both the yield and number of deprotonated <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> changed with these structural features. The dominant <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> varied from (M-H) + in saturated compounds to (M+H) + in aromatic compounds. H-loss was characteristic of all the compounds studied and appeared to result from a sequential process governed mainly by the stability of the deprotonated products. The dominant <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> were related to those <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> species encountered in methane chemical ionization. The study of deprotonation by coincidence counting revealed a chemical relationship between deprotonated <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> and H+. There is a higher coincidental emission of H+ with highly deprotonated <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> than with less deprotonated <b>molecular</b> <b>ions.</b> This finding suggests that at least a portion of the deprotonation process occurs from multiply ionized species...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{details of}} the construction of and experiments performed in a hybrid system consisting of a cold neutral atomic magneto-optical trap (MOT) contained within a linear radio-frequency quadrupole ion trap (LQT). The combination of these two workhorses of atomic physics facilitates a variety of developing science such as the controlled investigation of ion-neutral quantum chemistry and the production of ground-state <b>molecular</b> <b>ions.</b> While the primary focus of this work is the production of ultracold <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> via sympathetic cooling, there has been investigation of cold (T ~ mK) ion-neutral charge exchange processes in two different ion-neutral pair systems. In addition, a possible method of producing ultracold homonuclear <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> via a photo-associative ionization (PAI) pathway is studied in the MOT. The LQT traps ions in spatial overlap with a 40 Ca MOT constituting an ultracold buffer gas purposed to sympathetically cool <b>molecular</b> <b>ions.</b> An effective, general method of producing ground-state <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> would open a field of physics allowing, for example, precise measurements of molecular transitions which are uniquely sensitive to parity violation, or the possible variation of fundamental constants. Another promising application of cold <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> is an implementation of a quantum computing architecture by coupling micro-fabricated strip-line resonators to the microwave rotational transition found in many diatomic <b>molecular</b> <b>ions.</b> The <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> BaCl + is chosen to be used in proof-of-principle sympathetic cooling experiments. Ultimately, a vibrational internal state thermometry experiment shows that the Ca MOT performs very efficiently at quenching the vibrational motion of the BaCl + <b>molecular</b> <b>ion.</b> As a product of overcoming experimental challenges, this thesis discusses several experiments to characterize trapping and reaction dynamics in the hybrid system. For example, charge transfer measurements are performed with two different laser-cooled atomic ion species, Yb + and Ba +, which are allowed and disallowed ground-state reaction, respectively. Controlled measurements of these inelastic processes test the cutting edge of quantum theory of ion-neutral interaction in both the ground-state and under optical excitation...|$|R

One versatile and widely applied method to cool molecules is helium buffer-gas cooling in either a supersonic beam expansion or a cryogenic trap environment. Another more recent method applicable to trapped <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> relies on sympathetic translational cooling, through collisional interactions with co-trapped, laser-cooled atomic ions, into spatially ordered structures called Coulomb crystals, combined with laser-controlled internal-state preparation. Here we present experimental results on helium buffer-gas cooling of the rotational degrees of freedom of MgH + <b>molecular</b> <b>ions,</b> which have been trapped and sympathetically cooled in a cryogenic linear radio-frequency quadrupole trap. With helium collision rates of only about ten per second—that is, four to five orders of magnitude lower than in typical buffer-gas cooling settings—we have cooled a single <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> to a rotational temperature of 7. 5 + 0. 9 / - 0. 7 kelvin, the lowest such temperature so far measured.
