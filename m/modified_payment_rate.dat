40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a {{distributed}} recharg-ing rate control algorithm which combines the objectives of regulating frequency and improving the utilization of electric generators. An incentive policy is created that encourages Electric Vehicles (EVs) to demand energy when non-EV demand is low and the electric generators are underutilized. EVs also act as frequency regulators which can control their participation role by <b>modifying</b> their respective <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> wi. The proposed distributed recharging rate control algorithm can realize a Demand Management solution for EVs and does not require explicit real time communication from the electric generators or between the recharging sockets. A mechanism is presented that can trade off an ideal incentive policy with its approximation, and enable the integration of the proposed controller with legacy protection system. Simulation is used to assess the algorithm and to highlight its embedded characteristics. Index Terms—Demand management, distributed algorithms, frequency regulation, electric vehicles, multi-agent systems. I...|$|R

40|$|Should the {{government}} subsidize entry to promote competition? In theory, free entry {{does not guarantee}} the socially optimum number of entrants. In differentiated product markets, free entry can result either in excessive or insufficient entry.

Objective To {{examine the}} {{association}} between <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> for personal care assistants and use of long-term services and supports (LTSS) following hospital discharge among dual eligible Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Data Sources State hospital discharge, Medicaid and Medicare claims, and assessment data on California Medicaid LTSS users from 2006 to 2008. Study Design Cross-sectional study. We used multinomial logistic regression to analyze county personal care assistant <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> and postdischarge LTSS use, and estimate marginal probabilities of each outcome across the range of rates paid in California. Data Extraction Methods We identified dual eligible Medicare and Medicaid adult beneficiaries discharged from an acute care hospital with no hospitalizations or LTSS use in the preceding 12 months. Principal Findings Personal care assistant <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> were modestly associated with home and community-based services (HCBS) use versus nursing facility entry following hospital discharge (RRR 1. 2, 95 percent CI: 1. 0 - 1. 4). For a rate of $ 6. 75 per hour, the probability of HCBS use was 5. 6 percent (95 percent CI: 4. 2 - 7. 1); at $ 11. 75 per hour, 18. 0 percent (95 percent CI: 12. 5 - 23. 4). <b>Payment</b> <b>rate</b> {{was not associated with}} the probability of nursing facility entry.

40|$|Business and {{government}} spending on physician services have soared {{over the last}} few decades. Most payers for services traditionally peg their <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> to Medicare. However, most consider the current Medicare single <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> flawed because it fails to improve health outcomes or control spending. Everyone wants to replace it, but good replacements have not been identified. We estimated elasticities of the single-payment rate with respect to several of its determinants, proposed a replacement—a service-specific payment rate—for the single-payment rate, and estimated the budget implications of this replacement. Key findings are that the single-payment rate is relatively inelastic to the Sustained Growth Rate (SGR) 1 and expenditure levels and that the proposed service-specific <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> promotes primary care, controls spending, and saves money.

50|$|Cost-shifting {{is either}} an {{economic}} situation where one individual, group, or government underpays for a service, resulting another individual, group or government overpaying for a service (shifting compared to expected burden). It can occur where one group pays a smaller share of costs than before, resulting in another group paying {{a larger share}} of costs than before (shifting compared to previous arrangement). Some commentators on health policy in the United States believe the former currently happens in Medicare and Medicaid as they underpay for services resulting in private insurers overpaying. In 1995, Health Affairs started a study testing the “cost-shifting” theory using a unique new data set that combines MarketScan private claims data with Medicare hospital cost reports, the study ran from 1995-2009. In May 2013 when the findings were released, the study found that a 10 percent reduction in Medicare <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> led to an estimated reduction in private <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> of 3 percent or 8 percent, depending on the statistical model used. These <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> spillovers may reflect an effort by hospitals to rein in their operating costs in the face of lower Medicare <b>payment</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
40|$|Government {{bodies in}} Britain {{encourage}} conservation management within designated Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) through {{the conclusion of}} formal agreements with owners and occupiers. The nature of ESA and SSSI agreements and the procedures involved in concluding them are described and contrasted. Analysis of the available data indicates that the average <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> (pounds per hectare per annum) for SSSI agreements concluded exceeds that for ESA agreements. In contrast, arguments from first principles suggest that the ESA <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> would be the higher. That the reverse is {{the case may be}} explained if SSSL agreements impose substantially more stringent conditions. A distinction is drawn between expensive agreements (under which the annual payment exceeds � 2000) and inexpensive agreements (the annual payment is less than � 2000). The data suggest that <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> for expensive SSSI agreements may be excessive and capable of being lowered; and <b>payment</b> <b>rates</b> for inexpensive ESA agreements may need to be raised to attract reasonable levels of entry to these schemes. Alternatively, it may be that ESA arrangements are more cost-effective for concluding large, expensive agreements; and SSSI arrangements for concluding small, inexpensive agreements. ...|$|R

Collectively, GAO's findings demonstrate that Medicaid fee-for-service claims data can be a useful source of information for analyzing provider payments. These data have the potential to provide a more complete representation of provider payment than do fee schedules, as claims data can capture both the distribution and frequency of actual payments to providers. ...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Utilization of ESRD drugs in 2011 was about 23 percent lower, on average, {{than it was in}} 2007, driven largely by a decline in the utilization of ESAs. As a result, Medicare may have paid more than necessary for dialysis care in 2011 because the bundled <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> in that year was based on 2007 utilization levels. We estimated that Medicare expenditures on dialysis would have been about $ 650 million to $ 880 million lower in 2011 if the bundled <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> were rebased to reflect the 2011 utilization level of ESRD drugs. Furthermore, this estimate of potential savings could be larger in future years if the level of ESRD drug utilization at the end of 2011 declines further, as preliminary data suggest. Rebasing the bundled <b>payment</b> <b>rate</b> to account for changes in ESRD drug utilization could help ensure that Medicare pays appropriately for dialysis services and also yield savings to Medicare.
