5|$|After {{entering}} the open {{waters of the}} South China Sea, Nepartak continued to intensify and turned <b>more</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest. It attained its peak intensity on November 16, with maximum 10‑minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and 1-minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). After weakening slightly, the storm found a weakness in the easterly steering currents and bore north, reintensifying slightly and directly striking southwestern Hainan. There, heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops, livestock, and hundreds of homes, leaving $197 million (2003 USD) in damage. The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China.|$|E
5|$|The storm quickly {{weakened}} as {{it continued}} southwest, passing {{just north of}} Charters Towers City, though it continued to produce heavy rainfall over interior Queensland. Curving southeastward, Althea re-emerged over open waters between Maryborough and Double Island Point on 26 December and began to intensify once again. At 00:00 UTC on 28 December, the cyclone reached a third peak with 10-minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), but as it turned <b>more</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> south, increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures weakened the cyclone. On 29 December, Althea lost its tropical characteristics over the Tasman Sea.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{took over}} issuing {{warnings}} on the hurricane, as Fernanda crossed 140° W into their area of responsibility. After maintaining a west-northwest track {{for much of}} its duration, the hurricane turned <b>more</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west. By August 15, the storm was expected to pass between Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii; however, the CPHC noted uncertainty due to an approaching upper-level trough, which would produce a more northerly tack. Its winds weakened to about 85mph (140km/h), although late on August 15 the hurricane re-intensified to winds of 105mph (165km/h). By that time, it had redeveloped a large eye of 50 miles in diameter; wind gusted to 120mph (195km/h), while tropical storm force winds extended 200 miles (640km) from the center. Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane to provide observational data while it was near Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{had found}} its way to the southwestern quadrant of a large anticyclone aloft, allowing for continued strengthening. Both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm midday on November 12, when it gained the name Nepartak from the JMA. Simultaneously, the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, which named it Tropical Storm Weng. Meteorologically, the storm began to exhibit improved outflow and deepening convection as it neared the central Philippines. At around 1600 UTC on November 13, Nepartak made landfall on northern Samar Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west. The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea briefly weakened and with reduced forward motion, but quickly resumed its intensification trend as it turned <b>more</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest. Shortly thereafterat 0000 UTC on November 15the JTWC further upgraded 25W to a typhoon.|$|E
5|$|The first {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} developed on August 23, in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Not believed to have strengthened further, the storm tracked west-northwestward and struck southwestern Hispaniola. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression as it turned <b>more</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest and crossed northern Cuba. On August 26, the depression passed through the Bahamas, east of the Florida Peninsula. Heading due north, the storm had transitioned into an extra{{tropical cyclone}} by the next day. An area of high pressure {{to the north and}} east of the storm was said to have prevented it from recurving out to sea, and the cyclone skirted the eastern coast of North Carolina before being listed as dissipated east of the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm reportedly caused heavy precipitation on August 29 and 30 in Georgia and the Carolinas, while ships at sea reported high winds, rough seas and heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Gillian {{were from a}} weak {{tropical}} low that persisted in the eastern Arafura Sea on 6March. The next day, the system moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, where it developed convection, or thunderstorms, which organised into curved rainbands. The thunderstorms were located west of a circulation, was exposed due to moderate wind shear. At 06:00UTC on 8March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Darwin began issuing warnings on the developing tropical low. Around that time, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), indicated the high potential for tropical cyclogenesis due to the increasingly organised circulation and convection. At 09:00UTC on 8March, the BoM upgraded the low to Tropical Cyclone Gillian, and six hours later, the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17P. After its formation, Gillian moved slowly southward toward Queensland within an area of weak steering currents. Despite ongoing wind shear, forecasters anticipated strengthening due to warm water temperatures and favourable outflow. The storm turned <b>more</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> southeast due {{to the influence of}} a ridge to the northeast. Early on 10March, Gillian made landfall along the western Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, after weakening below tropical cyclone status.|$|E

In 2001, Democrat Thomas Spota was elected District Attorney, and ran unopposed in 2005. Although Suffolk voters gave George H. W. Bush a victory here in 1992, the county voted for Bill Clinton in 1996 and continued the trend by giving Al Gore an 11-percent victory in the county in 2000. 2004 Democratic candidate John Kerry won by a much smaller margin of one percent, in 2008 Democratic candidate Barack Obama won by a slightly larger 4.4 percent margin, 52%-47%.
