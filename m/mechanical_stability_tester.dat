40|$|Significant <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> is an {{essential}} feature shared by many elastomeric proteins, which function as molecular springs {{in a wide variety}} of biological machinery and biomaterials of superb mechanical properties. Despite the progress in understanding molecular determinants of <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability,</b> it remains challenging to rationally enhance the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of proteins. Using single molecule force spectroscopy and protein engineering techniques, we demonstrate that engineered bi-histidine metal chelation can enhance the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of proteins significantly and reversibly. Based on simple thermodynamic cycle analysis, we engineered a bi-histidine metal chelation site into various locations of the small protein, GB 1, to achieve preferential stabilization of the native state over the mechanical unfolding transition state of GB 1 through the binding of metal ions. Our results demonstrate that the metal chelation can enhance the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of GB 1 by as much as 100 pN. Since bi-histidine metal chelation sites can be easily implemented, engineered metal chelation provides a general methodology to enhance the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of a wide variety of proteins. This general approach in protein mechanics will enable the rational tuning of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of proteins. It will not only open new avenues toward engineering proteins of tailored nanomechanical properties, but also provide new approaches to systematically map the mechanical unfolding pathway of proteins...|$|R
40|$|Whereas marked {{variations}} in the clinical manifestations of hereditary spherocytosis have long been recognized, we have only recently begun to define the molecular basis for this heterogeneity. An important unanswered question is whether decreased spectrin results in reduced membrane <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability,</b> and if this reduction in membrane <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> {{can be related to}} in vivo surface area loss. Using the ektacytometer, we quantitated membrane surface area and stability in erythrocytes from 18 individuals with hereditary spherocytosis and deficiencies of spectrin (30 - 80 % of normal spectrin level). Membrane <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> was reduced and the magnitude of the reductions correlated with the spectrin content. Moreover, the reductions in <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> correlated with in vivo loss of membrane surface area. These data indicate that decreased spectrin content results in reduced membrane <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> and surface area loss in vivo. We conclude that partial deficiencies of spectrin, reductions in membrane <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability,</b> and loss of membrane surface area are directly related and are major features determining the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of hereditary spherocytosis. ...|$|R

Here we demonstrate that it is feasible to use a “cocktail” approach for combining more than one approach to enhance significantly the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of proteins in an additive fashion. As a proof of principle, we show that metal chelation and protein-protein interaction can be combined to enhance the unfolding force of a protein to ∼ 450 pN, which is > 3 times of its original value.

Seven different chemical agents were tested (two non-oxidising biocides, three surfactants and two oxidising biocides) and their effects on the biofilm <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> were evaluated. The increase in the Reynolds number increased the biofilm removal, but total biofilm removal was not found for all the conditions tested. For the experiment without chemical addition (only mechanical treatment), the biofilm remaining on the surface was about 76 %. The chemical treatment followed by the subsequent mechanical treatment did not remove all the biofilms from the surface. The biofilm remaining on the SS cylinder ranged from 3 % to 62 %, depending on the chemical treatment, showing that the chemical treatment {{is far from being}} a cause that induces massive biofilm detachment and even the synergistic chemical and mechanical treatments did not promote biofilm removal.

Here, we report the mechanical unfolding properties of ubiquitin-like proteins (SUMO 1 and SUMO 2) and their comparison with those of ubiquitin. Although ubiquitin and SUMOs have similar size and structural topology, they differ in their sequences and structural contacts, making them ideal candidates to understand the variations in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability</b> of a given protein topology. We observe a two-state unfolding pathway for SUMO 1 and SUMO 2, similar to that of ubiquitin. Nevertheless, the unfolding forces of SUMO 1 (∼ 130 pN) and SUMO 2 (∼ 120 pN) are lower than that of ubiquitin (∼ 190 pN) at a pulling speed of 400  nm/s, indicating their lower <b>mechanical</b> <b>stability.</b> The <b>mechanical</b> <b>stabilities</b> of SUMO proteins and ubiquitin are well correlated with the number of interresidue contacts present in their structures.
