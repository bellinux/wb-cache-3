5000|$|Since 2005 Dicko and his {{business}} partner and manager, David Wilson, had been developing a new TV series talk show. The series placed three celebrities before a live studio audience where they were asked tricky moral questions such as, [...] "Is it okay to <b>monitor</b> <b>your</b> children online?" [...] or [...] "Is it okay to dress up a Hitler at a fancy dress party?". The celebrities had to answer yes or no to the questions with no in-between. The idea for the show was pitched to TV networks several times throughout 2005-2009, and each time the show was rejected. In 2010 Dicko and David partnered with TV producer and presenter Andrew Denton to co-produce the show. It was then re-pitched to Network Ten, where Dicko acted as a host in the meeting and the executives played the celebrity contestants. The show was bought within that pitch meeting and would then be called Can of Worms.|$|E

5000|$|The {{use of an}} {{inexpensive}} glucometer and blood glucose testing at home can help avoid dangerous insulin overdoses and can provide a better picture of how well the condition is managed. Dr. Sara Ford gave a presentation {{about the need for}} home blood glucose testing in diabetic pets at the 2010 American Veterinary Medical Association Convention. She believes a diabetic pet needs to be checked at least twice a day, saying, [...] "If you're a human diabetic you <b>monitor</b> <b>your</b> blood sugar between 4-6 times a day. I believe that state-of-the-art care in veterinary medicine in 2010 includes home blood-glucose monitoring."A 2003 study of canine diabetes caregivers who were new to testing blood glucose at home found 85% of them were able to both succeed at testing and to continue it on a long-term basis. Using only one blood glucose reading as the reason for an insulin dose increase is to be avoided; while the results may be higher than desired, further information, such as the lowest blood glucose reading or nadir, should be available to prevent possible hypoglycemia.|$|E

3000|$|Monitoring: Essentially, {{the value}} of a {{monitoring}} tool is for the user to log easily into a performance dashboard, check if the virtual machines are running, and gain an understanding of what is running so far. PAR# 3 stated, “They (cloud provider) issued a user cloud statistics, which essentially makes your applications, data and metrics into cloud watch. So, you have a performance tool that <b>monitors</b> <b>your</b> service, CPU, I/O and stuff…So, not only can you <b>monitor</b> what <b>your</b> applications are doing but you can also action things.” The user would have to know what specific services are impacted by the problem, and be able to drill down to fundamental information. As PAR# 17 stated, “If something goes wrong with the monitoring service which can happen you know that you’re not caught off guard when something does go wrong.” Having a monitoring system enables the business customer to observe and act on system alarms, which increases the usefulness of the cloud services obtained from the provider. Knowing that the service is up and running well is a key thing that PAR# 17 looks for in those reports. Further, the manager would have a concrete basis {{in the form of a}} reporting tool for feedback as well to top management. If something goes wrong, there are alerts to the customer. PAR# 4 stated, ”So, they give us a dashboard report of everything within their realm. We also monitor things like web performance…so things will automatically tell us when suddenly we’ve got off the air for any reason.” [...]...|$|R
