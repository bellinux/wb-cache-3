25|$|This {{was always}} my life, {{but now it}} takes up {{so much of my}} life that it's very difficult. In fact {{survival}} is very, very hard. My flat's nothing special – two rooms – and I live as frugally as I possibly can to make sure I can campaign. I'm not trying to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> out to be a martyr because this is my choice.|$|E
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, want to change it. So I had to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E

25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
500|$|In one of {{his first}} interviews, Cobain told Sounds {{journalist}} John Robb, [...] "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes I try to make things harder for myself, just to try to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen." ...|$|E
500|$|DeJoseph left, {{leaving the}} band without a drummer. Mark O'Connell, {{a friend of}} Reyes, heard about the vacancy and joined the group. After {{recording}} Taking Back Sunday's self-titled EP, Longo left the band and eventually played with Guilt Like Gravity and the Mirror. In December 2000, Lazzara switched from bass to lead vocals. He never thought he would become the group's singer: [...] "I remember getting into [...] Windstar with that [...] and just driving around singing those songs, just to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> actually do it." [...] O'Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist, and brought in Shaun Cooper of Breaking Pangaea. In February 2001, Taking Back Sunday released a five-track demo before touring for a year.|$|E

500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E
500|$|... "It Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Jason Derulo, E. Kidd Bogart, Lindy Robbins and Emanuel [...] "Eman" [...] Kiriakou, who also {{produced}} the track. The engineering process was handled by Jens Koerkmeier. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The song's keyboards, whistle, guitars, bass, percussion and drum programming were provided by Eman, with additional keyboards and drum programming by Koerkmeier and Andrew Goldstein. On July 29, 2011, the audio of [...] "It Girl" [...] was uploaded to Derulo's official YouTube account. When speaking of the song, Derulo told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I wanted to put myself in a position as if I'd found my It Girl, to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> feel like if I found that one true love. I've basically described {{what it would be}} like if I found her." [...] Derulo further elaborated about the concept of the song in another interview with Matt Elias of MTV News: ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} romantic theme in her storyline Ruby {{has been shown}} as an {{aspiring}} singer. Breeds is classically trained in real life and said she doesn't mind singing on camera. Discussing this she stated: [...] "When you're playing a character you can hide behind them. I know it's still my voice, [...] I was more confident singing from Ruby's point of view. Even {{though there was a}} storyline where she was terrified about singing in a school play, I wasn't nervous at all. I had to try really hard to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> feel nervous." [...] She revealed she had to play down her voice and make it [...] "a bit cleaner" [...] and a [...] "bit more inexperienced". This was due to the fact {{it was meant to be}} that she had never sung before – [...] "I have to pull her back a bit." [...] She added the storyline was realistic because there are no set guidelines for discovering vocal talent.|$|E

500|$|Williams {{declared}} {{his intention to}} stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment {{in the light of}} Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years [...] "the one idea of my life has been to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in my power to facilitate the study of its literature." [...] He assured voters that, if elected, [...] "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion. Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit [...] "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his [...] "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" [...] when compared to Müller's [...] "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think me ungrateful or churlish, Mr. Fentolin," [...] he begged. [...] "I have {{a habit of}} keeping {{promises}} which I <b>make</b> to <b>myself,</b> and to-night I have made myself a promise that I will {{be back at the}} Tower by ten o'clock." ...|$|R

2500|$|Although multi-faceted and complex, Casanova's personality, as he {{described}} it, was dominated by his sensual urges: [...] "Cultivating whatever gave pleasure to my senses was always the chief business of my life; I never found any occupation more important. Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> loved by it." [...] He noted that he sometimes used [...] "assurance caps" [...] to prevent impregnating his mistresses.|$|E
2500|$|None of {{the five}} Blackwell sisters ever married. Elizabeth thought {{courtship}} games were foolish early in her life, and prized her independence. When commenting on the young men trying to court her during her time in Kentucky, she said: [...] "...do not imagine I am going to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> a whole just at present; the fact is I cannot find my other half here, but only about a sixth, which would not do." [...] Even during her time at Geneva Medical College, she rejected advances from a few suitors.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the long}} {{production}} of Ashes of Time, Wong faced a two-month break {{as he waited}} for equipment to re-record sound for some scenes. He was in a negative state, feeling heavy pressure from his backers and worrying about another failure, and so decided to start a new project: [...] "I thought I should do something to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> feel comfortable about making films again. So I made Chungking Express, which I made like a student film." [...] Conceived and completed within only six weeks, the new project ended up being released two months before Ashes of Time.|$|E

2500|$|Rauschenberg {{picked up}} trash and found objects that {{interested}} {{him on the}} streets of New York City and brought these back to his studio where they could become integrated into his work. He claimed he [...] "wanted something other than what I could <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> and I wanted to use the surprise and the collectiveness and the generosity of finding surprises. And if it wasn't a surprise at first, by the time I got through with it, it was. [...] So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, when Vaughan was {{six years}} old, he began {{stealing}} his father's drinks. Drawn in by its effects, he started making his own drinks and this resulted in alcohol dependency. He explained: [...] "That's when I first started stealing daddy's drinks. Or when my parents were gone, I'd find the bottle and <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> one. I thought it was cool...thought the kids down the street would think it was cool. That's where it began, and I had been depending on it ever since." [...] According to the authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford: [...] "In the ensuing twenty-five years, he had {{worked his way through}} the Physicians' Desk Reference before finding his poisons of preference—alcohol and cocaine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vandenbroucke said in 2004: [...] "I've {{never done}} {{anything}} to <b>make</b> <b>myself</b> popular. In fact, the opposite. Sometimes I think it's all a dream. I've thrown up a marriage, I've been on bad terms with my parents for a long time, all of which has troubled and exhausted me." [...] He said he had disappointed sponsors, managers and directeurs sportifs, even though they continued to show confidence in him. [...] "I had become schizophrenic," [...] he said. Without psychiatric help, he would [...] "have followed the same path as Pantani", the Italian rider found dead on a hotel floor. After 450,000 French francs a month at Cofidis, he earned 220,000 at Lampre in 2001 and then half that at Fasso Bortolo.|$|E
