50|$|The Byzantine army regained an {{increasingly}} offensive role against the crusaders {{in the mid}} to late 13th century but many fortifications regained by the Byzantines fell out of use; a lack of manpower and <b>multiple</b> <b>pressing</b> fronts relegated these castles to abandonment. Some of the castles captured in Greece were used to control the local hostile Greek, Albanian, Vlach or other tribal peoples that opposed Frankish rule and since the Byzantines were both Greek and Orthodox, the threat that the Crusaders had to contend with existed on a lesser scale for the Byzantines, giving them another reason not to repair them. Constantinople's fortifications remained formidable, but repairing them proved impossible after 1370 due to the destructive nature of an ongoing civil war. By the time the Byzantines emerged from it, they were forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, who threatened military action if any repairs were made to the millennium-old Walls of Constantinople. Heavily outnumbered, the walls of the capital provided the defenders in 1453 with 6 weeks of defense.|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} of high temperature superconductivity has gone beyond mere scientific curiosity {{and into the}} manufacturing environment. Single lengths of multifilamentary wire are now produced that are over 200 meters long and that carry over 13 amperes at 77 K. Short-sample critical current densities approach 5 x 10 {sup 4 } A/cm{sup 2 } at 77 K. Conductor requirements such as high critical current density in a magnetic field, strain-tolerant sheathing materials, and other engineering properties are addressed. A new process for fabricating round BSCCO- 2212 wire has produced wires with critical current densities as high as 165, 000 A/cm{sup 2 } at 4. 2 K and 53, 000 A/cm{sup 2 } at 40 K. This process eliminates the costly, <b>multiple</b> <b>pressing</b> and rolling steps that are commonly used to develop texture in the wires. New multifilamentary wires with strengthened sheathing materials have shown improved yield strengths up to a factor of five better than those made with pure silver. Many electric power devices require the wire to be formed into coils for production of strong magnetic fields. Requirements for coils and magnets for electric power applications are described...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA PCB {{embedded}} transformer for {{harsh environment}} (i. e., ambient temperature above 200 • C) applications is presented {{and used in}} the design of a 2 MHz integrated power-supply prototype for gate driver. The main benefits of using this developed PCB embedding process are the capability to customize the air-gap for the flyback transformer and volume reduction for the converter. The easy modulation of the air-gap distance can be achieved using PCB material in specfic thickness. Moreover, the design of a coplanar-winding transformer structure with very low inter-winding capacitance needs a large winding area and raises the interest for the PCB integration approach. Two-machined ferrite pieces in UI shape were sandwiched into a multi-layer PCB laminate with <b>multiple</b> <b>pressing</b> processes. A converter prototype built with the PCB embedded transformer and other components (GaN transistors, gate driver and passives) mounted above it shows 72 % of power efficiency. One thousand thermal cycles between − 55 • C and 200 • C were performed on the PCB embedded transformer without observation of any major defects, such as delamination and cracking. The thermal reliability test validates the compatibility between the selected ferrite core and PCB materials as well as the feasibility of this developed transformer embedding method. A three-time volume reduction is achieved when comparing with a benchmark converter prototype using discrete transformer...|$|E
40|$|Public opinion {{formation}} plays a {{very important}} role in economic policy development. Opinions put forward in various social platforms offered by the media and the Internet have a large impact on international treaty negotiations. In particular this {{seems to be the case}} for international negotiations regarding the abatement of greenhouse gasses. In this paper we argue that social opinion formation can be represented as part of a game-theoretic equilibrium concept that transcends the standard Nash equilibrium concept. We discuss its application to treaty negotiations in the context of a model of the tragedy of the commons representing the international environmental situation. We conclude that social opinion formation in most cases has a significant impact on their outcomes and effectiveness. 1 The environment and social opinion formation The current climate debate and the negotiations over global emission reductions bring up <b>multiple</b> <b>pressing</b> questions for economists and game theorists. Economists can contribute to the public debate on these issues by clarifying the incentives of decision makers, in particular the participants in such negotiations regarding global emission reductions. In this paper we discuss an innovative approach for understanding the various influences on negotiators. Central among these is the influence of public discourse on the negotiations. Negotiators, representing certain populations of economic subjects, are usually strongly influenced by public opinion formation regarding global warming and the effects of emission abatement on environment and the economy.

Bangle acknowledges that his designs do not look good in photographs, suggesting to critics that they should see the cars in real life before judging them on their looks.Bangle himself did not (as is commonly believed) coin the phrase [...] "flame surfacing" [...] to describe his work; this can be attributed to a motoring journalist, and is probably the first time Deconstructivism has been adapted to automotive design. The reason for this design was to use BMW's new technology of 3D panel pressing allowing a single press for compound curves, which had previously needed <b>multiple</b> <b>pressings</b> unless the panel was shaped by hand. This is further evidenced by the fact that Bangle has often pointed out architect Frank Gehry's work as a major influence.|$|R

50|$|John Wylie {{started to}} gather {{attention}} {{when he joined}} Rich Thurston in the already formed Culture. He recorded Born of You, and the Split with Roosevelt, before leaving in late 1995 to form his own band, Morning Again. This band would be mostly formed of ex-Culture members, such as Damien Moyal, Steve Looker, Louie Long, and Joe Simmons. Morning Again would grow {{to become one of}} the most hardcore bands of Florida, with subjects such as vegan, straight edge and anti political matters. The band grew to get signed to many labels, leading John to want to start his own. In 1997 he founded Eulogy Recordings. The labels first two bands were Bird of Ill Omen (who were going on tour with Morning Again that year) and Red Letter Day. The label's DIY ethics also led to John founding <b>multiple</b> merchandise <b>pressing</b> companies, such as Bending Tree a shirt printing plant, Southern Noise Studio a recording studio, and even Aces High a tattoo shop. In 1998, he formed Where Fear and Weapons Meet, a hardcore punk band that traced back to the 1980s roots. After the demise of Morning Again in late 1999, he formed Until the End which was quickly signed to the recognized label Equal Vision Records. Until the End then moved to his own label, Eulogy, until their break up in September 2005. Wylie then took a break from music until 2008 when he formed Toetag. The début release is a split CDEP with Shattered Realm. Wylie is currently a member of West Palm Beach, Florida hardcore band Old Habits and also currently operates a second record label Wayward Parade and a second tattoo shop Black Rose Tattoo.|$|R
50|$|A {{keyboard}} is {{an arrangement}} of buttons that each correspond to a function, letter, or number. They are the primary devices used for inputting text. In most cases, they contain an array of keys specifically organized with the corresponding letters, numbers, and functions printed or engraved on the button. They are generally designed around an operators language, and many different versions for different languages exist. In English, the most common layout is the QWERTY layout, which was originally used in typewriters. They have evolved over time, and have been modified for use in computers {{with the addition of}} function keys, number keys, arrow keys, and keys specific to an operating system. Often, specific functions can be achieved by <b>pressing</b> <b>multiple</b> keys at once or in succession, such as inputting characters with accents or opening a task manager. Programs use keyboard shortcuts very differently and all use different keyboard shortcuts for different program specific operations, such as refreshing a web page in a web browser or selecting all text in a word processor. In addition to the alphabetic keys found on a typewriter, computer keyboards typically have a numeric keyboard and a row of function keys and special keys, such as CNTRL, ALT, DEL and Esc.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years a {{grassroots}} social movement has emerged from the Black community. This movement aims to eliminate police and vigilante violence against Blacks nationwide. Blacks in America have long been subjected to this violence, and the issue has recently captured the country’s attention. <b>Multiple</b> groups are <b>pressing</b> for change, including Ferguson Action, Black Lives Matter, Say Her Name, and the leaderless social media effort organized by DeRay McKesson and Johnetta Elzie, to name a few. These fledgling activist groups have already experienced some success, garnering public attention and government response. As it currently stands, this nascent civil-rights movement has the potential to advance racial justice in twenty-first century America, but its path is not without obstacles. According to social-movement theory, the ability of activists to further marshal support is vital to the continued development of this civil-rights movement. Whether engaging in street-level activism or pursuing formal change through judicial, legislative, or electoral processes, movement organizers will have to think rationally and strategically about resource mobilization and oppositional forces. At a minimum, they must amass money and manpower for their activities, establish group credibility in the eyes of their participants and the public, and remain sensitive to the costs of movement participation imposed by government officials and counter-movements. To address these concerns, social-movement theory and history reveal that Black music and musicians can and should {{play a key role in}} Black America’s next-generation battle for criminal justice and civil rights. Social-movement activists should draw Black musicians, especially hip-hop artists, into the movement fold, encouraging Black musicians to initiate a massive wave of cultural activism...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a simple}} LED package, {{typically}} {{all of the}} cathodes (negative terminals) {{or all of the}} anodes (positive terminals) of the segment LEDs are connected and brought out to a common pin; this is referred to as a [...] "common cathode" [...] or [...] "common anode" [...] device. Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard IC sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays {{to reduce the number of}} I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, <b>pressing</b> <b>multiple</b> keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.|$|R
