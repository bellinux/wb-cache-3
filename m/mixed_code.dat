40|$|Background: Cantonese-English <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> is {{ubiquitous}} in Hong Kong society, and yet using <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> is widely perceived as improper. This paper presents evidence of <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> being socially constructed as bad language behavior. In the education domain, an EDB guideline bans <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> in the classroom. Teachers {{are encouraged to}} stick to Cantonese or English, depending on the school-based medium of instruction policy (i. e. EMI vs. CMI schools). Aims or focus of discussion: This paper analyzes the major reasons why <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> is so difficult to avoid, {{both inside and outside}} the classroom. One important factor is the ‘medium-of-learning effect’. Empirical evidence will be presented to demonstrate students ’ cognitive dependence on English terminologies as a direct result of English-medium education. The paper draws implications for classroom code-switching, which is pedagogically a valuable linguistic resource. Arguments / comments / suggestions: The EDB guideline banning <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> in the classroom is too rigid. Code-switching has great potential for helping the bilingual teacher to achieve context-specific teaching and learning goals like clarifying difficult concepts and reinforcing students ’ bilingual lexicon (e. g. melamine/三聚氰胺, financial tsunami/金融海嘯). For EMI teachers, switching to Cantonese helps maintain class discipline, build rapport an...|$|E

Second, the discussion of my research design is intended to contribute to methods in the study of intercultural communication. Third, I am identifying language choice as {{a major factor in the}} linguistic construction of cultural identity. Through their language choices, bilingual couples most often align themselves with the majority. However, they may also actively construct themselves as intercultural border-crossers by the use of a <b>mixed</b> <b>code,</b> or even as minority members, which happens when both minority and majority partner use the minority language. The reasons the couples themselves identify for their choices are 'habit' and 'compensation. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{emergence}} of a mixed language variety spoken by Udmurt-Russian bilinguals in the Russian republic of Udmurtia. Called Suro-Požo ‘mixed, mixture ’ by its speakers, this language code is characterised by variation in the use of Udmurt, Russian, double and hybrid discourse markers, as data analysis has revealed, which has specifically focused on subordinators and question tags. Accord-ing to the frequency distribution of the native and borrowed discourse-regulating items in the analysed corpus, several classes of Suro-Požo discourse markers are represented overwhelmingly by Russian forms, indicating the starting point of a diachronic process of fusion (Matras 1998, 2000) of the two systems of discourse marking on the way from code-mixing to a <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> (Auer 1998 a, 1998 b) ...|$|E
40|$|Recently unitary space-time {{modulation}} {{has been}} presented to give a solution to more reliable multiple antennas communications. Good-performing unitary constellations are required to be designed to fit into this system. Although the basic principle is well understood and certain criteria and their transformations for designing such constellations have been presented, we don't have a general method to design goodperforming constellation {{for any number of}} transmit and receive antennas and for any transmission rate. In this paper, we design unitary constellations which have good diversity product in some specific situations and we analyze the asymptotic behavior of some special constellations. We describe a new design criterion for low SNR channel, also we present a <b>mixed</b> <b>code</b> scheme which features good performance unitary constellations.

The phenomenon of mixing languages within sentence boundaries is known as <b>code</b> <b>mixing.</b> <b>Code</b> <b>mixing</b> phenomenon can be found not only in spoken but also in written text such as novel.

The procedures of data analysis are classifying <b>code</b> <b>mixing</b> based on MusykenÂ’s <b>code</b> <b>mixing</b> typology, analyzing the interview script, correlating the authorsÂ’ reason to the reviewed theories and drawing conclusion based on the result of data analysis. The finding of the study showed that there are three patterns of <b>code</b> <b>mixing</b> called insertion, alternation and congruent lexicalization found in Ranah 3 Warna novel. The reasons of the author in using <b>code</b> <b>mixing</b> are the authorÂ’s personal experience, strengthening the story setting, the need of dialogues and/or character to used foreign language and also <b>code</b> <b>mixing</b> is used as an approach in writing novel.
