40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to map the distribution of pork retail outlets as well as assess their role in food borne disease transmission. Using a structured questionnaire, practices associated with hygiene related to infrastructure, workers, and equipment were assessed. Sources of pork were assessed to determine whether pork had undergone inspection, as were socio economic determinants of hygiene outcomes and risk factors for foodborne disease. There were 158 pork outlets in the five divisions of Kampala. Overall, 68 % of the pork was from places where slaughtering was not authorized (ungazetted) and meat inspection not carried out. Worker hygiene score was highest (average 71 %), followed by infrastructure (68. 2 %) and equipment (47. 3 %). There was a significant relation between good hygiene and the presence of a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> However only 42 % of the outlets had a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> Holding a public <b>health</b> <b>certificate</b> is an important predictor of good practices.

5000|$|However, {{since this}} {{did little to}} reduce prostitution, Austrian laws changed to {{consider}} prostitution as a necessary evil {{that had to be}} tolerated but regulated by the state. In 1850, Dr. Nusser of the Vienna police suggested that prostitutes be required to register with the police, receive medical examinations twice a week, and obtain special <b>health</b> <b>certificates.</b> In 1873, Anton Ritter von Le Monnier, head of the Vienna police, reformed Vienna's prostitution law, and <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> have been obligatory since that time. Prostitutes who complied with the requirements of registration and examinations were no longer prosecuted by the police. A newspaper article of October 27, 1874 reported that 6,424 prostitutes had received <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> and were under observation by police and health authorities. According to police estimates, at least 12,000 more women lived on the proceeds of [...] "free love" [...] without being registered. Most of these were factory workers who received so little pay that they needed the additional income. Of the registered prostitutes, 5,312 were unmarried, 902 widows, and 210 married. The youngest was 15 and the oldest 47 years old.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSources of {{data used}} in France to {{routinely}} monitor vaccination coverage, {{such as the}} Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and school surveys, allow reliable estimations, but data are not made available with long delays. To rapidly identify recent changes, we have explored the feasibility and relevance of using vaccine reimbursement data. MethodsWe used the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries, {{a representative sample of}} the National Health Insurance Information System, which contains data on health spending reimbursement of {{the vast majority of the}} population. We first validated this new source by comparing measles vaccine coverage between Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> and the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries. We present herein the results on hepatitis B, meningococcal C, and human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) coverage. ResultsMeasles vaccine coverage estimated with the Permanent Sample of Beneficiaries (91. 4 %) is very close to the estimation obtained through Child <b>Health</b> <b>Certificates</b> (90. 6 %). For children born in 2011, hepatitis B vaccination coverage at 24 months of age was 88. 7 % for one dose and meningococcal vaccination coverage was 56. 4 % for one dose in December 2013. Of girls born in 1997, 20. 1 % had received the full HPV vaccination series on their 16 th birthday. ConclusionThis novel routine vaccination coverage monitoring tool provides regularly updated reactive and reliable vaccination coverage estimates in children...|$|R

30|$|Imaging {{platforms}} {{can easily}} become hubs for (potentially) pathogenic microorganisms. Several precautions help to minimize this risk. Animal facilities, and in particular, those transferring animals to others, should monitor the facility {{according to a}} list of specified pathogens and keep book in <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> [17]. Several organizations offer analytical services to test sentinel animals or excreta for contamination with defined microorganisms. Before exchanging animals between facilities, the <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> need to be exchanged, and only if the receiving facility’s negative list of pathogens is tested negative over a defined time period in the source facility/facilities, the animals can be transferred. Alternatively, and if infrastructure and risk assessment allow, rooms with differing hygiene levels or quarantine rooms can be defined and common instruments cleaned and decontaminated accordingly. However, it should be kept in mind that any infection or its treatment could affect the imaging results.|$|R

30|$|Airports are {{the most}} {{important}} country frontiers to be protected because infectious agents can reach destinations and disseminate very quickly and they are strategic areas for national veterinary surveillance. This is because infectious agents can be transported in food of animal origin, especially those without <b>health</b> <b>certificates</b> and these can be detected in international baggage (Taniguchi et al. 2008 Chaber et al. 2010) using X-ray scanners. Airborne, food-borne, vector-borne, and zoonotic infectious diseases transmitted during commercial air travel became an important public health issue due to the greater affordability of air travel, increasing the mobility of people (Mangili and Gendreau 2005). To minimize the risk of these diseases entering a country, products of animal origin need to be accompanied by an international <b>health</b> <b>certificate.</b> This is crucial to assure a reliable health situation when countries with known health status are involved, as regulated by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for its member countries (Pastoret and Chaisemartin 2011).|$|R
