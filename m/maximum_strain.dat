50|$|One {{drive from}} each of the RAID 5 sets could fail without loss of data; for example, a RAID 50 {{configuration}} including three RAID 5 sets can only tolerate three maximum potential drive failures. Because the reliability of the system depends on quick replacement of the bad drive so the array can rebuild, it is common to include hot spares that can immediately start rebuilding the array upon failure. However, this does not address the issue that the array is put under <b>maximum</b> <b>strain</b> reading every bit to rebuild the array at the time when it is most vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} failure theories: maximum shear stress theory, maximum normal stress theory, <b>maximum</b> <b>strain</b> energy theory, and maximum {{distortion}} energy theory. Out {{of these four}} theories of failure, the maximum normal stress theory is only applicable for brittle materials, and the remaining three theories are applicable for ductile materials.Of the latter three, the distortion energy theory provides most accurate results in majority of the stress conditions. The strain energy theory needs the value of Poisson’s ratio of the part material, which is often not readily available. The maximum shear stress theory is conservative. For simple unidirectional normal stresses all theories are equivalent, which means all theories will give the same result.|$|E
50|$|Pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} can {{be diagnosed}} by history and physical exam, {{though it is}} more accurately graded by imaging. Historically, fluoroscopy with defecography and cystography were used, though modern imaging allows the usage of MRI to complement and sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment of the disorder, allowing for less radiation exposure and increased patient comfort, though an enema is required the evening before the procedure. Instead of contrast, ultrasound gel is used during the procedure with MRI. Both methods assess the pelvic floor at rest and <b>maximum</b> <b>strain</b> using coronal and sagittal views. When grading individual organ prolapse, the rectum, bladder and uterus are individually assessed, with prolapse of the rectum {{referred to as a}} rectocele, bladder prolapse through the anterior vaginal wall a cystocele, and small bowel an enterocele.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} the air war had changed {{significantly}} since 1941 and German bomber crews implemented new tactics. In the Blitz, German bombers were dispatched individually rather than in formation. Each Gruppe had been briefed to take off and bomb the target {{over a period of}} time extending anywhere up to ten hours. The intention was to place the British Civil Defence Authority and anti-aircraft artillery defences under <b>maximum</b> <b>strain</b> and also inflict greater psychological damage to the civilian population. This kind of tactic was effective in 1940 when German crews understood they faced little threat from RAF Fighter Command night fighters. The tactics were also designed to limit the chances of collision. Bombers took off at an interval of four minutes with an average spacing of 12 miles. Even with airborne radar-equipped night fighters it usually meant there was only one raider every 180 square miles. The average operating heights of 10 to 20,000 ft put one raider in every 345 cubic miles of air space.|$|E
50|$|The maximum {{actuator}} strain for electrically driven actuators {{of carbon}} nanotube sheets {{can be improved}} up to 0.7% in a 1 M electrolyte once the sheets are annealed in an inert atmosphere at very high temperatures (1100 oC) in contrast to once reported 0.1% or less for low electrochemical potentials (~1 V or less). The <b>maximum</b> <b>strain</b> for the carbon nanotube sheet actuators at low voltages is {{greater than that of}} the high modulus ferroelectric ceramic actuators (~0.1%), but it is lower than that of the low voltage (~0.4 V) conducting polymer actuators (~3% film direction, 20% thickness direction). Strokes were reported as high as 215% for strain biased low modulus electrostrictive rubbers under biases greater than 1kV (corresponding to an electric field 239 MV/m for the geometry mentioned in the reference paper). Spinks et al. realized pneumatic actuation from the carbon nanotube sheets in electrolyte solutions with high electrochemical potential (1.5 V), which cause gas generation in the electrolyte. The released gas dramatically increases the actuator stroke from the carbon nanotube sheet. Thickness of the carbon nanotube sheet expands by ~300% and the sheet plane contracts by 3%.|$|E

40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} as concrete road slab, {{appear as}} a strong alternative for flexible superstructures especially because of their low cost for maintenance and repair and the high performance they show under heavy axle loads. The design of these concrete road slabs {{is quite different from}} the traditional concrete and reinforced concrete structures’ design. In the design for this kind of pavements, traffic conditions should be defined properly and considered an addition to the concrete and platform properties. There have been designing methods developed based on both experimental and mechanic foundations for concrete pavements. The most important ones of these methods are AASHTO (1993) and PCA (1984). In both design methods, it’s significant to know the maximum deflections and <b>maximum</b> <b>strains</b> the vehicles’ loads cause on the pavement. The calculation of this maximum deflections and <b>maximum</b> <b>strains</b> can be done via the finite element method or the closed formulas which have been developed by Westergaard. In this study, a user-friendly software has been developed based on AASHTO 1993, PCA 1984 design methods and Westergaard formulas. Thanks to this software, the user who wants to design the concrete pavement as concrete road slab can obtain the essential parameters automatically by entering the required data for the design. ...|$|R
