40|$|Resonant {{absorption}} of fast magnetoacoustic (FMA) waves in an inhomogeneous, weakly dissipative, one-dimensional planar, strongly anisotropic and dispersive plasma is investigated. The magnetic configuration {{consists of an}} inhomogeneous <b>magnetic</b> slab <b>sandwiched</b> between two regions of semi-infinite homogeneous magnetic plasmas. Laterally driven FMA waves penetrate the inhomogeneous slab interacting with the localised slow or Alfven waves present in the inhomogeneous layer and are partly reflected, dissipated and transmitted by this region. The presented research aims to find the coefficient of wave energy absorption under solar chromospheric and coronal conditions. Numerical results are analyzed to find the coefficient of wave energy absorption at both the slow and Alfven resonance positions. The mathematical derivations {{are based on the}} two simplifying assumptions that (i) nonlinearity is weak, and (ii) the thickness of the inhomogeneous layer is small in comparison to the wavelength of the wave, i. e. we employ the so-called long wavelength approximation. Slow resonance is found to be described by the nonlinear theory, while the dynamics at the Alfven resonance can be described within the linear framework. We introduce a new concept of coupled resonances, which occurs when two different resonances are in close proximity to each other, causing the incoming wave to act as though it has been influenced by the two resonances simultaneously. Our results show that the wave energy absorption is heavily dependent on the angle of the incident wave in combination with the inclination angle of the equilibrium magnetic field. In addition, it is found that FMA waves are very efficiently absorbed at the Alfven resonance under coronal conditions. Under chromospheric conditions the FMA waves are far less efficiently absorbed, despite an increase in efficiency due to the coupled resonances. Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures, Solar Physic...|$|R

This combines the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method for evaluating the current and the charge density {{with a description of}} the dynamics of the magnetization in terms of quasistatic thermally-activated transitions between stationary configurations. This method is then implemented in a tight-binding (TB) model with parameters chosen to simulate the main features of the electronic structures of magnetic transition metals.

Three sets of experiments have been conducted namely for (i) an aluminium beam, (ii) a MRE sandwich beam {{in the absence of a}} magnetic field and (iii) a MRE sandwich beam in the presence of a magnetic field. An electrodynamic shaker was used to excite each system and the corresponding displacement of the point mass was measured: for the third experiment (iii), an array of magnets has been placed at various distances away from the centre of the point mass to investigate the effect of changing stiffness and damping properties on the nonlinear dynamical behaviour.

40|$|This PhD {{research}} project encompasses {{an investigation into}} the controlled behaviour of magnetic domain walls in patterned ferromagnetic nanostructures using advanced nanofabrication techniques and characterised by the techniques of transmission electron microscopy. By fabricating Permalloy (Py) nanowires using electron beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) milling a comparative study has been made in which key differences in the magnetic behaviour have been identified. Nominally identical Py nanowires, with widths down to 150 nm, were fabricated onto a single electron transparent Si 3 N 4 membrane. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed to compare the nanostructures produced by these two techniques in what we believe is the first direct comparison of fabrication techniques for nominally identical nanowires. Both EBL and FIB methods produced high quality structures with edge roughness being of the order of the mean grain size 5 - 10 nm observed in the continuous films. However, significant grain growth was observed along the edges of the FIB patterned nanowires. Lorentz TEM in situ imaging was carried out to compare the magnetic behavior of the domain walls (DWs) in the patterned nanowires with anti-notches present to pin DWs. The overall process of DW pinning and depinning at the anti-notches showed consistent behaviour between nanowires fabricated by the two methods with the FIB structures having slightly lower characteristic fields compared to the EBL wires. However, a significant difference was observed in the formation of a vortex structure inside the anti-notches of the EBL nanowires after depinning of the domain walls. No vortex structure was seen inside the anti-notches of the FIB patterned nanowires. Whilst the two fabrication methods show that well defined structures can be produced for the dimensions considered here, the differences in the magnetic behavior for nominally identical structures may be an issue if such structures are to be used as conduits for domain walls in potential memory and logic applications. In this project, investigations were also carried out on ion irradiation of nanowires in which DW pinning sites arise from a controlled local modification of the magnetic properties of the nanowire. The nanowires comprised a multilayer thin film of Cr(3 nm) /Py(10 nm) /Cr(5 nm) in which the local magnetic properties were varied by irradiation with Ga ions in a focused ion beam microscope. Alloying Py with Cr is known to significantly change its magnetic properties. The nanowires were patterned and irradiated in the FIB, a single irradiation line was used to create a pinning site at an angle of 45 degrees to the wire length. Observation of the magnetic state of the nanowires was made using Lorentz microscopy. A transverse DW (TDW) was created {{at the end of a}} 500 nm wide nanowire and then a field applied to move it towards the pinning site. This TDW was pinned at the irradiated line for low doses. For lines with increased dose the TDW was often seen to transform into a vortex DW. The change of micromagnetic wall structure and the dependence of the subsequent depinning field on the dose and wall type were investigated together with initial simulation results modeling these features. In addition to the control of the DWs, our findings indicate potential for engineering and filtering DWs of certain types as they pass irradiated features at predefined locations in nanowires, dependent on the dose associated with these features in <b>magnetic</b> nanowires <b>sandwiched</b> between metallic layers.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an array of small quantum information processors sharing classical information can be used to solve selected computational problems, referred to as a type-II quantum computer. The first concrete implementation demonstrated here solves the diffusion equation, and it provides a test example from which to probe the strengths and limitations of this new computation paradigm. The NMR experiment consists of encoding a mass density onto an array of 16 two-qubit quantum information processors and then following the computation through 7 time steps of the algorithm. The results show a good agreement with the analytic solution for diffusive dynamics. From the numerical simulations of the NMR implementations, we explore two major error sources (1) the systematic error in the collision operator and (2) the linear approximation in the initialization. Since the mass density evolving under the Burgers equation develops sharp features over time, this is a stronger test of liquid state NMR implementations of type-II quantum computers than the previous example using the diffusion equation. Small systematic errors in the collision operator accumulate and swamp all other errors. We propose, and demonstrate, that the accumulation of this error can be avoided to a large extent by replacing the single collision operator with a set of operators, that have random errors and similar fidelities. (cont.) Experiments have been implemented on 16 two-qubit sites for eight successive time steps for the Burgers equation. The improvement in the experimental results suggests that more complicated modulation of error terms may offer further improvement. An alternative approach has been suggested to encode in the Fourier space (k-space) to remove the usage of this linear approximation. This new method also provides us a simple means to implement the streaming operation quantum mechanically by controlling <b>magnetic</b> field gradients <b>sandwiched</b> with RF pulses. Therefore, this method might serve as a new tool to probe the implementations of quantum lattice gas (QLG) algorithms. Experimental demonstration of the diffusion equation has been performed on 16 two-qubit sites for four successive time steps. Recently, much attention has been focused on constructing many identical simple processing elements arranged in a cellular automata architecture recently. It is likely that the early quantum hardware will be built in a similar manner. Quantum lattice gas algorithms therefore provide a bridge between such hardware and potential early algorithms. We propose a quantum lattice gas model similar to the one proposed by Margolus for the classical setting. (cont.) This quantum algorithm simulates the one-particle quantum random walk. The preliminary experimental design associated with the lattice gas model on a ring molecule is presented. The searches for the suitable pulses to construct the unitary operators, used in the implementations of the lattice gas model, are done and the results are encouraging. y Zhiying Chen. Thesis (Ph.
