5|$|According {{to genetic}} studies, the {{families}} Hyloidea, <b>Microhylidae,</b> and the clade Natatanura (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, {{soon after the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event associated with the Chicxulub impactor. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microhylidae</b> and Ranidae {{make up a}} {{small amount}} of the Australian frog fauna, with less than 20 species in <b>Microhylidae</b> and one species of Ranidae. The {{majority}} of the species within these families are found throughout the world, with Australia making up a small portion of their diversity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the origins}} of <b>Microhylidae</b> in New Guinea {{are very similar to}} the Ranids, there is much more diversity. The Microhylids are {{represented}} by twelve genera in New Guinea, four of which are endemic.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{families}} which are widely {{distributed throughout the}} northern hemisphere which only inhabit far northern Australia. These are <b>Microhylidae</b> and the Ranidae. Two of the 59 genera of <b>Microhylidae,</b> and only one of approximately 750 species of Ranidae are native to Australia. Although both these families are widely distributed throughout the world, they have only recently reached Australia and New Guinea. This is because the Australian continent has remained isolated since its separation from Antarctica, and as it has drifted north towards Asia, many species {{have been able to}} cross into New Guinea, and eventually Australia. However, most of the ecological niches filled by frogs had been filled before the ranids and microhylids reached Australia, so {{only a limited number of}} species have established.|$|E
25|$|The {{amphibians}} of New Guinea {{consist of}} a highly diverse group of species, with over 320 described species, and many species still to be described. The amphibians of New Guinea, like most Gondwanan continents, are restricted {{to those of the}} order Anura, known as frogs and toads. There are six families represented in New Guinea. Four of these: Myobatrachidae, Hylidae, Ranidae and <b>Microhylidae</b> are native. Two specimens of Rhacophoridae, a family well represented in Asia, were discovered in 1926. They were thought to be introduced by humans, and to have become extinct on the island. The other family, Bufonidae, is only represented by two species: the cane toad (Rhinella marina) and the Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus). The cane toad was introduced from Australia in 1937 to control hawk moth larvae, which were eating sweet potato crops; they have since become common in non-forested areas. The common Asiatic toad was accidentally introduced, and is very abundant in a small area in the north-west, and may be spreading further throughout the island.|$|E
500|$|Frogs in the {{families}} Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and <b>Microhylidae</b> have short back legs {{and tend to}} walk rather than jump. When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) {{has been described as}} having a gait that is [...] "a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length". In an experiment, Fowler's toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.|$|E
500|$|Tree frogs live {{high in the}} canopy, {{where they}} {{scramble}} around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The [...] "true" [...] tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae, but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of convergent evolution. These include the glass frogs (Centrolenidae), the bush frogs (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (<b>Microhylidae),</b> and the shrub frogs (Rhacophoridae). Most tree frogs are under [...] in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal epidermal cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete mucus. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis {{on the surface and}} also surface tension and viscosity. Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed. Some members of the subfamily Phyllomedusinae have opposable toes on their feet. The reticulated leaf frog (Phyllomedusa ayeaye) has a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{has four}} {{families}} of native frogs and one introduced toad, the cane toad. In 1935 the cane toad {{was introduced to}} Australia in a failed attempt to control pests in sugarcane crops. It has since become a devastating pest, spreading across northern Australia. As well as competing with native insectivores for food, the cane toad produces a venom that is toxic to native fauna, {{as well as to}} humans. The Myobatrachidae, or southern frogs, are Australia's largest group of frogs, with 112 species classified into anywhere from 17 to 22 genera. A notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered Corroboree frog. The tree frogs, from family Hylidae, are common in high rainfall areas on the north and east coasts; there are 77 Australian species from three genera. The 18 species from two genera of the <b>Microhylidae</b> frogs are restricted to the rainforests of northern Australia and nearby habitats; the smallest species, the scanty frog, is from this family. There is a single species from the world's dominant frog group, family Ranidae — the Australian wood frog — which only occurs in the Queensland rainforests. As elsewhere, there has been a precipitous decline in Australia's frog populations in recent years. [...] Although the full reasons for the decline are uncertain, it can be at least partly attributed to the fatal amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis. Another theory for the decline might be, as research shows, that species from the Southern Hemisphere are on average 4.6 million years old, compared to an average 2.9 million years old for the Northern Hemisphere: Researchers believe this age difference is because of the history of severe ice ages in the Northern Hemisphere, which may drive older species to extinction.|$|E
