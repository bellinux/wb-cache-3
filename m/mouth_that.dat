5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} <b>mouth,</b> <b>that</b> distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|Designed by {{visual effects}} artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was {{inspired}} by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.|$|E
5|$|The first Castellania of Valletta was {{demolished}} in the mid-18th century {{on orders}} of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, as he despised its austere architecture and wanted a symbolic building of his absolutism. There are claims based on word of <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> in the 18th century {{the courts and}} tribunals were housed at 254, St. Paul's Street (now known as Europe House, and occupied by {{the offices of the}} European Commission and the European Parliament), plausibly between 1757 and 1760, however this is considered as a hearsay.|$|E

5|$|The {{internal}} cavity forms: a <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> {{can usually}} be closed by muscles; a pharynx ("throat"); a wider area in the center {{that acts as a}} stomach; and a system of internal canals. These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal: the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles, if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores. The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis. The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and well-developed muscles. In other parts of the canal system, the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), germ cells that produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence. The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals, punctuated by ciliary rosettes, pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (cave hyena subspecies) is {{depicted}} in {{a few examples of}} Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's steeped profile, it is thought that the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a hyena. In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and {{is depicted in}} profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ariège shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal’s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the spotted hyena, as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> evokes a smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a spotted hyena based on its broad muzzle and long neck.|$|E

25|$|The {{tongue is}} {{skeletal}} muscle {{on the floor}} of the <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis.|$|E

Most {{patients}} tolerate the procedure with only topical anesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed.|$|E

5000|$|Williston noticed that, over {{evolutionary}} time, the modular and serially repeated parts distinguishing animal groups exhibited {{trends in}} numbers and types. For instance, ancient vertebrates {{were characterized by}} <b>mouths</b> <b>that</b> contained mostly similar teeth, whereas recent vertebrates are characterized by <b>mouths</b> <b>that</b> contain many different teeth, adapted for biting, tearing, and compacting food; differences ultimately characterized different diets, with carnivores bearing incisors and canines and grazers bearing mostly molars. So pronounced were these trends that Williston (1914) declared that [...] "it is also a law in evolution that the parts in an organism tend toward reduction in number, with the fewer parts greatly specialized in function".|$|R
25|$|A {{flattened}} head {{allows for}} digging through the substrate {{as well as}} perhaps serving as a hydrofoil. Some have a <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> can expand to a large size and contains no incisiform teeth; catfish generally feed through suction or gulping rather than biting and cutting prey. However, some families, notably Loricariidae and Astroblepidae, have a suckermouth {{that allows them to}} fasten themselves to objects in fast-moving water. Catfish also have a maxilla reduced to a support for barbels; this means that they are unable to protrude their mouths as other fish such as carp.|$|E
25|$|Birdo is a pink, {{anthropomorphic}} {{creature who}} wears a red hairbow, and has a round <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> can fire eggs as projectiles. Birdo also wears a large diamond ring. In the early version of Birdo, the character had an orange tone. Birdo's name was mistakenly switched with another Super Mario Bros. 2 enemy, Ostro, both in the manual {{and in the end}} credits. The mistake persisted in the version of Super Mario Bros. 2 included in the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, but was corrected in the Game Boy Advance re-release titled Super Mario Advance.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species may}} show {{morphological}} adaptations, {{such as a}} flat head and an upturned <b>mouth,</b> <b>that</b> allow them to perform ASR without breaking the water surface (which would make them more visible to aerial predators). One example is the mummichog, whose upturned mouth suggests surface feeding, but whose feeding habits are not particularly restricted to the surface. In the tambaqui, a South American species, exposure to hypoxia induces within hours the development of additional blood vessels inside the lower lip, enhancing its ability to take up oxygen during ASR. Swimming upside down may also help fishes perform ASR, as in some upside-down catfish.|$|E

25|$|The polyp is {{generally}} a small stalk with a <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> is ringed by upward-facing tentacles. The polyps resemble the closely related Cnidaria anthozoan (sea anemones and corals) polyps. The jellyfish polyp may be sessile, {{living on the}} bottom or on another substrate such as floats or boat hulls, {{or it may be}} free-floating or attached to tiny bits of free-living plankton or rarely, fish or other invertebrates. Polyps may be solitary or colonial. Polyp colonies form by strobilation, in which multiple polyps share a common stomach cavity. Most polyps are only millimeters in size. They feed continuously. The polyp stage may last for years.|$|E
25|$|Court Square, {{previously}} called Long Island City−Court Square, is {{the northernmost}} {{station on the}} IND Crosstown Line and the northern terminal for G trains at all times. Although G service terminates here, the tracks themselves continue north and feed into the Queens Boulevard main line just south of Queens Plaza. This section of track is not used in regular service, though until April 19, 2010, trains traveled over this connection to continue to Forest Hills–71st Avenue at various times of the day. Just south of the station, there is a bell <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> splits the 2 tracks into 3 tracks then again into 2. The 3rd track is used for storage during rush hours.|$|E
25|$|A crocodile’s {{physical}} traits {{allow it}} to be a successful predator. Its external morphology is a sign of its aquatic and predatory lifestyle. Its streamlined body enables it to swim swiftly; it also tucks its feet to the side while swimming, making it faster by decreasing water resistance. Crocodiles have webbed feet which, though not used to propel them through the water, allow them to make fast turns and sudden moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallower water where the animals sometimes move around by walking. Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue {{at the back of the}} <b>mouth</b> <b>that</b> blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence.|$|E
