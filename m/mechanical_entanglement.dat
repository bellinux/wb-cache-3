We show that the parameter regime where the system is unstable without OPAs, such as relatively high laser intensity and blue detuning, can be exploited to build the steady-state <b>mechanical</b> <b>entanglement</b> by modulating the parametric gain. The application of OPAs is helpful to preserve the <b>mechanical</b> <b>entanglement</b> suffered from the dissipation at some finite temperature.

The scheme exploits the quantum {{effects of radiation}} pressure and {{it is based on}} a novel application of entanglement swapping, where standard optical measurements are used to change the "nature" of the entanglement rather than only re-scale it over the distance. The scheme is presented by first solving the general problem of entanglement swapping between arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states, for which simple input-output formulas for the correlation matrices and entanglement measures are derived.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent {{studies have focused on}} novel {{features}} in game theory when the games are played using quantum <b>mechanical</b> toolbox (<b>entanglement,</b> unitary operators, measurement). Researchers have concentrated in two-player-two strategy, 2 x 2, dilemma containing classical games, and transferred them into quantum realm showing that in quantum pure strategies dilemmas in such games can be resolved if entanglement is distributed between the players armed with quantum operations. Moreover, {{it became clear that the}} players receive the highest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise impossible in classical pure strategies. Encouraged by the observation of rich dynamics of physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of entanglement in quantum versions of 2 x 2 games, it became generally accepted that quantum versions can be easily extended to N-player situations by simply allowing N-partite entangled states. In this article, however, we show that this is not generally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in quantum domain imposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum operators. We propose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical versions of games, and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a physical realization. We give examples of entangled states that can and cannot be used, and the characteristics of quantum operators used as strategies. Comment: 5 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} {{quantum limit}} constrains {{the precision of}} an oscillator position measurement.

However, a measurement of only a single quadrature of the oscillator can evade the back-action and be made with arbitrary precision. Here we demonstrate quantum back-action evading measurements of a collective quadrature of two mechanical oscillators, both coupled to a common microwave cavity. The work allows for quantum state tomography of two mechanical oscillators, and provides a foundation for macroscopic <b>mechanical</b> <b>entanglement</b> and force sensing beyond conventional quantum limits.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{entanglement}} dynamics of two coupled mechanical oscillators, within a modulated optomechanical system.

Moreover, we have shown that this entanglement dynamics is strongly related to the stability of the normal modes. Taking mechanical damping effects into account, an analytical expression corresponding to the critical mechanical coupling strength, where the transition from stationary to dynamical entanglement occurs is also reported. The proposed scheme is analysed with experimentally realistic parameters, making it a promising mean to realize macroscopic quantum entanglement within current state-of-the-art experimental setups...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{remarkable}} {{advances have}} been made in coupling a number of high-Q modes of nano-mechanical systems to high-finesse optical cavities, with the goal of reaching regimes in which quantum behavior can be observed and leveraged toward new applications. To reach this regime, the coupling between these systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic <b>mechanical</b> system or <b>entanglement</b> generation between spatially separate systems, even in room-temperature environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere...|$|R
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} a three-mode optomechanical {{system where}} two mechanical oscillators are coupled {{to a single}} cavity mode. By using two-tone (i. e. amplitude-modulated) driving of the cavity, {{it is possible to}} couple the cavity to a single collective quadrature of the mechanical oscillators. In such a way, a back-action-evading measurement of the collective mechanical quadrature is possible. We discuss how this can allow one to measure both quadratures of a mechanical force beyond the full quantum limit, paying close attention to the role of dissipation and experimental imperfections. We also describe how this scheme allows one to generate steady-state mechanical entanglement; namely, one can conditionally prepare an entangled, two-mode squeezed <b>mechanical</b> state. This <b>entanglement</b> can be verified directly from the measurement record by applying a generalized version of Duan's inequality; we also discuss how feedback can be used to produce unconditional entanglement.

40|$|Although {{electrons}} and photons {{produce the same}} interference patterns in the two-slit experiments, the description of these patters is markedly different. This difference was analyzed by Bohm. Later on Sanz and Miret-Artes and others were able to squeeze the differences to zero. Fortunately, they left some room for developments presented in this Letter. We noticed that {{in the absence of}} sources the electromagnetic field can be represented by the complex scalar field. It is demonstrated that the same fields are being used in the non relativistic Schrödinger equation. The connection between the electromagnetic and Schrödinger fields allows to study the topology of zero sets (Chladni patterns) of Schrödinger eigenfunctions. The existence of these patterns is contingent upon the existence of eigenvalues of multiplicity higher than one. This is permissible only in Schrödinger's version of quantum mechanics. Presence of multiplicities is making quantum <b>mechanical</b> and topological <b>entanglements</b> equivalent. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

40|$|In this review, we briefly {{overview}} {{recent works}} on hybrid (nano) opto-mechanical systems that contain both mechanical oscillators and diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers.

The second one is an optically trapped nano-diamond with a build-in nitrogen-vacancy center.

40|$|Dynamical {{evolution}} of quantum <b>mechanical</b> squeezing and <b>entanglement</b> in a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate (TBEC) with an adiabatic, time-varying Raman coupling is studied by finding analytical expressions for these quantities. In particular, we study the entanglement between the {{atoms in the}} condensate {{as well as that}} between the two modes. The nature of the enhanced quantum correlations in TBEC is clarified by considering squeezing and entanglement both with and without the nonlinear interaction turned on; it is found that entanglement approaching maximal value can be achieved with the nonlinear interactions present. Somewhat counter-intuitively, greater squeezing is found in the absence of nonlinear interactions. This is due to the collapses and revivals of the TBEC quantum state induced by the nonlinear interactions. In addition, results involving the self-trapping phase state of TBEC indicate potential for creating a dynamically stable, macroscopic entangled quantum state which is relatively robust with respect to atom number fluctuations.

We discuss both the pure state case and the mixed state case (Werner state) with special regard to separability. The power-log entropy is a non-additive entropy and we derive a pseudo additivity condition. The conditional entropy thus defined can be negative for entangled states unlike the classical entropy. The zero leads to the separability criterion. Our results show that for Werner states (with x component of the pure state), a rapid convergence to x = 1 / 3 as n increases, thus restoring the Pere’s criterion.
