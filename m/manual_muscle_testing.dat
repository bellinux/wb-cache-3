40|$|Background: Several {{tests to}} assist {{it in the}} diagnoses of rota- tor cuff {{impairment}} have been described in the literature but controversy still exists as {{to the accuracy of}} these tests. A study was therefore conducted to determine the reliability of the rotator cuff <b>muscle</b> <b>tests</b> (empty can, full can, lift off and external rotation) as a diagnostic tool. Methodology: Fifty three patients experiencing shoulder pain were assessedusing <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tests</b> (empty can; full can; lift off and external rotationtests). Both pain and weakness were recorded using numerical scales adapted from tests performed by Itoi et al, (1999). These results were compared to ultrasonic diagnoses made by a surgeon. Informed consent was obtained and anonymity was ensured for all participants. Results: A test was false positive when ultrasonic diagnosis indicated no tear in the muscle (although oedema or calcification may have been present), but the <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>test</b> was positive regarding pain and weakness. A test on the other hand was false negative when the ultrasonic diagnosis indicated a muscle tear but the <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tests</b> indicated no pain or muscle weakness. Reliability was tested using sensitivity and specificity tests. The sensitivity of all four tests was high (80 %), but the specificity was low (20 % to 40 %), implying {{that a large number of}} false positive diagnoses can be made. The major contributors to the false positive results were sub-acromial sub-deltoid bursitis and a decreased acromio-humeral space. When considering pain alone for a positive result the correlation increased a  little, however, taking both pain and muscle weakness into account, the correlation increased even more. Conclusion: The <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tests</b> were not as reliable as expected, but concurrent pathologies may be the main factor influencing the results of the tests. The combination of muscle strength and pain could be recommended as criteria for a positive test. The empty can and full can tests could both be recommended in predicting a torn supraspinatus tendon, as they were equally sensitive</em...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of Applied Kinesiology {{techniques}} {{based on}} <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tests</b> {{relies on the}} relationship between muscles and acupuncture meridians. Applied Kinesiology detects body dysfunctions based on changes in muscle tone. Muscle tonification or inhibition within the test setting can be achieved with selected acupoints. These acupoints belong to either the same meridian or related meridians. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze muscle sedation and tonification by means of surface electromyography. Methods <b>Manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out using standard Applied Kinesiology (AK) techniques. The investigation included basic AK procedures such as sedation and tonification with specific acupoints. The sedation and tonification acupoints were selected from related meridians according to the Five Elements. The tonification effect of these acupoints was also tested while interfering effects were induced by manual stimulation of scars. The effects of selective neural therapy, i. e. individually tested and selected anesthetic agent, for the treatment of scars were also studied. The characteristics of muscle action were documented by surface electromyographys (sEMG). Results The sEMG data showed a diminution of signal intensity when sedation was used. Graded sedation resulted in a graded diminution of signal amplitude. Graded increase in signal amplitude was observed when antique acupuncture points were used for tonification. The tactile stretch stimulus of scars localized in meridian-independent places produced diminution of signal intensity on a reference muscle, similar to sedation. These changes, however, were not corrected by tonification acupoints. Correction of these interferences was achieved by lesion specific neural therapy with local anesthetics. Conclusion We demonstrated the central working principles, i. e. sedation and tonification, of Applied Kinesiology through the use of specific acupoints that have an influence on <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tests.</b> Sedation decreases RMS signal in sEMG, whereas tonification increases it. Interfering stimuli from scars were corrected by selective neural therapy. </p...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the presence of spinal cord hemorrhage and the size and location of spinal cord edema on MR images is predictive of functional recovery in survivors of cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: The degree of damage to the cervical spinal cord was measured on the MR images of 49 patients who underwent imaging within 72 hours of sustaining SCI. The effects of hemorrhage and length/location of edema on changes in the value of the motor scale of the functional independence measure (FIM) were assessed on admission to and discharge from rehabilitation.

It is used to diagnose diseases, to evaluate and compare treatments, to document progression of muscle strength, and to provide feedback during the rehabilitation process.

50|$|The goal of {{physical}} and occupational therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophyis to obtain {{a clear understanding of}} the individual, of their social circumstances and of their environment in order to develop a treatment plan that will improve their quality of life.

This is related to the effects of the disorder, such as decreased mobility; decreased strength and postural stability; progressive deterioration of upper-limb function; and contractures. Occupational and physical therapists address an individual's limitations using meaningful occupations and by grading the activity, by using different assessments and resources such as splinting, bracing, <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>testing</b> (MMT), ROM, postural intervention and equipment prescription.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} outcome of <b>muscle</b> {{strength}} with <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> strength <b>testing</b> grip and pinch strength measurements and a dynamometer which allows for measurements of the intrinsic muscles of the hand in isolation (the Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer, RIHM). Methods: Thirty-four patients more than 2 years after ulnar and/or median nerve injury. Muscle strength was evaluated using <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> strength <b>testing</b> (MMST), grip, pinch and intrinsic muscle strength measurements. Results: <b>Manual</b> <b>muscle</b> strength <b>testing</b> showed that most muscles recover to grade 3 or 4. Average grip strength recovery, as percentage of the uninjured hand, was 83 %. Pinch strength recovery was 75 %, 58 % and 39 % in patients with ulnar, median and combined nerve injuries, respectively. The RIHM measurements revealed a poor recovery of the ulnar nerve innervated muscles in particular (26 - 37 %). No significant correlation (Pearson) {{was found between the}} measurements of the RIHM and grip strength. Pinch strength was significantly correlated with strength of the abduction of thumb and opposition of the thumb strength (r 0. 55 and 0. 72, p = 0. 026, 0. 002) as measured with the RIHM. Conclusion: While <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> strength <b>testing</b> and grip strength measurements show a reasonable to good recovery, measurements of the intrinsic muscles by means of the RIHM showed poor recovery of intrinsic muscle strength after peripheral nerve injury.

Methods: Initially, the literature review was carried out to {{identify the}} tools used in scientific research. The search was conducted in the following databases: Virtual Health Library (VHL), Pedro, and PubMed. Studies published between 1990 and 2016 were considered and selected, depicting an evaluation of muscle strength as an endpoint or for characterization of the sample. Next, a survey was carried out with physiotherapists to identify the instruments used for evaluation in clinical practice, and the degree of satisfaction of professionals with respect to them. Results: 495 studies were found; 93 were included for qualitative evaluation. In the studies, we verified the use of <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>test</b> with different graduation systems, isokinetic dynamometer, hand-held dynamometer, and manual dynamometer. In clinical practice, the <b>manual</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>test</b> using the motor score recommended by the American Spinal Cord Injury Association was the most used method, despite the limitations highlighted by the physiotherapists interviewed.

The tools available and currently used have important limitations, which were highlighted by the professionals interviewed. No instrument depicts direct relationship of muscle strength and functionality of the subject.
