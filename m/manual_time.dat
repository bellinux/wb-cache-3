50|$|The Mamiya ZM, {{introduced}} in 1982, was essentially an advanced {{version of the}} ZE-2, {{with some of the}} features of the ZE-X. It was the last Mamiya 135-film camera produced. It had an aperture-priority automatic time control, based on center-weighted TTL readings, an automatic shutter-speed range from 4 seconds to 1/1000, and a manual range from 2 seconds to 1/1000. Visual and audio signals indicated over- or under-exposure, pending battery failure, or excessive camera shake.

50|$|At the 2011 Sprint Bathurst event, {{he set a}} {{blistering}} time of 2.04.95 around the famous Mount Panorama circuit. This was a monumental effort {{at the time as}} it was a full 2 seconds clear of any V8 Supercar lap time and comparable to the Formula 3 lap record set in the following year. This time so amazed the officials that they initially removed it from the timing screens as they believed it to be in error.

Electronic fuzes are designed use electronic setters to transfer data electronically, early ones required an electrical contact between the fuze and the setter. These have been superseded by induction fuze setters that do not require physical contact with the fuze. Electronic setters may also check fuze functioning in a ‘Go/No Go’ test.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{track and}} field statisticians use a {{conversion}} factor estimate of 0.24 seconds added to any hand-timed mark in the 100 m or 200 m event, and 0.14 seconds to any hand-timed mark in the 400 m or longer event. These conversion factors are only applicable for comparing marks {{from a variety of}} sources, but are not acceptable for Record purposes. In the case of comparing an adjusted <b>manual</b> <b>time</b> to FAT timing, an original FAT time being equivalent, the FAT time will be considered more accurate, and thus the athlete will be given the higher seed, or comparison ranking. This old method of converting times dates back to when FAT systems were much less common.

AIMS Oesophageal clearance in endoscopy-negative heartburn was assessed to detect differences in bolus clearance time among patients sub-grouped according to impedance-pH findings. METHODS In 118 consecutive endoscopy-negative heartburn patients impedance-pH monitoring was performed off-therapy. Acid exposure time, number of refluxes, baseline impedance, post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index and both automated and <b>manual</b> bolus clearance <b>time</b> were calculated. Patients were sub-grouped into pH/impedance positive (abnormal acid exposure and/or number of refluxes) and pH/impedance negative (normal acid exposure {{and number of}} refluxes), the former further subdivided {{on the basis of}} abnormal/normal acid exposure time (pH+/-) and abnormal/normal number of refluxes (impedance+/-).

40|$|The creation, {{deployment}} {{and management}} of network architecture is <b>manual,</b> <b>time</b> consuming and costly. To the network architect the creation process is ad-hoc in nature, based on hand crafting small-scale network prototypes that evolve toward wide scale deployment. We envision a different paradigm where `spawning networks' are capable of profiling, spawning, architecting and managing distinct virtual network architecture on-the-fly. This paper {{provides an overview of}} a virtual network kernel and its life cycle of spawning virtual networks, and focuses particularly on the role of resource management of virtual networks. We describe, virtuosity, a virtual network resource management system that minimizes the complexity of handling multiple spawned virtual networks that operate over multiple timescales. Virtuosity is driven by per-virtual network policy exerting control and management over multiple spawned virtual networks (characterized by a set of resources) and their spawned architectur [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The North American {{interconnected}} {{power systems}} continuously attempt to hold power system time {{as close to}} standard time as possible. All inherent problems associated with normal power system operation make this a difficult task. System time is presently allowed to deviate from standard time by up to two seconds before steps are taken to correct the time error. Present correction methods are <b>manual,</b> <b>time</b> consuming and add to existing operating problems which leads us {{to the conclusion that}} the advantages of power system interconnection impose more stringent requirements on load and frequency control. Without precise control of generation and frequency, undesired tie-line flows will result. The Tie-Line-Bias mode of control is examined in detail, with emphasis on present means of controlling system time error. A design concept for automatic system time correction is presented which if accepted by the utilities would eliminate manual initiation of frequency offset periods...|$|E
40|$|Dialogue acts {{model the}} intent {{underlying}} dialogue moves.

Automatically classifying these dialogue acts is a challenging task, traditionally addressed with supervised classification techniques requiring substantial <b>manual</b> <b>time</b> and effort. There is growing interest in unsupervised dialogue act classification to address this limitation. This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework, query-likelihood clustering, for classifying student dialogue acts. This framework combines automated natural language processing with clustering and a novel adaptation of an information retrieval technique. Evaluation against manually labeled dialogue acts on a tutorial dialogue corpus in the domain of introductory computer science demonstrates that the proposed technique outperforms existing approaches. The results indicate that this technique holds promise for automatically understanding corpora of tutorial dialogue and for building adaptive dialogue systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{spite of}} all {{advancement}} in software testing, debugging remains a labor-intensive, <b>manual,</b> <b>time</b> consuming, and error prone process. A candidate solution to enhance debugging process is to fuse it with testing process. To achieve this integration, a possible solution may be categorizing common software tests and errors followed by the effort on fixing the errors through general solutions for each test/error pair. Our approach {{to address this issue}} is based on Christopher Alexander’s pattern and pattern language concepts. The patterns in this language are grouped into three major sections and connect the three concepts of test, error, and debug. These patterns and their hierarchical relationship shape a pattern language that introduces a solution to solve software errors in a known testing context. Finally, we will introduce our developed framework ADE as a sample implementation to support a pattern of proposed language, which aims to automate the whole process of evolving software design via evolutionary methods...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} flow {{injection system}} for the determination of dissolved silver at ultratrace concentrations in seawater, and controlled under Lab VIEW™, is described. The flow injection system allows online processing of seawater samples before their analysis using a magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MS-ICP-MS) instrument. Samples were analysed with a minimum amount of manipulation, thereby {{reducing the risk of}} contamination. In addition, the flow injection approach with incorporation of an anion exchange minicolumn allowed ready removal of analytical interferences caused by the saline matrix. The software allowed full control of all flow injection components (valves and pumps) and removed <b>manual</b> <b>time</b> control and, therefore, operator errors. The optimized system was capable of five sample injections per h, including preconcentration and wash steps. The limit of detection was 0. 5 pM for a 240 -s sample load time, which allowed the determination of dissolved silver in open ocean waters, where picomolar concentration levels are typically encountered...|$|E
