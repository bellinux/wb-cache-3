25|$|Just {{like the}} {{cornified}} layer of epidermis and of any mammalian nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by <b>mitotic</b> <b>activity</b> in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E

40|$|A {{systemic}} {{and quantitative}} study {{was performed to}} examine whether different levels of <b>mitotic</b> <b>activities,</b> assessed by the percentage of S-phase cells {{at any given time}} point, existed at different physical regions of human embryonic stem (hES) cell colonies at 2, 4, 6 days after cell passaging. Mitotically active cells were identified by the positive incorporation of 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) within their newly synthesized DNA. Our data indicated that mitotically active cells were often distributed as clusters randomly across the colonies within the examined growth period, presumably resulting from local deposition of newly divided cells. This latter notion was further demonstrated by the confined growth of enhanced green florescence protein (EGFP) expressing cells amongst non-GFP expressing cells. Furthermore, the overall percentage of mitotically active cells remained constantly at about 50 % throughout the 6 -day culture period, indicating <b>mitotic</b> <b>activities</b> of hES cell cultures were time-independent under current growth conditions...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{cells in}} the colon are {{arranged}} in cylindrical structures called crypts in which cellular proliferation and migration are tightly regulated. We hypothesized that the proliferation patterns of cells may determine the stability of crypts {{as well as the}} rates of somatic evolution towards colorectal tumorigenesis. Here, we propose a linear process model of colonic epithelial cells that explicitly takes into account the proliferation kinetics of cells as a function of cell position within the crypt. Our results indicate that proliferation kinetics has significant influence on the speed of cell movement, kinetics of mutation propagation, and sensitivity of the system to selective effects of mutated cells. We found that, of all proliferation curves tested, those with <b>mitotic</b> <b>activities</b> concentrated near the stem cell, including the actual proliferation kinetics determined in in vivo labeling experiments, have a greater ability of delaying the rate of mutation accumulation in colonic stem cells compared to hypothetical proliferation curves with <b>mitotic</b> <b>activities</b> focused {{near the top of the}} crypt column.

2500|$|The {{crucian carp}} is one species able to remodel its gill {{filaments}} {{in response to}} hypoxia. Their inter-lamellar cells have high rates of <b>mitotic</b> <b>activity</b> which are influenced by both hypoxia and temperature. [...] In cold (15nbsp&°C) water the crucian carp has more ILCM, but when the temperature is increased to 25nbsp&°C the ILCM is removed, just {{as it would be}} in hypoxic conditions. [...] This same transition in gill morphology occurs in the goldfish when the temperature was raised from 7.5nbsp&°C to 15nbsp&°C. [...] This difference {{may be due to the}} temperature regimes that these fish are typically found in, or there could be an underlying protective mechanism to prevent a loss of ion balance in stressful temperatures. [...] Temperature also affects the speed at which the gills can be remodelled: for example, at 20nbsp&°C in hypoxia, the crucian carp can completely remove its ILCM in 6 hours, whereas at 8nbsp&°C, the same process takes 3–7 days. [...] The ILCM is likely removed by apoptosis, but it is possible that when the fish is faced with the double stress of hypoxia at high temperature, the lamellae may be lost by physical degradation. Covering the gill lamellae may protect species like the crucian carp from parasites and environmental toxins during normoxia by limiting their surface area for inward diffusion while still maintaining oxygen transport due to an extremely high hemoglobin oxygen binding affinity.|$|E

30|$|Cytokinins are {{essential}} to plant growth and development, especially in regulating <b>mitotic</b> <b>activities</b> (Emery and Atkins 2006). In E. ibaguense, an increase of cytokinin activity coincides with fertilization and commencement of embryo development (Taylor et al. 1982). Since by that time cell division in the fruit wall has more or less completed, the increase in cytokinin activity is most likely related to embryo development (Taylor et al. 1982). However, unlike the majority of flowering plants, cytokinin activity remains high throughout maturation. Is this a unique phenomenon common to orchids?

50|$|As motile cells {{come into}} contact in {{confluent}} cultures, they exhibit decreased mobility and <b>mitotic</b> <b>activity</b> over time. Interestingly, exponential growth {{has been shown to}} occur between colonies in contact for numerous days, with the inhibition of <b>mitotic</b> <b>activity</b> occurring far later. This delay between cell-cell contact and onset of proliferation inhibition is shortened as the culture becomes more confluent. Thus, it may be reasonably concluded that cell-cell contact is an essential condition for contact inhibition of proliferation, but is by itself insufficient for mitotic inhibition. In addition to making contact with other cells, the contact-inhibited cells must also be forced to reduce its cell area under the mechanical stress and constraints imposed by surrounding cells. Indeed, {{it has been suggested that}} mechanical tension acts as an inhibitory signal for mitosis. Moreover, it is important to note that such an inhibition of <b>mitotic</b> <b>activity</b> is a local phenomenon; it occurs between a select few cells in a likely heterogeneous culture.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} {{high-density}} DNA microarrays {{to provide an}} analysis of gene regulation during the mammalian cell cycle {{and the role of}} E 2 F in this process. Cell cycle analysis was facilitated by a combined examination of gene control in serum-stimulated fibroblasts and cells synchronized at G 1 /S by hydroxyurea block that were then released to proceed through the cell cycle. The latter approach (G 1 /S synchronization) is critical for rigorously maintaining cell synchrony for unambiguous analysis of gene regulation in later stages of the cell cycle. Analysis of these samples identified seven distinct clusters of genes that exhibit unique patterns of expression. Genes tend to cluster within these groups based on common function and the time during the cell cycle that the activity is required. Placed in this context, the analysis of genes induced by E 2 F proteins identified genes or expressed sequence tags not previously described as regulated by E 2 F proteins; surprisingly, many of these encode proteins known to function during mitosis. A comparison of the E 2 F-induced genes with the patterns of cell growth-regulated gene expression revealed that virtually all of the E 2 F-induced genes are found in only two of the cell cycle clusters; one group was regulated at G 1 /S, and the second group, which included the <b>mitotic</b> <b>activities,</b> was regulated at G 2.

Two cDNAs, LeKRP 1 and LeKRP 2, encoding tomato CDK inhibitors were isolated. The LeKRP 1 and LeKRP 2 transcript expression was shown to be enhanced in the differentiating cells of the gel undergoing endoreduplication. At the translational level, LeKRP 1 was shown to accumulate in the gel tissue and to participate in the inhibition of the CDK-cyclin kinase activities occurring in endoreduplicating cells of the gel tissue.

The ability of apical protocorm cells to divide make them ideal explants for micropropagation and transformation studies. Rapid divisions occur ‘naturally’ at the meristematic zone allowing for better responses to exogenously applied plant growth regulators. Protocorm cells still retain ‘embryogenic’ properties, under appropriate in vitro culture conditions. Cells at the apical end can give rise to protocorm-like bodies (PLBs) directly {{from the surface of}} protocorms or indirectly through the formation of organogenic calli. The structural organization and developmental properties of PLBs are similar to protocorms in general. PLBs are considered as ‘somatic embryos’ of orchids. Lee et al. (2013) demonstrated that during PLB formation, there is a transient formation of storage proteins within PLB cells. This clearly indicates that PLBs retain features of zygotic embryo development, albeit transient in nature. In an in vitro environment, PLBs quickly “germinate” and function as protocorms, giving rise to plantlets.|$|R
