40|$|An {{objective}} function {{is a key}} component of a strategic portfolio management model used to determine the optimal allocations of assets and, possibly, their associated liabilities over some investment horizon. The author discusses investment philosophies and perspectives for the <b>management</b> of foreign <b>reserves,</b> and investigates how to translate the three common policy objectives for reserves (liquidity, safety, and return) into {{objective function}}s for strategic <b>reserves</b> <b>management.</b> Stochastic programming is identified as an advantageous modelling framework to capture the objectives of foreign <b>reserves</b> <b>management,</b> and a strategic <b>reserves</b> <b>management</b> model is illustrated that trades off expected net returns with costs and liquidity issues related to a potential liquidation of a portion of the portfolio.

40|$|In recent years, {{issues related}} to the {{management}} of foreign exchange reserves have gained prominence, and <b>reserve</b> <b>management</b> practices have evolved rapidly. Against this background, the Monetary and Economic Department of the Bank for International Settlements organised an ad hoc meeting of senior central bankers from both industrial and emerging market countries responsible for the <b>management</b> of <b>reserves,</b> which took place on 1 - 2 March 2007. The meeting covered key issues in foreign exchange <b>reserve</b> <b>management,</b> including the broad framework in which it is conducted, asset allocation at the strategic, tactical and portfolio management levels, risk measurement and management, organisational structures and disclosure. This paper was prepared as background and provides a general framework to help organise the various issues that arise in the context of FX <b>reserve</b> <b>management.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Some {{scientists}} {{have found that the}} umbrella effect provides a simpler way to manage ecological communities. Others feel that a combination of other tools establish better land <b>management</b> <b>reserves</b> to help protect more species than just using umbrella species alone. Individual invertebrate species can be good umbrella species because they can protect older, unique ecosystems. There have been cases where umbrella species have protected a large amount of area which has been beneficial to surrounding species such as the northern spotted owl.|$|R

There are four reservoirs within the town (Belmont, Plunkett, Cleveland Brook and a portion of the Windsor Reservoir), as well as part of Muddy Pond in the south and most of Ashmere Lake along the Peru town line. The town, which contains the peak of Tully Mountain along the western border, is traversed by a portion of the Appalachian Trail, which crosses the mountain.

GAO found that the X- 33 cooperative agreement limited NASA's exposure to cost growth and allowed industry to embark on such a program at relatively modest investment. To meet the goal set in 1994 by the White House Space Policy, NASA implemented the Reusable Launch Vehicle Program, incorporating a "fast-track" management approach and "new ways of doing business. " NASA did not conduct cost estimates before awarding several contracts, thereby increasing the risk that the <b>management</b> <b>reserves</b> might not be sufficient to cover additional contract costs. NASA restructured the plan for the X- 34 Program in response to both X- 34 Program technical reviews and other internal assessments of NASA programs, including reports on the failed Mars missions, the shuttle wiring problems, as well as an assessment of NASA's approach to executing its "Faster, Better, Cheaper" projects. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent, pre-downturn, {{disturbance}} {{in the global}} helium market {{can be traced to}} the tight supply–demand position, which characterizes today’s changing helium supply structure. A detailed System Dynamics model provides fresh insight into the helium question and suggests a production path that is closely associated with future natural gas production. Venting of un-extracted helium to the atmosphere remains a central issue. The model indicates that improving resource exploitation strategies might extend a production plateau that emerges in the 2030 s. Substitution will result in more helium being vented. To mitigate this, the industry needs to ensure security of supply (particularly after the Bureau of Land <b>Management</b> <b>reserve</b> is sold). ...|$|E
