40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the physical structure of poly (D,L lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microspheres loaded with ciclosporin A in terms of the amorphous properties of the individual components and the phase separation characteristics of the binary systems. Microspheres were prepared using a standard oil-in-water emulsion technique. The thermal properties of the PLGA, ciclosporin A and loaded spheres were investigated using modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MTDSC) using a TA Instruments MTDSC 2920, with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and high-performance liquid chromatography used as supportive techniques. MTDSC indicated a glass transition for ciclosporin A in the reversing heat flow signal at 107 °C, supported by temperature cycling studies, while XRD showed clear evidence for diffraction peaks, thereby indicating that the material as received is semi-crystalline. The unloaded PLGA spheres showed a glass transition (Tg) at 43 °C, with no reduction in Tg being observed on loading the peptide up to 50 %, w/w. Similarly, no evidence for diffraction peaks were seen for the drug-loaded systems, although the glass transition corresponding to the peptide was observed for the loaded microspheres, suggesting that the drug is present as a separate amorphous phase. Similarly, SEM studies showed the appearance of distinct “islands” on the surface of the spheres that are suggested to correspond to the drug phase, with the size of the islands increasing with drug loading. Evidence is therefore presented that ciclosporin A may exist in a range of solid states, with the degree of crystallinity being altered by processing. In addition, there appears to be little or no miscibility between the drug and PLGA using the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>protocol</b> employed here. These findings may have implications for the choice of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>protocol,</b> the release of peptide drugs from PLGA microspheres and the chemical and physical stability of such drugs...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{optimize}} a reproducible flexible sensor adapted to thin low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films and/or structures to enable their deformation measurements. As these deformations are suspected to be weak (less than 10 %), the developed sensor needs to be particularly sensitive. Moreover, it is of prime importance that sensor integration and usability do not modify the mechanical behavior of its LDPE substrate. The literature review allowed several materials to be investigated and an elastomer/intrinsically conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS (CleviosTM) filled composite was selected to simultaneously combine mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. This composite (made of PEDOT:PSS and silicone Bluesil®) presented satisfying compatibilities with piezoresistive effects, negative temperature performances (in a range from − 60 °C to 20 °C), as well as elongation properties (until the elastic limit of the substrate was reached).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dendritic cells (DCs) are {{the most}} {{important}} antigen-presenting cell population for activating antitumor T-cell responses; therefore, they offer a unique opportunity for specific targeting of tumors. AREAS COVERED: We will discuss the critical factors for the enhancement of DC vaccine efficacy: different DC subsets, types of in vitro DC <b>manufacturing</b> <b>protocol,</b> types of tumor antigen to be loaded and finally different adjuvants for activating them. We will cover potential combinatorial strategies with immunomodulatory therapies: depleting T-regulatory (Treg) cells, blocking VEGF and blocking inhibitory signals. Furthermore, recommendations to incorporate these criteria into DC-based tumor immunotherapy will be suggested. EXPERT OPINION: Monocyte-derived DCs {{are the most}} widely used DC subset in the clinic, whereas Langerhans cells and plasmacytoid DCs are two emerging DC subsets that are highly effective in eliciting cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. Depending on the type of tumor antigens selected for loading DCs, it is important to optimize a protocol that will generate highly potent DCs. The future aim of DC-based immunotherapy is to combine it with one or more immunomodulatory therapies, for example, Treg cell depletion, VEGF blockage and T-cell checkpoint blockage, to elicit the most optimal antitumor immunity to induce long-term remission or even cure cancer patients...|$|E

40|$|Decellularized {{arterial}} scaffolds {{have achieved}} success in advancing toward clinical use as vascular grafts. However, concerns remain regarding long-term preservation and sterilization of these scaffolds. Freeze drying offers {{a means of}} overcoming these concerns. In this study, we investigated the effects of various freeze-drying protocols on decellularized porcine carotid arteries and consequently, determined the optimum parameters to fabricate a stable, preserved scaffold with unaltered mechanical properties. Freeze drying by constant slow cooling to two final temperatures ((Tf), ? 10 ?C and ? 40 ?C) versus instant freezing was investigated by histological examination and mechanical testing. Slow cooling to Tf= ? 10 ?C produced a stiffer and less distensible response than the non freeze-dried scaffolds and resulted in disruption to the collagen fibers. The mechanical response of Tf= ? 40 ?C scaffolds demonstrated disruption to the elastin network, which was confirmed with histology. Snap freezing scaffolds in liquid nitrogen and freeze drying to Tf= ? 40 ?C with a precooled shelf at ? 60 ?C produced scaffolds with unaltered mechanical properties and a histology resembling non-freeze-dried scaffolds.

However, as {{it is very likely}} that the spectroscopic fingerprint can also be affected by the manufacturing process of this product, in particular by drying temperature and time, the effect of the manufacturing process on the spectral profile of egg-pasta samples was thoroughly investigated, using experimental design coupled to a multivariate exploratory data analytical technique called ANOVA-Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA).

'Clean-up' concerns the removal of environmental and man-made materials mixed with 'targets' in collected samples: such materials can interfere with subsequent sample processing and ultimately bio assays. Depending upon the collection modality, contaminants might include soil particles, naturally occurring biological entities or fragments thereof. Dean-flow performs clean-up by means of physical separation exploiting differential hydrodynamic drag forces acting upon target materials and contamination. The project involved the study and experimental evaluation of microfluidic Dean-flow devices in order to begin to characterise Dean-flow behaviour in this regime.

This paper comprehensively reviews and updates fundamental and applied aspects encompassing tech nological and organoleptic characteristics of AOP traditional cheeses manufactured in the Iberian Peninsula, from ovine and/or caprine milks. Those cheeses from Portugal and Spain can be divided into four distinctive groups, based on milk source and rennet type: (i) Azeitão, Castelo Branco, Évora, Nisa, Serpa, Serra da Estrela and La Serena cheeses, manufactured with raw ovine milk and coagulated via plant rennet; (ii) Terrincho, Idiazábal, Manchego, Roncal and Zamorano cheeses, elaborated with raw ovine milk and coagulated via animal rennet; (iii) Cabra Transmontano and Majorero cheeses, manufac tured with raw caprine milk and coagulated via animal rennet; and (iv) Amarelo da Beira Baixa, Picante da Beira Baixa and Rabaçal cheeses, manufactured with mixtures of raw ovine and caprine milks and coagulated via animal rennet. Considerable differences between Portuguese and Spanish AOP cheeses exist; the former are, in general, characterized by softer consistencies and similarities to one another in terms of <b>manufacturing</b> <b>protocols</b> (usually encompassing coagulation of plain raw milk followed by slow draining of the curd), whereas the latter are, in general, larger and firmer...|$|R
