40|$|The {{anchorage}} {{of structures}} {{is a crucial}} element of construction, both for humans and animals. Spiders use adhesive plaques to attach silk threads to substrates. Both biological and artificial adhesive structures usually have an optimal loading angle, and are prone to varying loading situations. Silk anchorages, however, must cope with loading in highly variable directions. Here we show that the detachment forces of thread anchorages of orb-web spiders are highly robust against pulling in different directions. This is gained by a two-step back-and-forth spinning pattern during the rapid production of the adhesive plaque, which shifts the thread insertion point towards the plaque centre and forms a flexible tree root-like network of branching fibres around the loading point. Using a morphometric approach and a tape-and-thread model we show that neither area, nor width of the plaque, but the shift of the loading point towards the plaque centre has the highest effect on pull-off resistance. This is explained by a circular propagation of the delamination crack with a low peeling angle. We further show that silken attachment discs are highly directional and adjusted to provide maximal performance in the upstream dragline. These {{results show that the}} way the glue is applied, crucially enhances the toughness of the anchorage without the need of additional <b>material</b> <b>intake.</b> This work is a starting point to study the evolution of tough and universal thread anchorages among spiders, and to develop bioinspired ‘instant’ anchorages of thread- and cable-like structures to a broad bandwidth of substrates. 11 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{technology}} in agriculture offers many products that reduce distractions and fatigue experienced by machinery operators, including automatic path guidance, variable rate product delivery, and precision seed placement. However, {{the size and}} complexity of modern mechanical harvesting operations have limited the ability of autonomous technology to significantly reduce total negative effects on grain combine operators. Combine operators are highly susceptible to fatigue because several tasks must be performed simultaneously to ensure safe machine operation. These duties include monitoring internal threshing and crop flow intake, maintaining row alignment, avoiding foreign <b>material</b> <b>intake,</b> and overseeing unloading grain. The primary goal of this project was to design a decision support system for autonomous unloading of combines. When unloading grain on-the-go, operators divert more attention away from critical tasks to focus on grain delivery to the adjacent cart. An autonomous system {{eliminating the need for}} combine operators to focus on unloading on-the-go potentially reduces operator stress and grain spillage. Critical to the decision support system for autonomous unloading was the input of a two-dimensional fill grid used to describe the grain height in the cart. The inverse distance weighting method, an estimation technique common to spatial data modeling, was used to estimate points in the fill grid of a grain cart prone to being immeasurable or highly variable. This method was successful in estimating missing points in a grain cart under difficult delivery conditions to within 15 cm of underestimation and 25 cm of overestimation. A model to predict the weight of grain in a grain cart was developed using the average grain height measured in the cart. The model demonstrated high robustness by producing mean errors that changed by less than 2 % of the total cart volume when the delivery conditions strayed from typical conditions to highly biased conditions. The decision support system that was developed exhibited robust performance when critical features of the system were tested at typical levels. Field testing validated the potential to apply the decision support system to autonomous combine unloading systems by producing predictable and consistent final cart volumes that were within 5 % of the total volume...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 One {{means of}} {{evaluating}} the temperature requirements {{of an animal}} is to determine changes temperature causes in the uses and losses of energy and materials in the food the animal consumes. To develop energy budgets for cichlids (Cichlasoma bimaculatum) at different temperatures (20, 24, 28, 32 and 36 C) data were obtained on food intake, growth (total, fat, and protein), fecal losses, maintenance requirements, and other uses and losses of energy and materials including specific dynamic action, activity, and nitrogen excretion. Starvation experiments were conducted to provide information on the metabolic cost of existence and on adjustments in body composition {{in the absence of}} food. Energy expenditure during starvation, estimated from heat of combustion data, was found to increase linearly with temperature over 4, 13 and 20 days of starvation. The caloric cost of existence per fish per day was greatest during the first four days at all temperatures and decreased as starvation was prolonged to 20 days. Caloric losses, and dry weight losses showed essentially the same thing. Protein catabolism increased regularly with temperature and decreased slightly with duration of starvation. Fat catabolism did not vary significantly with temperature but decreased markedly as starvation was prolonged. Food intake, growth, and food conversion efficiency varied greatly with changes in temperature. Cichlids were fed ad libitum on small aquatic worms of the genus Tubifex. For food consumption as well as growth, the optimum temperature dropped from 32 to 28 to 24 C as the experimental period was extended from 5 to 12 to 19 days. Optimum growth in dry weight and calories occurred at the same temperatures. Growth of cichlids through time at 20 and 28 C was nearly linear; at 24 C the curve was exponential. At 32 and 36 C, the growth curves rose and then declined. When the fish were held separately during the experiment, food conversion efficiency of cichlids was highest at 20 C and decreased with increasing temperature. Efficiencies decreased with duration of the experiment. When fish were held in groups during the experiment, efficiency was low at both high and low temperatures. The guts of the cichlids were found to contain food up to 30 hours after an ad libitum meal at all temperatures. They were reasonably empty after 36 hours. Thus, no significant correlation was found between temperature and the length of time necessary for the guts to empty. Food material not absorbed was measured by wet combustion. Percentages of absorption of unrestricted rations were found to be 83, 84, 88, 85 and 69 at 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36 C. Percentages of food absorption were much higher on the restricted ration than on the unrestricted ration. Absorption appears to have been optimal at 28 C. Specific dynamic action (SDA) was estimated at different temperatures by taking the difference between oxygen consumption of unfed and fed cichlids at the same levels of activity. SDA represented 22, 20, 19, 33 and 33 percent of the food consumed at 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36 C, when the fish were swimming at 4 cm/second. SDA was generally complete within 36 hours after feeding. Graphs showing energy and <b>material</b> <b>intake,</b> utilization, loss, and scope for growth at each temperature during different experimental periods were developed both in terms of calories per fish per day and calories per gram of fish per day. The evidence suggests that the optimum temperature for growth of this cichlid is near 24 C...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} project was to investigate new and alternative ways to determinate synthetic cannabinoids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Currently, the possibilities to quantify synthetic cannabinoids are very limited. This can lead to an increased use of synthetic cannabinoids as the risk of detection is low, which may be known by drug users. The synthetic cannabinoids are sold mixed with different herbs and have varying names like Spice Gold, Spice Silver, K 2, Smoke and Pot-pourri. The synthetic cannabinoids analyzed were JWH- 018 and JWH- 073, which are commonly found in seized Spice <b>material.</b> At <b>intake</b> of these drugs, usually through smoking, cannabis-like effects arise. This is because they bind to cannabinoid receptors in a similar way as THC does, which is the primary active cannabinoid of cannabis. For urine samples an analytical method would probably be the most sensitive if the major metabolite could be analyzed, as it is expected to be present in high concentrations in this sample type. Since information regarding the metabolism of synthetic cannabinoids is very limited there may be reasons to analyze the mother substance in urine. Further, in plasma and serum samples the mother substance is expected in high concentrations. Thus different ways to detect JWH- 018 and JWH- 073 directly were investigated in this project. Derivatization of JWH- 018 and JWH- 073 was the first step to get more selective and sensitive GC-MS analysis. Different derivatization-reagents were investigated, for example BSTFA and TFAA. The results show that the derivatization of JWH- 018 with BSTFA after reduction and extraction was successful. To achieve this, samples had to be heated at 115 °C for 1 - 3 hours, but still the samples were not completely derivatized. The results indicate that JWH-substances are difficult to derivatized, but they are possible to derivatize with BSTFA. This could mean that a GC-MS-method maybe could be established for these substances, preferably trough TFAA-derivatization...|$|R
40|$|Fatty liver can be {{produced}} in the rat by prolonged consumption of nutritionally ade-quate diets containing alcohol (1). The state of hepatic steatosis produced is highly de-pendent upon the level of fat in the diet (2). Prolonged consumption of liquid diets con-taming alcohol {{does not lead to}} significant hepatic lipid accumulation when the level of fat is 25 % or less of total calories (3). The chain length of the dietary fat is also important. Liver fat is elevated to similar extents by alcohol diets containing the con-ventional long-chain fats, linseed oil, coco-nut oil, or a mixture of corn and olive oils (2). However, feeding diets containing me-dium-chain triglycerides (MCT) in place of regular long-chain triglycerides (LCT) sub-stantially reduces hepatic fat accumulation (4). Because a diet containing alcohol and MCT greatly reduces the accumulation of liver fat, it was of interest to determine whether diets containing MCT would aid in the regression of alcoholic fatty liver.

25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter <b>material</b> through an <b>intake</b> pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|R

However, energy intake of individuals during ad libitum lunch was significantly lower in dark chocolate groups (CON: 849. 46 ± 47. 45 kcal versus DARK: 677. 69 ± 48. 45 kcal and B-GLU + DARK: 691. 08 ± 47. 45 kcal, p = 0. 014). Conclusion: The study demonstrated that substituting dark chocolate for milk chocolate is more effective in inducing satiety during subsequent food intake in healthy subjects...|$|R

Oral health was assessed in {{a representative sample of}} 720 individuals at 24 years. Obesity, waist circumference and number of episodes with obesity between 15 and 23 years of age were the main exposures. Mediating effect of oral hygiene, C-reactive protein level and carbohydrate consumption was also assessed. Results: Obese individuals {{were more likely to have}} 2 teeth with gingival bleeding. However, after adjusting for confounders, the association was not statistically significant [OR (obese 9 2 or more teeth) 1. 72 (95 % CI: 0. 95, 3. 11) ] and adjustment for potential mediators decreased the OR (OR = 1. 38). The risk of presenting calculus in obese subjects was 10 % higher [PR 1. 10 (95 % CI: 1. 02, 1. 18) ]. The number of episodes of obesity between 15 and 23 years was associated with dental calculus.

40|$|Introduction: This paper {{presents}} the validation of a rapid method for {{the determination of}} nitrate content in chard samples, in order to determine, during two periods (winter and summer of 2012), the current levels of nitrate in this typical vegetable, and the toxicological risk associated with this <b>intake.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: A rapid colorimetric determination of nitrate in chard samples by nitration of salicylic acid was validated. The validated method was applied to analyze the content of nitrate in 56 chard samples marketed in Huesca (Spain) and collected in winter and summer seasons, and the toxicological risk associated with the intake for adult and children population was evaluated. Results: The method was specific and robust enough for the required purposes. The main performance characteristics of the method were: limits of detection and quantitation of 0. 29 mg L- 1 and 0. 59 mg L- 1, respectively; recoveries from 80. 0 % to 107. 4 %; and coefficients of variation lower than 11. 4 %. The detected mean nitrate content was 2293 mg kg- 1 and there was evidence of risk only for extreme consumers (adults and children), especially in winter period. Conclusions: A high percentage of chard samples with a considerable concentration of nitrate were found. Taking into account the estimated dairy intake of nitrate associated with them, it could be recommended to establish a regulatory limit of nitrate to chard, a vegetable of important consumption in Spain. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{several studies}} have {{investigated}} the association between ovarian cancer risk and nonisoflavone flavonoids intake, these findings are inconsistent. This systematic review of published epidemiological studies was conducted to summarize and clarify the evidence on the association between ovarian cancer incidence and nonisoflavone flavonoids <b>intake.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and EMBASE databases were searched based on MeSH term (ovarian neoplasm in combination with flavonoids) to identify related English and non-English papers published up to June 2016. We summarized {{the results of the}} relevant studies in this review. Results: In total, seven studies (four with cohort and three with case–control design) included in this review. The results of conducted cohort studies show no relation between ovarian cancer risk and total nonisoflavone flavonoids intake, and only one study reported a significant reduction between ovarian cancer incidence and kaempferol and luteolin intake. Similar to those in the cohort studies, also in case–control studies, no association was found between total nonisoflavone flavonoids intake and ovarian cancer risk, just an inverse association between flavonols intake and ovarian cancer was reported. Conclusion: Several studies investigated the relation of nonisoflavone flavonoids intake and ovarian cancer risk; none of them reported any association for total nonisoflavone flavonoids intake, but some reported an inverse association between certain subclasses or individual flavonoids. These findings are limited, and {{there is a need for}} further and more accurate researches to be confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: In obesity with {{no history}} of alcohol abuse, liver {{steatosis}} (NAFLD) {{is associated with a}} cluster of metabolic alterations, particularly insulin resistance (IR). IR induces advanced liver fibrosis leading progressively NAFLD to cirrhosis, through steatohepatitis (NASH). A noninvasive simple scoring system was recently suggested to identify the risk of fibrosis in NAFLD patients (Angulo et al, 2007). On the other hand nutrient intake affects IR and it {{plays an important role in}} NAFLD progression to NASH. We have investigated the possible correlations between the suggested markers of metabolic and liver damage: IR by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (FS) and the macronutrient (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) <b>intakes.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: From May to Sept. 2008, 30 obese patients (F 24; age 21 - 61 y) with BMI 31 - 54, were consecutively selected after admission to our digestive endoscopy service for the intragastric balloon insertion. Clinical and laboratory data were collected; HOMA-IR (values > 2. 5 = IR) and FS (> - 1. 455 =possible fibrosis) were calculated. Patients with HBV(+), HCV(+), alcohol abuse, and steatogenic drugs in the history, were excluded. Dietary habits were obtained by detailed questioning and a computed database determined total energy and macronutrient intakes, according to the standard table of food composition in Italy (ed. 2000).

40|$|This study quantifies the {{influence}} of debris cages on critical submergence at vertical intakes in reservoir configurations. Four model debris cages were constructed of light panel <b>material.</b> A vertical <b>intake</b> protruding one pipe diameter above {{the floor of a}} model reservoir was tested in six configurations: open intake pipe, a debris grate placed directly over the intake pipe, and debris cages representing widths of 1. 5 *d and 2 *d and heights of 1. 5 *c and 2 *c, where d is diameter of the intake and c is height of intake above reservoir floor. A selection of top grating configurations and a submerged raft configuration were also tested for comparison. Testing of the model debris cages indicates that the roof or top grate of a debris cage dominates {{the influence}} a debris cage has on the reduction of critical submergence of air-core vortices. The side grates of a debris cage have some influence on the formation of vortices. The spacing of bars in the top grate has an influence on air-core vortex development. The presence of a debris cage at vertical intakes in still-water reservoirs reduces the critical submergence required to avoid air-core vortices and completely eliminates the air-core vortex for cases where the water surface elevation remains above the top grate of the debris cage. The potential exists for designing debris cages to fulfill a secondary function of air-core vortex suppression...|$|R
2500|$|Parnok’s {{works are}} filled with the timbre of tragedy and the melody of coincidence. Her first poem was printed in 1906 and her last, the week before her death. Her first {{collection}} Стихотворения (Poems) was published in 1916 and her last book of works Вполголоса (Half-Whispered or In a low voice) was published in 1928. She created five books of poems, more than 30 critical essays, and several translations. Sofia Polyakova, editor of Parnok's Collected Works, preserved 261 of her poems. Because she chose to live openly and write about her relationships with seven women – to each of whom she dedicated several poems – she {{came to be called}} the [...] "Russian Sappho". Much of the scholarly work focused on Parnok has centered around the period of her relationship with Tsvetaeva;, yet many of her [...] "best poems" [...] were created after 1928. Nearly 100 poems, written between 1928 and 1933 were never published until long after her death. Poems from her Vedeneyeva period reflect both <b>material</b> and spiritual <b>intake</b> and musical and creative output. They incorporate the themes running through all her works: [...] "anguish, poetry, the elements (wind, water, earth, fire), heat and cold, illness, madness, remembering, and death". Parnok's mature poetry showed a simpler use of language, shorter lines and rhythmic variation. While rejecting the Romantic poetry of previous eras, Parnok conveyed passion through the use of commonplace straightforward language. Her style employs rhetorical questioning, as if she is having conversations with herself, indicators that even in the presence of others, Parnok felt removed from them.|$|R

Consumption of contaminated food is {{the main source of}} exposure nowadays. We sought to identify main contributors to blood chlordecone concentration (BCC) and to validate an exposure indicator based on food <b>intakes.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: We used a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) completed by a sample of 194 pregnant women to estimate their dietary exposure to chlordecone and compared it to blood levels. In a first approach, chlordecone daily intake was estimated as the product of daily eaten quantity of 214 foodstuffs, multiplied by their chlordecone content, and summed over all items. We then predicted individual blood chlordecone concentration with empirical weight regression models based on frequency of food consumption, and without contamination data. RESULTS: Among the 191 subjects who had BCC determination, 146 (76 %) had detectable values and mean BCC was 0. 86 ng/mL (range < LOD- 13. 2). Mean per capita dietary intake of chlordecone was estimated at 3. 3 microg/day (range: 0. 1 - 22. 2). Blood chlordecone levels were significantly correlated with food exposure predicted from the empirical weight models (r= 0. 47, p< 0. 0001) and, to a lesser extent, with chlordecone intake estimated from food consumption and food contamination data (r= 0. 20, p= 0. 007). Main contributors to chlordecone exposure included seafood, root vegetables, and Cucurbitaceous. CONCLUSION: These results show that the Timoun FFQ provides valid estimates of chlordecone exposure.

40|$|Background: {{epidemiological}} {{studies have been}} related food intake with the incidence of nontransmissible chronic diseases. Objective: {{the purpose of the}} present study was to analyze the validity and reproducibility of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) aimed at assessing lipid and phytochemical <b>intake.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: FFQ was administered to 45 people of both sexes, aged between 20 and 72 years old and resident in Cordoba, Argentina. The FFQ included 257 questions referring to foods, their consumption frequency and portion size. Regarding consumption of fruit and vegetables, the season was also taken into account. The questionnaire was applied at two different periods (FFQ 1 and FFQ 2) with a break of six months in between. As a reference, the 24 -hour dietary recall was used (24 HDR) three times. The mid intake of FFQ 1 -FFQ 2, the 24 HDR-FFQ 2 median intake, median difference, Mean Absolute Deviation from the median differences (MAD), Wilcoxon signed rank sum test and Spearman rank order correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze the accuracy of the FFQ data. Results: the correlation coefficients for FFQ 1 -FFQ 2 varied from 0. 52 for 20 : 5 n 3 eicosapentanoic (EPA) fatty acid to 0. 89 for 4 : 0 butyric fatty acid (p< 0. 05). For 24 HDR-FFQ 2, the values ranged from 0. 19 for lycopene to 0. 93 for EPA fatty acid (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: the analysis carried out showed an acceptable validity and reproducibility of the FFQ, thus enabling it to be used in research relating the intake of lipids and phytochemicals and the risk of non-transmissible diseases. publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Background. Alcohol intake {{has been}} {{associated}} with the bitter taste receptor T 2 R 38. TAS 2 R 38 gene ex-presses two common haplotypes: PAV and AVI. It has been reported that AVI homozygotes consume more alcohol than heterozygotes and PAV homozygotes. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of the TAS 2 R 38 haplotypes among Mexican-Mestizo population and to analyze its association with alcohol <b>intake.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods. In a cross-sectional study, a total of 375 unrelated Mestizo individuals were genotyped for TAS 2 R 38 polymorphisms (A 49 P, V 262 A and I 296 V) by a Real-Time PCR System (TaqMan). Haplo-type frequencies were calculated. Association of TAS 2 R 38 haplotypes with alcohol intake was estimated in drinkers (DRS) and nondrinkers (NDRS). Results. Two haplotypes accounted for over 96 % of all haplotypes (AVV, 60 %, and PAI, 36. 5 %). The frequency of AVV homozygotes was significantly higher in DRS than NDRS (47. 2 vs. 32. 2 %, respectively; p < 0. 05). Additionally, the AVV/AVV genotype was associated with alcohol in-take when compared with heterozygotes and PAI homozygotes (OR = 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 13 - 2. 84, p < 0. 05 and OR = 2. 23, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 4. 48; p < 0. 05, respectively). Conclusions. In conclusion, two TAS 2 R 38 haplotypes (AVV and PAI) prevailed in Mexican-Mestizo population. The novel AVV haplotype was associated with alcohol intake.
