40|$|In all {{manufacturing}} processes, {{surface quality}} {{has a great}} significance beside dimensional and geometrical tolerances of the products. Performance and strength of machine parts are highly affected by the surface quality. In this research, {{the effect of the}} rake angle on surface quality for AISI 1040 steel in turning operations was investigated. For this purpose, eight different rake angles varying from negative to positive and five different cutting speeds were used in the experiments. Depth of cut and feed rate were kept constant throughout the experiments. The results showed that negative rake angle resulted in poor surface quality. Improvement in surface quality continued when the rake angle increasing in positive direction up to a certain limit (10 °) after which no further improvement was determined. Moreover, the analysis of variance was used based on factorial design of experiment to evaluate effectiveness of the rake angle and cutting speed in the <b>medium</b> <b>machining.</b> Statistical analysis results showed that the rake angle is the dominant parameter associated with the surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} micro holes, micro-molds, and micro forms {{continues}} to grow as high-tech industries demand miniaturized products. Sectors such as aerospace, microelectronics, medicine, and even the automotive sector, are just some examples of enterprises that {{are taking advantage of}} micro-manufacturing technologies. Within this framework, the need to adapt the knowledge of macro-scale manufacturing processes to micro-scale is evident. This paper provides the insight needed to improve milling as a micro-manufacturing process. The goal is to characterize motion system to reduce error and improve accuracy with different process parameters on final shape for micro-parts while standard milling machine with linear motor and servomotor is used. Geometrical error and accuracy caused by motion control and control software error sources is evaluated and analyzed. Results will help decision on process parameters and it verifies that standard milling machine is useful to produce micro-parts. The work is carried out by theoretical principles and experimental work, the machine-tool motion accuracy of a <b>medium</b> <b>machining</b> center specializing in the micro-milling of elliptical cavities on aluminum workpieces. Measurements were taken to evaluate deviations and/or errors in geometric accuracy and the geometric quality errors caused by motion control and control software. The results show that due to the structure and inertia of the machine tool, acceleration and deceleration do indeed affect the accuracy and quality of the micro-part. Furthermore, errors from motion control and/or control software are present because differences in the moving carriages create instabilitiesThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the Product, Process and Production Engineering Research Group from the University of Girona for the facilities provided during the experiments and for all their valuable support.

The BRDM-2 obr. 1960 also had mountings for two more 7.62 mm SGMB <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> guns on the sides of the roof however usually only one machine gun was mounted even though it was possible to mount machine guns in all three mounting points. Later the 12.7 mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun or 14.5 mm KPV heavy machine gun replaced the 7.62 mm SGMB <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun in the front while an additional 7.62 mm SGMB <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun was mounted on the rear.

50|$|The 1960s and 70s saw the {{introduction}} of new families of automatic weapons using smaller cartridges than the full-power rifle caliber cartridges previously in use.

The <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> guns continue to be used in many of their previous roles however, especially on tanks and vehicles.

5000|$|Light {{machine guns}} are {{designed}} to provide mobile fire support to a squad and are typically air-cooled weapons fitted with a box magazine or drum and a bipod; they may use full-size rifle rounds, but modern examples often use intermediate rounds. <b>Medium</b> <b>machine</b> guns use full-sized rifle rounds and {{are designed to}} be used from fixed positions mounted on a tripod. Heavy machine gun is a term originating in World War I to describe heavyweight <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> guns and persisted into World War II with Japanese Hotchkiss M1914 clones; today, however, it is used to refer to automatic weapons with a caliber of at least [...]50 in (12.7 mm) but less than 20 mm. A general-purpose machine gun is usually a lightweight <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun which can either be used with a bipod and drum in the light machine gun role or a tripod and belt feed in the <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun role.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of using medium-weight machine guns {{continued into the}} 1930s. The French made a version of their infantry machine gun, the Châtellerault M1924, with 150-round magazine and internal water cooler. The German requirement for a new <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun, a Einheitsmaschinengewehr (standard machine gun), resulted in a Universelle Maschinengewehr (universal machine gun) that was to not only be a <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun {{that was used in}} many roles, but was specifically named so. It was similar to older mediums in that it was a <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun intended to replace older light and heavy machine guns of the same caliber, though Germany would continue using a variety of heavier and lighter automatic machine guns to a limited extent. The use of <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> guns to replace other types would later be called a General Purpose Machine Gun by the Belgians in the 1950s. The actual {{practice of}} using <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> guns in different roles dates back to World War I, whatever the name given by different countries. The trend toward replacing more types with mediums would receive a great boost as tactics using heavy water-cooled MGs were slowly phased out, but suffered a loss when there was shift back to lighter caliber automatic infantry support weapons.|$|R

50|$|The Barrett 240LWS (Light Weight Short) gas operated, belt fed, open bolt, <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun is a {{shortened}} {{variant of}} the 240LW program. The design concept of this variant is to produce a viable <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun that would serve in a special operations capacity, where a small team of operators could maximize a <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> gun by having it in a shorter and lighter package than its big brother, the 240LW, or the equivalent M240B. This follows {{in the footsteps of}} the Mk 48 and the M60E6 <b>medium</b> <b>machine</b> guns, also designed for the small unit role. The Mk 48 is a {{variant of the}} M249 LMG, scaled up to chamber 7.62×51mm NATO; it has come across some issues in its service life; it was never designed to be a general-purpose machine gun, while the M60E6 arguably came too late {{to make a difference in}} USMC and US Army general machine gun adoption, being that the M240 design was well standardized within the DoD ranks. Both offerings are more focused on Special Operations in US Service.|$|R
