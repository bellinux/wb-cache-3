5000|$|Le chant des sirènes has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. For Éric Mandel of Journal du Dimanche, Orelsan [...] "drives the point {{home with a}} stunning song: [...] "Suicide social". It alternates trash humour and existential questions, homage to the origins of rap {{and the art of}} storytelling." [...] <b>Musical</b> <b>blog</b> Goûte Mes Disques says, [...] "Le chant des sirènes appears as a light and shade: an album punctuated by some flashes of genius and, unfortunately, also by several tracks that could be described as rather ordinary." [...] Thierry Cadet of Pure Charts says the album is [...] "written in bitterness, sparing no one." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} the album's title is [...] "like a satire of our time and the younger generations." ...|$|E

That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind of looking at it like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus.

A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy - hands in the air.|$|R
