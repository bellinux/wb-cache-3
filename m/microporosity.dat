25|$|Closed {{shrinkage}} defects, {{also known}} as shrinkage porosity, are defects that form within the casting. Isolated pools of liquid form inside solidified metal, which are called hot spots. The shrinkage defect usually forms {{at the top of}} the hot spots. They require a nucleation point, so impurities and dissolved gas can induce closed shrinkage defects. The defects are broken up into macroporosity and <b>microporosity</b> (or microshrinkage), where macroporosity can be seen by the naked eye and <b>microporosity</b> cannot.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its high}} degree of <b>microporosity,</b> just one gram of {{activated}} carbon has a surface area in excess of , as determined by gas adsorption.

25|$|Promising {{alternatives}} to Pt-based catalysts are Metal/Nitrogen/ Carbon-catalysts (M/N/C-catalysts). To achieve high power density, or output of power over {{surface area of}} the cell, a volumetric activity of at least 1/10 that of Pt-based catalysts must be met, along with good mass transport properties. While M/N/C-catalysts still demonstrate poorer volumetric activities than Pt-based catalysts, the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate. However, increasing the loading of M/N/C-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker, impairing its mass transport properties. In other words, H2, O2, protons, and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer, decreasing the voltage output of the cell. While high <b>microporosity</b> of the M/N/C catalytic network results in high volumetric activity, improved mass transport properties are instead associated to macroporosity of the network. These M/N/C materials are synthesized using high temperature pyrolysis and other high temperature treatments of precursors containing the metal, nitrogen, and carbon.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{porosity}} {{can sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish from microshrinkage because microshrinkage cavities can contain gases as well. In general, <b>microporosities</b> will form if the casting is not properly risered or if a material with a wide solidification range is cast. If neither of these are the case then most likely the porosity is due to gas formation.|$|R

2500|$|Conjugated {{microporous}} polymers (CMPs) are a sub-class of {{porous materials}} {{that are related to}} structures such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks, but are amorphous in nature, rather than crystalline. CMPs are also a sub-class of conjugated polymers and possess many of the same properties such as conductivity, mechanical rigidity, and insolubility. [...] CMPs are created through the linking of building blocks in a π-conjugated fashion and possess 3-D networks. Conjugation extends through the system of CMPs and lends conductive properties to CMPs. Building blocks of CMPs are attractive in that the blocks possess broad diversity in the π units that can be used and allow for tuning and optimization of the skeleton and subsequently the properties of CMPs.

2500|$|Several {{physical}} properties of CMPs {{can be attributed}} to their extended conjugation or <b>microporosity.</b> Much like conductive metals, conjugated polymers exhibit electronic bands. [...] The electrons of the conjugated system occupy the valence band and removal of electrons from this band or addition of electrons to the higher energy conductive band can lead to conductivity. [...] Conjugated materials can in many cases [...] absorb visible light because of their delocalized π-system. [...] These properties have led to applications in organic electronics and organic photonics. [...] CMPs exhibit a high level of tunability with respect to surface area and pore size. [...] Monomers can be designed with longer rigid moieties to increase surface area. [...] The series of CMP-1,4 to CMP-5 shows a dramatic increase in surface area from 500 m2/g to 1000 m2/g. [...] The increase in surface area can drastically improve their ability to be filled with various organic and inorganic compounds for different applications. [...] The increased surface area can also improve gas sorption capabilities.|$|E

30|$|For luting lithium {{disilicate}} ceramic, {{the surface}} treatment is etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF), which generates <b>microporosities</b> {{because of the}} glass phase and silica oxide dissolution. This treatment produces topographical changes, which increases the micromechanical retention and chemical bond with the silane and resin cements, reflecting on the values of bond strength between the ceramic and cement [3]. The lithium disilicate ceramic must be etching with HF, with an application of silane prior to cementation, but the etching generates acid precipitates that may affect the bond between ceramic and cement [4]. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} use some protocols such as post-etching ultrasonic cleaning bath or neutralization [4 – 6].|$|R
30|$|Although silanes used in {{this study}} were applied differently, few {{statistical}} differences were found among silanes. These materials present similar compositions and are pre-hydrolyzed primers, except Silano (Dentsply Brasil). The lowest bond strength was found for a pre-hydrolyzed silane containing phosphate monomer-based MDP. Its manufacturer does not recommend hydrofluoric acid etching, because MDP monomer should be able bond to ceramic without acid etching treatment by very strong bonds to SiO 2 based ceramics and metal oxides [21]. Without the <b>microporosities</b> promoted by acid etching, the silane containing phosphate monomer-based MDP yielded approximately 19 % (for heat treatment) and 29 % (no heating) lower bond strength than those silanes applied to acid etched ceramic.|$|R

50|$|A {{dramatic}} {{example of}} a core effective porosity vs log effective porosity discrepancy comes from some Greensand reservoirs in Western Australia. Greensands are green because of iron-bearing glauconite which is usually recognized as illite/mica or mixed layer illite-smectite clay by x-ray diffraction. The glauconite per se will incorporate electrochemically bound water (CBW) because of the clay types. More importantly for the consideration of effective porosity, though, glauconite grains (part of the Vsh) have intra-particular microporous pore space which retains capillary-bound water. Glauconite can constitute {{a large percentage of}} the reservoir rock, and therefore the associated intra-particular pore space can be significant. Log effective porosities calculated at 25% in some Greensand reservoirs have yielded core analysis effective porosities of 35% at equivalent depths. The difference is the glauconitic <b>microporosity</b> which contains water at reservoir conditions and is included as part of the Vsh (non-effective porosity) by log analysis. However, glauconitic <b>microporosity</b> is measured as part of the effective porosity in core plugs, even if they are humidity dried.|$|E

The aim of this work is to precisely identify the defects that most affect the fatigue behavior in heavy-section castings, in order to guide the foundry to take the proper countermeasures. For this purpose, fatigue rotating bending tests were carried out on specimens machined from small-scale samples opportunely cast to reproduce long solidification times. The fracture surface of broken samples were investigated by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy in order to identify crack initiation points and fracture mechanisms.

By the laws of electrodynamics this acceleration leads to the emission of electromagnetic radiation (Jackson, 1975). Linear particle acceleration is one possibility, but apart from the very high electric fields one would need it is more practical to hold the charged particles on aclosed trajectory in order to obtain a source of continuous radiation. Magnetic fields are used to force the particles onto the desired orbit and prevent them from flying in a straight line. The radial acceleration associated with the change of direction then generates radiation.|$|R
40|$|Activated carbons can be {{produced}} from different precursors, including coals of different ranks, and lignocellulosic materials, by physical or chemical activation processes. The objective {{of this paper is}} to characterize oil-palm shells, as a biomass byproduct from palm-oil mills which were converted into activated carbons by nitrogen pyrolysis followed by CO 2 activation. The effects of no holding peak pyrolysis temperature on the physical characteristics of the activated carbons are studied. The BET surface area of the activated carbon is investigated using N 2 adsorption at 77 [*]K with selected temperatures of 500, 600, and 700 °C. These pyrolysis conditions for preparing the activated carbons are found to yield higher BET surface area at a pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C compared to selected commercial activated carbon.

50|$|Although the intraparticle pore of the {{original}} SWNHs is completely closed, 11 and 36% of the intraparticle pore spaces become open by oxidation at 573 and 623 K, respectively. As the number {{and size of the}} windows in the wall of SWNH can be varied by the heating temperature, the possibility for a molecular selective adsorbent is shown. In addition, adsorption analysis can provide a reliable means for evaluation of the pore structure parameters of the interstitial and internal <b>microporosity.</b> The adsorption study showed that the budlike SWNH aggregates possess micropores despite the closed individual nanohorns. A distinctive feature of these micropores is the small average pore width of 1.0 nm. Heat treatment in oxygen opens the closed nanohorns and thus increases the micropore space available for adsorption. The oxidation affects mostly the closed pores by creating windows on the walls and does not change the bundle structure as well as the interstitial <b>microporosity.</b> Opening mechanism of internal nanoporosity of single-wall carbon nanohorn was revealed through careful oxidation, which allowed controlling the internal nanoporosity. The opening rate was also controllable by oxidation temperature.|$|E

Thus SWNH aggregates should have both <b>microporosity</b> and mesoporosity originating from the above specific structure.

40|$|The failure {{analysis}} of a martensitic stainless steel (CA- 15 M) roll manufactured by centrifugal casting and used in cast glass rolling {{was carried out by}} means of traditional characterization techniques (optical metallography, SEM, EDX microanalysis, tensile testing and XRD). The roll was in the as-cast condition and its microstructure featured large proportion of δ ferrite (between 20 % and 27 %) in a martensitic (α′) matrix, with the δ/α′ interfaces presenting an intergranular network of M 23 C 6 carbides. The crack propagation began in the internal surface of the roll, with δ/α′ intergranular and transgranular cleavage in the “equiaxed region” of the casting, progressing to δ/α′ intergranular ductile fracture in the “columnar” and “chilled regions”. Tensile thermal stresses in the internal surface of the roll associated with microstructural embrittlement (network of interfacial carbide and <b>microporosities)</b> are thought to be the main causes for the premature failure of the roll.

50|$|Surface {{condition}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the required deposit thickness and good field performance. For example, machined substrates alloyed with sulfur and/or lead are particularly vulnerable to a high degree of porosity, since these alloying constituents are catalytic poisons to the deposition process. Substrates with high roughness values require thicker deposits to provide adequate corrosion protection. This is primarily due to the formation of nodules on the roughened surface during the initial stages of deposition, resulting in <b>microporosity</b> of the ENP film.|$|E
50|$|Optimizing the {{performance}} of EN coatings for maximum corrosion protection requires that the coating be continuous and free of any <b>microporosity,</b> roughness, nodules and irregularities within the microstructure. Since the microstructure of high phosphorus EN films are amorphous they are essentially free of the grain boundaries that could potentially serve as sites for corrosion. The absence of such phase boundaries {{and the ability of}} the high phosphorus EN film to form a passive film on its surface, make it an excellent choice for protection on aluminum and steel substrates in highly corrosive, acidic environments.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{developed}} two criteria which can characterize the susceptibility to <b>microporosities</b> formation of alloys. These defects are influential in determining mechanical properties of materials. The first criterion is used when the fraction eutectic is important : then the porosity formation is essentially caused by dissolved gases of formed during chemical reactions. The second is employed when the alloy possesses low fraction eutectic. In that case, because of the pressure drop, the liquid is unable to feed through interdendritic spaces to accomodate solidification shrinkage. The pressure drop is composed of two terms which influence in contrary direction : the first is due to solidification shrinkage and the second to gravity. This term {{is the most important}} except for low fraction eutectic. The fraction liquid (or the fraction eutectic) is an important factor. It depends on the alloy composition and on solidification conditions. In fact, we have showed that, depending on initial alloy concentration, the solidification conditions have opposite effects on the fraction liquid : if Co>KCe, the fraction liquid decreases if the ratio G/R decreases and if Co<KCe it increases if the ratio G/R decreases...|$|R
