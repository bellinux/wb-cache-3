2500|$|Polls on the Canadian monarchy {{have been}} {{regularly}} conducted, since the 1990s, typically coinciding with a royal tour or other major royal event.

Polls on the institution {{have been accused}} of using [...] "inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous wording." [...] Monarchists assert the use of the inaccurate word [...] "British" [...] in a poll question on the Canadian monarchy skews the results, while republicans say the same about the use of [...] "sever" [...] or [...] "abolish". It has also been noted, and confirmed by polls, that Canadians are not well educated about the monarchy and its role. In 2002, the <b>majority</b> <b>polled</b> thought the prime minister was head of state, only 5% knowing it was the Queen.
