40|$|Grinding {{process is}} {{characterized}} by high energy consumption and low productivity. Nowadays efficiency of the ball mills applied for grinding is rather low. Only 3 - 6 % of the supplied power energy is used for material grinding. The rest part of the energy disappears {{in the form of}} heat, vibration and noise. So matter concerning reduction of energy consumption is of great importance. Improvement of efficiency and quality of technological process in grinding of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> components while producing construction materials is considered as one of priority-oriented targets of power- and resource saving in construction industry with the purpose to reduce energy consumption for grinding. Grinding efficiency at operating enterprises is reasonable to improve by modernization of the equipment and existing technological, management and other processes which are related to grinding of <b>mineral</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> In order to reduce grinding power consumption it is necessary to carry out a complex re-engineering of technological process in grinding of various materials which is based on usage of new modifications of grinding bodies, physical and chemical grinding aids, modern information technologies and industrial automation equipment. Application of modern information technologies and industrial automation equipment makes it possible to execute the grinding process with maximum achievable productivity for existing capacity due to automatic control and consideration of continuous changes in technological parameters. In addition to this such approach gives an opportunity to control processes in real time by immediate adjustments of technological equipment operational modes. The paper considers an approach to the development of re-engineering methodology for technological process in grinding of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> components while producing construction materials. The present state of technological grinding process is presented in the paper. The paper points out the necessity to modernize technological equipment used for grinding <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> components with the purpose to improve efficiency and quality, power- and resource saving. The possibility of using various grinding aids that permit to increase grinding productivity is shown in the paper. The paper studies an automation concept of the control system which used for grinding process of <b>mineral</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> A conceptual model for complexation of various methods grinding aids has been proposed in the paper. The paper presents methodological principles for simulation of technological process used for processing of <b>mineral</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> while producing cement and silicate products. The parameters which are to be controlled and which are necessary for development of computer simulations of technological grinding process have been determined in the paper. The paper justifies an application of imitation simulation for creation of computer models. Methodology for imitation simulation of the technological process has been studied in the paper. The paper confirms the possibility to use analytical and probability methods. Imitation simulations of a grinding mill operation have been developed on the basis of experimental data and probability functions. The possibility of controlling technological process of <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> grinding has been demonstrated in the paper. While implementing the proposed complex of organizational and technical recommendations it is possible to increase grinding productivity up to 30 - 50 % and significantly reduce и существенно снизить energy consumption for <b>mineral</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> grinding during production of cement and silicate products. The combined reengineering methodology for grinding process including all the mentioned intensification methods substantially increases quality of final products and reduces its self-cost that will favour its compatibility and attractiveness for consumers. </p...|$|R
