40|$|There are {{numerous}} industrial applications, such as paper mills, locomotive traction, oil and gas, mining and machine tools, which require high performance control {{of more than}} one electric motor simultaneously. When more than one electric motors are employed in an electric drive, it is called, ‘multi‐motor drive’. These multi‐motor drives are generally available in two configurations. The first one consists of a number of three‐phase voltage source inverters connected in parallel to a common DC link, each inverter feeding a three‐phase AC motor. This configuration allows independent control of all machines by means of their own three‐phase voltage source inverters (VSIs). Nevertheless, this configuration needs n number of voltage source inverters for supplying n number of AC machines. The second configuration comprises one inverter, which feeds multiple parallel‐connected three‐phase motors. However, the later configuration does not allow independent control of each motor and is suitable only for traction application. The power converter supplying the drive system, are conventionally, voltage source inverters. However, alternative solution could be a direct AC‐AC converter that can supply the electric drive system. Exploring this alternative solution {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Thus for decoupled dynamic control of AC machines working in a group (multi‐motor drive) is possible by employing multi‐phase (more than three‐phase) motors, where their stator windings are connected in either series or in parallel and the combination is supplied from a single multi‐phase power converter. This thesis explores the control techniques of multi‐phase direct AC‐AC converter for such specific series and parallel‐connected <b>multi‐phase</b> <b>motor</b> drives. The research presented here utilises additional degrees of freedom available in a multi‐phase system to control a number of machines independently. The concept is based on the fact that independent flux and torque control of any AC machine, regardless of the number of stator phases requires control of only two stator current components. This leaves the remaining current components free to control other machines within the group. The multi‐phase multi‐motor drive system fed using multi‐phase direct AC‐AC converter need precise Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique to independently control the drive system. The subject of this research is to propose PWM techniques for such configurations. The thesis focuses on four different cases; five‐phase, six‐phase (symmetrical and asymmetrical), and seven‐phase system. Five‐phase and six‐phase drive systems consists of two motors, and seven‐phase drive system controls three motors. The thesis presents various PWM techniques aimed at these drive configuration. Carrier‐based, carrier‐based with harmonic injection and direct duty ratio based PWM techniques are presented in the thesis. The independence of control of various motors are shown by simulation and experimentation. Although, the proposed techniques are equally applicable to series‐connected drives and parallel‐connected drives, the thesis focuses on the former drive configuration. Analytical, simulation and experimental approach is used throughout the thesis...|$|E

40|$|<b>Multi-phase</b> <b>motors</b> {{are gaining}} more {{attention}} {{due to the}} advantages of good fault tolerance capability and high power density, etc. By applying dual-rotor technology to multi-phase machines, a five-phase dual-rotor permanent magnet synchronous motor (DRPMSM) is researched in this paper to further promote their torque density and fault tolerance capability. It has two rotors and two sets of stator windings, and it can adopt a series drive mode or parallel drive mode. The fault-tolerance capability of the five-phase DRPMSM is researched.

40|$|<b>Multi-phase</b> <b>motors</b> {{have several}} {{advantages}} over the traditional three-phase motors. In this study, the additional {{degrees of freedom}} available in five-phase permanent magnet motors {{have been used for}} three purposes: 1) enhancing the torque producing capability of the motor, 2) improving the reliability of the system, and 3) better adjusting of the torque and flux linkages of the five-phase direct torque controlled system. 1) Due to the fact that space and time harmonics of the same orders will contribute positively to output torque, a five-phase permanent magnet motor with quasi-rectangular back-EMF waveform is supplied with combined fundamental and third harmonic of currents. For modeling and analysis of the motor a 0 3 3 1 1 q d q d frame of reference is defined where 1 1 q d rotates at the synchronous speed and 3 3 q d rotates at the three times synchronous speed. Based on the mathematical model in the 0 3 3 1 1 q d q d frame of reference, it is shown that this system while having a higher torque density with respect to a conventional permanent magnet synchronous machine, is also compatible with vector control algorithm. 2) A resilient current control of the five-phase permanent motor with both sinusoidal and trapezoidal back-EMF waveforms under asymmetrical fault condition is proposed. In this scheme, the stator MMF is kept unchanged during healthy and faulty condition. Therefore, the five-phase permanent magnet motor operates continuously and steadily without additional hardware and just by modifying the control algorithm in case of loss of up to two phases. The feature is of major importance in some specific applications where high reliability is required. 3) High torque and flux ripple are the major drawbacks of a three-phase direct torque controlled system. The number of space voltage vectors directly influences the performance of DTC system. A five-phase drive, while benefiting from other advantages of high order phase drives, has inherently 32 space voltage vectors which permits better flexibility in selecting the switching states and finer adjustment of flux and torque. A sensorless direct torque control of five-phase permanent magnet motor is implemented. Speed information is obtained based on the position of stator flux linkages and load angle. Experiments have been conducted on a 5 kW five-phase surface mount permanent magnet motor and a 3 kW five-phase interior permanent magnet motor by using TMS 320 C 32 DSP.

40|$|Abstract – The {{purpose of}} this paper was to find an {{effective}} method for measuring electromagnetic torque produced by a brushless DC motor with single-phase current sensing in real-time. A torque equation is derived from the theory of brushless DC motor. This equation is then validated experimentally with a motor dynamometer. A computer algorithm is also proposed to implement the electromagnetic torque estimation equation in real-time. Electromagnetic torque is a linear function of phase current. Estimating the electromagnetic torque in real-time using single-phase current is not appropriate with existing equations, however, because of the rectangular alternating-pulse nature of the excitation current. With some mathematical manipulation to the existing equations, the equation derived in this paper overcame this limitation. The equation developed is simple and so it is computationally efficient, and it takes only motor torque constant and single-phase current to evaluate the electromagnetic torque; no other parameters such as winding resistances, inductances are needed. The equation derived is limited to the three-phase brushless DC motor.
