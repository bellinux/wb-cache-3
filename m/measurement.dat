The {{aim of this}} study will be to compare the diagnostic efficacy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) versus diagnostic clinical <b>measurements</b> in patients presenting with furcation involved maxillary first molars. METHODS: The study population included 20 patients with 34 maxillary first molar teeth with furcation involvement. Clinical horizontal and vertical probing <b>measurements</b> were compared to CBCT <b>measurements</b> taken by two calibrated examiners. RESULTS: Horizontal <b>measurements</b> showed a significant difference between Glickman class II and class III. There were no statistical significant differences with the horizontal <b>measurements</b> between clinical probing, bone sounding and CBCT <b>measurements.</b> CBCT vertical <b>measurements</b> were statistically greater than clinical probing <b>measurements.</b> CONCLUSION: The CBCT can provide similar horizontal <b>measurements</b> to standard clinical horizontal probing <b>measurements</b> and will provide a greater vertical dimension of a furcation defect to standard vertical probing <b>measurements...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Microwave methods {{require some}} sort of {{calibration}} before physical (thickness, flaw, etc.) and electrical (permittivity, permeability, etc.) <b>measurements</b> of materials. It is always attractive to devise a method which not only eliminates this necessity but also saves time before <b>measurements.</b> Microwave calibration-independent <b>measurements</b> can be utilized for this goal. However, in the literature, these <b>measurements</b> are only applied for electrical <b>measurements</b> of materials. In this research paper, we investigate the performance of microwave calibration-independent <b>measurements</b> for thickness evaluation of dielectric materials to increase the potential of available microwave techniques for thickness evaluation of dielectric materials. We derive an explicit expression for thickness estimation of dielectric materials from calibration-independent <b>measurements</b> for the adopted calibration-independent technique. We also propose a criterion for increasing the performance of <b>measurements.</b> We conducted thickness <b>measurements</b> of six dielectric specimens with different lengths to validate the derived expressions and the proposed criterion for thickness <b>measurements...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that strain-related phenotypic plasticity may be a major confounding factor in attributing hominin fossils to species. The study reported here tested this hypothesis with craniometric data from the great apes and Colobus guereza. We divided the <b>measurements</b> into three groups: <b>measurements</b> of features subject to high masticatory strain, <b>measurements</b> of features subject to low-to-moderate masticatory strain, and <b>measurements</b> of features that do not remodel and therefore are not prone to strain-related phenotypic plasticity. Next, we used the coefficient of variation and ANOVA to investigate whether masticatory strain is a cause of variability. These analyses partially supported the hypothesis. The predicted differences between the high-strain <b>measurements</b> and the other <b>measurements</b> {{were found in the}} majority of the species. However, the coefficient of variation values for the low-to-moderate strain and non-phenotypically plastic <b>measurements</b> were indistinguishable. Thereafter, we used discriminant function analysis to compare the ability of the three groups of <b>measurements</b> to assign specimens to species. This analysis did not support the hypothesis. The high-strain <b>measurements</b> were less effective than the other <b>measurements,</b> but the low-to-moderate strain <b>measurements</b> were more effective than the non-phenotypically plastic <b>measurements.</b> In addition, better discrimination was achieved when all the <b>measurements</b> were employed than when just the non-phenotypically plastic <b>measurements</b> were utilised. We conclude from this that strain-related phenotypic plasticity is unlikely to impede hominin alpha taxonomic research...|$|R
