5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E

Britain's Daily Telegraph wrote that after an unprecedented summer of sporting achievements, including the Olympic Games in London, Bradley Wiggins' victory in the Tour de France and Andy Murray's first tennis major at the US Open, the Ryder Cup was incapable of [...] "dullness, one-sidedness, and hollow drama" [...] despite the looming anti-climax {{at the start of}} the singles matches on the final day.

50|$|In {{the series}} finale, actor Felix Lok ad-libbed {{one of his}} lines, and {{replaced}} one of {{the words in the}} line with a corresponding English one. Although code-switching has been very common in Hong Kong as of the last 10-20 years, such practice is unheard of for the time period of the drama, and, in <b>most</b> circumstances, <b>unlikely,</b> considering the historically non-existent knowledge of English for the characters. TVB was ridiculed by the public for allowing such a slip up.|$|R
25|$|While Hatshepsut was {{depicted}} in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, {{such as the}} false beard that male pharaohs also wore, it is <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, {{just as it is}} unlikely that the male pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the nemes crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of how she would have presented herself at court.|$|E

25|$|The English {{response}} {{after the}} first rebellion was conciliation of the Geraldines. Fitzmaurice, {{the leader of the}} rebellion, was pardoned and the Earl and his brother John of Desmond were released from imprisonment and returned to their lands. As late as 1579, it looked <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the FitzGeralds would again challenge English rule in Munster. However, a combination of personal, economic and religious factors, and the actions of James Fitzmaurice FitzGerald himself, led to an explosion of rebellion in July of that year.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1930s {{and until}} his death, Douglas {{maintained}} correspondences with many people, including Marie Stopes and George Bernard Shaw. Anthony Wynn wrote the play Bernard and Bosie: A <b>Most</b> <b>Unlikely</b> Friendship {{based on the}} letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the Royal Society of Literature on 2 September 1943, entitled The Principles of Poetry, {{which was published in}} an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of T. S. Eliot, and the talk was praised by Arthur Quiller-Couch and Augustus John.|$|E

A well-known poem in the Wen Xuan is attributed to her. Although <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> to actually be by her (especially since {{it is not in}} her grand-nephew Ban's biography of her), it is certainly written as if it could have been written by her or someone in her position. It is an important early example of the secluded palace lady genre of poetry.|$|E

The injury could be relatively minor, such as spots only detectable by medical exam {{or on the}} periphery of vision. At higher power levels, the spots may be in the central vision, in the same area where the original light was viewed. <b>Most</b> <b>unlikely</b> of all is injury causing a complete and permanent loss of vision.

Of the new biotechnology firms in Belgium that were included in this study, <b>most</b> are <b>unlikely</b> to become fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, because they are heavily dependent on their strategic large partners, especially for marketing outlets, for manufacturing resources when they reach the commercialization stage, and for continuing product development efforts. They have to rely heavily on licensing agreements and milestone payments.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{other issues}} were Chen's accusations of a soft coup after his March 2004 victory, {{as well as}} legal efforts (which <b>most</b> {{consider}} <b>unlikely</b> to succeed) by {{the leaders of the}} pan-blue coalition to overturn the results of the March presidential election. In a related issue, there were concerns that the 3-19 shooting incident was staged; an investigatory committee established by the legislature (only by overriding a cabinet veto) was criticized by the pan-green coalition, which refused to appoint any of its members to the committee as mandated by law.|$|R
25|$|In the 6th century, {{when the}} Irish missionary Columba first sailed to Iona, he first {{arrived at the}} island of Hinba, which he later treated to {{as a place of}} contemplative retreat.

However, Adomnán (the chronicler of the life of Columba) noted that Brendan the Navigator stopped at Hinba while traveling from Ireland to Iona; Canna is a <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> landfall on such a journey as it is well beyond the destination.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Morphy went to Europe to play Staunton {{and other}} chess greats. Morphy made {{numerous}} attempts at {{setting up a}} match with Staunton, but none ever came through. Staunton was later criticised for avoiding a match with Morphy, although his peak as a player {{had been in the}} 1840s and he was considered past his prime by the late 1850s. Staunton is known to have been working on his edition of the complete works of Shakespeare at the time, but he also competed in a chess tournament during Morphy's visit. Staunton later blamed Morphy for the failure to have a match, suggesting among other things that Morphy lacked the funds required for match stakes—a <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> charge given Morphy's popularity. Morphy also remained resolutely opposed to playing chess for money, reportedly due to family pressure, although the Creole culture he was from did not have any stigma against gambling.|$|E
50|$|This, {{possibly}} {{one of the}} <b>most</b> famous <b>unlikely</b> victories, saw {{just over}} 150 British and colonial troops successfully defend a farmhouse against an intense assault by 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu warriors in 1879. The massive but piecemeal Zulu attacks on Rorke's Drift {{came very close to}} defeating the much smaller garrison. After repeated attacks, the Zulus saluted the bravery of the British and left the field. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the combatants, it was the largest amount of Victoria cross medals awarded by the British Government at any one battle.|$|R

25|$|The league {{suspended}} him, and his teammates, {{though not}} fond of Cobb, {{went on strike}} to protest the suspension, {{and the lack of}} protection of players from abusive fans, before the May 18 game in Philadelphia. For that one game, Detroit fielded a replacement team made up of hastily recruited college and sandlot players plus two Tiger coaches and (not surprisingly) lost, 24–2, thereby setting some of Major League Baseball's modern-era (post-1900) negative records, notably the 26 hits in a nine-inning game allowed by Allan Travers, who pitched one of the sport's <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> complete games. The pre-1901 record for the most hits and runs given up in a game is held by the Cleveland Blues' Dave Rowe. Primarily an outfielder, Rowe pitched a complete game on July 24, 1882, giving up 35 runs on 29 hits. The current post-1900 record for most hits in a nine-inning game is 31, set in 1992 by the Milwaukee Brewers against Toronto; however, the Blue Jays used six pitchers.|$|E

In Budapest there are currently 837 different monuments, which represent the most of the European artistic style. The classical and unique Hungarian Art Nouveau buildings are prominent.|$|E
25|$|United had {{the run of}} {{the play}} {{in the first half of}} the final, {{dominating}} Chelsea in terms of possession, and took the lead in the 26th minute through a Cristiano Ronaldo header off a Wes Brown cross. However, in the last minute of the first half, a ball into the United box was deflected to Frank Lampard, who capitalised on a slip by Van der Sar to equalise for the Londoners. The second half was much more even, but no further goals were scored and the match went to extra time. Midway through the second half of extra time, a large incident involving Carlos Tevez and John Terry kicked off. In the ensuing melée, the referee spotted a slap on Nemanja Vidić by Didier Drogba, and had no hesitation in sending the Ivorian international off. Despite the man advantage, United were unable to find a winner and the match went to penalties. Both teams converted their first two penalties, but then the <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> of players missed his – Cristiano Ronaldo, who stepped up with his usual self-confidence, could only stare on as Petr Čech saved his shot. Just when the match looked lost, John Terry stepped up for the Blues, only for his standing foot to give way as he struck his shot and the ball hit the post. This took the match to sudden death penalties, though only two further rounds were required. Ryan Giggs scored United's seventh penalty, meaning that Nicolas Anelka had to score in order to keep Chelsea in the game. His shot, however, was poorly struck, and at the perfect height for United's Dutch goalkeeper to save, granting United their third European Cup title.|$|E

He wrote copiously about his cross-border experiences, in prose and in poetry, from eastern culture to western culture, from literature and art to cultural observations, from old ideas to new concepts, posing questions that would not have been formulated if he had not left Hong Kong, and trying to portray, to a Hong Kong wallowing in old habits, new sets of emotion and knowledge in hope of a change.” ...|$|R
25|$|However, the Seawolves {{returned}} to national prominence in 2011-12 season after an off year with six programs participating in NCAA sanctioned tournaments. The fall season took {{the football team}} to new heights with a record-breaking nine-game winning streak which led the team to a 9-4, 6-0 Big South season earning their third consecutive conference championship and first outright followed by an NCAA tournament berth which saw the Seawolves advance to the second round {{for the first time}} ever. The season included multiple sellout games at LaValle Stadium, a first for the program. Men’s soccer {{returned to}} the NCAA tournament {{for the second time in}} three years after winning their third America East championship at home but fell in their first round match after penalty shootouts. The success continued with Women's volleyball advancing to the Conference Championship game despite falling in three sets. After being predicted to finish second in the league, the Men's basketball program surpassed expectations and clinched another regular season championship with a 20-8, 14-2 regular season record and headed into the America East tournament as the top seed reaching the finals for the second consecutive year and falling just short of the NCAAs, with participation in the postseason NIT. In Track & Field, Lucy Van Dalen became Stony Brook's first NCAA individual National Champion after winning the mile at the NCAA Indoor Track championships. With the addition of Joe Spallina as head coach of Women's lacrosse, and several players from Adelphi, the program was chosen to finish third in the America East and ended their season with a trip to the conference championship game and 5-1, 14-5 overall record. Men's lacrosse also introduced Jim Nagle as the new head coach and the team was predicted to finish second in the America East. After a slow start through non-conference play they picked up in league play to earn their fourth consecutive regular season championship and then went on to earn conference championship and advance to the NCAA tournament for the third time with an early first round exit. Women's tennis earned their first Conference championship and entered the national tournament for their first time ever, but were ousted in the first round. The success included one of the <b>most</b> <b>unlikely</b> runs in intercollegiate athletics by the baseball program which captured a regular season and conference tournament and went on to the NCAA College World Series defeating along the way established national powers with seven players selected in the 2012 MLB draft, led by the 2012 National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Coach of the Year Matt Senk.|$|E
