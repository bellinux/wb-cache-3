5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition, {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, which <b>means</b> <b>it</b> will appear to move backwards in a looping motion {{with respect to the}} background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak luminosity {{in the middle of this}} motion.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} soluble fluorides, CsF is {{moderately}} basic, because HF is a weak acid. The low nucleophilicity of fluoride <b>means</b> <b>it</b> {{can be a}} useful base in organic chemistry. CsF gives higher yields in Knoevenagel condensation reactions than KF or NaF.|$|E

5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility <b>means</b> <b>it</b> can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|From 1997, the 166th Aviation Brigade {{has trained}} other {{aviation}} units for front-line service. As such, {{it has never}} seen combat, and has thus never earned any campaign streamers or unit awards. As the only brigade in the First Army responsible for training aviation units, the 166th Aviation Brigade is the principal unit for training Army Reserve and Army National Guard assets preparing to deploy to contingencies around the world, which <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is responsible for 47 percent of all Army Aviation assets.|$|E

5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which <b>means</b> <b>it</b> would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Sirius {{became the}} first star to have its {{velocity}} measured, {{the beginning of the}} study of celestial radial velocities. Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of the star and observed a red shift. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is approaching the Sun.|$|E

As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a music with English and science with mathematics specialist school.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which <b>means</b> <b>it</b> can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of energy, most of which it obtains from oil, natural gas and coal. The country's focus on those resources for production and export, which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings, <b>means</b> <b>it</b> has paid little attention to renewable energy. Out of the 203GW of electric generation capacity that Russia has, 44GW comes from hydroelectricity, 307MW from geothermal, 15MW from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources. In 2009, the Russian energy industry generated a total 992TWh of electricity, 176TWh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations. Some of Russia's hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment, as shown by the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} Mycoplasma, which some think {{may be the}} cause of the TSEs. The lack of a cell wall <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, which target cell wall synthesis. Frank O. Bastian of Louisiana State University first discovered Spiroplasma-like inclusions in the brain of a CJD patient during an autopsy in 1979 and has hypothesized that this bacterium could possibly {{be the cause of}} the TSEs.|$|E

5|$|The Nord Stage {{follows the}} success of earlier {{keyboard}} instruments from Clavia, and contains similar emulations of vintage electromechanical keyboards such as the Hammond Organ and electric pianos as found on the Nord Electro 2, with additional functionality including a weighted piano-like keyboard on certain models, a synthesizer section based on the Nord Lead, a more versatile organ section and extended effects processing. The Nord Stage is multitimbral, which <b>means</b> <b>it</b> can play more than one sound at once, either by splitting the internal keyboard or connecting an external MIDI controller.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy loads and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point above the river <b>means</b> <b>it</b> is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E
