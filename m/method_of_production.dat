5|$|Helium must be {{extracted}} from natural gas {{because it is}} present in air at {{only a fraction of}} that of neon, yet the demand for it is far higher. It is estimated that if all neon production were retooled to save helium, that 0.1% of the world's helium demands would be satisfied. Similarly, only 1% of the world's helium demands could be satisfied by re-tooling all air distillation plants. Helium can be synthesized by bombardment of lithium or boron with high-velocity protons, or by bombardment of lithium with deuterons, but these processes are a completely uneconomical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E

25|$|Many common {{depictions of}} the Electromagnetic Spectrum show gamma rays as higher in energy (hence are higher in {{frequency}} and smaller in wavelength) than X-rays. This historically allowed {{a clear distinction between}} X-rays and gamma rays. Today, the research literature often describes photons depending on their source. While astronomers usually hold to the historical convention (often the source or production mechanism of the radiation is unknown), the physics literature often use the term historically associated with the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> For example, one group of scientists might describe a 1 MeV photon as a gamma ray, while another group use the term X-ray.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} impacts of animal production vary with the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pest problems with less pesticides through rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a desertification process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than {{the same kind of}} soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans. Corn and soybean crops commonly provide food for human consumption, biofuels, livestock feed, or some combination of these.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding the {{categorical}} {{assertion of}} a purely British origin, there is solid {{evidence of a}} connection between French tambour embroidery and crochet. The former <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> was illustrated in detail in 1763 in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The tip of the needle shown there is indistinguishable {{from that of a}} present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique. The 1823 Penélopé instructions unequivocally state that the tambour tool was used for crochet and the first of the 1840s instruction books uses the terms tambour and crochet as synonyms. This equivalence is retained in the 4th edition of that work, 1847.|$|E
25|$|Iron(II,III) oxide is the {{chemical}} compound with formula Fe3O4. It occurs in nature as the mineral magnetite. It {{is one of}} a number of iron oxides, the others being iron(II) oxide (FeO), which is rare, and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) also known as hematite. It contains both Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions and is sometimes formulated as FeO ∙ Fe2O3. This iron oxide is encountered in the laboratory as a black powder. It exhibits permanent magnetism and is ferrimagnetic, but is sometimes incorrectly described as ferromagnetic. Its most extensive use is as a black pigment which is synthesised rather than being extracted from the naturally occurring mineral as the particle size and shape can be varied by the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E
