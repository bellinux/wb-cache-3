500|$|In {{the words}} of Harriet Arbuthnot, {{who was in the}} Duke's carriage, ' was caught by it, thrown down & the engine passed over his leg & thigh, {{crushing}} it in a most frightful way. It is impossible to give an idea of the scene that followed, of the horror of everyone present or of the piercing shrieks of his unfortunate wife, who was in the car. He said scarcely more than, [...] "It's all over with <b>me.</b> <b>Bring</b> me my wife and let me die.|$|E
2500|$|The crowd chanted for the {{resignation}} of Prime Minister Alkatiri, while also expressing support for President Gusmão. Gusmão later addressed the crowd from atop a car outside his office, saying [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> peace to East Timor {{and then we will}} resolve others matters." [...] He was said to be in tears at times, and said [...] "The priority now is to stop people burning, and guns shooting."

2500|$|Reed said that, of his roles, he {{probably}} loved Ko-Ko the most, noting, [...] "t's such {{fun to do}} ... you make people laugh, and the children and everybody enjoy him. And I suppose that's what our job is here anyway. To entertain people." [...] He also commented, [...] "Ko-Ko is almost me. There's a lot of me in the character. It lets <b>me</b> <b>bring</b> out my sense of humour. ... the character parts ... you must get your own personality through." [...] On the other hand, he said, [...] "Something takes over from me when I go on. I become something different. I'm basically shy, and I go and hide behind my characters." [...] Reed also loved to play Jack Point in Yeomen, a tragicomic character. [...] "Jack Point is me in another age – just a strolling player. I really believe I could die of a broken heart". Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while waiting to go on". Of the [...] "younger" [...] roles he played even in his later years with the company, Reed said, [...] "I feel I'm so fundamentally a young person. ... I'm older than the part I'm playing, for instance, but I feel young." [...] He loved performing for children and delighted in the gala [...] "last nights" [...] of each London season with the D'Oyly Carte, where he would perform for glittering audiences of [...] "Prime Ministers, Lord Chancellors and First Lords of the Admiralty." ...|$|E
