The polling firm, however, emphasized that the poll {{was not intended to}} provide two-way race numbers and that the polling (which was completed on January 16) did not include Michael Lamb, who had entered the race the next day.

5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E

5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive legal status. Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|The season {{came down}} to a two-game set with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, with the home team one game behind and needing to win both. Stengel, during the 1949 season, had shown himself <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> than his peers {{to bring in a}} relief pitcher, and when during the first game, starter Allie Reynolds gave up the first two runs in the third inning, the manager brought in Joe Page. Though Page walked in two more runs, he shut out the Red Sox {{the rest of the way}} as the Yankees came back to win, 5–4. This set up a winner-take-all game for the league title. The Yankees took a 5–0 lead before Boston scored three in the ninth, but Vic Raschi was able to prevent further damage, giving the Yankees the pennant, Stengel's first as a major league manager.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the results}} of {{globalisation}} is that increasing numbers of students from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds come together to learn in one space. This article theorises an ethical approach to this challenge for drama educators, drawing principally on theories of transnational ﬁction (Stephen Clingman) (1), cosmopolitan ethics (Kwame Anthony Appiah) (2) and cultural understandings of space (Doreen Massey) (3). The central metaphor of drama as a means for ‘navigating boundaries’, it argues, is <b>more</b> politically <b>apt</b> if less ‘sexy’ than Giroux’s more commonly cited metaphor of ‘border crossing’. The relationship between this theory and an ethical drama praxis is illustrated by examples drawn from work carried out by two Asian postgraduate students currently studying at the University of Warwick...|$|R

As its parent railroads began to replace steam with diesel locomotives, the PRSL became a haven for steam locomotives during their final years of operation.|$|E
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how organizations become reoriented towards <b>more</b> environmentally <b>apt</b> strategies suffers from previously fragmented conceptual approaches and insufficient attention in research to the process and content of such ecological reorientations. This paper develops an orientational framework that systematizes different conceptualizations in the organizational, strategy and marketing literature and adds an ecological orientation. The framework is applied to an exploratory case study of an attempted reorientation towards a greener strategy in a household appliance firm. The minor ecological reorientation that occurred {{was found to be}} primarily driven by legislation rather than market pull owing to the dominant production orientation of the firm. Thus it is suggested here that the relative effectiveness of legislative push or market pull in achieving ecological reorientation varies according to the initial orientation of the firms.

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the very term 'tragedy of the commons' is a misnomer per se, since 'the commons' {{originally}} referred to a resource owned by a community, and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource. However, the term is presently used when describing a problem where all individuals have equal and open access to a resource. Hence, 'tragedy of open access regimes' or simply 'the open access problem' are <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> terms.|$|E

Novelas usually last six to eight months at most in Brazil. One of the longest-running telenovelas in that country, however, is the teen-oriented Malhação ("Working Out"), which has aired since 1995; as such, it is commonly classified as an American-format soap opera instead.|$|R

The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways.

Keeping this structure in mind, it makes sense that the substituent that can maintain positive charge the best would be most likely to migrate. The higher the degree of substitution, the more stable a carbocation generally is. Therefore, the tertiary > secondary > primary trend is observed.|$|E

25|$|Village rugs are <b>more</b> <b>apt</b> to have warps of wool {{rather than}} of cotton. Their designs are not as {{elaborate}} and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They {{are more likely to}} display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.|$|E

30|$|In addition, Vauquelin [27] {{investigated}} the slow dissociation of receptors {{and how that}} facilitates long-lasting protection of in vivo receptors.

In this respect, we can see in our simulated graph of healthy bound receptors (Figure  5 (d)) here that its level is very {{much higher than the}} no-trafficking case. This is because the receptors in this figure are healthy and therefore slow in dissociation. Moreover, trafficking felicitates healthy receptors’ binding with Ca 2 + and, consequently, can contribute to long lasting actions on calcium kinetics (first term on the right of equation (1)).|$|R
