40|$|Abstract — Bundle {{adjustment}} (BA) {{which produces}} highly accurate results for visual Simultaneous Localization and Map-ping (SLAM) {{could not be}} used for Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) with limited processing power because of its O(N 3) complexity. We observed that a consistent ground plane often exists for MAVs flying in both the indoor and outdoor urban environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a visual SLAM algorithm that make use of the plane constraint to reduce the complexity of BA. The reduction of complexity is achieved by refining only the current camera pose and most recent <b>map</b> <b>points</b> with BA that minimizes the reprojection errors and perpendicular distances between the most recent <b>map</b> <b>points</b> and the best fit plane with all the pre-existing <b>map</b> <b>points.</b> As a result, our algorithm is approximately constant time since the number of current camera pose and most recent <b>map</b> <b>points</b> remain approximately constant. In addition, the minimization of the perpendicular distances between the plane and <b>map</b> <b>points</b> would enforce consistency between the reconstructed <b>map</b> <b>points</b> and the actual ground plane.

However, Ioann [...] "Edward" [...] Sukhariev was sneaking up the whole time and caught Maniac trying to plant the bomb. Na'Vi ended the half with the 11-4 lead before the two teams switched sides. Titan came roaring back as its defense held up strong against Na'Vi's terrorist side. Na'Vi reached <b>map</b> <b>point</b> first at 15-13, but Titan claimed one more round. In the last round of regulation, round 30, Na'Vi executed towards the B bombsite and got the bomb planted fairly early. Rpk took down flamie shortly after the plant and Maniac caught seized with his back turned. Zeus took down Ex6TenZ but Maniac took down GuardiaN in the meantime. Zeus was able to take down Maniac but shox pushed through and took down both Edward and Zeus and defused the bomb to send the game to overtime. The overtime rounds were also close. Na'Vi once again got to <b>map</b> <b>point</b> first at 18-17. In the last round of the first overtime, Titan only had four pistols and one rifle to spend its remaining money on grenades. Titan went to the B bombsite. Ex6TenZ tried to push through but Zeus took him down.

Maniac tried to get the bomb that was dropped on the B bombsite, but all Na'Vi players were waiting and flamie sent Na'Vi to face off against Fnatic. shox topped the Titan scoreboard with 27 kills and Maniac was close by with 25. For Na'Vi, flamie had 29 kills, GuardiaN had 28, and Edward had 27 and all Na'Vi players had over 20 kills.|$|E
5000|$|Using the touchscreen, {{the owner}} can play with, train, pet, walk, brush, and wash a virtual dog. With the {{microphone}} that {{is built into}} the DS, the player can create voice commands which the puppy will understand and, if properly trained, follow. Dogs can be walked to the park where they can practice their disc catching skills, and to the gymnasium to practice dog agility. The game features two brands of currency: money and [...] "trainer points". Money is used to purchase items, whilst trainer points grow or shrink depending on the actions of the player. As points accumulate, more dogs become available for the player to adopt, and more background can be purchased to decorate the player's in-game house. By walking their dog, players earn trainer points; the amount of points varies depending on the length of the walk, and activities participated in on the way, such as contest training. While walking, question mark icons on the <b>map</b> <b>point</b> out areas that may contain neighborhood dogs or presents, though presents can be found unmarked as well.

In the 12th round, boltz flashed his way into the drop area of the map to take down Zeus with about 1:20 to go. mou quickly peeked to trade out boltz, but LUCAS1 took down AdreN just before. HObbit was able to sneak his way in through a smoke grenade, but only found LUCAS1 before HEN1 quickly turned around to take him out. steel planted the bomb, but Dosia sneaked around to make it a 2 vs. 2. mou threw an incendiary grenade to force HEN1 out of his position and took him out, but kNg quickly traded. Dosia then walked into the bullets of kNg and Immortals reset Gambit. Immortals took a huge lead into the second half with the score of 12-3. Immortals once again took the first three rounds of the half to get to <b>map</b> <b>point.</b> Gambit was able to take a round, but Immortals quickly struck back to take the first game. HEN1 lead all players with 22 kills while the rest of Immortals ranged from 15 kills to 17 kills. Dosia and mou each had 14 kills, but the starpower of AdreN did not show as he only had 5 kills.|$|E

50|$|Day 2 of {{the playoffs}} began with Cache, one of LG's worst maps. However, LG proved that it could still contend with the best on the map. VP took a strong 5-0 lead before LG got a round. VP had the {{potential}} to reset LG, but the duo of fer and FalleN shut down VP and TACO clinched the round to avoid being reset. VP rose to a 8-2 lead before LG won a third round. With reset potential for LG, the Brazilians once again avoided reset as fnx got two big kills and fer killed TaZ. LG won another round, but VP took the last two and had a 10-5 lead at the half. The two big fraggers for LG, fer and coldzera, struggled in the first half. The second half began with LG convincingly taking the pistol round. LG closed the gap to 10-8, but fer and coldzera could not win the 2 vs 2 against byali and NEO and VP went to 11 rounds. LG tied the score at 11-11 and took the lead at 15-11 and seemed likely to take the first game on its second worst map. However, VP was resilient and took the last four rounds to send the game to overtime. LG took the first round of overtime after cutting the clock close, but VP fought back and won the last two rounds. The teams switched sides and VP took {{the first round of the}} second half and was at <b>map</b> <b>point.</b> fnx had three kills and fer had two and LG needed one more round to send it to a second overtime. However, VP stormed the B bombsite and TACO was left in a 1 vs 4 situation. The youngest LG member could not pull it off and VP secured the first map 19-17. VP won with the help of byali's and Snax's 30 kills. LG came close with coldzera's 27 kills and FalleN's 24 but fell short in the end.|$|E
5000|$|However, which {{properties}} {{are added to}} a surface and to what degree depends upon which of the 7 forms are applied, and further upon the amounts and types of diluents added {{to reduce the cost}} of production. In 2006 the Association of German Engineers, VDI, the largest engineering association in Western Europe issued an authoritative report VDI2840 [...] in order to clarify the existing multiplicity of confusing terms and trade names. It provides a unique classification and nomenclature for diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and diamond films. It succeeded in reporting all information necessary to identify and to compare different DLC films which are offered on the market. Quoting from that document:These sp3 bonds can occur not only with crystals - in other words, in solids with long-range order - but also in amorphous solids where the atoms are in a random arrangement. In this case there will be bonding only between a few individual atoms and not in a long-range order extending over a large number of atoms. The bond types have a considerable influence on the material properties of amorphous carbon films. If the sp2 type is predominant the film will be softer, if the sp3 type is predominant the film will be harder. A secondary determinant of quality was found to be the fractional content of hydrogen. Some of the production methods involve hydrogen or methane as a catalyst and a considerable percentage of hydrogen can remain in the finished DLC material. When it is recalled that the soft plastic, polyethylene is made from carbon that is bonded purely by the diamond-like sp3 bonds, but also includes chemically bonded hydrogen, it is not surprising to learn that fractions of hydrogen remaining in DLC films degrade them almost as much as do residues of sp2 bonded carbon. The VDI2840 report confirmed the utility of locating a particular DLC material onto a 2-dimensional map on which the X-axis described the fraction of hydrogen in the material and the Y-axis described the fraction of sp3 bonded carbon atoms. The highest quality of diamond-like properties was affirmed to be correlated with the proximity of the <b>map</b> <b>point</b> plotting the (X,Y) coordinates of a particular material to the upper left corner at (0,1), namely 0% hydrogen and 100% sp3 bonding. That [...] "pure" [...] DLC material is ta-C and others are approximations that are degraded by diluents such as hydrogen, sp2 bonded carbon, and metals. Valuable properties of materials that are ta-C, or nearly ta-C follow.|$|E
50|$|Luminosity chose Mirage, the {{map that}} put the team on the {{international}} scene. However, it did not bode well at the start for the Brazilians. Na'Vi won the pistol round {{and then the next}} five rounds to take a 6-0 lead. In the seventh round, LG executed towards the A bombsite. Edward found coldzera shortly after and flamie followed up on TACO after the bomb was planted. fnx traded flamie but Zeus took down fer and LG needed to defend the bomb in a 2 vs 4. FalleN traded Zeus and the found GuardiaN attempting to run into the site. seized picked off FalleN and that left fnx in a 1 vs 2. fnx was known for his clutches on LG {{and he was able to}} pull off another clutch by taking down seized and Edward and LG took its first grand final round ever. In the next round, LG had a man advantage. Edward killed fnx but coldzera was able to trade quickly and pick up the bomb. seized found coldzera with about twenty seconds remaining, leaving him and FalleN in a 1 vs 1. Both players were low on health as FalleN had 11 hp and seized had 9. FalleN got the bomb down with just one second remaining and then peeked out at just the right time to find seized. LG took the ninth round and made it 6-3. In the tenth round, fer found Edward peeking midway through the round but GuardiaN just about picked off fer to make it a 4 vs 4. seized found fnx at the B bombsite and Zeus killed coldzera attempting to trick Na'Vi. flamie killed FalleN and was immediately killed by TACO, but TACO could not win the 1 vs 3 and Na'Vi picked up a seventh round. Na'Vi would go on to eleven rounds and had a chance to pick up twelve with LG on a limited buy. However, LG was able to overwhelm the CIS team and make it a 4-11 deficit. LG started off the second half strong by winning the pistol round and the expected anti-economy rounds to make it 11-7. Na'Vi nearly took the 19th round, but GuardiaN accidentally killing seized and coldzera shutting a couple of players down gave LG the round. LG made it 10-11 but Na'Vi was able to withstand the bomb retake from LG and win the round, making it 12-10 under flamie's two kills. LG was able to reset Na'Vi the next round and soon LG tied the game. LG finally took the lead at 13-12 extended it to 14-12. Na'Vi had inferior rifles in the 27th round, but GuardiaN's two kills and Zeus being able to clutch against TACO kept Na'Vi in the game. LG took a timeout, but Na'Vi was able to get to 15 rounds first. In the last round of regulation, flamie took down LG's captain early but fnx evens it out by killing flamie. Na'Vi was ready for an A bombsite execute with no LG members directly on the site and Na'Vi seemed likely to take the round. However, as the execution took place, fer peeked to find a running GuardiaN. Zeus attempted to trade but fer hid and ran through his own smoke and coldzera came in time to kill Zeus. The bomb was planted but seized and Edward were left in a 2 vs 4. seized sprayed down fnx but was immediately traded by fer. Edward found fer but was sniped by coldzera as he was attempting to get away. TACO defused the bomb and LG forced overtime. Na'Vi won the first round of overtime under Zeus's triple kill and LG won the second round under fer's double kill. In the third round, Zeus found fer early. With about fifteen seconds left, Na'Vi rushed to the A bombsite, but flamie was taken down by FalleN. GuardiaN was able to plant the bomb just in time. fnx took down seized but was immediately traded by Zeus. GuardiaN missed a shot on coldzera and was punished right after. coldzera then found Zeus, leaving Edward in a 1 vs 3. However, like fnx for LG, Edward was known for his clutches on Na'Vi. Edward took down coldzera. TACO was defusing the bomb and needed less than one second left, but Edward purposely missed FalleN to take down TACO. FalleN traded Edward, but Edward taking down FalleN meant that there was no time left for LG and Edward was able to clutch the round. The teams switched sides and in the fourth round LG was able to take the B bombsite in twenty seconds, forcing the three remaining Na'Vi members to fall back and save their weapons. They were only able to save two after LG ran after flamie. LG came with another fast execute, this time in about 25 seconds, and LG was able to get to <b>map</b> <b>point</b> first. In the last round of the first overtime, FalleN found seized trying to peek while jumping at the B bombsite. However, GuardiaN was prepared and traded FalleN to make it a 4 vs 4 again. With about 25 seconds left, LG ran into the A bombsite. coldzera found flamie quickly but was traded by a hidden Zeus. Zeus had a chance to take down more LG players but fnx was able to trade him out. Edward tried to deny TACO from planting the bomb, but he killed him after the bomb was planted. GuardiaN missed a crucial shot on fnx and was taken down by the said LG player and Edward was left in another clutch situation. He shot down fnx but was taken down to 11 HP and fer was able to peek out right after and LG took the first game 19-17. Zeus had a massive 31 kills for Na'Vi and Edward had 29, but coldzera's 37 and fer's 30 bested Na'Vi. Meanwhile, GuardiaN, who was named the second best player of 2015 behind olofmeister, struggled with 19 kills and 27 deaths.|$|E

Intracardiac ultrasound with a magnetic sensor probe has recently become available for catheter ablation. In this study, we assessed a new mapping method, contraction mapping, for determining the optimal ablation sites using intracardiac ultrasound and M-mode. This study sought to assess the accuracy of the new mapping method using intracardiac echocardiography. Methods: Eighteen patients (10 males and eight females; mean age, 63 ± 12 years) with 104 <b>mapping</b> <b>points</b> diagnosed as idiopathic PVCs were included in this study. At the <b>mapping</b> <b>points,</b> the time interval from the onset of the QRS to the onset of the contraction (QRS-c-time) and the local activation time were measured using M-mode with an intracardiac echo probe and using the conventional method.

Results: The QRS-c-time was significantly correlated with the local activation time (activation time=− 66. 8 + 0. 882 * QRS-c-time, R 2 = 0. 728, p< 0. 0001).
