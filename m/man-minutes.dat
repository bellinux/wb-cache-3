40|$|Vertebrate remains {{have been}} found on gravel bars of the Red River in {{southwest}} Arkansas, northeast Louisiana, and east Texas. The majority of these specimens were recovered by amateur archaeologists and Dr. Frank Schambach of the Arkansas Archaeology Survey. Extinct species of bison (Bison sp.), mastodon (Mammut americanum), pampathere (Holmesina septentrionalis), llama (Palaeolama mirifica), tortoises (Geochelone sp.), and (Terrapene sp.) indicate a Pleistocene component in the region 2 Ì† 7 s alluvium. The giant tortoise, pampathere, and llama represent first known occurrences of these species {{for the state of}} Arkansas. Search times between finds were recorded for seven localities. The richest gravel bar averaged one man-minute per find. The least productive bar averaged 82. 5 <b>man-minutes</b> per find. The average collection rate for all bars was one find per 19. 5 <b>man-minutes...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{basic process}} models for textual and graphical HDL-based design. The models {{are used to}} measure effort (time) required for various design activities, with an aim to quantify design productivity. Effort-distribution in <b>man-minutes</b> {{is used as a}} parameter to evaluate design productivity. Design quality, defined as a probability that the design meets its specifications, is plotted for various design activities. We also discuss the resources that are essential to perform each design activity. These experiments demonstrate that "effort-distribution analysis " is useful for real life HDL-based design projects...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{the tools}} used at NREL to {{compensate}} for the difference between a reference spectrum and a simulator spectrum have been well-matched reference cells and the application of a calculated spectral mismatch correction factor, M. This paper describes the algorithm for adjusting the spectrum of a 9 -channel fiber-optic-based solar simulator with a uniform beam size of 9 cm square at 1 -sun. The combination of this algorithm and the One-Sun Multi-Source Simulator (OSMSS) hardware reduces NREL's current vs. voltage measurement time for a typical three-junction device from man-days to <b>man-minutes.</b> These time savings may be significantly greater for devices with more junctions...|$|E

40|$|When an {{underwater}} vehicle {{is to be}} towed by a surface craft at speeds greater than 1 or 2 knots, the tow cable designer faces several major problems. Included are overcoming the drag and lift forces that can limit tow vehicle depth and eliminating cable strumming,which causes fatigue failures. The usual solution is to add segments of fairing to the tow cable to change its hydrodynamic characteristics. However, this is normally a costly, time-consuming effort, especially on tow cable {{that does not have}} metallic armor. This report describes a method that greatly simplifies one part of the fairing installation procedure and is especially useful on plastic jacketed cable. A. C. Esau, Captain, USN Commanding Officer, NORDA Executive summary The construction and installation details of mechanical stops for use with fairing segments on plastic jacketed underwater tow cables are explained. Installation is easy, consumes about one <b>man-minute</b> per stop, and requires no tools. The parts {{do not have to be}} threaded onto the tow cable from one end, they are very inexpensive, and are available off the shelf. Slight modifi-cation of the off-the-shelf parts is generally necessary. The technique does not require the resistance to crush, which is usually available only with metallic armored cable. It has been used successfully on electromechanical cable that contained a braided Kevlar tension member within a polyurethane jacket...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the study was to develop a model that would provide an {{efficient}} and standardized approach to workload reporting in a non-fee (HMO-like) dental care system. The model was also designed to predict the dental personnel resource requirements in the system as the overall dental needs of the population were already known. To accomplish this, a set of 246 task/procedures representing the broad scope of dental practice was developed. For each task/procedure, a Best Time-weighted Estimate (BTE) in terms of average expected <b>man-minutes</b> of work required for accomplishment was developed from over 35, 000 actual time measurements on patient visits to 29 US Army dental clinics located throughout the United States. Because of the nature of the specific task/procedure data, it was necessary to use four different mathematical models to produce statistically optimal BTEs. It was concluded that, cumulatively the BTEs developed for each task/procedure evaluated could be used as a basis for both the development of a Dental Care Composite Unit workload measure and the determination of overall dental personnel resource requirements in a non-free dental care system...|$|E
40|$|Scientific Groups Program: Seq. no. 10 - Poster Presentation: {{abstract}} no. 0064 OBJECTIVE: To {{establish a}} demonstration school-based oral {{health care service}} {{in a rural area}} in China and to investigate its effects on school children's oral health. METHODS: Study population was children attending grade 3 in seven primary schools in a rural township in southern China in 2003. Clinical examinations and a questionnaire survey were conducted. By random selection, an outreach dental service was offered free of charge to the children in four schools. Preventive and restorative dental services were provided annually by local dentists according to the children's individual needs. Cost of the materials used and time taken to deliver the service was recorded. Evaluation of outcome was carried out after 3 years by conducting clinical examinations. RESULTS: A total of 1635 children were examined at baseline, 1096 in the test group and 539 in the control. Their mean age was 9. 7 years and 55 % were boys. At baseline, over 90 % of the children had dental caries, mainly in primary teeth, and similar in both the test and control groups (p> 0. 05). After 36 months, 1493 (92 %) children were examined, 1001 and 492 in the test and control groups respectively. Prevalence of dental caries in permanent teeth in the test and control children were 11 % and 25 % respectively (p 0. 05). Moreover, a lower percentage of the test children had dental calculus (55 % vs. 63 %, p= 0. 004). The resources spent on providing the service per child per year was 22. 7 <b>man-minutes</b> for staff and less than US$ 1 for materials. CONCLUSION: The study outreach school dental service was effective in improving the oral health of the children and was generally affordable by the local community. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 22 nd International Association for Dental Research (SEA Division) & 19 th South East Asia Association for Dental Education, Manila, Philippines, 8 - 10 October 2008...|$|E
