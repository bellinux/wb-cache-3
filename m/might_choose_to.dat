5|$|The French {{government}} {{claimed that}} it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called repatriates to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both Algeria and France.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, around 30 {{members of}} the Assiniboine First Nation {{were killed in the}} Cypress Hills Massacre, {{creating}} a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a Privy Council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North-West Mounted Police with the intention of mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> intervene. Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 63 BC, Hybrida went to Etruria {{to assist}} the praetor, Quintus Metellus Celer, in {{preventing}} Catiline escaping through the Alps and into Gaul. Catiline, hoping that Hybrida <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> help him, choose to engage him and his consular army rather than the forces under the praetor. Hybrida, however, had given command of the army to his legate, Marcus Petreius, having either suffered a bout of gout or pretending to have. Catiline put up his final resistance in Pistoria, Etruria with an army of 3000 men. Here, Petreius and his soldiers massacred the entire army, killed and beheaded Catiline, and then sent his head to Rome. Hybrida, having adhered to the agreement that he had with Cicero and the Senate, was granted the governorship of Macedonia {{at the end of}} his consulship.|$|E
25|$|Insurance {{bets are}} {{expected}} to lose money in the long run, because the dealer {{is likely to have}} blackjack less than one-third of the time. However the insurance outcome is strongly anti-correlated with that of the main wager, and if the player's priority is to reduce variation, they <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> pay for this.|$|E
25|$|In addition, he {{made two}} other objections: that {{defendants}} <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> forgo the defense despite {{the facts of}} the case out of fear that an inquiry into their predisposition to offend would allow the prosecution to bring up prior bad acts that might not otherwise be relevant, and that jury verdicts of entrapment were not as reliable in deriving precedent for future cases.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{it is more}} {{cost-effective}} to select respondents in groups ('clusters'). Sampling is often clustered by geography, or by time periods. (Nearly all samples are in some sense 'clustered' in time – although this is rarely {{taken into account in}} the analysis.) For instance, if surveying households within a city, we <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> select 100 city blocks and then interview every household within the selected blocks.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative pain is minimal, and {{the woman}} is usually able to leave {{hospital}} the same day. No vaginal packing is required, although she <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> wear a sanitary pad for comfort. The physician informs the woman that the reduced labia are often very swollen during the early post-operative period, because of the edema caused by the anaesthetic solution injected to swell the tissues.|$|E
25|$|The fully {{transparent}} {{nature of}} existing ETFs means that an actively managed ETF {{is at risk}} from arbitrage activities by market participants who <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> front run its trades as daily reports of the ETF's holdings reveals its manager's trading strategy. The initial actively managed equity ETFs addressed this problem by trading only weekly or monthly. Actively managed debt ETFs, which are less susceptible to front-running, trade their holdings more frequently.|$|E

50|$|Patients {{experiencing}} symptoms {{associated with}} pheochromocytoma {{should be aware}} that it is rare. However, it often goes undiagnosed until autopsy; therefore patients <b>might</b> wisely <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> take steps to provide a physician with important clues, such as recording whether blood pressure changes significantly during episodes of apparent anxiety.|$|R
25|$|Heap {{leaching}} is an {{extraction process}} by which chemicals (usually sulfuric acid) are used to extract the economic element from ore which has been mined and placed in piles on the surface. Heap leaching is generally economically feasible only for oxide ore deposits. Oxidation of sulfide deposits occurs during the geological process called weathering. Therefore, oxide ore deposits are typically found close to the surface. If {{there are no other}} economic elements within the ore a mine <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> extract the uranium using a leaching agent, usually a low molar sulfuric acid.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May, Mehmed sent an {{ambassador}} to Constantinople {{and offered to}} lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed {{the safety of the}} population that <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands {{in the hands of the}} Turks as Ottoman possession.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{responses}} to the uncertainties of global warming is to adopt a strategy of sequential decision making. This strategy recognizes that decisions on global warming need to be made with incomplete information, and that decisions in the near term will have potentially long-term impacts. Governments <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> use risk management as part of their policy response to global warming. For instance, a risk-based approach can be applied to climate impacts which are difficult to quantify in economic terms, e.g., the impacts of global warming on indigenous peoples.|$|E

50|$|By way of {{comparative}} example, California has long held {{the position that}} clients must be encouraged to speak candidly to their legal counsel about both past and future actions knowing their statements {{will be held in}} complete confidence. Their counsel can then explain the relevant law to them and urge them to conform their future conduct to the law, thus promoting lawful conduct. In contrast, ABA Model Rule 1.6 contains exceptions to confidentiality for both violent and nonviolent (e.g. financial) future crimes, which California believes creates a strong disincentive for clients to discuss their future plans with their attorneys - but for which the client <b>might</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> comply with the law instead of violating it.|$|R

25|$|The French {{artillery}} train having arrived, Colonel James Grant {{proposed that}} the castle should be attacked from the classic direction of the town cemetery where the guns would be nearly level with the fortifications. However, Prince Charles was allegedly afraid that the return fire from the castle would wreck the town of Stirling and therefore opted for an alternative that was offered by the Franco-Scottish engineer Mirabelle de Gordon, who had arrived with Lord John Drummond. Mirablle de Gordon stated that an attack from the little Gowan Hill, which lay hard under the north-eastern side of the castle, which would be totally dominated by whatever cannon the besiegers <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> fire against it. The bedrock at this location however, was only 15 inches below the surface {{making it difficult for}} the besiegers to throw up effective cover, and the ramparts of the castle on this side were {{at the top of a}} near vertical cliff which would make it impossible even for the agile Highlanders to scale. The Prince accepted Mirabelle de Gordon’s advice and in doing so is probably the tactical mistake that can be most firmly pinned on him.|$|E
25|$|Fabius first {{reinforced}} the Roman garrison at Casilinum, which guarded one such bridge, and Cales {{on the south}} of Ager Falernus. Minucius took up position {{to the north of}} the plain to watch both the via Latina and via Appia with a detachment, while Taenum was also garrisoned. The main Roman army camped near Mount Massicus, north of the plain to the west of Minucius, ready to support his position. A detachment of 4,000 troops was sent to watch the passes of Mount Callicula to the east of the plain near Allifae, one of the possible passes through which Hannibal <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> leave the plain. The exact location is still unknown and remains debatable. Thus, the Roman dispositions hemmed the Carthaginians in the plain, trapping them. It seemed that Hannibal would have to attack a Roman position directly to break out; the only question was whether he would choose such a dangerous manoeuvre before or after his supplies had failed. Fabius had ensured the best possible situation for Rome in his view. All the Romans now had to do was wait until the Carthaginians ran out of supplies and then were forced to take desperate measures.|$|E

Nonetheless, he agreed to a six-year extension worth $35 million that would keep him in Calgary until the end of the 2013–14 season. He struggled at times, as his GAA and save percentage fell outside of the top 30 goaltenders in the League by mid-November. His play improved throughout the season, however, and he finished the season third in the NHL with 39 wins.|$|E
500|$|... {{but there}} are some hazards. Although {{training}} and safe procedures are central to the ethos of the sport, a few fatal accidents occur every year, almost all caused by pilot error. In particular there is a risk of mid-air collisions between gliders, because two pilots <b>might</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> fly to the same area of lift and so might collide. Because of this risk, pilots usually wear parachutes. To avoid other gliders and general aviation traffic, pilots must comply with the Rules of the Air and keep a good lookout. In several European countries and Australia, the FLARM warning system is used to help avoid mid-air collisions between gliders. A few modern gliders have a ballistic emergency parachute to stabilize the aircraft after a collision.|$|E
