5|$|Central Province is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} national movement of Zambia. The United National Independence Party (UNIP) was founded in Kabwe by Kenneth Kaunda, who later became the first President of Zambia and remained in office from 1964 to 1991. The provincial capital is Kabwe, home of the Mulungushi Rock of Authority. This is a historic site, an isolated flat-topped hill, where in 1960, UNIP <b>met</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, away from the eye of the colonial administration. It is still used for political gatherings, but the open air assemblies have been replaced by a conference centre built nearby at Mulungushi University. Mulungushi is the name of a river in the province and many historical policies, buildings and organizations are named after it. The 1968 Mulungushi Declaration proclaimed the country as a socialist nation. Mulungushi Hall in the capital is the venue for most international conventions. The city of Kapiri Mposhi was a historic site during the post-colonial era fight against White minorities.|$|E
