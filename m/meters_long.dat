5|$|Excavated between 1992 and 1995, it {{is located}} {{underneath}} the western sector of the palace {{at a depth of}} almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other's with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west-east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 <b>meters</b> <b>long,</b> 4 meters wide and west-east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks protruding from the sides toward the middle of the rooms suggest the roof to have been a corbelled vault.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> at the waterline, and 183 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> overall. They had {{a beam of}} 17 meters and a draft of 5.42 meters standard, 7.25 meters forward, and 6.03 meters aft. The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at standard load and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men. They were designed to carry one picket boat, a barge, a launch, and two cutters.|$|E
5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E

5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses even over 50 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence.|$|E
5|$|Matt's brigade {{began moving}} to Tasa at 4:30 PM on October 15, before turning eastwards on Akavish. Heavy {{congestion}} {{on the roads}} made the brigade's progress very slow. A little after midnight, the brigade left Akavish and moved westward to the Yard, an area 700 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> and 150 meters wide surrounded by protective sand walls. The site had been made long before the war.|$|E
5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{difficult}} to excavate, as it is buried deep under the later layers of habitation. A defensive system against floods, composed of a circular embankment was unearthed, {{in addition to a}} circular 6.7m thick internal rampart to protect the city from enemies. An area of 300 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> filled with gardens and craftsmen quarters, separated the outer embankment from the inner rampart which had a height of 8 to 10 meters, and was strengthened by defensive towers. Other findings include one of the city gates, a street beginning at the center and ending at the gate, in addition to residential houses. Mari had a central mound, however no temple or palaces have been unearthed, although a large building that seems to have been an administrative one was unearthed which had stone foundations and dimensions of (32 meters X 25 meters), with rooms up to 12 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> and 6 meters wide. The city was abandoned {{at the end of the}} Early Dynastic period II c. 2550 BC for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} shipsQ and Rwere {{enlarged}} versions: 188 <b>meters</b> <b>long</b> at the waterline and 196 m overall. Their beams were 1 meter wider, at 18 meters. The ships' draft was lower at 5.4 meters. The ships {{were designed to}} displace 9,300 tons, and displaced 8,568 tons standard. All six ships were to have steel-made, and up to 85% welded construction. The design called for fifteen watertight compartments and a double bottom for 78% {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw {{construction}} of a north wing, {{increasing the number of}} rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. In Germany, it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock airships, to cost $100,000. The platform would extend over the whole roof, and the tracks for the airship launch would be on an incline 105 <b>meters</b> <b>long.</b> The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the airships. A mooring mast for docking airships was constructed on top of the west wing, however no record exists of it having been used. The mooring mast nonetheless was the first built for docking airships.|$|E

5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} cable ship port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. Cargo traffic has tripled over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 <b>meters</b> <b>long,</b> thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} newcomers {{represented the}} Linear Pottery culture. Their uniform culture survived in Poland {{in its original}} form until about 4600 BCE. Despite the big impact they made, the first waves came in small numbers - hundreds, or at most a few thousand people, judging by the sizes of the known settlements. They populated mainly fertile soils of southern highlands and river valleys further north, {{all the way to}} the Baltic Sea. They lived alongside the more numerous native people who were still pursuing the Mesolithic lifestyle, but during the Linear Pottery culture times there wasn't much interaction, as the two groups inhabited different environments. Their villages consisted of several, but sometimes up to a dozen or so rectangular communal long-houses, some over 30 <b>meters</b> <b>long,</b> supported by wooden posts, the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region. One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica, which is now at the west end of Kraków just within the city limits.|$|E

Of the barges collected for the invasion, 1,336 were classified as peniches and 982 as Kampinen.
