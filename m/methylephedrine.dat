40|$|Membrane permeation-controlled transdermal {{delivery}} devices for the controlled delivery of <b>methylephedrine</b> HCl were developed using calcium alginate membrane as rate-controlling membrane. To increase the solubility of <b>methylephedrine</b> HCl in the systems, HPMC and agar binary gel {{was used as}} drug reservoir. In vitro drug release {{studies were carried out}} using modified Franz diffusion cells. The result shows that the step of drug penetrating through the calcium alginate membrane is rate-limiting, then the rate of drug release from the patch is considered to be membrane controlled. The release kinetics of ointment and patch may be square root time dependent and the highest regression coefficient was obtained with the Higuchi model. The surface permeability of ointment was reduced by crosslinking of the membranes and enable drug continuous release over prolonged periods. Above results will be helpful to possible development of rate-controlling membrane {{transdermal delivery}} systems for the other drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a simple and robust LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of ephedrine type substances in urine. Sample preparation consisted of a 10 -fold dilution step of the samples into the internal standard solution (ephedrine-d(3), 4 mu g/mL in water). Baseline separation of the diastereoisomers norpseudoephedrine-norephedrine and ephedrine-pseudoephedrine was performed On a C 8 -column using isocratic conditions followed by positive electrospray ionisation and tandem mass spectrometric detection. The mobile phase consisted of 98 / 2 (H 2 O/ACN) containing 0. 1 % HAc and 0. 01 % TFA. Calibration curves were constructed between 2. 5 and 10 mu g/mL for norephedrine and norpseudoephedrine and 5 and 20 mu g/mL for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and <b>methylephedrine.</b> The bias ranged from - 5. 5 to 12 % for norephedrine, - 4. 1 to 8. 0 % for norpseudoephedrine, 0. 3 to 2. 1 % for ephedrine, 1. 6 to 2. 6 % for pseudoephedrine and 2. 9 to 5. 0 % for <b>methylephedrine.</b> Precision of the method varied between 2. 8 and 10. 4 % for all compounds and the matrix effect was less than 15 %. The applicability of the method has been checked by the analysis of 40 urine samples. The results were compared with those obtained with the common GC-NPD method. Results show a good correlation between both methods with correlation coefficients higher than 0. 95 for all analytes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} determination and confirmation of illicit drugs (e. g., methamphetamine, amphetamine, ephedrine, <b>methylephedrine,</b> morphine, morphine- 3 -glucuronide, morphine- 6 -glucuronide, 6 -acetylmorphine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine) in human urine by thermospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was studied. The LC-MS separation {{was performed on}} a reversed phase column (L-column ODS; 150 mm x 4. 6 -mm i. d.) using a gradient mobile phase system of 100 mM ammonium acetate for 1 rain then linear amps to 100 ram ammonium acetate including 40 % acetonitrile at 20 rain. Extraction was conducted by solid-phase extraction using a Sep-pak C 18 cartridge. The drugs were eluted with 2 mL of 40 % acetonitrile in 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 3 (adjusted with acetic acid), from the cartridge. A 50 -pL volume of the eluate was injected into the LC-MS. The recoveries by this extraction were 88 to 99 %. The mass spectra of methamphetamine, amphetamine, ephedrine, <b>methylephedrine,</b> morphine, 6 -acetylmorphine, cocaine, and henzoylecgonine showed the quasi-molecular [M+H] ยง ion as the base peak, whereas morphine- 3 -glucuronide and morphine- 6 -glucuronide showed [MH-glucuronide] ยง ion as the base peak. The calibration graphs were linear and reproducible. Detection limits of these drugs ranged from 2 to 40 ng/mL by selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode and from 50 to 400 ng/mL by scan mode. The coefficients of variation {{for the analysis of}} these drugs ranged from 4. 5 to 9. 5 % at a concentration of 0. 4 pg/mL (n = 10) ...|$|E
40|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is commonly}} seen in small breed dogs and {{is caused by}} a progressive weakening of the tracheal rings. A 5 year-old male Yorkshire terrier (weighing 1. 97 kg) was presented Veterinary Teaching Hospital at Kangwon National University (S. Korea) with goose honking cough and cyanosis. On the radiographical and endoscopical examination, trachea was collapsed from the mid of cervical trachea to the mid of thoracic trachea. A self-expanding intraluminal stent (Zilver 635 biliary stents, COOK, USA) was implanted to restore collapsed trachea. After implantation, the dog was medicated with cough suppressant (<b>methylephedrine,</b> 2 mg kg 1 BID), prednisolone (0. 5 mg kg 1 BID) and cefazoline (5 mg kg 1 BID) for 2 weeks, to reduce side effects from metallic stenting. Clinical improvement was noticed right after implantation. Although mild transient dry cough lasted for a month, the dog was clinically recovered from tracheal collapse...|$|E
40|$|A dataset {{consisting}} of structures and aqueous solubility and melting point data for 51 salt {{forms of the}} phenylethylamine base <b>methylephedrine</b> is presented. Analysis showed correlation between solubility and melting point and between melting point of the salt and melting point of the parent acid, but no correlation of salt solubility with solubility of the parent acid. Identification of associations was aided by examining chemically sensible subgroups of the dataset, and this approach highlighted significantly different relationships between solubility and melting point for these subgroups. Thus, for example, the expected negative correlation between solubility and melting point was found for 24 anhydrous benzoate salts, but a positive correlation observed for 8 halide salts. Hydrated forms were anomalous. Packing analysis identified groups of structures that were isostructural with respect to cation packing. Correlation between solubility and melting point {{was found to be}} greatest within these isostructural groups, implying a role for packing structure in determining solubility...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a method for}} the detection and quantitation of cathine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and <b>methylephedrine</b> in urine, using their deuterated analogues as internal standards and derivatization to form the corresponding trimethylsilyl derivatives after a simple liquid-liquid extraction. The {{study was designed to}} evaluate whether the urinary cutoff values set by the World Anti-Doping Agency for the banned ephedrines (cathine > 5 microg/mL, ephedrine and <b>methylephedrine</b> > 10 microg/mL) can be exceeded after the normal self-administration of common over-the-counter medicaments containing nonbanned ephedrines. The present method, after validation, has been applied on real urine samples obtained from 9 healthy volunteers taking different doses of over-the-counter preparations containing ephedrines. Results obtained from excretion studies show high interindividual differences in the urinary concentrations of both pseudoephedrine and cathine, not dependent on body weight or sex nor, in some instances, on the administered dose. The same typical therapeutic dose of pseudoephedrine (60 mg) produced a urinary concentration of more than 5 microg/mL for cathine and of more than 100 microg/mL for pseudoephedrine in 2 of 9 subjects only. When a dose of 120 mg was administered, cathine concentration exceeded 5 microg/mL in 4 of 7 subject, and also concentrations of pseudoephedrine above 100 microg/mL. After administration of 5 x 120 mg of pseudoephedrine (120 mg administered every 7 days for 5 weeks) to one of the subjects exceeding the urinary threshold values, the urinary concentration of cathine and pseudoephedrine exceeded 5 microg/mL (peak concentration 14. 8 microg/mL) and 100 microg/mL (peak concentration 275 microg/mL), respectively. When the same subject took 180 mg of pseudoephedrine, the urinary concentration values were below 5 microg/mL for ephedrine and 100 microg/mL for pseudoephedrine. In the case of ephedrine administration in a sustained-release formulation containing 12 mg of ephedrine, 2 of 3 subjects exceeded the urinary cutoff value of 10 microg/mL. The high interindividual variability is still significant even if the urinary concentration values are adjusted by specific gravity and/or creatinine. These results confirm a high interindividual variability in the urinary concentration of ephedrines after the administration of the same therapeutic dose of a preparation...|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} phytochemical {{analysis of}} Ephedra alata indicated {{the presence of}} cardiac glycosides, reducing sugars, flavonoids, phenolic compounds and alkaloids. Ephedra species contain alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, norpseudoephedrine, <b>methylephedrine,</b> and methylpseudoephedrine. Beside the E-type alkaloids, ephedroxane, and macrocyclic spermidines called ephedradine A-D, were isolated from some Ephedra species. The total amount of alkaloids isolated from Ephedra alata aerial parts was 0. 2 - 0. 22 %. Phenolic compounds included chlorogenic acid, rutin, catechin, quercetin, coumaric acid, flavonoid (Vicenin II, lucenin III, kaempferol 3 -rhamnoside, quercetin 3 -rhamnoside, herbacetin 7 -glucoside, herbacetin 8 -methyl ether 3 -O- glucoside- 7 -O-rutinoside and herbacetin 7 -O- 6 โณ-quinylglucoside) and furanofuran ((ยฑ) -syringaresinol, digalloylglucose, nilocitin, p-coumaric acid) were isolated from Ephedra alata. Ephedra foliata also produced ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. The total alkaloids contents of Ephedra foliata (ephedrine and psudoephedrine) were 0. 04 - 0. 2 %. Previous pharmacological studies revealed that Ephedra species possessed antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective and cardiovascular effects. This review discussed the chemical constituents and pharmacological effects of Ephedra alata and Ephedra foliata. Keywords: Ephedra alata, Ephedra foliata, pharmacology, constituents, therap...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the determination of}} ephedrine (E) and pseudoephedrine (PE) and their metabolites norephedrine (NE), norpseudoephedrine (NPE), <b>methylephedrine</b> (ME), and methylpseudoephedrine (MPE) alkaloids in natural health products by flow injection-electrospray ionization-high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (FI-ESI-FAIMS-MS). The determination of the six alkaloids requires the separation of diastereomic pairs of E 2 ฬ 212 PE, NE 2 ฬ 212 NPE, and ME 2 ฬ 212 MPE. FAIMS was able to resolve/separate these isomeric pairs based on their gas-phase ion mobility differences. The FAIMS-based separation and detection approach has been tested on over-the-counter diet pills. Following the extraction of the tablets, either by pressurized fluid extraction developed in-house or with sonication, the ephedra alkaloids were quantified using a modified isotope dilution approach. Detection limits for the alkaloids ranged from 0. 1 to 3 ng/mL, and a linear range of at least 2 orders of magnitude was observed for the six analytes. The throughput of the current configuration of the FI-ESI-FAIMS-MS system is 2 min/sample, which is significantly higher than conventional chromatographic approaches. The developed FI-ESI-FAIMS-MS method has been compared with a conventional LC 2 ฬ 212 UV analysis, and good agreement has been found for the major alkaloids.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis is based on novel analytical approaches to develop new methods for determining psychoactive and therapeutic drugs in biological matrices. All the analytical methods developed were according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. The first project involved development and validation of an analytical method for quantification of psychoactive drug mephedrone and its two metabolites 4 - <b>methylephedrine</b> and 4 -methylnorephedrine in human hair using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Recent abuse of designer drugs such as mephedrone has presented a requirement for sensitive, reliable and reproducible analytical methods {{for the detection of}} these controlled drugs in different matrices. Based on the similar structure of mephedrone to other methcathinones and amphetamines, the study also proposed a similar metabolic pathway for mephedrone. The method developed can be of great value for the future detection of mephedrone and its two metabolites in human hair. Having completed the above, another analytical method was developed capable of detecting 0. 6 ng/mg abacavir and tenofovir in human hair using LC-MS/MS. The method was successfully validated for the intraday precision, interday precision, and limit of detection, accuracy and extraction recovery. This is the first full report of a method for the simultaneous determination of these two key antiretroviral drugs in hair. The newly developed method is useful for future routine analysis of tenofovir and abacavir in human hair and could be used in therapeutic drug monitoring and adherence to medicines studies, which would be helpful in decision making regarding treatment change in combination anti-retroviral therapies. The last project focused on analysing dietary substances such as green and white tea, fruit juices along with catechins present in tea and corticosteroids in order to investigate potential inhibitory effects on the glucuronidation of B 2 " agonists clenbuterol and formoterol. [3;- agonists are frequently prescribed for the treatment of asthma in athletes. Due to performance-enhancing effects, these [3;- agonists have been subjected to restrictions in sport. A glucuronidation method using human liver microsomes (HLM) and uridine 5 '-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT 2 B 17) has been used. The study shows that common dietary products and the catechins present in tea inhibit the glucuronidation activity of forrnoterol which effects/alters the actual drug concentration when testing in human body/urine and may help in masking formoterol misuse therefore having implications on current doping control in sport...|$|E
