500|$|During {{a writing}} session at McCartney's house in north London, Lennon and McCartney {{fine-tuned}} the lyrics, using {{an approach that}} author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William Burroughs. [...] "I didn't copy the accident," [...] Lennon said. [...] "Tara didn't blow his mind out, {{but it was in}} my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song—not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene—were similarly part of the fiction." [...] McCartney expounded on the subject: [...] "The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It has been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don't believe is the case, certainly as we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara in <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> John's head it might have been. In my head I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who'd stopped at some traffic lights and didn't notice that the lights had changed. The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> every time I see it." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{defending}} Moyles {{have noted}} that Aled Haydn Jones, his show's producer {{who has worked with}} Moyles since 2001, is openly gay. He was quoted in The Guardian by Stonewall chief executive Ben Summerskill as saying [...] "Yeah, I'm homophobic, I don't like the gays. Sorry, it just does <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in.</b> We have a token gay on the show!" [...] In his book The Difficult Second Book, Moyles says that he was responding to another article with sarcasm, and was subsequently quoted out of context.|$|E
2500|$|On January 25, 2013, it was {{announced}} that guitarist Greg Ginn and vocalist Ron Reyes would reform Black Flag, joined by Gregory Moore on drums, and 'Dale Nixon' on bass (Dale Nixon is a pseudonym sometimes used by Ginn, most prominently as the bassist on My War). The band would tour as well as release a new album, their first since 1985's In <b>My</b> <b>Head.</b> <b>In</b> March, it {{was announced}} that Screeching Weasel bassist Dave Klein had joined the band. On May 2, 2013, the band released a new song entitled [...] "Down in the Dirt" [...] through their website.

2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then he says [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. I could feel the presence of Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to {{the back of my head}} out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{has called}} it his {{favorite}} song of all time. In {{an interview with}} David Leaf in 1990 he stated, [...] "I was asked recently to give my top 10 favorite songs for a Japanese radio station ... I didn't think long and hard on it but I popped that [...] {{on the top of}} my list. It's very deep. Very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one." [...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time I hear it. It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm afraid to say that during the sound check I broke down. It was just too much to stand there singing this song that does <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> and to stand there singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And if I never write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and {{do my best to}} record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I'll have a whole bunch of them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in.</b> I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{solve the}} problem of {{overpopulation}} in Japan, a plan was announced in Tokyo in 1935 to settle five million Japanese farmers and their families into Manchukuo between 1936 and 1956, and in the first stage of the plan 20,000Japanese families moved to Manchukuo every year, continuing until 1944, when American submarine attacks reduced the shipping available to move colonists into Manchukuo. By 1939, the total Japanese population in Manchukuo was about 837,000men, women, and children; comprising the Japanese who had been brought in as rural colonists plus the Japanese who had come to Manchukuo to work as civil servants, businessmen, and for the South Manchurian Railroad company, which was the largest corporation in Asia at the time, together with their families. To provide farmland for the Japanese settlers, the ethnic Chinese and ethnic Korean farmers already living on the land were evicted {{to make way for the}} colonists. Those farmers who resisted eviction to make way for the Japanese settlers were used by the Kwantung Army for bayonet practice. Furthermore, Manchukuo was meant to be the industrial powerhouse of the Japanese empire, and right from the start, the Japanese started to build factories and mines on a vast scale while the Chinese workers were ruthlessly exploited. The American historian Mark Driscoll described the economic system introduced by Nobusuke Kishi, Manchukuo's Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce between 1935-1939 and a future prime minister of Japan, as a “necropolitical” system where the Chinese workers were literally treated as dehumanized cogs within a vast industrial machine. Behr commented that Puyi knew from his talks in Tianjin with General Kenji Doihara and General Seishirō Itagaki that he was dealing with [...] "ruthless men and that this might be the regime to expect". Puyi later recalled that: [...] "I had put <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the tiger's mouth" [...] by going to Manchuria in 1931.|$|E
