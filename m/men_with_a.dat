5|$|The {{progressive}} {{movement in}} the United States was at its height during the early 20th century. With the migration of families from farms to cities, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism and individualism. The YMCA was an early promoter of reforms for young <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> focus on social welfare and programs of mental, physical, social and religious development.|$|E

5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate.

Some talented <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up to take the lead, {{but they could not}} change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E
5|$|American {{football}} as a {{whole is}} the most popular sport in the United States. The most popular forms of the game are professional and college football, with the other major levels being high school and youth football. , nearly 1.1million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play the sport in the United States annually, almost all of them <b>men,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> few exceptions. The National Football League, the most popular American football league, has the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world; its championship game, the Super Bowl, ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world, and the league has an annual revenue of around US$10billion.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the census}} of 2010, Jerome was home to 444 people {{comprising}} 253 households, 93 of which were families {{made up of a}} householder and one or more people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. The other 160 were non-family. The residents had a racial makeup that was nearly 94percent white, and the remainder was listed in the census as black or African American, Native American, Asian, other, or combinations thereof. About 6percent of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population, nearly evenly split along gender lines, consisted of 226 women with a median age of 54 and 218 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> median age of 55.

5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between them. As she continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 73 BC, Spartacus and Crixus were {{in command}} of {{a large group of}} armed <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> proven ability to {{withstand}} Roman armies.

Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves' motives and goals exists, and historians writing about the war propose contradictory theories.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare almost {{certainly}} wrote {{the role of}} Hamlet for Richard Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's <b>Men,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range. Judging {{by the number of}} reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it. Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.|$|E

5|$|The {{incidence}} of AML increases with age; {{the median age}} at diagnosis is 63 years. AML accounts for about 90% of all acute leukemias in adults, but is rare in children.

5|$|Upnor Castle is an Elizabethan {{artillery}} fort {{located on}} {{the west bank of the}} River Medway in Kent. It is in the village of Upnor, opposite and a short distance downriver from the Chatham Dockyard, at one time a key naval facility. The fort was intended to protect both the dockyard and ships of the Royal Navy anchored in the Medway. It was constructed between 1559–67 on the orders of Elizabeth I, during a period of tension with Spain and other European powers. The castle consists of a two-storeyed main building protected by a curtain wall and towers, with a triangular gun platform projecting into the river. It was garrisoned by about 80 <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> peak armament of around 20 cannon of various calibres.|$|E

5|$|With the British {{colonization}} of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies {{that would become}} the United States of America were established. All had local governments with elections open to most free <b>men,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen {{and a sense of}} self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were carried}} out between 1852 and 1856 {{at a cost of}} over £6,725. The keep was adapted to support 32-pounder (14.5kg) guns, the seaward-facing bastions and curtain walls were {{reinforced}} with brick casemates and new gun positions, and the moat was deepened to protect against any surprise attack. Two batteries were built to the west and east of the castle, protected by shingle and earth and linked to the old castle by covered passageways called caponiers; a defensible barrack block was built beside the western battery, to provide further protection against any attack from the land. The result was that Hurst was re-established as a powerful fortification, equipped with fourteen 32-pounder guns, fifteen 8-inch (203mm) shell guns and two 32-pounder carronades; in wartime, these required a team of 440 <b>men,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> peacetime garrison of 105 soldiers. Fort Albert was built across the water on the Isle of Wight to provide supporting fire. The old inn was first reused as the garrison canteen and then demolished.|$|E

5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{covered the}} deaths of the <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> photo essay, including photographs by Cornell Capa and some taken by the five men before their deaths. The ensuing worldwide publicity gave several missionary organizations significant more visibility, especially in the United States and Latin America. Most notable among these was the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), the organization for which both Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint worked. Because of the martyrdom of her brother, Saint considered herself spiritually bonded to the Huaorani, believing that what she saw as his sacrifice for the Huaorani was symbolic of Christ's death for the salvation of humanity. In 1957, Saint and her Huaorani companion Dayuma toured across the United States and appeared on the television show This Is Your Life. The two also appeared in a Billy Graham crusade in New York City, contributing to Saint's increasing popularity among evangelical Christians and generating significant monetary donations for SIL.|$|E
5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of <b>men</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E
