40|$|Inaugural {{memorial}} lecture organised by the Department for Inclusion and Access to Learning, Faculty of Education, University of Malta. Delivered at San Anton Palace in {{the presence}} of Her Excellency Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, President of <b>Malta,</b> <b>Attard,</b> Malta, 12 th May 2017. In this memorial lecture - given as tribute to Frederick Ofosu, a Ghanaian migrant in Malta who tragically committed suicide on 18 th January 2017 – I draw on critical race theory to highlight subaltern voices in the discourse, and in everyday life, particularly related to immigrant experiences, the failure of multiculturalism and the resultant psychological trauma of migration. I then recast the positive impact of an inclusive society, and importantly emphasise the role of civic education in fostering a sense of community for all people who live in a multicultural country such as Malta. peer-reviewe...|$|E

50|$|The Three Villages of <b>Malta</b> are <b>Attard,</b> Balzan, and Lija, {{which are}} located {{approximately}} at {{the centre of}} the Mediterranean island of Malta. The Three Villages are known as such because of their close proximity to one another. In some cases one side of the street is part of one village while {{the opposite side of the}} same street is part of another village. The three villages are also very similar in size, layout and age. During the Order of St. John the three villages were sought after for country residences and hunting lodges, of which many built there large palaces as a symbol of nobility and to some extent even superiority over the rest of Maltese society. From 1993 to 2014 the population in Attard and Lija has increased while that of Balzan has decreased and grew in age.|$|R
50|$|Palazzo Nasciaro {{was built}} on a {{strategic}} place, a hill, overlooking the three villages of <b>Malta</b> being <b>Attard,</b> Balzan and Lija.

The building's street is named Main Street (Triq il-Kbira) but back then was named Strada Reale before Lord Gerald Strickland started to Anglicanise Maltese street names. The street including Palazzo Nasciaro already existed in the 1720s. In modern-day the street still leads directly to the main piazza but it is no longer the main street leading directly to Valletta as there was several building developments. It is found next to the house of the Naxxar parish priest. Naxxar is a village on a hill, {{while at the same time}} the palace is elevated from the street. It is built on two floor with a large underlying shelter. It originally looked over the three villages.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the degree of social withdrawal and breadth of attention in 24 chronic non-paranoid schizophrenics was investigated by relating clinical ratings of withdrawal to performance on a card sorting task. The results obtained by Venables (1963) confirming this relationship could not be replicated for the whole group. The experimental design differed in some aspects from the Venables design. Results were suggestive of a qualitative difference between hallucinated and non-hallucinated schizophrenics. In the hallucinated group, more withdrawn patients showed a narrower span of attention than less withdrawn patients; this relationship could not {{be seen in the}} non-hallucinated group. The case study reported was carried out at Mount Carmel Hospital, <b>Attard,</b> <b>Malta.</b> peer-reviewe...|$|R
