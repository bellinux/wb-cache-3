5|$|In {{the ensuing}} story, Nagisa is {{introduced}} {{to other students}} {{from each of the}} three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the <b>media</b> <b>type,</b> the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|E

25|$|Although DirectShow {{is capable}} of {{dynamically}} building a graph to render a given <b>media</b> <b>type,</b> in certain instances {{it is difficult for}} developers to rely on this functionality and they need to resort to manually building filter graphs if the resulting filter graph is variable.

40|$|The {{positive}} effects of using different listening texts (i. e. audio, video) in listening enhancement {{as a part of}} FLL are already well known. As multimedia enables us to combine and present these <b>media</b> <b>types,</b> - which are the main listening elements-, more effectively on the same computer platform, they can be presented to language-learners in one multimedia listening application (MLA) in different forms as different listening <b>media</b> <b>types</b> (i. e. audio-only, audio + visuals, audio + animation, video-only, video + visuals). This study investigated forty five autonomous intermediate and upper intermediate NNSs learners' (AILLs) perceptions of the use and priority of different listening mediatypes in one MLA that aimed to enhance the listening skills of the participants. The results revealed that the learners are in favour of the presence of different listening <b>media</b> <b>types</b> in one MLA. They believe that the presence of different listening <b>media</b> <b>types</b> in one MLA improves their listening skills and helps prepare for the real-world. Similarly, learners prefer some listening <b>media</b> <b>types</b> more than others in one MLA. In the same way, not only do learners think that some listening <b>media</b> <b>types</b> improve their listening more than others, but learners also believe that they prepare better for the real-world...|$|R

2500|$|Additionally, Bolter and Grusin also {{discuss a}} {{psychological}} dimension of “the desire for immediacy and the fascination with hypermediacy” (p.62) that considers how individuals are subjugated through their engagement with media forms. For instance, “when we watch a film or a television broadcast, we understand ourselves as the changing {{point of view}} of the camera” (p.62). Bolter and Grusin stipulate that the <b>media</b> <b>type</b> predisposes the form of subjectivisation that takes places and that all mediated participations offer, “a different mediation of the subject, and our experience is the remediation of these differences” (p.62). A subject’s existence is understood as “the ability to occupy points of view … [...] can enter into immediate relationships with the various media or media forms that surround her” (p.63). Considerations of the ways the ‘self’ is involved in processes of mediation and remediation enable an examination of the effect of the desire for immediacy within media. Bolter and Grusin assert that, “instead of trying to be in the presence of the objects of representation, the subject now defines immediacy as being in the presence of media” (p.62).|$|E

Network Location Awareness uniquely identifies each network and exposes the network's attributes and connectivity type. Windows Vista graphically presents how different devices are connected over a network in the Network Map view, using the LLTD protocol. In addition, the Network Map uses LLTD to determine connectivity information and <b>media</b> <b>type</b> (wired or wireless). Any device can implement LLTD to appear on the Network Map with an icon representing the device, allowing users one-click access to the device's {{user interface}}. When LLTD is invoked, it provides metadata about the device that contains static or state information, such as the MAC address, IPv4/IPv6 address, signal strength etc.|$|E

At the same time, lots of work has been investigated in conceptual modelling for web-based in-formation systems which is at most loosely coupled with XML. One such research direction {{has led to the}} theory of <b>media</b> <b>types,</b> which has proven itself to be useful for the design and development of large and maintainable web-based information systems. The research reported in this article investigates how XML and the theory of <b>media</b> <b>types</b> could be brought together, i. e. how XML could be used to support <b>media</b> <b>types.</b> It turns out that some of the striking features of <b>media</b> <b>types</b> are not yet well supported by XML. Therefore, severals extensions to XML such as subelements, update operations, schema updates, views, media elements and adaptivity will be suggested in this article in order to close this gap. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent trends {{show that}} more and more digital cameras, video cameras and DVD {{recorders}} are sold and the number of emails and other messages sent increases each year. For example it is estimated that there will be nearly 300 million digital image capture devices in use worldwide through 2004, capturing about 29 billion digital pictures [12]. Users not only produce huge amounts of content, but this content is also spread over many different <b>media</b> <b>types</b> and document formats. Storing all contents implicates a great extent of documents in large, heterogeneous data repositories. Performing effective retrieval in heterogeneous repositories requires new approaches: documents in different formats containing different <b>media</b> <b>types</b> have to be transformed to a common denominator, and relations between contents of different <b>media</b> <b>types</b> must be established. This allows direct comparison of contents of different <b>media</b> <b>types.</b> In this paper we present a prototype called Magick that implements such an approach to cross-media retrieval...|$|R
