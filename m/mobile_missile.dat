25|$|In 329 BC, Alexander, {{while in}} Sogdiana, created a 1,000 strong unit of horse archers that was {{recruited}} from various Iranian peoples. They were very effective at scouting and in screening {{the rest of}} the army from the enemy. Firing their bows whilst mounted, they offered highly <b>mobile</b> <b>missile</b> fire on the battlefield. At the Battle of Hydaspes, the massed fire of the horse archers was effective at disordering the Indian cavalry and helped to neutralise the Indian chariots.|$|E

25|$|The Peacekeeper Rail Garrison is a <b>mobile</b> <b>missile</b> {{system that}} was {{developed}} by the United States Air Force during the 1980s as part of a plan to place fifty MGM-118A Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles on the rail network of the United States. The railcars were intended, in case of increased threat of nuclear war, to be deployed onto the nation's rail network to avoid being destroyed by a first strike counterforce attack by the Soviet Union. However the plan was cancelled as part of defense cutbacks following the end of the Cold War, and the Peacekeeper missiles were installed in silo launchers as LGM-118s instead.|$|E

The same figure was re-released in 1983 with a [...] "swivel-arm battle grip", which made it easier for figures to hold their rifles and accessories.|$|E

The B-2 was also seen as a counter to Soviet deployment of <b>mobile</b> <b>missiles,</b> which only a manned bomber could find and attack.|$|R
