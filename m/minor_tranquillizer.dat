40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of pericyazine in severe behavioural disorders was evaluated in 15 profoundly and severely retarded children. Pericyazine provided {{significant improvement in}} such parameters as co-operation, temper, purposeless activities, hyperactivity, communication and mood. It proved to be statistically superior to the <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> in improving co-operation and helpfulness, temper, mood, the understanding of commands and table manners, and in reducing self-abusiveness and abusiveness to staff. The safety of this agent was confirmed and photosensitivity was {{not found to be}} associated with its use...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the number and}} type of substances taken in deliberate self-poisoning with fatal (n= 127) and non-fatal (n= 521) outcome. The aims were (i) to describe substances typically involved in self-poisoning in England and Wales, (ii) to examine the role of drug 'cocktails' and (iii) to examine whether toxic substances are over-represented in cases with fatal outcome. Over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics, <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> and antidepressants accounted for about 70 % of substances taken, irrespective of outcome. Compared with survivors, cases who died had taken a higher mean number of substances. Among self-poisonings with a single substance, antidepressants and paracetamol-opiate combinations were over-represented in fatal-outcome cases. This report emphasizes the role of OTC analgesics and antidepressants in overdose-related mortality in England and Wales...|$|R
40|$|Information about {{psychotropic drug}} {{prescribing}} in one general practice was compared with overall information about such prescribing in Australia. Over the period 1978 – 81 {{there was a}} significant {{reduction in the number of}} prescriptions issued for psychotropic drugs. Prescriptions for hypnotics, sedatives and <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> were more common than those for antidepressants or major tranquillizers. The indications for prescribing were distributed equally among three groups of conditions: psychological disorders, sleep problems and physical diseases. Patients for whom psychotropic drugs were prescribed had a greater overall morbidity and used medical care services more than other patients. Only 9 % of patients in 1981 were issued with a prescription for one of the four most commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs. A relatively small proportion of patients, most of them elderly women, received the largest proportion of the prescriptions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an analysis}} of women's perceptions of medical technology and the elements which shape them, and then draws out the implications for medicine and the medicalization thesis. In {{the first part of}} the paper we outline the macro-theoretical debates about medicalization and the role of medical technology in this process, and the consequences for those who use health care. The implications for women are given particular attention as they have a higher level of contact with health care than men. We then evaluate the arguments of these macro-theorists against evidence from two ethnographic studies, concerning women patients' and their doctors' attitudes to the use of <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> and women's evaluations of medicine and medical practice. This provides a basis for questioning some of the assumptions of the macro-theorists regarding the social relations of medical technology and the medicalization thesis. women medical technology medicalization...|$|R
40|$|Injection of 5 -hydroxytryptophan into mice {{produces}} a characteristic head-twitch. For a given period of observation this response may be assessed quantitatively either by observing {{the proportion of}} mice showing at least one head-twitch (a quantal response) or by {{counting the number of}} head-twitches for each mouse (a graded response). A method, based on the quantal response, of investigating the effect of centrally acting compounds on the head-twitch response is described. Evidence is presented that the head-twitches are due to a central action of 5 -hydroxytryptamine formed by decarboxylation of 5 -hydroxytryptophan. Head-twitches are potentiated by monoamine oxidase inhibitors and by phenytoin. Antagonists tested include an inhibitor of decarboxylase, antagonists of 5 -hydroxytryptamine, some antihistamines, major tranquillizers and analgesic and sympathomimetic drugs. Drugs which neither potentiate nor inhibit the response include barbiturates and <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers.</b> The method may be valuable in the preliminary examination of compounds likely to have a central action...|$|R
40|$|Studies of licit psychotropic drugs, {{utilizing}} {{a variety of}} methodologies, which have been conducted in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe (including the United Kingdon) are examined to describe the prevalence and patterns of use of these drugs. While not directly comparable, consistent patterns emerge both nationally and internationally, with notably higher use recorded among women and the elderly, and where identifiable, <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> generally being the most commonly prescribed psychotropic. The necessity of moving beyond the level of quantitative data analysis {{in order to provide}} insights into the processes influencing current drug-prescribing and consumption practices is pointed out. Recommendations are made for future research directions which would address questions of the potential social and public health consequences of drug consumption, matters of particular interest to policy makers. The various methods employed in psychotropic drug use studies are described and evaluated in terms of their advantages and disadvantages and their appropriateness for future investigations utilizing this public health approach. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} role of psychopharmacology in suicide {{prevention is}} often minimised. This may {{to some extent}} reflect that few medication trials have specifically focussed on prevention of suicidal behaviour [...] indeed this outcome is often not reported in trials. However, there is reasonably strong evidence that lithium may reduce risk of suicide, the postulated mechanism being a specific effect on aggression. Evidence is lacking with regard to any protective effect of other mood stabilizers. Clozapine may reduce suicidal behaviour in patients with schizophrenia, with reduction of affective symptoms being a possible explanation. The role of antidepressants in relation to suicide risk is highly controversial, especially in children and adolescents. It is unclear whether <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> or hypnotics can assist in suicide prevention, although they can reduce the anxiety symptoms that may occur during initial treatment with SSRI antidepressants. It is also uncertain whether psychopharmacology has a role in preventing suicidal behaviour in people with personality disorders. Despite {{the limitations of the}} evidence we contend that suicide risk should be an important factor in deciding when and what to prescribe...|$|R
40|$|Nitrazepam {{it is one}} of {{the most}} {{frequently}} used <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> is psychotherapy. However, its solubility characteristics are very unfavourable. To improve these, different cyclodextrin derivative (CD) and non-ionic macromolecular materials: Polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) and Polyvinylpyrrolidone 25000 (PVP) was used. Products were processed in different combinations and by several methods (mixing, kneading, co-precipitation and spray drying). Authors studied the solubility and the dissolution rate. They conducted thermo analytical studies to demonstrate the fact of formation of complexes. The increases in the dissolution characteristics depend on the nature of the CD derivative, on the nitrazepam concentration in the products and on the processing method. The various CD derivatives increased the solubility of nitrazepam to different extents, RAMEB proving the most effective; N: RAMEB 2 : 1 kneaded products. It`s also applicable the PEG 4000 and the PVP 25 in 3 : 7 molar ratio. On the basis of kinetic parameters and termo dynamics parameters, the solubility results are in correlation with the stability order of binary systems. The thermo analytical investigation demonstrate that the thermic stability of nitrazepam is increased by the formed complex inclusions and the other complexes...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} the charts of 476 patients {{admitted to a}} university teaching hospital to determine whether sedative-hypnotic drugs (SHDs) were being used excessively and to examine the use of SHDs as hypnotics. The frequency of medical and surgical indications for barbiturates and benzodiazepines or other <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> {{as well as the}} use of such drugs were compared among different groups of patients and specialty wards. Of the patients 29 % had a regular order and 40 % had a PRN order; only 77 % of the PRN orders were administered. A total of 215 patients (45 %) received an SHD during their hospital stay, and 160 (34 %) received the drug as a hypnotic. Medical indications accounted for 49 % of the regular orders but only 2 % of the PRN orders; moreover, 89 % of all the PRN orders were for insomnia. On average, patients receiving SHDs as hypnotics were older (p less than 0. 05) and stayed longer in hospital (p less than 0. 01) than those who did not; however, no patient on the geriatric or pediatric ward received an SHD as a hypnotic during the hospital stay. The differences in use between patient groups may have been influenced by orientation of ward staff. Physicians should review their rationale for prescribing hypnotics and avoid routine orders on admission...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess what}} factors {{determine}} the involuntary status of psychiatric patients, we reviewed the case records of 5729 patients consecutively admitted {{to one of}} four inpatient psychiatric facilities, including a mental hospital, in St. John's between October 1975 and October 1978. Of the 5729 patients 5005 (87. 4 %) were voluntary and 724 (12. 6 %) involuntary. Involuntary patients {{were more likely than}} voluntary patients to be male, single and unemployed and to have been referred by police or transferred from another facility to the mental hospital, where most of the involuntary admissions occurred. They had higher rates of previous admissions to a psychiatric facility and of suicidal and violent behaviour, {{were more likely to have}} a diagnosis of schizophrenia or mania and were less likely to be suffering from depression or a neurotic disorder. In correspondence with differences in diagnosis, involuntary patients stayed in hospital more than twice as long as voluntary patients, were less likely to receive electroconvulsive therapy, <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> and antidepressants, and were more likely to receive neuroleptics and lithium carbonate. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only the source of referral and a diagnosis of neurotic disorder had an independent effect on admission status. The findings are discussed in the context of the controversy over the parens patriae approach v. the legal approach to involuntary admission of psychiatric patients...|$|R
40|$|Who {{becomes an}} abstainer? On the abstainer as deviant The {{principal}} {{aim of the}} study is {{to find out what the}} characteristics are of those consumers that later choose to abstain from alcohol. Both cross-sectional and panel data from the level-of-living surveys (LNU) conducted 1968, 1974, 1981 and 1991 are analysed. The results show that those becoming abstainers during the study period have a higher proportion of smokers than the long-term abstainers and, compared to the long-term abstainers and the drinkers, poorer mental health, a higher prevalence of use of <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers</b> and a sparser social network. In the beginning of the study period (1968 - 74) an association was also found between cardiovascular disease and later abstinence. Whereas (physical) health selection has become less obvious over time, the importance of negative psychosocial selection increases, especially for women. The findings underline the importance of distinguishing the new, selected abstainers - former drinkers - from long-term abstainers. This holds true especially in studies of the relationship between alcohol consumption on the one hand and mortality or morbidity on the other hand. It is likely that a majority of the long-term abstainers, of which some are lifetime abstainers, are part of a social context in which abstinence is not seen as deviant, whereas a large proportion of the new abstainers have a problematic life situation. The abstainers’ deviant position says something about the Swedish drinking culture in the last decades of the twentieth century. The fact that the psychosocial selection is so pronounced, and increases over time, reflects a social climate where an ever-decreasing number sees abstinence as an attractive choice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{information}} is available about older deliberate self-harm (DSH) patients and their outcome. METHODS: This study is a prospective investigation and follow-up of 730 consecutive patients (459 females and 271 males) aged 60 years and over who presented to a general hospital following DSH over a 20 -year period, 1978 - 1997. Outcome has been examined in terms of repetition of DSH, and deaths {{by the end of}} 2000 identified through official death registers. RESULTS: DSH involved self-poisoning in 88. 6 % of cases, 49. 3 % of the overdoses including paracetamol (acetaminophen), 24. 0 % <b>minor</b> <b>tranquillizers,</b> and 15. 9 % antidepressants. Nearly three-quarters of episodes involved high suicidal intent. Common problems preceding DSH were physical illness (46. 1 %), social isolation (33. 5 %), relationship problems with family (29. 4 %) or partner (25. 9 %), and bereavement or loss (16. 7 %). Repetition of DSH occurred in 15. 3 % of cases, 8. 2 % in the first year following DSH. By the end of 2000, 432 / 661 (65. 4 %) of traced patients had died. There were 30 suicides and open verdicts, which were 49 times and 33 times more frequent respectively than expected from general population death rates. Prior DSH before initial presentation was the main risk factor for suicide, with some evidence of high suicide intent being another factor. There were also excess deaths due to several types of physical disorder. CONCLUSIONS: DSH in older people is closely related to suicide, both in terms of suicidal intent and risk of eventual suicide, especially when DSH is repeated. The range of problems experienced by older DSH patients requires extensive and multidisciplinary clinical interventions...|$|R
