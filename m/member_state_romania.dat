Unfortunately, the ambitious projects for reducing the regional disparities inspired by the policy in the field of EU have been suppressed quickly by the world economic crisis. This being said, the authors aim at analysing the earnings disparities on regional level in Romania, respectively the impact the economic crisis has had over the dynamic of these disparities.

This notion includes health, productive comfort and also involves the animal protection. The Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, issued by the World Society for Animals Protection, defines welfare as: Degree in which the animal physical, behavioural and psychological requirements are met. As a <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>Romania</b> has implemented EU legislation on the animal welfare and protection, including farm animals. There are seven measures to ensure the minimum standards concerning animal welfare on farms and they include: flooring, lighting, fights prevention, potable water, microclimate, dry bedding, health. Increasing the number of farms in which are applied superior measures in comparison with the mandatory technological measures and improving the welfare of pigs leads to improving the environment and the rural space. The animal welfare superior standards often involve additional costs and therefore the state provides some tools to compensate producers for higher production costs for: increasing by at least 10 % of available space allocated to each animal, ensuring at least 11 hours / day artificial light with a value of 50 lux of lighting, improving pig welfare conditions during transport, correction the nitrites and nitrates level in the water, reducing pollutants by 30 % in comparison with the mandatory minimum level, by maintaining optimal microclimate parameters limits, improving the rest area...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to examine the}} role of rural {{development}} strategies in a new <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> (<b>Romania)</b> and, in particular, to analyse the case of the metropolitan area of the Bucharest-Ilfov region. The analysis concerns the selected strategies for the programming period 2007 - 2013, in the field of rural development. It must be noted that Romania is divided into non-administrative development region regions and that the process of land privatisation is not yet concluded. These factors could have a negative influence on the implementation of the interventions. The analysed region is situated in the Southern part of the country and in {{the central part of the}} Romanian Plan. The total surface is about 1. 8 square kilometres, out of which 12. 5 % occupied by Bucharest town and 87. 5 % by Ilfov County; however, approximately 88 % of the population is concentrated in the urban center and only 12 % in Ilfov County. The case study is characterised on the one hand by a high GDP growth rate, a relatively low unemployment rate and increasing consumer good sales (mainly food and beverages); on the other by some marked disparities in macroeconomic indicators among regions and between rural and urban areas and the enormous lack of infrastructures. The case study thus calls for a local approach in order to identify the strategies required to improve the quality of life of the regional inhabitants (both in rural and urban areas) and to prevent pressure from the urban centre from compromising the rich rural heritage. rural development, regional disparities, enlargement...|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction] In May 2004 the European Union (EU) was {{enlarged}} {{to include}} ten new <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> <b>Romania</b> and Bulgaria followed in 2007. Although so far Slovenia {{is the only}} new <b>member</b> <b>state</b> that has adopted the EU's single currency (the euro) the other eleven of these twelve countries will do so {{at some point in}} the future, after two years of membership in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) mark II, and after their levels of public debt and deficit, inflation and interest rates were brought to the standards of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) set by the Maastricht treaty. However, EMU was associated with substantial economic and political strains within and among EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in the 1990 s. In addition, in recent years leading <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have breached the rules governing fiscal policies in the EU, which are part of the EU's monetary regime. Eventually these rules were made more flexible. Perhaps more worryingly, competitiveness of industries in some of the <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> notably the Mediterranean ones, has been continuously eroding since they joined the euro zone. Unable to devalue their currencies to regain this lost competitiveness these economies face significant potential imbalances. All of this suggests that potential or even actual membership of various EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in the third stage of EMU should not be taken for granted. The purpose of this study is to develop a quantitative indicator of the economic and political adjustment burden of EMU to its member states' societies and to argue that proper domestic political institutions can reduce this burden for the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> by enhancing cabinet duration. 1 This is not a financial cost-benefit balance of EMU. Rather, this study attempts to measure how large are the adjustments that a <b>member</b> <b>state's</b> society would have to bear after joining the union. The adjustment burden indicator is based on optimum currency area theory, adjusted for political variables. Other things being constant a higher adjustment burden makes a currency union less sustainable and must be compensated for by other factors to make it sustainable...|$|R
