Homeownership has been further promoted through tax policy which allows a tax deduction for <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on a primary residence. The Community Reinvestment Act also encourages homeownership for low-income earners. The promotion of homeownership by the government through encouraging mortgage borrowing and lending has given rise to debates regarding government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|E
25|$|Housing was a {{major policy}} area under the first Wilson government. During Wilson's time in office from 1964 to 1970, more new houses were built than {{in the last six}} years of the {{previous}} Conservative government. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the total, while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966. Allowing for demolitions, 1.3million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970, To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income housebuyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> <b>payments).</b> This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes and enabling more people to become owner occupiers. In addition, house owners were exempted from capital gains tax. Together with the Option Mortgage Scheme, this measure stimulated the private housing market.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009 and 2012 Osborne was criticised for his expense claims, in {{particular}} for the claims for <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> on his Cheshire properties.

Moreover, unlike advanced economies before 2007 - 8, deviation from fundamentals has not been persistent in Hong Kong. Going forward, low interest rate and improving growth prospects, as well as a tight supply, particularly in the mass market, means that house price growth will continue to be strong. This is the period in which vulnerability may be accumulating, and tight prudential standards and fiscal measures will be required to tame price inflation.

40|$|I quantitatively {{study the}} optimal capital income {{taxation}} {{in the general}} equilibrium overlapping generations model with uninsurable idiosyncratic income shocks and with housing and financial assets. Following key characteristics of housing are explicitly modeled: (i) housing is held for the dual purpose of consumption and savings, (ii) housing can be either owned or rented, (iii) if owned, housing {{can be used as}} a collateral for mortgage loans, and (iv) there is a preferential tax treatment for owner-occupied housing through tax-exemption of imputed rents and <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> <b>payment</b> deduction. Using calibrated models, I investigate whether and how the optimal capital income tax rate differs between the model with both housing and financial assets and the standard model without housing. I find that the optimal capital income tax changes significantly depending on the housing tax policy. This is mainly because capital income tax affects both portfolio choice between housing and financial assets, and tenure decision. In particular, I find that, when preferential tax treatment for owner-occupied housing like the current U. S. economy is maintained, there is a large welfare gain by lowering the capital income tax rate and thus narrowing the ta...|$|R
5000|$|Hudson {{devoted his}} entire {{scientific}} career {{to the study}} of debt: both domestic (loans, <b>mortgages,</b> <b>interest</b> <b>payments)</b> and external. In his works he consistently advocates the idea that loans and exponentially growing debts that outstrip profits from the economy of the [...] "real" [...] sphere are disastrous for both the government and the people of the borrowing state: they wash money (going to payments to usurers and rentiers) from turnover, not leaving them to buy goods and services, and thus lead to [...] "debt deflation" [...] of the economy. Hudson notes that the existing economic theory (in particular, the Chicago School of economics) is in the service of rentiers and financiers and has developed a special language designed to create the impression that the current status quo has no alternative. In a false theory, the parasitic encumbrances of a real economy, instead of being deducted in accounting, add up as an [...] "addition to GDP" [...] (Gross Domestic Product), and are presented as [...] "productive." [...] Hudson sees consumer protection, state support of infrastructure projects and taxation of parasitic rentier sectors of the economy instead of taxing workers as a continuation of the line of classical economists today.|$|R

2500|$|After Britain's {{exit from}} the ERM, Lamont had two major tasks: to replace the ERM with a new {{framework}} for monetary [...] to replace the ERM and to address the sharp increase in government borrowing caused by the recession and the rapid fall in inflation. In {{a letter to the}} Chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee in October 1992, Lamont set out a new basis for the conduct of monetary policy centred on inflation targeting. He set a target range for inflation excluding <b>mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> rate <b>payments</b> (which can otherwise lead to distortions) of 1 – 4%, falling into {{the lower part of the}} range by the end of the Parliament. In assessing progress toward meeting the inflation target, there was a target for the growth of narrow money (M0) and monitoring ranges for the growth of broad money (M4). Decisions on interest rates would also take account of house and asset price inflation and the exchange rate. Transparency and market credibility would be enhanced by publication of a monthly monetary assessment and the Bank of England was asked to produce a quarterly inflation report. These innovations marked a decisive break with the past and a necessary step toward central bank independence. Inflation targeting was the basis on which the Bank of England was made independent by the Blair government in 1997, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee being made accountable for achieving the government's inflation target.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mortgage</b> <b>interest</b> <b>payments</b> were {{excluded}} from the inflation target because otherwise the Bank's behaviour would be distorted. Any rate rise from the Bank, aimed at bringing inflation lower, would have the side effect of raising interest payments on variable-rate mortgages, causing higher inflation on any broad measure such as RPI. Targeting RPI would thus create a vicious circle of higher rates, something avoided by using RPIX as the target.|$|E
