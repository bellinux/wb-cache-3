After returning to Pennsylvania with drummer Jeremy Hummel, Burnley formed Plan 9, which also included bassist Jason Davoli.

The group were scheduled to appear on Saturday night, 16 August, but the festival ran late {{and they did not}} take to the stage until 5am on Sunday; they played most of Tommy.

500|$|Twenty-two {{years prior}} to this film's production, actor Mark Lindsay Chapman, while professionally using the name Mark Lindsay, had been almost cast as John Lennon in the biopic [...] (1985). Yoko Ono had been deeply {{involved}} in the production and had herself been initially impressed with his audition and approved his casting prior to discovering his full name was Mark Lindsay Chapman. She then nixed his casting on the grounds it was [...] "bad karma", {{and a great deal of}} press attention was given to his having almost gotten the role. The director of Chapter 27, Jarrett Schaefer, auditioned many Lennon impersonators, but was especially impressed with Mark Lindsay Chapman's tape because he conveyed the [...] "tough town" [...] street-smart quality of Lennon that the impersonators failed to convey, as they always played Lennon as larger-than-life. Schaefer described Lennon as having a [...] "chip on his shoulder and always cracking these cynical one-liners", and felt that actor Chapman was best at conveying this quality. Schaefer had some difficulty negotiating the casting with the film's producers because of Chapman's name. After Chapman was cast, he asked Chapman how he should be billed to which Chapman replied [...] "Mark fucking Lindsay Chapman. That's <b>my</b> <b>fucking</b> name." [...] Schaefer remarks that this was so reflective of how Lennon talked, it just reinforced his sense that Chapman was right for the part.|$|E
