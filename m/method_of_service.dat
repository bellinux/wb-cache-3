It was difficult to give herself to the Hostels. In that Mr. Brumley, actuated by a mixture of more or less admirable motives, did his best to assist her.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> {{provision}} in Slovak towns.   It addresses decision-making concerning selected services provision, based on a transaction cost economic model. The article looks at five types <b>of</b> <b>services</b> from that point of view. These are core services, i. e., services that are provided in most Slovak towns, thereby allowing outcomes of decision-making to be compared, and services which can be outsourced according to transaction cost theory. Findings partially confirm the hypothesis: Slovak towns do outsource, though “insourcing” moderately prevails. However, a comparison of several research studies in the area indicates a trend towards higher outsourcing <b>of</b> such local <b>services</b> provision.   The findings show that public bodies do not always select the most suitable <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provision, {{as suggested by the}} transaction costs theory (the Brown-Potoski model). This indicates that it is not only economic models that influence decision-making concerning the organization <b>of</b> <b>services</b> provision in the Slovak towns. ...|$|R

When fear had gripped the population, she organized the conferences in all the neighborhoods of Paris to care for the cholera victims, becoming well known in the city for her work, especially in the 12th arrondissement.

50|$|Service {{design is}} the {{activity}} of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service {{in order to improve}} its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers. Service design may function as a way to inform changes to an existing service or create a new service entirely. The purpose of service design methodologies is to establish best practices for designing services according to both the needs of customers and the competencies and capabilities of service providers. If a successful <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> design is employed, the service will be user-friendly and relevant to the customers, while being sustainable and competitive for the service provider. For this purpose, service design uses methods and tools derived from different disciplines, ranging from ethnography (Segelström et al., Ylirisku and Buur, 2007, Buur, Binder et al. 2000; Buur and Soendergaard 2000) to information and management science (Morelli, 2006) to interaction design (Holmlid, 2007, Parker and Heapy, 2006). Service design concepts and ideas are typically portrayed visually, using different representation techniques according to the culture, skill and level of understanding of the stakeholders involved in the service processes (Krucken and Meroni, 2006, Morelli and Tollestrup, 2007).|$|E
50|$|A 2016 {{lawsuit filed}} against al-Ajmi by the California-based NGO that assists Middle East {{refugees}} called St. Francis of Assisi, drew headlines {{for being the}} first U.S. lawsuit served to a person via Twitter. The allegations were made for funding Christian genocide in Iraq and Syria, the Assyrians. The lawsuit defending Assyrians that have been systematically killed and displaced was against al-Ajmi, as well as Kuveyt-Turk Participation Bank, Inc. and Kuwait Finance House, two banks {{that he used to}} funnel money to the al-Nusra Front, for financing a group that killed, injured, and maimed civilians, even within the U.S. defending Assyrians that were systematically killed and displaced. The NGO was seeking compensation at a San Francisco Federal Court against al-Ajmi, who was difficult to reach, on behalf {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Assyrian Christians owning property in Syria and Iraq. Judge Laurel Beeler discovered al-Ajmi’s active Twitter account, and allowed Twitter to be used to satisfy the service of process requirement to move along the case, considering it was the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> most likely to reach him. St. Francis of Assisi was given permission to tweet a summons and a complaint to al-Ajmi, in which the documents were stored on MediaFire, a file-sharing service. This request came after a month of attempts to serve him, and a Kuwaiti government rejection of the process. During this period, al-Ajmi had been tweeting hourly, sharing videos with his bank account details asking followers for money. Shortly after his service, al-Ajmi retweeted a message regarding the notice to rally his followers against the non-profit, and his twitter account was deactivated shortly after. This case was the first to approve serving a foreign defendant via social media.|$|E

50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on stillage. Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This dispense method is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} technical barrier to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas stillages are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a parbuckle) to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the pipe connector onto the tap, so that the cellarman could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|E
