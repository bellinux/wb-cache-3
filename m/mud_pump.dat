The wearing parts for mud pumps include pump casing, bearings, impeller, piston, liner, etc. Advanced antiwear measures should be adopted to increase the service life of the wearing parts, which can reduce the investment cost of the project, and improve production efficiency.

50|$|Mud pumps come in {{a variety}} of sizes and {{configurations}} but for the typical petroleum drilling rig, the triplex (three piston/plunger) <b>mud</b> <b>pump</b> is the pump of choice. Duplex mud pumps (two piston/plungers) have generally been replaced by the triplex pump, but are still common in developing countries. Two later developments are the hex pump with six vertical pistons/plungers, and various quintuplex's with five horizontal piston/plungers. The advantages that these new pumps have over convention triplex pumps is a lower mud noise which assists with better Measurement while drilling (MWD) and Logging while drilling (LWD) decoding.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the driving factors for the interlayer creation and <b>mud</b> <b>pumping</b> phenomena in railway sub-structure. Physical model tests on a ballast layer overlying a sub-soil layer {{were carried out}} under different conditions in terms of water content, loading and sub-soil dry unit mass. The physical model was equipped with various sensors and devices allowing water content, pore water pressure, axial displacement to be monitored. Visual observations were also made using a digital camera. It was observed that the ballast behavior depends on the sub-soil state. Both the interlayer creation and <b>mud</b> <b>pumping</b> {{are related to the}} migration of fine particles, and the water content of the sub-soil is the most important factor for this migration. Under the unsaturated conditions, the ballast/sub-soil interface did not change. On the contrary, under the near saturated conditions, significant migration of fine particles occurred. In case of low dry unit mass, the dissipation of high pore water pressure in the sub-soil gave rise to <b>mud</b> <b>pumping.</b> In case of higher dry unit mass, the excess pore water pressure was lower due to the smaller volume change of sub-soil. As a result, the effect of water pressure dissipation was limited and the upward migration of fine particles was only due to the penetration of ballast into the sub-soil, thereby, forming the interlayer...|$|R

Weatherford’s Auto-Fill float collar, which includes two flapper-type check valves, was installed at Macondo 180 ft above the reamer shoe at casing bottom. The valves are held open by a 2-inch diameter auto-fill tube {{to allow the}} casing to fill with mud while it is lowered down the well. BP’s casing installation procedure stated: [...] "slowly increase (<b>mud)</b> <b>pump</b> rates greater than 8 bpm to convert the float equipment (~ 500 - 700 psi) per Weatherford recommendation". As the flow rate drag force during circulation and cementing was only around 30% of that required, the auto-fill tube was almost certainly not ejected and the flapper valves never closed. Some evidence suggests that personnel on the Deepwater Horizon mistakenly believed that the high pressure needed to establish mud circulation had converted the float collar.|$|E

In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a mud logging company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm). [...] "The gas recorder usually is scaled in terms of arbitrary gas units, which are defined differently by the various gas-detector manufactures. In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected."

40|$|Ballasted {{rail tracks}} are most {{commonly}} used in rail track structure and are {{designed to provide a}} stable, safe and economic foundation. Main components of ballasted rail track structure can be grouped as track superstructure and track substructure. The cyclic loading by the train will be distributed from the superstructure to substructure. Sri Lanka currently uses the Indian standard gradation for almost all the tracks. Most of the ballast material used in Sri Lanka is obtained from biotite gneiss rock which is available in abundance. However, ballast is constantly subjected to degradation throughout its service due mainly to ballast breakage and migration of fine particles from the subgrade into the ballast layer, which is known as <b>mud</b> <b>pumping.</b> In this study, the effect of ballast particle breakage and <b>mud</b> <b>pumping</b> on the shear strength characteristics of ballast is investigated. Parallel gradation technique was used to model the sample as it is difficult to handle large size ballast in the conventional direct shear box.

Scaled down sample was sieved and test sample was prepared according to Indian standard gradations using the parallel gradation technique and the direct shear test was carried out under three normal pressures of 15 kPa, 30 kPa and 90 kPa.
