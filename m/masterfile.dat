Budget shares for non-senior households are examined over time using non-parametric regression, parametric `difference-in-difference' techniques, and quantile regression methods. The evidence suggests that while program effects are muted when there are high deductibles, a non-senior prescription drug subsidy is more redistributive than an equal-cost proportional income transfer, {{in part because of}} differential private health insurance coverage by income. This is in contrast to previous evidence on Canadian senior prescription drug subsidies. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} the American Medical Association's Physician <b>Masterfiles</b> (1963 - 80) and the GINI index of {{resource}} concentration as a global measure {{of changes in the}} pattern of locational choice, the expectation of a more uniform distribution of physicians is shown to have been met for all major categories of physicians except General Practitioners. Increases in the supply of Surgical Specialists, Medical Specialists, and Other Specialists were accompanied by increases in the index of dispersion across counties of 23. 1 per cent, 17. 9 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively. By 1980, Surgical Specialists were the most uniformly distributed of all physician groups. The distributional implications of location theory for physicians are addressed and evidence relevant to evaluating this economic theory of locational choice is presented...|$|R
40|$|Geographers have long-recognised the {{importance}} of boundary specification and the problems of using arbitrarily defined areas for the collection and dissemination of socioeconomic data. The focus has tended {{to be on the}} modifiable areal unit problem and on custom zone design with the problems created by temporal inconsistencies in zonal boundaries having less consideration. This is surprising as alongside occasional major structural reorganisations the UK experiences frequent administrative boundary changes causing difficulties in producing comparable statistics over time. Unless a consistent geographical approach with time-series data is taken it cannot be known whether changes are real or an artefact of boundary changes. The late 1990 s has seen initiatives from ONS to promote harmonisation of geographical information and the Update UK Area <b>Masterfiles</b> (UUKAM) project which allows the conversion of data between 1991 census and various late- 1990 s geographies. For studies which predate the ONS initiative and exceed the data conversions possible through the UUKAM project, a method must be devised to establish a data time-series on a consistent geographical basis otherwise the data quality will be compromised and analyses cannot objectively be compared over time. After illustrating the nature of the boundary change problems to be overcome, this paper describes and appraises methods by which data can be adjusted to an appropriate geography. The paper concludes with a list of advised checks for researchers carrying out similar work. ...|$|R

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: The overall {{supply of}} general {{surgeons}} per 100 000 population has {{declined in the}} past 2 decades, and small and isolated rural areas of the United States continue to have relatively fewer general surgeons per 100 000 population than urban areas. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal analysis. SETTING: Clinically active general surgeons in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: The American Medical Association's Physician <b>Masterfiles</b> from 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2005 were used to identify all clinically active general surgeons in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of general surgeons per 100 000 population and the age, sex, and locale of these surgeons. RESULTS: General surgeon to population ratios declined steadily across the study period, from 7. 68 per 100 000 in 1981 to 5. 69 per 100 000 in 2005. The overall urban ratio dropped from 8. 04 to 5. 85 (- 27. 24 %) across the study period, and the overall rural ratio dropped from 6. 36 to 5. 02 (- 21. 07 %). The average age of rural surgeons increased compared with their urban counterparts, and women were disproportionately concentrated in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: The overall number of general surgeons per 100 000 population has declined by 25. 91 % during the past 25 years. The decline has been most marked in urban areas. However, more remote rural areas continue to have significantly fewer general surgeons per 100 000 population. These findings have implications for training, recruiting, and retaining general surgeons...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether {{variation in the}} representation of minority physi-cians across geographical areas in California affects the location decisions of minority physicians. Data Sources. We analyzed data on 9, 806 residents and 53, 606 patient-care physi-cians from the 1997 – 2003 American Medical Association <b>Masterfiles</b> for California along with data from the California Department of Finance, RAND, and other sources. Study Design. We estimated departure models using linear probability models and destination models using conditional logit. Each model controlled for physician and county characteristics. Parameters of interest include the interactions of physician race/ ethnicity with area-level minority physician representation for the corresponding race/ ethnicity. Principal Findings. Departure models show that black and Hispanic physicians {{are more likely to}} remain in an area as the level of representation of physicians from their respective groups worsens. The destination models show that black, Asian, and His-panic physicians tend to move to areas where the level of representation {{is similar to that of}} their previous location. Conclusions. Black and Hispanic physicians are influenced by the level of represen-tation of physicians from their respective groups in their location decisions and tend to locate where needed. Key Words.
