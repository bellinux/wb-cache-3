On 2 March, Foreign Minister Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament that the Singapore legal team has studied Malaysia’s application carefully, including the three documents relied on by Malaysia to support its application, and strongly believes that the documents relied on by Malaysia do not satisfy the criteria under Article 61. Singapore has until 14 June to submit to the ICJ its comprehensive and compelling rebuttal to Malaysia’s application.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{after being}} dismissed, the future Hall of Fame manager defended {{himself in a}} press conference, arguing that the club was badly organised, for having players that never played {{together}} before. Anderson added that to improve the team, the owners should strengthen the relationship between players and coaches, not <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference.</b> Also, {{they gave me a}} group of local veteran players almost gone from baseball, and rookies with little professional experience, he explained earnestly.|$|E
25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game.

25|$|Inspired by {{elements}} from outside its ranks, the royal guard {{had sought to}} impose its views upon the body politic by 'pronouncing' against the régime. Challenged by this call of arms, Godoy and his royal patrons found that they had few defenders. The officer corps {{as a whole was}} disgruntled by the failure of reforms to <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> in its situation, and his orders to resist the French were already widely disobeyed; much of the upper nobility and the Church was hostile; reformist circles had long since lost all faith in Godoy's political credentials; and the common people were in a state of open revolt. As for Fernando, he was seen as a saviour, the reception that he received when he rode into Madrid on 24 March.|$|E
25|$|While Feldmarshalleutnant Klenau {{was being}} ousted from Essling, Archduke Charles {{received}} much-awaited {{news about the}} arrival of his brother on the battlefield. However, the news were disappointing: Archduke John of Austria and his 13,000 men, Charles's only hope for rescuing his collapsing left flank, would {{only be able to}} arrive towards 17:00, much too late to <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference.</b> By now, Charles was acutely aware that his troops would not hold out much longer. His three corps on the Wagram plateau (I, II and IV) had been in action for some ten hours. On his right, Kollowrat's III Korps, Klenau's VI Korps and the Reserve Korps were being pushed back. Crucially, he had no battle reserves with which to either support his battered line or to launch a counterattack of his own. Continuing to fight in these conditions would have spelled the end of the Kaiserlich-königliche Hauptarmee and, in Charles's view, the end of the Habsburg Empire. His only realistic option was to begin an orderly retreat, which he ordered by mid morning, directing each corps along its line of retreat.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E

25|$|Unjust {{enrichment}} is seen {{to underlie}} a final group of constructive trust cases, although this remains controversial. In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd Goulding J held that a bank that mistakenly paid money to another bank had a claim to the money back under a constructive trust. Mistake would typically {{be seen as an}} unjust enrichment claim today, and there is no debate over whether the money could be claimed back in principle. It was, however, questioned whether the claim for the money back should be proprietary in nature, and so whether a constructive trust should arise, particularly if this would bind third parties (for instance, if the recipient bank had gone insolvent). In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that a constructive trust could only arise if the recipient's conscience would have been affected {{at the time of the}} receipt or before any third party's rights had intervened. In this way, it is controversial whether unjust enrichment underlies any constructive trusts at all, although it remains unclear why someone's conscience being affected should <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E

500|$|At 13:32, {{during the}} zig-zag, it became {{apparent}} that Queen Mary would come too close to the cruiser and the liner's officer of the watch interrupted the turn to avoid Curacoa. Upon hearing this command, Illingworth told his officer to: [...] "Carry on with the zig-zag. These chaps are used to escorting; they will keep out of your way and won't interfere with you." [...] At 14:04, Queen Mary started the starboard turn from a position slightly behind the cruiser and at a distance of two cables (about [...] ). Boutwood perceived the danger, but the distance was too close for either of the hard turns ordered for each ship to <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> at the speeds that they were travelling. Queen Mary struck Curacoa amidships at full speed, cutting the cruiser in half. The aft end sank almost immediately, {{but the rest of the}} ship stayed on the surface a few minutes longer.|$|E

500|$|When {{the former}} Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to Maunsell’s N15 {{specification}} in February 1925, the Southern Railway {{decided to give}} names to all express passenger locomotives. Because of the railway's association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, John Elliot suggested {{that members of the}} N15class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: [...] "Tell Sir Herbert [...] I have no objection, but I warn you, it won't <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference</b> to the working of the engines". Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell's permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No.E453, was given the first name and christened King Arthur. The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as [...] "Urie Arthurs"; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the [...] "Eastleigh" [...] and [...] "Scotch Arthurs".|$|E
500|$|Blunt's third studio album titled Some Kind of Trouble, was {{released}} on 8 November 2010. The album debuted at number four in the UK with over 100,000 copies sold in the first week.

The third single from the album, [...] "If Time Is All I Have" [...] was released in the UK on 4 April 2011.

500|$|Within the Star Trek canon, {{there have}} been no officially {{recognized}} LGBT characters in the television spin-offs. [...] The International Review of Science Fiction ran a feature entitled [...] "Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice: Why There Are no G/L/B/T Characters in Star Trek: Deep Space 9" [...] However, gender identity has occasionally been treated as an [...] "issue" [...] within the new Star Trek series, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the 1995 [...] episode [...] "Rejoined", which was the first episode of the show to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the Star Trek franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil [...] "mirror universe" [...] ("The Emperor's New Cloak") or body possession ("Warlord" [...] and others), and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters. In a 2000 Fandom interview, Star Trek screenwriter Ronald D. Moore suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to <b>make</b> <b>any</b> <b>difference.</b> In recent years, a few of the Star Trek novels and comics, which are officially licensed but not considered canon, have featured serious direct same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character as gay.|$|E
