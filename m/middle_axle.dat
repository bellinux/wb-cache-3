Some investigators implicated the HT-C truck in derailments in Amtrak's SDP40F locomotive fleet and Conrail chose to order SD40-2s and their first order of SD50s with the earlier Flexicoil C truck. The controversy surrounding the HT-C truck was eventually disproved, and Conrail's second order of SD50s as well as their SD60 variants were all HT-C equipped.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1930s, {{the wagon}} {{couplings}} were switched from hook-and-chain to autocoupler type. When these conversions took place, the six-wheeled vans lost their <b>middle</b> <b>axles</b> and TFM wagons were converted back to standard T design.|$|R
5000|$|Six-by-six {{conversions}} of {{four-wheel drive}} trucks are made, {{such as the}} Australian Army's Perentie Land Rover Defender and [...] "Landcruiser Sherman"), as are 6×4 versions (with only front and rear or front and <b>middle</b> <b>axles</b> driven).|$|R
5000|$|Tyres: Type - Pneumatic tyres, front <b>axle</b> duplex tyres, <b>middle</b> {{and rear}} <b>axle</b> single tyres. Size, 270-20. Air {{pressure}} - Front <b>axle,</b> 4,8 atm.; <b>Middle</b> and rear <b>axle,</b> 5,8 atm.|$|R
50|$|A {{turntable}} at {{the rear}} of the chassis frame supported a bogey, mounted on bearings so it could swivel and pivot. The bogey was fitted with two axles, a fixed <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> and a steerable rear axle, both of the swinging wishbone type with transverse semi-elliptical leaf spring suspension. The <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> was fitted with pneumatic brakes, while the rear axle was unbraked. A feedback steering system was included in the design, so that any change in direction by the rear bogey (and fixed <b>middle</b> <b>axle)</b> was duplicated by the steerable rear axle, but to twice the extent. The linkage for the feedback system was for used front towing, and was disengaged during rear towing.|$|E
50|$|The 6x6 Puma has {{steerable}} {{wheels on}} {{the first and the}} third axles, while the wheels of the <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> are fixed, which enables a tight turning circle.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving and}} coupled wheels were {{fixed to the}} frame. Whether the <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> had a reduced wheel flange is not known. The drive went to the second axle.|$|E

The two <b>middle</b> <b>axles</b> are rigidly attached to the A-Trailer and support the fifth wheel coupling with which the rear trailer is towed. The A-Trailer wheels electronically counter steer with respect to the tractor unit.|$|R
50|$|Intense trial runs {{were made}} with the prototypes. They had bogies with fixed axles, which led to heavy rail and wheel flange abrasion. Despite some early {{technical}} issues, the SBB-CFF-FFS were convinced {{they were on the}} right path with the development of the Ae 6/6. After introducing side-elastic wheelsets and making the wheel flanges of the <b>middle</b> <b>axles</b> smaller, the series production started in 1954, resulting in the first series locomotives delivered in 1955.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam engine}} itself {{comprised}} a two-cylinder engine with simple steam expansion and Heusinger valve gear. The engine drove the second (<b>middle)</b> coupled <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Meillerwagen was {{equipped}} with pneumatic drum brakes, installed {{on the front and}} middle axles. The <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> brakes could also be applied mechanically with a hand-operated cable, to act as a parking brake.|$|E

5000|$|The Mark V was of four 8-wheeled designs {{built as}} a {{response}} to reports of the German 8-wheeled armoured cars (Schwerer Panzerspähwagen)[...] Power was from two Albion 6-cylinder engines driving only the two <b>middle</b> <b>axles.</b> The prototype had poor performance in desert conditions and was rebuilt with both engines at the rear. Although well-armoured it was heavy at 16 tons and performance still lacked so the project was stopped. A very large vehicle armed with the QF 6 pounder gun and armoured side skirts; only the one prototype was built.|$|R

50|$|From 1867 a {{total of}} 152 {{examples}} of this engine were built in Bavaria for the Ostbahn. The five series differed in their dimensions from one another. They had larger grate and heating areas than their predecessor engines, the Class C II. In addition the drive was to the <b>middle</b> <b>axle,</b> so that shorter connecting rods could be used. The locomotives had an Allan valve gear and injectors.|$|E
5000|$|CRR Brasileiro: {{a version}} {{developed}} in 1968 by the Brazilian Army Engineering Institute (IME). The <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> was removed {{and a new}} engine ( [...] Mercedes-Benz OM-321) installed to create the VBB-1 of which one prototype was completed, the vehicle being found to be inferior. The Vbb-1 was, in turn, {{the basis for the}} CRR which reverted to a 6×6 configuration and eight vehicles were produced for evaluation. The EE-9 Cascavel was developed from the CRR.|$|E
5000|$|The forged {{front axle}} beam is I-profile shape {{and there is}} a drop in the <b>middle.</b> The <b>axles</b> are {{produced}} by Kirkstall. Suspension is carried out by leaf springs 1200 mm long and 2.5 in wide. Both front and rear axle are equipped with telescopic shock absorbers. The standard wheel size is 7.50 - 16" [...] and 5.50 - 20" [...] was available as an option.|$|R
5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the <b>middle</b> coupled <b>axle</b> for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|R
50|$|Divided drive {{could also}} be used on simple {{expansion}} locomotives with coupled driving wheels.The NER Class X (LNER Class T1) 4-8-0T shunting engines designed by Wilson Worsdell for the North Eastern Railway had three cylinders with divided drive. Similarly Richard Maunsell of the Southern Railway (Great Britain) designed the SR Lord Nelson class with divided drive between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the <b>middle</b> coupled <b>axle</b> for the outside cylinders 'to give better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow'.|$|R
5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first compound locomotives in Saxony. Its two-cylinder, compound engine was located behind the carrying axle and drove the final axle. The locomotives had an inside Allan valve gear. The steam dome was in {{the centre of the}} boiler over the <b>middle</b> <b>axle.</b> The running gear had an improved Nowotny carrying axle, nevertheless it did not have good riding qualities. The Schleifer brakes were later converted to Westinghouse brakes.|$|E
50|$|These wagons {{were heavily}} {{modified}} around 1932-1934, with the <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> removed {{and the other}} two modified with larger axle boxes, creating the ubiquitous 15 ft underframe (in fact 15 ft between axles, not over ends). This change occurred with the introduction of automatic couplers; as part of the same project, when buffers were removed the wagons were upgraded to a maximum load of 16 LT instead of the previous 15 LT. Of the 430 wagons of the type, about 390 were upgraded as such; the remainder had bogies added, and were re classed UB.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was based}} on the EMD FP9, lengthened to accommodate additional equipment, including a larger train heating steam boiler. Due to the additional weight of the added equipment and the weight restriction on the Park Avenue 97th Street Portal Viaduct, the locomotive was equipped with a three-axle rear truck, giving it an uncommon B-A1A wheel arrangement. The <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> of the rear truck was not powered. The Flexicoil type of truck was used at both front and rear, due to this type of truck having more room for fitting the third rail shoes and associated equipment.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Disassembled gear hub. The {{sun gear}} is {{attached}} to the <b>middle</b> of the <b>axle</b> which lies across the top center, the four planet gears are arranged in a square {{to the right of the}} center, and the ring gear is to the upper right of them.|$|R
500|$|The {{fast-moving}} {{and unpredictable}} Bulleid steam reverser {{was replaced with}} a screw-link version, whilst the mechanical lubricators were moved to the footplates along the boiler sides. [...] Sanding was also added to the leading driving axle, whilst rearward application was incorporated to the <b>middle</b> driving <b>axle.</b> [...] The first 'modified' locomotive {{to be released from}} Eastleigh was 35018 British India Line in 1956. The final example, 35028 Clan Line, was completed in 1960. The success of the modification programme for the Merchant Navy class was also to influence the design of the future modification of 60 'Light Pacifics'.|$|R
50|$|The Super Olympian chassis {{was based}} on the Volvo Olympian. The front {{radiator}} was moved behind the front axle on the 12 metre version, or in front of the second axle for the 10.6 metre version (due to its shorter wheelbase). In order to lower the chassis further, the assisted steering function of the <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> was cancelled. The suspension system has also been largely modified so that it is electronically controlled instead of moving passively. One special feature is that after turning, the suspension unit does not return to normal, remaining tilted to either the left or right, until the bus becomes stationary.|$|E
50|$|Initial designs {{had some}} common themes; the A and B type {{carriages}} were for first- and second-class travellers, with C reserved for third-class, though later re-allocated for coffin vehicles. D class {{was used for}} guards' vans, E for mail vans and F for horse-boxes. The first vehicles were placed on four-wheeled underframes, later designs having a <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> added. Some cars were built by the Victorian Railways while others imported. Between 1860 and 1880 the Victorian Railways absorbed a number of private railway operators, and their rollingstock was absorbed into the fleet, renumbered to suit. This explains why records show some cars built in 1855, even though the Victorian Railways only started operating in 1858.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{customer}} options, the SD50 {{was available}} with {{a multitude of}} traction-motor gearing ratio and wheel size options, {{the most common of}} which being the 70:17 ratio with 40 in wheels, this allowed for a top speed of 70 mph. Other gearing options for the SD50 with 40 in wheels include 69:18 for 76 mph, 67:19 for 82 mph and 66:20 for 88 mph. 42 in wheels were also available. Customers of the SD50 also had the option of either HT-C trucks (identified with a hydraulic shock {{on the side of the}} <b>middle</b> <b>axle</b> of each truck) or the earlier Flexicoil trucks, which only Conrail opted for. Some investigators implicated the HT-C truck in derailments in Amtrak's SDP40F locomotive fleet and Conrail chose to order SD40-2s and their first order of SD50s with the earlier Flexicoil C truck. The controversy surrounding the HT-C truck was eventually disproved, and Conrail's second order of SD50s as well as their SD60 variants were all HT-C equipped.|$|E
50|$|The metallic-blue, tank-like SPV {{serves as}} Spectrum's primary {{armoured}} interceptor ground vehicle. It is 25 ft long, weighs , {{and has a}} maximum speed of 200 mph. It is fitted with five pairs of wheels (the three over the front, <b>middle</b> and rear <b>axles</b> constituting the main drive), with additional traction for mountainous environments provided by rear-mounted, hydraulically-lowered caterpillar tracks.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to weight}} {{restrictions}} {{it proved to}} be impossible for all three cylinders to drive the <b>middle</b> coupled <b>axle,</b> the design used divided drive with the middle cylinder driving the leading axle and was positioned forward above the front bogie.The LNER also ordered some modifications, including an increase in cylinder size from 17 in to 17+1/2 in, and a lengthening of the firebox by 5 in with longer frames, and lighter springs. The design continued to prove problematic and the LNER eventually cancelled a penalty clause in the original contract. The first locomotive, No. 2802 Walsingham was delivered 30 November 1928, thirteen weeks late.|$|R
50|$|The inside {{high-pressure}} cylinder had a slide valve below, {{while the two}} outside low-pressure cylinders had balanced slide valves above. The cylinder ratio was 1 to 2.45. The outside cranks were placed 90 degrees apart, while the middle inside crank was placed at 135 degrees {{from each of the}} outer two. All three cylinders actuated the <b>middle</b> coupled <b>axle</b> and their valves were actuated from this axle by an eccentric for the inside cylinder and two return cranks for the outer cylinders. The exhaust from the {{high-pressure cylinder}} passed directly into a large steam chest common to both low-pressure cylinders, which eliminated the need for a receiver pipe.|$|R
