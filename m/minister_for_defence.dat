5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|Along with Athol Townley, <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> from 1958 to 1963, Scherger {{urged the}} {{establishment}} of an Australian Joint Services Staff College (JSSC), to further inter-service knowledge and cooperation against an indigenous background instead of sending officers to overseas colleges; the JSSC opened in 1970 as the Joint Services Wing of a proposed Australian Services Staff College, later being subsumed by the Australian Defence College.|$|E

He {{was a member of}} the Victorian Parliament for Castlemaine from 1895 to 1899, where he was a champion of women's suffrage and federation. He lost his seat in 1899 but became a member of the first Australian Federal Parliament in 1901. He was <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> from 1904 to 1905, during which he implemented long-lasting reforms, including the creation of the Military Board.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> following the 1998 federal election, John Moore {{decided that the}} only way to solve the various problems of the Collins class was for an independent report to be prepared on them. He appointed Malcolm McIntosh, chief executive of the CSIRO and an unofficial advisor to Moore, and John Prescott, a former BHP director, to investigate the project, uncover the problems with the submarines, and suggest ways of solving them.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to South Australia to assist Charles Kingston in his government, but ultimately crossed {{the floor to}} bring down Kingston over his plans to lessen {{the power of the}} Legislative Council. With the advent of Australian Federation, Playford became a Senator for South Australia. He was leader of the Senate and the 7th <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence.</b> After one term as a Senator, Playford was defeated. He ran again in 1910, was unsuccessful, and retired to Kent Town, where he died in 1915 at the age of 78.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} Vice-President of the Executive Council (1909–10) and <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> (1913–14) in two {{short-lived}} Liberal governments before his appointment {{as the first}} Minister for Repatriation in 1917. He organised the new department and co-ordinated Australia's repatriation effort, and was briefly acting Prime Minister in 1919, when he settled a seamen's strike. Millen resigned from the ministry in February 1923 and died later that year, his illness attributed to his heavy workload in the post-war years.|$|E

The school upgrading works were co-funded by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan, comprising a revamp of canteen, air-conditioned library, as well as the construction of the park square and a new 300 seat auditorium.|$|E
5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased {{the cost to the}} service of operating the Chinooks, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take on an even more complex helicopter type.|$|E
5|$|Many {{men in the}} SWPA {{believed}} that the demobilisation process was too slow. On 10December 1945 4,500 men at Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies staged a protest march demanding that shipping {{be made available to}} return them to Australia. Soldiers at Bougainville also complained about having to remain on the island after the war had ended, and Prime Minister Ben Chifley's plane was sabotaged in an apparent protest during his visit on 27December 1945. <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> Frank Forde was largely blamed for the slowness with which military personnel were being demobilised. As a result, he lost his seat at the 1946 election, though the Labor Party itself comfortably retained office.|$|E

25|$|Under the constitution, the President is the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces. In reality, the Chancellor has the decision-making authority, exercised through the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> National <b>Defence.</b> The Chancellor also chairs the National Defence Council, which has as its members a vice-chairman, the <b>minister</b> <b>for</b> national <b>defence,</b> an appointee of this minister, the Chief of the General Staff, and a parliamentary representative. The <b>minister</b> <b>for</b> national <b>defence,</b> acting in co-operation with the <b>minister</b> <b>for</b> interior, coordinates {{the work of the}} four major committees under the National Defence Council: the Military Defence Committee; the Civil Defence Committee; the Economic Defence Committee; and the Psychological Defence Committee. The Chief of the General Staff acts as the senior military adviser to the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> National <b>Defence,</b> assists the minister in the exercise of his authority, and, {{as the head of the}} general staff, is responsible for planning. However, the army commander exercises direct operational control of the Bundesheer in both peacetime and wartime.|$|R

5|$|On 1 July 1960, Pollard succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Ragnar Garrett as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), and {{was raised}} to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated on 2June 1961. Although favoured by Garrett, Pollard's {{succession}} {{had not been a}} foregone conclusion. The Minister for the Army, John Cramer, attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in cabinet on the advice of the <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence,</b> Athol Townley, who feared the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 2011, the Australian <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> Materiel, Jason Clare, {{announced}} that the Sea Kings would be withdrawn from service in December 2011; having flown in excess of 60,000 hours in operations in Australia and overseas in that time. The farewell flight was conducted on 15 December 2011, three Sea Kings flew over Sydney Harbour and across to Canberra, passing Lake Burley Griffin and the Australian War Memorial before landing at Nowra. On 16 December 2011, the Chief of Navy presided over the ceremonial decommissioning of 817 Squadron RAN at NAS Nowra. Five of the withdrawn helicopters have been made available for sale.

5|$|The <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence,</b> Senator George Pearce, {{appointed}} McCay to {{the newly}} created post of Inspector General of the AIF on 29 November 1915, with the local rank of major general. McCay was involved in recruiting campaigns, and inspected AIF units and reported on their training and equipment. He proposed a new training regime, with a national syllabus that {{increased the number of}} hours per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks. This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool. As a result, new liquor laws were introduced, including six o'clock closing.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{positions}} available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began to be lifted in 1990. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% of positions in the ADF were available to females as well as males. In September 2011 <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years. This decision {{was supported by the}} CDF and the chiefs of the services. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013. This remaining restriction was removed during 2016.|$|E
5|$|As a backbencher, McCay opposed {{amendments}} to the Defence Act 1903 proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party that called for peacetime conscription. He accepted its necessity in wartime, but only for service within Australia. McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful, and he feared that peacetime conscription would result in militarism. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1903 election, the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote. In 1904, McCay moved {{an amendment to the}} Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions. The debate became unexpectedly heated and resulted in the fall of Chris Watson's Labor government. The Free Trade Party's George Reid became Prime Minister and offered McCay the post of <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence.</b>|$|E
5|$|In May 1962 the Australian Government {{decided to}} deploy a {{squadron}} of CAC Sabre fighters to Thailand to bolster that country's defences. This action was undertaken as part of Australia's Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) commitment to defend Thailand against attack from its Communist neighbours, which was thought likely to occur. The United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand also deployed forces to Thailand {{in response to this}} perceived threat, though Malaysia and several other SEATO members chose not to be involved. On 28May, <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Defence</b> Athol Townley announced that Australia's contribution would be an RAAF squadron equipped with Sabre fighters. The eight aircraft, along with their pilots and ground crew, were drawn from No.77 Squadron, which formed part of Australia's Commonwealth Strategic Reserve forces at RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. In order to preserve Malaysia's neutrality, the Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore. This force was designated No.79 Squadron while at Tengah Air Base in Singapore on 29May.|$|E
