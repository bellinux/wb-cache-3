5|$|A {{dominant}} <b>male</b> black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the <b>male</b> concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the <b>male</b> at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the <b>male.</b> The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the <b>male</b> loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E
5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} a <b>male</b> may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The <b>male</b> then walks with erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If the female does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first. If the <b>male</b> stands his ground and she does not ran away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate. If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a <b>male</b> may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female. P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E
5|$|An {{observational}} study by Logan {{demonstrates that the}} female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the <b>male</b> and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new <b>male</b> in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new <b>male</b> shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated <b>male</b> and the new <b>male</b> will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Males</b> {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged <b>males</b> in {{contrast}} to the more developed flanged <b>males.</b> The transformation from unflanged to flanged can occur very quickly. Unflanged and flanged <b>males</b> have two different mating strategies. Flanged <b>males</b> attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger <b>males.</b> Unflanged <b>males</b> wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with flanged <b>males</b> and seek their company for protection against unflanged <b>males.</b> Resident <b>males</b> may form consortships with females that can last days, weeks or months after copulation.|$|R
50|$|African American <b>males</b> had 50-100% higher intakes {{than white}} <b>males</b> and African American <b>males</b> {{consumed}} {{three times as}} many HCAs as white <b>males</b> (Table 4).|$|R
50|$|Human sex ratios, {{either at}} birth {{or in the}} {{population}} as a whole, are reported in any of four ways: the ratio of <b>males</b> to females, the ratio of females to <b>males,</b> the proportion of <b>males,</b> or the proportion of females. If there are 108,000 <b>males</b> and 100,000 females the ratio of <b>males</b> to females is 1.080 and the proportion of <b>males</b> is 51.9%. Scientific literature often uses the proportion of <b>males.</b> This article uses the ratio of <b>males</b> to females, unless specified otherwise.|$|R
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the <b>male</b> moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may fluff its red back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another <b>male</b> to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the <b>male</b> presents to a female in {{what appears to be}} a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another <b>male</b> in an act of apparent aggression.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. <b>Male</b> forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the <b>male</b> approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the <b>male</b> and female begin to circle each other. If the <b>male</b> has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the <b>male</b> while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the <b>male</b> to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|Feminism in {{psychology}} {{emerged as a}} critique of the dominant <b>male</b> outlook on psychological research where only <b>male</b> perspectives were studied with all <b>male</b> subjects. As women earned doctorates {{in psychology}}, females and their issues were introduced as legitimate topics of study. Feminist psychology emphasizes social context, lived experience, and qualitative analysis. Projects such as Psychology's Feminist Voices have emerged to catalogue the influence of feminist psychologists on the discipline.|$|E
50|$|Of those {{remaining}} in the hospital {{at the close of}} the year, 124 <b>males,</b> 85 females, were epileptic; 37 <b>males,</b> 6 females, were paralytic; 26 <b>males,</b> 5 females, were homicidal; 34 <b>males,</b> 224 females, were suicidal; 57 <b>males,</b> 6 females, were insane convicts; 43 <b>males,</b> 8 females, were of the criminal insane; 215 <b>males,</b> 260 females, were uncleanly in person and habits, and about 109 patients were estimated to be probably curable cases.|$|R
40|$|Ergatomorph {{wingless}} <b>males</b> {{are known}} in {{several species of}} the genus Technomyrmex Mayr, 1872. The first record of these <b>males</b> is given in T. vitiensis Mann, 1921. In comparison with winged <b>males,</b> wingless <b>males</b> have a smaller thorax and genitalia, but both forms have ocelli and the same size of eyes. Wingless <b>males</b> seem to form a substantial portion (more than 10 %) of all adults in examined colony fragments. Wingless <b>males</b> are present in colonies during the whole year, whereas the presence of winged <b>males</b> seems to be limited by season. Wingless <b>males</b> {{do not participate in}} the taking care of the brood and active foraging outside the nest. <b>Males</b> of both types possess metapleural gland openings. Beside <b>males</b> with normal straight scapes, strange hockey stick-like scapes have been observed in several <b>males.</b> The cause of this divergence is unclear...|$|R
40|$|A ‘sneaking tactic’ is an {{alternative}} reproductive strategy that usually results in sperm competition among <b>males</b> with different tactics. Relatively large testes are a sneaker-specific trait that has generally been thought to have evolved due to sperm competition between sneaker <b>males</b> and bourgeois (guarding) <b>males.</b> However, here we show that competition among sneaker <b>males</b> can also affect testis enlargement in the dusky frillgoby (Bathygobius fuscus) sneaker <b>males.</b> The competitive advantage of focal sneaker <b>males</b> was experimentally manipulated by placing them in tanks with either relatively smaller or larger <b>males.</b> Testis enlargement was conspicuous in focal <b>males</b> that were cohoused with larger <b>males.</b> Smaller sneaker <b>males</b> may invest more in testicular growth because they are at a competitive disadvantage in physical contests for sneaking opportunities among sneaker <b>males</b> and consequently may be confined to making relatively late intrusions during spawning into nests that have {{a higher risk of}} sperm competition. Another possible reason for the relative size-dependent energy investment in testes may be increased investment by large sneaker <b>males</b> in aggressive interactions for sneaking opportunities. This is the first evidence that testis size variation among sneaker <b>males</b> is affected by the competition among sneaker <b>males...</b>|$|R
5|$|Finally the <b>male</b> mounts and copulates {{with the}} female. Afterward, the <b>male</b> {{generally}} dismounts {{and the two}} pair usually run away from each other. However, the <b>male</b> sometimes chases the female and tries to copulate again.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two <b>male</b> flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two <b>male</b> and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of <b>male</b> flowers replace the triads of <b>male</b> and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. <b>Male</b> flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than <b>male</b> flowers.|$|E

25|$|P. dominula wasps have a lek-based mating system. <b>Males</b> compete {{intensely}} for dominant {{positions on}} the lek, while females are scrupulous when choosing their mates. <b>Males</b> form aggregations on the uppermost portions of structures such as fences, walls, roof peaks, and trees. <b>Males</b> often fight with other <b>males</b> in mid-air or on the structure. <b>Males</b> that lose will fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe <b>males</b> before making choices on mates. Females use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on <b>males,</b> which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. <b>Males</b> with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other <b>males</b> and preferred by females compared to <b>males</b> that have larger, more irregularly shaped spots.|$|R
500|$|The faeders are {{sometimes}} mounted by independent or satellite <b>males,</b> but are as often [...] "on top" [...] in homosexual mountings as the ruffed <b>males,</b> suggesting that their true identity is {{known by the}} other <b>males.</b> Females never mount <b>males.</b> Females often seem to prefer mating with faeders to copulation with normal <b>males,</b> and normal <b>males</b> also copulate with faeders (and vice versa) relatively more often than with females. The homosexual copulations may attract females to the lek, like the presence of satellite <b>males.</b>|$|R
50|$|C. eurytheme <b>males</b> rely on {{visual cues}} {{to locate and}} {{identify}} females. Instead of using chemical stimuli to find mates, <b>males</b> are attracted to the ultraviolet absorbing color of female hindwings. Studies have shown that <b>males</b> respond to paper dummies of the appropriate color and even attempt to mate with them. On the contrary, the ultraviolet reflection found on <b>males</b> strongly inhibits approaches from other <b>males.</b> This suggests that ultraviolet reflectance is also used by <b>males</b> as an inhibitory signal directed towards other <b>males.</b>|$|R
5|$|Groups of {{wildebeest}} {{females and}} young {{live in the}} small areas established by the <b>male.</b> When groups of wildebeest join together, the female to <b>male</b> ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher <b>male</b> mortality having been attributed to hunting.|$|E

40|$|Diploid <b>males</b> in hymenopterans are {{generally}} either inviable or sterile, thus imposing a severe genetic load on populations. In species with the widespread single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD), sex {{depends on the}} genotype at one single locus with multiple alleles. Haploid (hemizygous) individuals are always <b>males.</b> Diploid individuals develop into females when heterozygous and into <b>males</b> when homozygous at the sex determining locus. Our comparison of the mating and reproductive success of haploid and diploid <b>males</b> revealed that diploid <b>males</b> of the braconid parasitoid Cotesia glomerata sire viable and fertile diploid daughters. Females mated to diploid <b>males,</b> however, produced fewer daughters than females mated to haploid <b>males.</b> Nevertheless, females did not discriminate against diploid <b>males</b> as mating partners. Diploid <b>males</b> initiated courtship display sooner than haploid <b>males</b> and were larger in body size. Although in most species so far examined diploid <b>males</b> were recognized as genetic dead ends, we present a second example of a species with sl-CSD and commonly occurring functionally reproductive diploid <b>males.</b> Our study suggests that functionally reproductive diploid <b>males</b> {{might not be as}} rare as hitherto assumed.

40|$|The fruitless mutants fru(3) and fru(4) were {{assessed}} for sex-specific reproductive-behavioral phenotypes and {{compared to the}} previously reported fru mutants. Among the several behavioral anomalies exhibited by <b>males</b> expressing these relatively new mutations, some are unique. fru(3) and fru(4) <b>males</b> are less stimulated to court females than fru(1) and fru(2). No courtship pulse song is generated by either fru(3) or fru(4) <b>males,</b> even though they perform brief wing extensions. fru(3) and fru(4) <b>males</b> display significantly less chaining behavior than do fru(1) <b>males.</b> The hierarchy of courtship responses by fru <b>males</b> directed toward females vs. <b>males,</b> when presented with both sexes simultaneously, is that fru(1) <b>males</b> perform vigorous and indiscriminant courtship directed at either sex; fru(4) <b>males</b> are similarly indiscriminant, but courtship levels were lower than fru(1); fru(2) <b>males</b> prefer females; fru(3) <b>males</b> show a courtship bias toward <b>males.</b> fru(3) and fru(4) <b>males</b> essentially lack the Muscle of Lawrence (MOL).

5|$|<b>Male</b> {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage <b>male</b> nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the <b>male</b> stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, the desire for social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival <b>male,</b> and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In <b>male</b> grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Male</b> {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. <b>Male</b> walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. <b>Male</b> California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult <b>male</b> South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the number of}} <b>males</b> per cage as a possible risk factor for murine ankylosing enthesopathy (ANKENT) [...] a spontaneous joint disease with parallels to human seronegative spondylarthropathies [...] since ANKENT shows incomplete penetrance of genetic susceptibility factors among individuals living in a stable environment. METHODS: Frequency of ANKENT was compared among <b>males</b> housed with females, with other <b>males,</b> or alone. RESULTS: In three independent cohorts, a trend was observed that <b>males</b> housed with females rarely develop the disease, in contrast to <b>males</b> housed with other <b>males</b> (P < 0. 25, P < 0. 05, and P < 0. 01). Furthermore, no <b>males</b> caged alone developed ANKENT, whereas disease did occur in <b>males</b> grouped together (P < 0. 01). When healthy <b>males</b> (retired breeders) were recaged either alone or with other <b>males,</b> ANKENT developed among the grouped <b>males</b> only (P < 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS: Caging <b>males</b> together is a relative risk factor for ANKENT. Grouped caging may perturb the immune system through endocrine pathways or modify microbiological load through behaviour (for example, infection due to biting) ...|$|R
50|$|By {{manipulating}} demographics so juveniles {{only had}} access to females, juvenile <b>males</b> developed atypical social behavior; they did not engage in the typical social singing bouts with other <b>males,</b> did not pair bond with females, and were promiscuous. This demonstrates that there is great flexibility {{in the behavior of}} cowbirds, and that the social environment is extremely important in structuring their behavior. Adult <b>males</b> housed with juvenile <b>males</b> were shown to have greater reproductive success compared to adult <b>males</b> housed with other adult <b>males.</b> Being housed with juvenile <b>males</b> honed the reproductive skills of the adult <b>males</b> by providing them with a more complex social environment.|$|R
5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both <b>male</b> and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a <b>male</b> M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally <b>male,</b> but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the <b>male</b> side. <b>Male</b> genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E
5|$|Males take up nesting sites {{before the}} {{breeding}} season, by frequently calling beside them. Unmated males start nest construction and call particularly frequently to attract females. When a female approaches a <b>male</b> during this period, the <b>male</b> displays by {{moving up and}} down while drooping and shivering his wings, pushing up his head, raising and spreading his tail, and showing his bib. Males may try to mate with females while calling or displaying. In response, a female will adopt a threatening posture and attack a <b>male</b> before flying away, pursued by the <b>male.</b> The <b>male</b> displays in front of her, attracting other males, which also pursue and display to the female. This group display usually does not immediately result in copulations. Other males usually do not copulate with the female. Copulation is typically initiated by the female giving a soft dee-dee-dee call to the <b>male.</b> Birds of a pair copulate frequently until the female is laying eggs, and the <b>male</b> mounts the female repeatedly each time a pair mates.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the <b>male</b> curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the <b>male</b> inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a <b>male</b> grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the <b>male</b> may bite the female to show his interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{conflict}} is exhibited when <b>males</b> target other <b>males</b> through sperm competition. For example, Iberian rock lizard (Lacerta monticola) <b>males</b> create hard mating plugs. These mating plugs are placed within the female cloaca instantly after copulation, which was hypothesized {{to function as}} a [...] "chastity belt." [...] However, the study found no evidence to support the hypothesis, as <b>males</b> were able to displace the mating plugs of other <b>males.</b> There is no direct conflict between <b>males</b> and females, but <b>males</b> may evolve manipulative traits to counter the removal of their mating plugs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Testosterone enhances {{aggression}} and can facilitate dominance in mammals, but most {{studies have been}} conducted on laboratory strains of mice and in simple environments. Unlike previous studies, laboratory and field tests were conducted using wild house mice, Mus musculus, to determine whether <b>males</b> with high, but physiological, testosterone levels (High T) would achieve dominance compared with <b>males</b> with low testosterone levels (Low T). All <b>males</b> were castrated and androgen was replaced with a single injection of testosterone enanthate, a long-acting androgen. At 8 days post-treatment the mean testosterone concentration in High T <b>males</b> was 5. 1 ng/ml, whereas the level in Low T <b>males</b> was 1. 3 ng/ml. Contests in the laboratory revealed that High T <b>males</b> achieved dominance over Low T <b>males</b> in the presence of females. In the field, equal numbers of High and Low T <b>males,</b> and a corresponding number of females, were released on three highway islands at densities equivalent to the highest density reported on similar sites. Periodic retrapping produced a capture history for <b>males</b> in each group and differences in survival were analysed using the program SURVIV. High T <b>males</b> had a higher probability of survival than Low T <b>males</b> on one island, but on the other two islands the higher capture rates of High T <b>males</b> were not statistically greater than those for Low T <b>males.</b> Of those that survived to the first trapping episode, the High T <b>males</b> had greater subsequent longevity than Low T <b>males.</b> On all three islands High T <b>males</b> wer...|$|R
40|$|Using laser optics to {{illuminate}} high–resolution video–recordings, we revealed behavioural mechanisms through which <b>males</b> of the calanoid copepod species Temora longicornis locate females. <b>Males</b> of T. longicornis swam at significantly faster speeds than females along more sinuous routes, possibly reflecting adaptations to increase encounter with females. Upon approaching within 2 mm (i. e. two bodylengths) {{of a female}} 2 ̆ 7 s swimming path, <b>males</b> accelerated to significantly higher pursuit speeds. Pursuit trajectories closely traced the trajectories of females, suggesting that <b>males</b> were following detectable trails created by swimming females. <b>Males</b> of T. longicornis detected female trails up to at least 10 s old, and tracked trails for distances exceeding 13 cm, or 130 bodylengths. Females were positioned up to 34. 2 mm away from <b>males</b> (i. e. reactive distance) when <b>males</b> initiated ‘mate–tracking’. It was always the <b>males</b> of T. longicornis that detected and pursued mates. In rare events, <b>males</b> pursued other <b>males.</b> Behavioural flexibility was exhibited by <b>males</b> during mate–tracking. <b>Males</b> generally tracked the trails of ‘cruising’ (i. e. fast–swimming) females with high accuracy, while the pursuits of ‘hovering’ (i. e. slow–swimming) females often included ‘casting’ behaviour, in which <b>males</b> performed sharp turns in zigzag patterns within localized volumes. This casting by <b>males</b> suggested that hovering females create more dispersed trails than cruising females. Casting behaviour also was initiated by <b>males</b> near locations where females had hopped, suggesting that rapid movements by females disrupt the continuity of their trails. <b>Males</b> were inefficient at choosing initial tracking directions, following trails in the incorrect direction in 27 of the 67 (40...|$|R
