500|$|One {{prominent}} {{proponent of}} a discontinuity-based theory of human language origins is linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky. Chomsky proposes that [...] "some random mutation took place, <b>maybe</b> <b>after</b> some strange cosmic ray shower, and it reorganized the brain, implanting a language organ {{in an otherwise}} primate brain." [...] Though cautioning against taking this story too literally, Chomsky insists that [...] "it may be closer to reality than many other fairy tales that are told about evolutionary processes, including language." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, one common {{criticism}} made is that Esperanto {{has failed to}} live up to the hopes of its creator, who dreamed of it becoming a universal second language. In this regard it has to be noted that Zamenhof was well aware that it may take much time, maybe even many centuries, to get this hope into reality. In his speech at the World Esperanto Congress in Cambridge in 1907 he said, [...] "we hope that earlier or later, <b>maybe</b> <b>after</b> many centuries, on a neutral language foundation, understanding one each other, the nations will build... a big family circle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of {{how their}} characters, Lucas and Peyton, were written out of the series focused mainly on a lack of {{explanation}} about where they went, and the exit not having been morbid enough for a star-crossed couple. Although the episode featuring their departure is initially grim, the episode's tone is drastically different by the end. Fans expected a tragic ending because of Lucas and Peyton's star-crossed history and the show's penchant for shocker-finales. MTV composed tragic scenarios for how to write the couple out of the series, but concluded by saying, [...] "OK, OK. <b>Maybe</b> <b>after</b> all they've been through in six seasons, these two deserved their happy ending. Lucas and Peyton, you were this generation's Joey and Pacey: the overly dramatic couple we couldn't help but root for. We'll miss you."

30|$|The {{etiology}} of CT is somehow controversial. Some authors {{described it as}} a degenerative process of the tendon fibers with secondary dystrophic calcifications. Uhthoff et al. (2006) provided morphological evidence of a formative and a resorptive phase of calcific deposits. During the formative phase, and through a multifocal, active, cell-mediated process, the tendinous tissue is transformed into fibrocartilage, which is later, calcified. This phase is usually painless. Once formed, the calcific deposits enter a resting stage and they <b>maybe</b> symptomatic. <b>After</b> a variable period of time, macrophages and multinuclear giant cells start an inflammatory reaction and the deposits enter the resorptive phase. This stage may be very painful.|$|R

5000|$|The above {{method has}} been called by Stanle Barnes (Anglers' Knots in Gut & Nylon, 2nd ed., 1951) [...] "outcoil", and is contrasted with the method that resembles the {{finished}} knot from the start, [...] "incoil".
