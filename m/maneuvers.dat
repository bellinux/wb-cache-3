5|$|Bayern {{participated in}} the {{ceremonial}} transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control {{in the summer of}} 1890. She was present during the fleet <b>maneuvers</b> in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. She remained with the I Division in 1891; the year's <b>maneuvers</b> simulated a two-front war against Russia and either France of Denmark. Bayern {{participated in the}} 1892 fleet <b>maneuvers</b> as well. Three separate simulations were conducted, which included French blockades of the German North Sea coast and a Russian attack on Kiel. Vice Admiral Wilhelm Schröder commanded the fleet <b>maneuvers</b> of 1893, which simulated a protracted campaign against a superior French fleet. Bayern and her three sisters served as the Russian Baltic Fleet during the 1894 <b>maneuvers.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the Armored Force had two {{operational}} armored divisions: the 1st Armored Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games of the Louisiana <b>Maneuvers</b> in August and September 1941, and the Carolina <b>Maneuvers</b> in November 1941. Despite some successes, the <b>maneuvers</b> revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E
5|$|By 1908, Piemonte {{had been}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet, which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats. In August that year, Piemonte participated in the annual summer <b>maneuvers</b> of the Italian fleet. She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing. The <b>maneuvers</b> were modeled on a potential war with Italy's nominal ally Austria-Hungary, {{and the fact that}} the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna. The <b>Maneuvers</b> concluded with a fleet review on 18 October. Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East.|$|E
50|$|ZPMs are {{developed}} by solving a specific nonlinear two-point-boundary-value optimal control {{problem for a}} fixed <b>maneuver</b> end time. Whereas an eigenaxis <b>maneuver</b> maintains a constant rotation axis and <b>maneuver</b> rate, a ZPM uses a time varying rotation axis and <b>maneuver</b> rate. An eigenaxis <b>maneuver</b> attitude trajectory tries to overcome disturbances to maintain a constant <b>maneuver</b> rate, which results in saturating the momentum storage devices. By using a variable <b>maneuver</b> rate, ZPMs avoid saturation of momentum storage actuators.|$|R

25|$|The sight {{distance}} {{needed for a}} given situation is the distance travelled during the two phases of a driving maneuver: perception-reaction time (PRT), and <b>maneuver</b> time (MT). Perception-reaction time is {{the time it takes}} for a road user to realize that a reaction is needed to a road condition, decided what <b>maneuver</b> is appropriate, and start the <b>maneuver.</b> <b>Maneuver</b> time is {{the time it takes to}} complete the <b>maneuver.</b> The distance driven during perception-reaction time and <b>maneuver</b> time is the {{sight distance}} needed.|$|R
5|$|Emanuele Filiberto {{spent the}} first several years of her career in the 1st Squadron, along with her sister Ammiraglio di Saint Bon and the two s. In October 1906, the ship participated in major fleet <b>maneuvers</b> {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brochetti in the Ionian Sea. The {{exercises}} lasted from 10 to 26 October. The <b>maneuvers</b> culminated in a mock attack by the Italian fleet on the harbor defenses at Taranto. During the 1908 <b>maneuvers,</b> Emanuele Filiberto served in the friendly squadron, while Ammiraglio de Saint Bon was assigned to the hostile squadron.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited is a 1995 {{aerobatic}} flight simulator video game developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and to perform aerobatic <b>maneuvers.</b> They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to <b>maneuvers</b> such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and Immelmann turn.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall <b>maneuvers</b> with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet <b>maneuvers,</b> the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further <b>maneuvers</b> in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn <b>maneuvers</b> in August and September. KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.|$|E
5000|$|Rubin <b>maneuver</b> is a secondary, {{rotational}} <b>maneuver</b> {{to deliver}} the baby in case of shoulder dystocia. The first Rubin <b>maneuver</b> is the rotation of anterior shoulder under pubic symphysis by giving suprapubic pressure. As a result, the bisacromial diameter is rotated from anteroposterior to oblique lie. The obstetrician uses the right hand for performing this <b>maneuver</b> if the foetus is facing mother's right side, and vice versa. During first Rubin <b>maneuver,</b> fundal pressure should not be applied because it may cause uterine rupture or further impaction of the shoulder. If the first Rubin <b>maneuver</b> does not disengage the shoulder, second Rubin <b>maneuver</b> is performed.|$|R
40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are used to}} synthesize the formation-keeping control law for a three-satellite formation in low-earth orbit. The objective is to minimize <b>maneuver</b> cost and position tracking error. Initial reductions are found for a one-satellite case by tuning the state-weighting matrix within the linear-quadratic-Gaussian framework. Further savings come from adjusting the <b>maneuver</b> interval. Scenarios examined include cases with and without process noise. These results are then applied to a three-satellite formation. For both the one-satellite and three-satellite cases, increasing the <b>maneuver</b> interval yields a decrease in <b>maneuver</b> cost {{and an increase in}} position tracking error. A <b>maneuver</b> interval of 8 - 10 minutes provides a good trade-off between <b>maneuver</b> cost and position tracking error. An analysis of the closed-loop poles with respect to varying <b>maneuver</b> intervals explains the effectiveness of the chosen <b>maneuver</b> interval...|$|R

Duchess Sophie, according to their oldest son, Duke Maximilian, accompanied her husband out of fear for his safety.|$|E
5|$|In July and August 1900, the French fleet {{conducted}} <b>maneuvers</b> in the English Channel. At the time, Brennus was {{the flagship}} of the Mediterranean Squadron, under Vice Admiral Fournier. On 10 August off Cape St. Vincent, while {{returning from the}} <b>maneuvers,</b> she collided with the destroyer Framée. The destroyer quickly sank, and only fourteen men from her crew of 50 were rescued. By 1903, Brennus {{was transferred to the}} Reserve Squadron, along with three other battleships and three armored cruisers. There, she flew the flag of Rear Admiral Besson during the annual summer <b>maneuvers</b> in July–August 1903.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the fleet}} {{conducted}} squadron <b>maneuvers</b> in the North Sea, which included coast defense exercises with {{soldiers from the}} X Corps. On 16 August, the fleet assembled in Danzig once again for the annual autumn <b>maneuvers.</b> The exercises started in the Baltic and on 30 August the fleet passed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak and steamed into the North Sea for further <b>maneuvers</b> in the German Bight, which lasted until 7 September. The third phase of the <b>maneuvers</b> {{took place in the}} Kattegat and the Great Belt from 8 to 26 September, when the <b>maneuvers</b> concluded and the fleet went into port for annual maintenance. The year 1900 began with the usual routine of individual and divisional exercises. In the second half of March, the squadrons met in Kiel, followed by torpedo and gunnery practice in April and a voyage to the eastern Baltic. From 7 to 26 May, the fleet went on a major training cruise to the northern North Sea, which included stops in the Shetlands from 12 to 15 May and in Bergen from 18 to 22 May. On 8 July, Weissenburg and the other ships of the I Division were reassigned to the II Division.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{application}} of kalman filter in tracking the <b>maneuver</b> target {{is not available}} as it is used in tracking the target of uniform motion.

50|$|Stopping sight {{distance}} is the distance traveled {{during the two}} phases of stopping a vehicle: perception-reaction time (PRT), and <b>maneuver</b> time (MT). Perception-reaction time is {{the time it takes}} for a road user to realize that a reaction is needed due to a road condition, decided what <b>maneuver</b> is appropriate (in this case, stopping the vehicle), and start the <b>maneuver</b> (taking the foot off the accelerator and depressing the brake pedal). <b>Maneuver</b> time is {{the time it takes to}} complete the <b>maneuver</b> (decelerating and coming to a stop). The distance driven during perception-reaction time and <b>maneuver</b> time is the {{sight distance}} needed.|$|R

5|$|Italia {{took part}} in the annual 1888 fleet <b>maneuvers,</b> along with the ironclads , , , and , a {{protected}} cruiser, four torpedo cruisers, and numerous smaller vessels. The <b>maneuvers</b> consisted of close-order drills and a simulated attack on and defense of La Spezia. Later that year, the ship was present during a naval review held for the German Kaiser Wilhelm II during a visit to Italy. Italia served as the flagship of the 2nd Division of the Active Squadron during the 1893 fleet <b>maneuvers,</b> along with the ironclad , the torpedo cruiser , and four torpedo boats. During the <b>maneuvers,</b> which lasted from 6 August to 5 September, the ships of the Active Squadron simulated a French attack on the Italian fleet.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and Deutschland {{were placed}} in reserve after the 1878 <b>maneuvers</b> were {{cancelled}} and remained there for a decade, {{with the exception of}} the 1883 <b>maneuvers.</b> During the <b>maneuvers,</b> both ships' steam engines proved troublesome, and indeed forced a temporary halt to the training exercises when they simultaneously broke down. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a state visit to Great Britain in August 1889 and a tour of the Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how strategic <b>maneuvering</b> with an {{argument can be}} analyzed systematically. According to Van Eemeren (2010), strategic <b>maneuvering</b> {{takes place in the}} discussion as a whole, in each discussion stage, but also in each individual discussion move, such as providing an argument. This article gives an overview of the steps to be taken in analyzing strategic <b>maneuvering</b> and offers a method for analyzing the <b>maneuvering</b> with an argument. It is argued that <b>maneuvering</b> with arguments can be analyzed more precisely {{with the help of the}} argument scheme. Pragmatic argumentation is used as an example. The <b>maneuvering</b> is described by examining which choices have been made with respect to the three aspects of strategic <b>maneuvering</b> in concretizing the central premise in the scheme, in this case ‘Action X leads to desirable consequence Y’. As an example, the article provides an analysis of <b>maneuvering</b> with pragmatic arguments in the British vaccination brochure Arm against cervical cancer.
