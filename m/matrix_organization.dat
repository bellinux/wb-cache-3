40|$|Abstract — Document {{exchange}} between diverse department within <b>matrix</b> based <b>organization</b> {{has been a}} huge challenge starting the last two decades. Complexity usually arises when an ideal model that deals with the precise exchange of document through different departments is needed. Taking into consideration the case of government architecture frameworks on a common country, exchange of efficient and most precise document is the key for a ideal decision. Document exchange within diverse nodes is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a general reference model to integrate different documents centers systems working under different government departments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to introduce a general reference model to document exchange using meta-data models and software engineering method to build up and keep usable and precise domain ontology in turn to overcome interoperability issues of exchanging documents on a <b>matrix</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R

50|$|When Goggin {{had joined}} Dow Corning, the {{organization}} was structured as <b>matrix</b> <b>organization.</b> As main building blocks were seen the profit center and cost center. Goggin explained, that {{in the concept of}} the multidimensional organization, two extra dimensions were added:As we first thought of it, the <b>matrix</b> <b>organization</b> was to be two-dimensional... the different businesses in Dow Corning were seen as:# Profit centers. These were the different businesses the company was in. Businesses were defined along product lines-for instance, rubber, encapsulants and sealants; resins and chemicals; fluids, emulsions, and compounds; specialty lubricants; and consumer, medical, and semi-conductor products. In most of the cases each business's product line served a related group of industries, markets, or customers. # Cost centers. These were functional activities and included marketing, manufacturing, technical service and development, and research, {{as well as a number}} of supportive activities, such as corporate communications, legal and administrative services, economic evaluation, the controller's office, the treasurer's office, and industrial relations.But soon we came to see further dimensions of the system:# Geographical areas. Business development varied widely horn area to area, and the profit-center and cost-center dimensions could not be carried out everywhere in the same manner... # Space and time. A fourth dimension of the organization denotes fluidity and movement through time (see Part D). The multidimensional organization is far from rigid; it is constantly changing. Unlike centralized or decentralized systems that too often are rooted deep in the past, the multidimensional organization is geared toward the future. Long-term planning is an inherent part of its operation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{advisable}} {{to establish a}} separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track.

In a divisional organization, {{there should be a}} central and several sector-specific energy management units.

In a <b>matrix</b> <b>organization</b> the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.|$|E

50|$|Perlecan {{consists}} of a core protein of molecular weight 470 kDa to which three long chains (each approximately 70-100 kDa) of glycosaminoglycans (often heparan sulfate, HS but can be chondroitin sulfate, CS) are attached. The core protein {{consists of}} five distinct structural domains. The N-terminal domain I (aa ~1-195) contains attachment sites for HS chains. Although HS chains are not required for correct folding and secretion of the protein, lack of HS or decreased sulfation can decrease perlecan's ability to interact with matrix proteins. Removal of HS chains may affect <b>matrix</b> <b>organization</b> and endothelial barrier function. Domain II comprises four repeats homologous to the ligand-binding portion of the LDL receptor with six conserved cysteine residues and a pentapeptide, DGSDE, which mediates ligand binding by the LDL receptor. Domain III has homology to the domain IVa and IVb of laminin. Domain IV {{consists of a}} series of IG modules. The C-terminal Domain V, which has homology to the G domain of the long arm of laminin, is responsible for self-assembly and may be important for basement membrane formation in vivo. Thus, perlecan core protein and HS chains could modulate matrix assembly, cell proliferation, lipoprotein binding and cell adhesion.|$|E
