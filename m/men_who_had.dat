40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women <b>who</b> are HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women are less than half {{as likely to be}} HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden. © 2014 Friedman et al...|$|R

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with men's views about condom use when having anal intercourse. Background Internationally, health promotion campaigns use behavioural change strategies to support <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to always use condoms when having anal sex with other men. The health promotion message given {{to this group}} is consistent and explicitly stated that ‘use a condom every time for anal sex regardless of relationship status’. Design Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of New Zealand <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> Methods A total of 960 useable questionnaires were completed: 571 online and 389 in hard copy. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic data analytic process. Results Three themes relating to condom use in <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> were identified. These are as follows: ‘Safer sex is good sex’, ‘Condom use is good but …’ and ‘I use condoms sometimes’. Conclusions The range of responses towards condom use for anal sex in <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> in our sample reveal this as a complex public health issue, with not all <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> willing to consistently use condoms. Relevance to clinical practice It is important that nurses do not assume that all <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> are willing to use condoms for anal sex, and should create opportunities for <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to raise any concerns {{about the use of}} condoms. In this way, nurses can assist in providing information that may help <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to make decisions that will minimise risk of contracting infections associated with sexual activity...|$|R
5|$|The few <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{not been}} wounded {{because they were}} manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with three <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and brought {{it back to the}} ships, although it sickened those who drank it. The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} force structure of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a number of units to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E

2500|$|Some other {{cultures}} {{do not recognize}} a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction. It is common to distinguish a person's sexuality according to their sexual role (active/passive; insertive/penetrated). In this distinction, the passive role is typically associated with femininity or inferiority, while the active role is typically associated with masculinity or superiority. For example, an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men: <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex only with men (consistently in a passive role), <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex only with women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women and men (consistently in an active role). [...] While <b>men</b> <b>who</b> consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals, <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with only women, and <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with women and men, were not differentiated.

While high HIV seroincidence has been documented among homosexual African-American men, behavioral research has rarely studied the HIV risk issues confronting these men. This study assessed a sample of 253 <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> to determine if African-American (n = 79) and white (n = 174) men report different rates of HIV risk behaviors and differ in characteristics indicative of risk.

Multivariate analyses of covariance, controlling for group differences in age, education, and income, revealed that African-American <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> were less open about their sexual orientation, scored lower in HIV risk behavior knowledge, had more female sexual partners, and more frequently used cocaine in association with sex relative to white <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men.</b> Human immunodeficiency virus prevention programs tailored to the needs and risk issues of African-American <b>men</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>men</b> are needed...|$|R
