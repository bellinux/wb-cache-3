Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night.

In this contemporary moment of convergence, art has become increasingly relational and dematerialized, and design has moved into the space now vacated by art – a space of rarified objects. Focusing on the contemporary, limited-edition furniture spawned by the art-design phenomenon and its contextual culture of hyper-luxury, this paper explores how these objects function as tastemakers, informing and influencing how contemporary style can be understood and how stylistic themes are established – how meaning is conveyed through design’s interconnected dimensions of form, materiality and style. Based on close observation of an entirely new aesthetic evidenced in these objects, this paper puts forth an emerging thematic typology which foregrounds the concepts of time and contemporaneity...|$|R

50|$|Maya rulers <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>habit</b> out <b>of</b> {{visiting the}} sweat baths {{as well because}} it left them feeling {{refreshed}} and, as they believed, cleaner. In addition, Maya rulers performed ritual purification ceremonies to appease the gods and secure the well-being of their communities.

Archeologists have uncovered sweat baths at sites including Tikal, Aguateca and Nakbe, but the most impressive find to date is in Piedras Negras, a Classic Maya city in Guatemala. In addition to the recognizable palaces, temples and ball courts, archaeologists have uncovered eight stone buildings that served as sweat baths to the Maya royalty. Steambaths are still in use among the contemporary Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya of highland Chiapas, and {{are associated with a}} wide range of medicinal plants and postpartum therapies.|$|R
