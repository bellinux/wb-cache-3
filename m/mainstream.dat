40|$|This article {{assesses the}} utility of impact {{assessments}} (IA) as an effective tool for <b>mainstreaming.</b> Specifically, it analyses whether the European Union’s (EU) system of integrated impact assessments (IIA) contributes to the realisation of six <b>mainstreaming</b> objectives defined in the EU Treaties.

The analysis shows that all the six <b>mainstreaming</b> objectives have a place within the IIA system, but the system does not ensure systematic consideration of them.

40|$|From the outset, {{there were}} high {{expectations}} about gender <b>mainstreaming</b> and the possibilities it raised for achieving gender equality. A {{decade after the}} introduction of gender <b>mainstreaming,</b> scepticism about gender <b>mainstreaming</b> as an effective policy strategy for gender equality is vast. Analyzing several operationalizations of gender <b>mainstreaming</b> at the respective policy levels in Belgium, the article focuses on the basic assumptions of the concept regarding policy as intentional and rational in process and outcome in explaining why in practice gender <b>mainstreaming</b> often turns into a formalistic exercise of measuring, monitoring and evaluating. The argument of the paper is {{that the lack of}} a definition of the aim of gender <b>mainstreaming</b> (i. e. gender equality) combined with its focus on implementing procedures in assumed rational policy processes, allows for gender <b>mainstreaming</b> to be watered down to a formalistic exercise of creating specific output using gender <b>mainstreaming</b> instruments whereby losing sight of substantive outcome in terms of enhancing gender equality...|$|R

40|$|Currently, gender <b>mainstreaming</b> is {{presented}} as bringing new lan to gender equality policies. Gender <b>mainstreaming</b> is a gender equality strategy that aims to transform organizational processes and practices by eliminating gender biases in existing routines, involving the regular actors in this transformation process. In this article, we question the aspirations of gender <b>mainstreaming.</b> Can gender <b>mainstreaming</b> escape the genderedness of organizations; can it genuinely effect change, or does it inevitably become compromised? Our analysis of a case project within Human Resource Management in the Ministry of the Flemish Community in Belgium shows that gender <b>mainstreaming</b> does indeed bring about changes, but {{that it does not}} break down the genderedness of organizations substantially. While gender <b>mainstreaming</b> invokes an image of cooperation between equal parties that pursue a dual agenda of business needs and feminist goals, our analysis shows that crucial power differences between those parties determine the outcome. The complex social dynamics of gender <b>mainstreaming</b> entail compromises in the context of these power differences, which seriously hinder the transformative and innovative potential of gender <b>mainstreaming...</b>|$|R

40|$|Gender <b>mainstreaming</b> was {{introduced}} within the European Union (EU) in the 1990 s {{as a means}} of addressing the unequal treatment of employed women. Yet its impact on organizational practices in Europe has been limited. This review synthesizes and analyses theoretical and policy literatures on gender <b>mainstreaming</b> within the EU between 1998 and 2011. It highlights ambiguities within gender <b>mainstreaming</b> literatures regarding whether gender <b>mainstreaming</b> is, first and foremost, a policy or a strategy. It further identifies ambiguities regarding how inequality should be articulated: in terms of the sameness or difference between women's and men's concerns, and in the context of whether gender <b>mainstreaming</b> research should be defined as focusing primarily on ‘women’ or on ‘gender’. The paper suggests that such ambiguity of definition within gender <b>mainstreaming</b> literatures compromises the implementation of gender <b>mainstreaming</b> within organizational practices. It further observes the need, within some gender <b>mainstreaming</b> theoretical and policy literatures, to move away from stable definitions of ‘male’ and ‘female’ (which identify women's and men's concerns as often in contrast) towards a more situated approach. The paper contributes to future gender <b>mainstreaming</b> research by proposing a more fluid, post-structural and sociocultural interpretation of ‘gender’. Drawing upon Judith Butler's research, it argues for the reconceptualizing of gender <b>mainstreaming</b> through a ‘Gender as performativity’ framework, in which gender is characterized as situational and performed in line with organizational expectations about women's and men's social role...|$|R

This method of educating handicapped children is commonly referred to as <b>mainstreaming.</b> ^ The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes of preschool educators toward <b>mainstreaming</b> handicapped children in Pennsylvania. Specifically the study examined the relationship of twenty-four independent variables with the dependent variable, attitudes toward <b>mainstreaming.</b> Some of the more important variables included enrollment of handicapped children, type of certification, age, completion of special education courses and experience teaching handicapped children. Data were also collected regarding potential incentives for encouraging the {{practice of}} preschool <b>mainstreaming.</b> Up until this time, research regarding the attitudes of preschool educators toward <b>mainstreaming</b> has been sparse or non-extant. ^ The methodology used for this study was that of a survey questionnaire which combined the Attitudes Toward <b>Mainstreaming</b> Scale developed by Berryman and Neal with a background data questionnaire. The geographic area surveyed covered selected counties from southern Pennsylvania including urban, suburban and rural areas. A multiple regression analysis was used to analyze most of the data. A measure of difference was also employed to determine the effect of three selected institutional variables. ^ The study reviewed the history of <b>mainstreaming,</b> the present status of preschool education in Pennsylvania and relevant research in the areas of preschool <b>mainstreaming</b> and attitudes toward <b>mainstreaming.</b> ^ Two significant results were: (1) There is a negative correlation between favorable attitudes toward <b>mainstreaming</b> among preschool educators and certification as specialists and (2) Those educators working in preschool programs which enroll handicapped children have more favorable attitudes toward <b>mainstreaming.</b> ^ The results of the survey indicated that most of the variables investigated had no significant relationship with the dependent variable. ^ The study also revealed that most respondents preferred financial incentives, provision of special services and relevant training as likely inducements to foster preschool <b>mainstreaming.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Gender <b>mainstreaming</b> was {{endorsed}} as {{the official}} policy approach to gender equality in the European Union and its member states in the Amsterdam Treaty (1997). New member states have been obliged to adopt a gender <b>mainstreaming</b> approach {{as a condition of}} joining the EU. However, despite this endorsement, there remains considerable confusion as to what gender <b>mainstreaming</b> is and there has been uneven development in the adoption of gender <b>mainstreaming</b> tools. This article seeks to contribute to the debate by identifying three principles that appear to underlie gender <b>mainstreaming</b> in Europe – treating the individual as a whole person; democracy; and justice, fairness and equity. It then draws on the experience of a number of European countries to identify where tools associated with each set of principles have been introduced. These include gender-disaggregated statistics, gender budgeting and ‘visioning’. The article illustrates how there appear to be very few examples of a gender <b>mainstreaming</b> approach where promoting gender equality is the main policy goal (agenda setting). More often, gender <b>mainstreaming</b> is used as a means of delivering on or is subsumed under another policy (integration). Despite these weaknesses in practice, the article concludes that gender <b>mainstreaming</b> has significant potential as a transformative strategy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGender is well {{recognised}} as {{a critical}} consideration for HIV/AIDS organisations. Since the 1990 s, HIV/AIDS policymakers, donors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and transnational corporations have adopted gender <b>mainstreaming</b> as the process for integrating gender into development programmes and institutions. There is an increasing body of literature on the successes and challenges of practicing gender <b>mainstreaming</b> within organisational environments, however, little {{has been said about}} this practice within HIV/AIDS-specific organisational environments. As a contribution to this gap, this reflective paper aims to generate debate about some of the considerations for gender <b>mainstreaming</b> practice in HIV/AIDS organisations. It draws on the author's experience conducting a gender <b>mainstreaming</b> review with a southern African HIV/AIDS capacity-strengthening organisation, as well as a review of the development literature on gender <b>mainstreaming.</b> The paper looks at three key issues facing gender mainstreaming: (1) donor requirements on disaggregating data by sex; (2) connecting gender <b>mainstreaming</b> with the priorities of community HIV/AIDS organisations; and, (3) the role of resistance to gender <b>mainstreaming</b> as neo-colonial. Preliminary understandings of these issues suggest that current approaches to gender <b>mainstreaming</b> may not be flexible enough to consider the multiple ways gender and HIV/AIDS interact in different socio-cultural contexts. There is an urgent need for further debate and in-depth research into these issues, given the challenge they pose for HIV/AIDS organisations and donors that have chosen to make gender <b>mainstreaming</b> a criterion for HIV/AIDS funding...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about whether the}} {{political}} majority {{has an impact on}} gender <b>mainstreaming</b> at the committee decisions. Gender <b>mainstreaming</b> is the main strategy in Sweden in order to increase equality. It has been the dominant strategy for over 20 years, but gender equality is still not achieved.  Political majority could have an impact on how municipalities work with gender <b>mainstreaming.</b> I study three municipalities, the municipality of Örebro, the municipality of Umeå and the municipality of Jönköping and how decisions {{have been made in the}} committee responsible for preschool and primary school in each municipality. Therefore, I study in this thesis if there are any similarities and differences between the municipalities with gender <b>mainstreaming</b> and if political majority can have an impact on gender <b>mainstreaming.</b> I have chosen to use a comparative case study to compare the gender <b>mainstreaming</b> of these three municipalities, using a qualitative content analysis. The analysis is based on the municipalities' gender equality plans, strategic plans and meeting protocols using the Municipal Population Model and the CEMR-declaration (Council of European Municipalities and Regions). The conclusions of the analysis are that there are similarities and differences in how municipalities use gender <b>mainstreaming</b> in their decisions. The similarities depends on that all municipalities are based on the same strategy and that everyone is based on the CEMR-declaration and the differences are that they have formed the goals different. The conclusion is that political majority does not have such a major impact on gender <b>mainstreaming.</b> Keywords: gender <b>mainstreaming,</b> municipalities, political parties, CEMR-declaratio...|$|R
