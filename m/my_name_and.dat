500|$|Regarding the situation, Gingrich said in January 1997, [...] "I did {{not manage}} the effort {{intensely}} enough to thoroughly direct or review information being {{submitted to the}} committee on my behalf. In <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements {{were given to the}} committee, but I did not intend to mislead the committee...

500|$|Scholars and {{academics}} have offered different {{interpretations of the}} music video and its story line. Allen Metz, {{one of the authors}} of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, noted that when Madonna enters the church at the beginning of the clip, the line [...] "I hear you call <b>my</b> <b>name,</b> <b>And</b> it feels like.... Home" [...] is played. The women of Italian East Harlem in New York call their Church as la casa di momma (Momma's House). In that respect, Metz believed that Madonna alluded herself to be one from Harlem, but also refers herself as divinity returning to the Church. This divine aspect is further explored by Nicholas B. Dirks, author of Culture/power/history, who argued that Madonna falling into a dream is the most important point of the narrative as it signified that [...] "Madonna is really not putting herself in place of the redeemer, but imagining herself as one." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} match, in Bridgetown, Barbados, Boycott was to face what was later {{said to be}} Holding's {{greatest}} over. Boycott was hit on the gloves by the first delivery, played-and-missed the second outside off stump, was hit on the thigh by the third, fended the next two deliveries away with his bat, and was then bowled by the final delivery. Though in 1987 Boycott would claim a 1966 delivery by Gary Sobers {{to be the best}} he ever faced in cricket, he noted of Holding's over that [...] "for {{the first time in my}} life I can look at a scoreboard with a duck against <b>my</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> not feel a profound sense of failure." [...] Boycott led an England fight back in the fourth Test. Having watched Holding's over several times on video, and worked in the nets on his game, Boycott came out and made 38 in the first innings and then hit his twentieth Test century. His career run total was now 7,410, gaining on Gary Sobers' record of 8,032.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, NME {{published}} an article detailing Love's plan to reunite Hole and release a new album, Nobody's Daughter. In response, former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement; therefore Nobody's Daughter would remain Love's solo record, {{as opposed to a}} [...] "Hole" [...] record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a Twitter post, claiming [...] "he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, <b>my</b> <b>name,</b> <b>and</b> my Trademark". Nobody's Daughter was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist Micko Larkin, Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). Nobody's Daughter featured material written and recorded for Love's unfinished solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, including [...] "Pacific Coast Highway", [...] "Letter to God", [...] "Samantha", and [...] "Never Go Hungry", although they were re-produced in the studio with Larkin and engineer Michael Beinhorn. The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk rock sound, and more acoustic guitar work than previous Hole albums.|$|E
500|$|The reunion album, titled simply Byrds, was {{released}} on March 7, 1973 to mixed reviews. [...] As a result, a planned tour {{in support of the}} album failed to materialize. [...] Among the album's shortcomings, critics made note of a lack of sonic unity and the absence of the Byrds' signature jangly guitar sound. [...] Nonetheless, the album managed to climb to number 20 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart and number 31 in the UK. [...] In the United States, the album became the band's highest charting LP of new material since 1965's Turn! Turn! Turn!, which had also been the last Byrds' album to feature Gene Clark as a full member. [...] Among the tracks included on the album were McGuinn's folk-flavored [...] "Sweet Mary", the Joni Mitchell cover [...] "For Free", a re-recording of Crosby's song [...] "Laughing" [...] (which had originally appeared on his 1971 solo album, If I Could Only Remember <b>My</b> <b>Name),</b> <b>and</b> a pair of Neil Young songs. [...] The album also featured the Gene Clark compositions [...] "Changing Heart" [...] and [...] "Full Circle", the latter of which had provided the reunion album with its working title and was subsequently released as a single, although it failed to chart.|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} in Traveling Shoes, one that many critics overlook, is Angelou's {{love for her}} son. [...] The theme of {{motherhood}} is one of Angelou's most consistent themes throughout her series of autobiographies, although it does not overwhelm this book {{as it does in}} Gather Together in <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> <b>and</b> Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. [...] Motherhood is present in many of the book's subthemes—her relationship with her houseboy Kojo, her delight in being called [...] "Auntie" [...] by many African children, and her feelings toward [...] "Mother Africa". [...] Traveling Shoes begins with Guy's accident, his long recovery, and his mother's reaction to it, thus universalizing the fear of every parent—the death of a child. [...] The main character is a mother of a grown son, so liberation from the daily responsibilities of motherhood is emphasized, but it is complicated by the recognition that part of motherhood is letting go, something Angelou struggles with. [...] Confrontations between Angelou and Guy are minimal, consisting of their conflict over his choice of dating a much-older woman and of his demands for autonomy after she returns from the Genet tour. [...] Angelou seems to vacillate between wanting to supervise him and wanting to let go throughout this book. [...] In this way, as Lupton says, the motherhood theme, like the identity theme, is [...] "dual in nature".|$|E
500|$|On March 27, 2010, Rihanna {{performed}} [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{as part of}} {{a medley}} with [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] at the 2010 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, held at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion in Westwood, California. The performance featured a large camouflage tank and two robots similar to those used for her performance at the ECHO Awards. On May 23, 2010, Rihanna performed a 40-minute set at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend Music Festival in Bangor, Wales. Rihanna wore a hooded leather playsuit with red, green, and yellow stripes as she performed several of her biggest hits, which included [...] "Mad House", [...] "Hard", [...] "Disturbia", [...] "Rude Boy", [...] "Te Amo", [...] "Russian Roulette", [...] "Don't Stop the Music", [...] "SOS", and [...] "Umbrella". The song was featured on Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour,. Rihanna was criticized for poor choreography and because she [...] "omitted the difficult parts and even forgot some of the lyrics." [...] "Rude Boy" [...] was also on the set-list of her Loud Tour, where Rihanna wore a denim bra and high waisted shorts. This performance was received far more positively than that of her previous tour, and critics praised the production of the concert. Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun wrote, [...] "the two-hour, larger-than-life show lived up to the billing." [...] Rihanna performed [...] "Rude Boy" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the seventh song on the set list. She also performed the song at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards in a medley with Pon De Replay, What's <b>My</b> <b>Name?</b> <b>and</b> Work.|$|E

2500|$|In The Other Hollywood, Boreman {{said she}} felt [...] "used" [...] by the anti-pornography movement.

She refused: [...] "Tallchief was <b>my</b> <b>name,</b> <b>and</b> I was proud of it." [...] However, de Mille had a more acceptable idea– using {{a modified version of}} her middle name. Tallchief agreed and was known as Maria Tallchief for the remainder of her career.|$|E
