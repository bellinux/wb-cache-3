This research investigates the influence of QWERTY <b>mobile</b> <b>phone’s</b> forms in the perception of Indonesian user. First, some alternatives of <b>mobile</b> <b>phone’s</b> form are developed based on a certain number of <b>mobile</b> <b>phone’s</b> models. At the second stage, some word pairs as design attributes of the <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> are chosen to represent the user perception of <b>mobile</b> <b>phone.</b> At the final stage, a survey is conducted to investigate the influence of the developed form alternatives to the user perception.

5|$|<b>Mobile</b> <b>phones</b> {{have had}} a {{significant}} impact on telephone networks. Mobile phone subscriptions now outnumber fixed-line subscriptions in many markets. Sales of <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> in 2005 totalled 816.6 million with that figure being almost equally shared amongst the markets of Asia/Pacific (204 m), Western Europe (164 m), CEMEA (Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa) (153.5 m), North America (148 m) and Latin America (102 m). In terms of new subscriptions over the five years from 1999, Africa has outpaced other markets with 58.2% growth. Increasingly these phones are being serviced by systems where the voice content is transmitted digitally such as GSM or W-CDMA with many markets choosing to deprecate analog systems such as AMPS.|$|E

Not only the rapidly development and improvement but also high competition in the <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> industry has resulted in the three major players in the Thai market, including AIS, DTAC, and TRUE service provider. This study emphasizes on factors influencing decision to subscribe <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> service and attitude toward <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> concerning on identity, usage, and expenses aspects. A sample of 600 respondents is observed and analysed using multivariate statistical analysis. Analyses of factors determining attitude toward <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> employ linear regression model and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) assuming Logit. The models applied in analysing decision to subscribe <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> service consist of 3 separate Probit models and Multivariate Probit for the three service providers. The results indicate that <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> network subscribers make decision to subscribe <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> service by taking all three services providers as choices simultaneous, thus, Multivariate Probit models show significant estimated results. The findings also reveal that attitude towards <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> and marketing mixed have significant impacts on decision to subscribe <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> service...|$|R
