40|$|Carpets of the Iberian Peninsula, woven in the 15 th and 16 th centuries, {{represent}} diverse {{cultural traditions}} {{at a time}} of great political transformation. With the fall of Granada in 1492, Christian dominion was firmly reestablished. Despite radical shifts in patronage from Muslim to Christian in previous centuries, the weaving of carpets with wool pile seems to have flourished in established production centers. Following the Arab and Berber conquests of Andalusia in the early 8 th century, there is scant evidence for rug-weaving but a significant group of carpets survives from the 15 th century, which stylistically reflects earlier traditions of carpet-weaving from Turkey, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Iberian carpets of the 16 th century herald styles of the Renaissance, reflecting the cultural reorientation of the Iberian Peninsula from the Islamic east to an emerging Europe. Carpets, today preserved in museum collections, exhibit design elements that draw from local Iberian sources and patterns of Roman pavements, as well as from motifs associated with Christian art and Islamic geometric interlace. Despite the diversity of sources and the blending of cultural traditions, Iberian carpets bear a unique weave structure based upon a single-warp knot and <b>multiple</b> <b>wefts,</b> which distinguishes this weaving tradition from all others. Based on analysis of weave structure and design in Iberian carpets at The Textile Museum, Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Hispanic Society of America, this paper seeks to document the ways in which carpets mark the complexities of cultural and political transformations that led to the making of modern Spain...|$|R
40|$|Fragment of undyed woven linen fabric with {{a single}} red wool weft near an edge with a long fringe (but {{no sign of a}} border). There are two pairs of <b>multiple</b> <b>weft</b> picks.

Some edge fraying. The edge next to the red wool weft has a long fringe which may be due to wear as there are no knots visible...|$|E
50|$|Tent stitch is a small, {{diagonal}} needlepoint stitch {{that crosses}} over {{the intersection of}} one horizontal (weft) and one vertical (warp) thread of needlepoint canvas forming a slanted stitch at a 45-degree angle. It {{is also known as}} Needlepoint stitch {{and is one of the}} most basic and versatile stitches used in Needlepoint and other Canvas work embroidery. When worked on fine weave canvas over a single warp and weft thread it is known as Petit point in contrast to stitches, such as Gobelin, worked over <b>multiple</b> warp and/or <b>weft</b> threads.|$|R
