25|$|According to the CBO, {{the major}} reason for {{observed}} rise in unequal distribution of after-tax income {{was an increase in}} <b>market</b> <b>income,</b> that is household income before taxes and transfers. <b>Market</b> <b>income</b> for a household is a combination of labor income (such as cash wages, employer-paid benefits, and employer-paid payroll taxes), business income (such as income from businesses and farms operated solely by their owners), capital gains (profits realized from the sale of assets and stock options), capital income (such as interest from deposits, dividends, and rental income), and other income. Of them, capital gains accounted for 80% of the increase in <b>market</b> <b>income</b> for the households in top 20%, in the 2000–2007 period.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} {{distribution}} and concentration of <b>market</b> <b>incomes</b> in Germany in the period 1992 to 2001 {{on the basis of}} an integrated data set of individual tax returns and the German Socio-Economic Panel. The unique feature of this integrated data set is that it encompasses the whole spectrum of the population, from the very poor to the very rich. We find a modest increase in overall inequality of <b>market</b> <b>incomes</b> in Germany in the period 1992 to 2001, most of which occurred in east Germany during {{the first few years of}} the transition period. However, this relative stability of overall inequality disguises significant changes that occurred at the very top of the income distribution. The increase of income inequality can be mainly attributed to a substantial increase of <b>market</b> <b>incomes</b> of the German economic elite, which we define as the richest 0. 001 % persons in the population. In that group, the income share received in form of wage income substantially increased...|$|R

President Obama attempted both strategies, with some success in reducing both the pre-tax and after-tax share of income of the top 1% measured 2012 to 2013 (the most recent CBO data available as of December 2016), which means the share of income of the bottom 99% increased.|$|E
25|$|Income {{inequality}} in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s after several decades of stability, meaning {{the share of}} the nation's income received by higher income households has increased. This trend is evident with income measured both before taxes (<b>market</b> <b>income)</b> as well as after taxes and transfer payments. Income inequality has fluctuated considerably since measurements began around 1915, moving in an arc between peaks in the 1920s and 2000s, with a 30-year period of relatively lower inequality between 1950–1980.|$|E

The ACOLI is the appropriate deflator to apply to pretax <b>market</b> <b>incomes</b> when calculating economic well-being. Well-being includes, not only conventional consumer purchases, but also goods and services provided by employers, by mandated social regulations, and by tax-financed public goods.

An application of the ACOLI approach to the United States during the 1960 - 1994 period indicates that the conventional consumer price index has grown about 15 percent faster than the ACOLI.
