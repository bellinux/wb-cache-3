Physicists tend to use the more classical definition of the term (see Stark effect), while chemists usually use the term to refer to what is technically electrochromism. In the former case, the applied electric field splits the atomic energy levels and is the electric field analog of the Zeeman effect. However, in the latter case, the applied electric field changes the <b>molar</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the sample, which can be measured using traditional absorption or emission spectroscopic methods.

S 1 –Sn transient absorption spectrum with a peak around 530 nm was observed by a femtosecond transient absorption technique for ArOH in ACN.

The rate constant for the deprotonation of ArOHradical dot+ in ACN, by the addition of small amounts of water (0. 10 – 0. 75 %), was estimated to be around 1 × 108 M− 1 s− 1.
