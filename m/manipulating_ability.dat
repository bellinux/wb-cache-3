The X-ray powder diffraction patterns and IR spectra of the as-formed magnetite particles indicate additive-free products were obtained. Analyses on the size and size distribution of the magnetite obtained suggest that the additives – surfactants, chitosan and inorganic ligands have different <b>manipulating</b> <b>ability.</b> Surfactants gave better manipulation on particle size (ca. < 45 nm) as well as the size distribution (ca. SD < 20 nm). Chitosan can manipulate the size distribution while maintaining the average size of the original magnetite. Whereas inorganic ligands, with the exception of thiourea, exert only slight influence on the size distribution with no manipulation over the average size. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs suggest that citrate and stearic acid may have affected the final morphology of the magnetite formed in their presence...|$|E

40|$|A high performance, {{high speed}} robotic arm {{must be able}} to {{manipulate}} objects {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, repeatability and dexterity. As with any other physical system, there are a number of factors causing uncertainties in the behavior of a robotic manipulator. These factors include manufacturing and assembling tolerances, and errors in the joint actuators and controllers. In order to study the effect of these uncertainties on the robotic end-effector and to obtain a better insight into the manipulator behavior, the concepts of theory of probability are applied to the manipulator kinematics and dynamics. Based on these probabilistic models, kinematic and dynamic performance criteria are defined to provide a measure of the behavior of the robotic end-effector. Techniques are presented to compute these criteria. The effect of the tolerances on various manipulator parameters on these criteria is studied. A methodology is developed to assign the tolerances optimally, that maximizes these criteria subject to constraints on the manipulator cost. Results show that very significant and cost effective improvements can be achieved in the manipulator performance with the use of optimal tolerances. ^ Another desirable property of a robotic arm is the degree of dexterity with which it can manipulate objects. This aspect of the manipulator performance is investigated, and new criteria are proposed to provide a measure of the kinematic, dynamic and force <b>manipulating</b> <b>abilities.</b> It is shown that optimization of these criteria can lead to significant improvements in the overall manipulating capabilities of a robotic arm.

40|$|The current {{research}} examines {{the effect of}} the content of memory reports on false memory judgments. Previous research on false memories has suggested that the mere claim from another person is enough to influence a target into reporting a false memory. The {{current research}} uses persuasion theory to suggest that the quality of the information that accompanies the memory claim influences the target 2 ̆ 7 s reporting of false memories. This dissertation includes 5 studies using a procedure based on the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The main goal of the studies is to examine how people use information in memory reports when making false memory judgments. Studies 1 and 2 provide evidence that false memories are more likely when memory claims are supported by strong rather than weak supporting information and that these results are not due to semantic priming or conformity. Study 3 replicates the findings of Studies 1 and 2 while demonstrating that the pattern of results depends on the supporting information being presented as support for a persuasive claim instead of simply being activated at the time of retrieval. Thus, Studies 1 [...] 3 provide strong support for persuasion effects on false memory. Studies 4 and 5 examine participants 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of supporting information under experimentally <b>manipulated</b> <b>ability</b> to process information. In Study 4, support strength again influences false memories, but does so across levels of cognitive load. In Study 5 source expertise has a marginal effect on false memories. However, the effects of source expertise and support strength do not differ by level of cognitive load. Thus, Studies 4 and 5 offer no consistent evidence as yet regarding whether the effects of support strength should be considered as due to support acting as arguments to support the claim or as information about the expertise or credibility of the source making the claim. In either case, the content of the support for the claim is influencing false memories. Future research may require some changes in methods to definitively answer such questions. Implications are discussed for effects of social influence on false memory within and beyond the DRM paradigm. ...|$|R
40|$|Old age could impair memory by disrupting {{learning}} strategies used by younger individuals. We tested this possibility by <b>manipulating</b> the <b>ability</b> to use visual-exploration strategies during learning.

Performance on tests of object recognition and object-location recall was matched for younger and older subjects for objects studied passively, when {{learning strategies}} were restricted. Active learning improved object recognition similarly for younger and older subjects. However, active learning improved object-location recall for younger subjects, but not older subjects. Exploration patterns were used to identify a learning strategy involving repeat viewing. Older subjects used this strategy less frequently and it provided less memory benefit compared to younger subjects. In previous experiments, we linked hippocampal-prefrontal co-activation to improvements in object-location recall from active learning and to the exploration strategy. Collectively, {{these findings suggest that}} age-related memory problems result partly from impaired strategies during learning, potentially due to reduced hippocampal-prefrontal co-engagement...|$|R

Naturally GPI-linked CD 48, along with engineered forms of I-Ek and B 7 - 2, in which their transmembrane domains have been genetically replaced with the GPI linkage, were studied. The proteins were labeled with fluorescently tagged antibodies, allowing the electric field-induced behavior to be followed by epifluorescence microscopy. All three protein complexes were observed to migrate toward the cathode with the B 7 - 2 and CD 48, each tethered to the membrane by a single GPI linker, moving significantly faster than the I-Ek, which has two GPI linkers. Patterns scratched into the membrane function as barriers to lateral diffusion and were used to isolate the proteins into highly concentrated corrals. All field-induced concentration profiles were completely reversible, indicating that the supported bilayer provides a stable, fluid environment in which GPI-tethered proteins can be <b>manipulated.</b> The <b>ability</b> to electrically control the spatial distribution of membrane-tethered proteins provides new opportunities for the study of biological membranes and the development of membrane-based devices...|$|R

However, G. campestris females are highly aggressive towards heterospecific G. bimaculatus males, and matings between them never happen.

40|$|Processing {{the motivational}} {{relevance}} of a visual scene and reacting accordingly {{is crucial for}} survival. Previous work suggests the emotional content of naturalistic scenes affects response speed, such that unpleasant content slows responses whereas pleasant content accelerates responses. It is unclear whether these effects reflect motor-cognitive processes, such as attentional orienting, or vary with the function/outcome of the motor response itself. Four experiments <b>manipulated</b> participants' <b>ability</b> to terminate the picture (offset control) and, thereby, the response's function and motivational value. Attentive orienting was manipulated via picture repetition, which diminishes orienting. A total of N[*]=[*] 81 participants completed versions of a go/no-go task, discriminating between distorted versus intact pictures drawn from six content categories varying in positive, negative, or neutral valence. While all participants responded faster with repetition, only participants without offset control exhibited slower responses to unpleasant and accelerated responses to pleasant content. Emotional engagement, measured by the late positive potential, was not modulated by attentional orienting (repetition), suggesting that the interaction between repetition and offset control is not due to altered emotional engagement. Together, results suggest that response time changes {{as a function of}} emotional content and sensitivity to attention orienting depends on the motivational function of the motor respons...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{experiments}} investigated modulatory {{effects of}} a surround upon the perceived speed of a moving central region. Both the surround’s depth and velocity (relative to the center) were <b>manipulated.</b> The <b>abilities</b> of younger observers (mean age was 23. 1 years) were evaluated in Experiment 1, while Experiment 2 was devoted to older participants (mean age was 71. 3 years). The results of Experiment 1 revealed that changes in the perceived depth of a surround (in this case caused by changes in binocular disparity) significantly influence the perceived speed of a central target. In particular, the center’s motion was perceived as fastest when the surround possessed uncrossed binocular disparity relative to the central target. This effect, that targets that are closer than their background {{are perceived to be}} faster, only occurred when the center and surround moved in the same directions (and did not occur when center and surround moved in opposite directions). The results of Experiment 2 showed that the perceived speeds of older adults are different: older observers generally perceive nearer targets as faster both when center and surround move in the same direction and when they move in opposite directions. In addition, the older observers’ judgments of speed were less precise. These age-related changes in the perception of speed are broadly consistent with the results of recent neurophysiological investigations that find age-related changes in the functionality of cortical area MT...|$|R
40|$|In {{groups of}} cooperatively {{foraging}} individuals, communication may improve the group’s performance by directing foraging effort {{to where it}} is most useful. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) use a specialized dance to communicate the location of floral resources. Because honey bees dance longer for more rewarding resources, communication may shift the colony’s foraging effort towards higher quality resources, and thus narrow the spectrum of resource types used. To test the hypothesis that dance communication changes how much honey bee colonies specialize on particular resources, we <b>manipulated</b> their <b>ability</b> to communicate location, and assessed the relative abundance of different pollen taxa they collected. This was repeated across five natural habitats that differed in floral species richness and spatial distribution. Contrary to expectation, impairing communication did not change the number or diversity of pollen (resource) types used by individual colonies per day. However, colonies with intact dance communication were more consistent in their resource use, while those with impaired communication {{were more likely to}} collect rare, novel pollen types. This suggests that communication {{plays an important role in}} shaping how much colonies invest in exploring new resources versus exploiting known ones. Furthermore, colonies that did more exploration also tended to collect less pollen overall, but only in environments with greater floral abundance per patch.
