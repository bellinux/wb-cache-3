40|$|Migration {{can be a}} {{hazardous}} venture, particularly if carried out clandestinely. Evidence indicates that foreigners working without formal authorisation, i. e. 'irregular migrant workers', are in a particularly vulnerable position primarily because of their irregular immigration status. They {{are more likely to}} be subjected to exploitative and unsafe employment practices in terms of benefits and conditions. This study examines the protection available to this category of migrant workers in South Africa, particularly their right of access to work-related social protection. South Africa is a major <b>migrant-receiving</b> <b>country</b> in Southern Africa because of its relatively stronger economy and political stability. However, the employment of foreign nationals without work permits, or foreigners working contrary to visa requirements, raises a series of policy issues. These issues, against the background of fairness and equity discourses pertaining to socio-economic entitlements, become exacerbated. This study examines the adequacy of domestic, constitutional and legislative frameworks that offer work-related social protection to foreign workers in South Africa. In the context of international, continental, and regional instruments that provide similar protection to irregular migrants, it could be argued that South Africa's restrictive legislative framework compromises equality in the right of access to social protection for some migrants. Although effective migration management depends on careful juxtaposition of myriad policies, emerging evidence suggests conflicting interplay between key South African policies intended to manage the rights of workers specifically and labour migration in the country generally. Critical analysis of relevant national immigration, labour, and social security laws indicates inconsistency with international human rights principles concerning the equality of opportunity or treatment of irregular migrants vis-àvis regular migrants and nationals regarding social protection. Yet, inequalities in the actual processes or opportunities (means) embedded in these policies disentitle many vulnerable foreign workers from important constitutionally entrenched fundamental rights because their presence and/or employment violates existing immigration laws.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} impact of skilled migrants 2 ̆ 7 remittances and import tariffs of migrant-sending countries on skilled migration. The first chapter builds a model that predicts the positive association between emigration of skilled individuals {{and the proportion of}} remittances from them by considering heterogeneity of workers in skills. There are inter [...] industry and migration thresholds of skill in migrant sending countries. Both of these skill thresholds lower with remittances from skilled migrants. This is because of the rising wage gap effects. Remittance outflows from developed countries depress the demand for differentiated goods which in turn lowers the demand for workers in this sector. This leads to lowering the demand for skilled workers and thus wages of the marginal workers increases. Just opposite happens in migrant-sending countries and so wage gap increases, which pulls skilled workers from developing countries and therefore, emigration of such workers increases. The second chapter builds a model that predicts the complementarity between skilled migration and import tariffs levied by migrant sending countries. Migration skill threshold increases with the increase in tariffs thereby reducing skilled migration. However, the inter-industry skill threshold moves left with the rise in tariffs causing to expand differentiated sector in the developing country. On the contrary, the differentiated sector in the developed country shrinks. Expansion of differentiated sector in the migrant sending country and shrinking of such sector in the <b>migrant-receiving</b> <b>country</b> lowers the skilled migration from the developing to the developed country. The third chapter empirically tests the validity of the prediction of the first chapter. Using a panel data of 133 developing countries as migrant source countries and seven five-year windows between 1980 and 2010, we find that inflows of remittances are positively associated with subsequent stocks of highly educated migrants living in OECD countries. We find little association between remittance inflows and subsequent changes in stocks of less educated migrants...|$|E
30|$|Increasing {{economic}} opportunities in <b>migrant-receiving</b> <b>countries</b> may {{act as a}} particularly strong stimulus to migrate for {{women who have been}} excluded from the labour markets in their countries of origin. Despite Soviet-era policies that encouraged women to participate in the labour market and in higher education, the employment of women in formal employment across the former Soviet space has plummeted since the transition to market economies (Pollert, 2003; LaFont, 2001). In many former Soviet states, drastic reductions in social protection benefits that disproportionately benefited women and enabled their re-entry to the labour market following child birth, such as child care and maternity benefits (Bezemer, 2006), has further reduced the productivity of human capital in local labour markets. Taken together, increased opportunities for employment in female-focused sectors abroad coupled with limited {{economic opportunities}} in the home labour market may strongly encourage the participation of women in international moves, contributing to changes to the structure and composition of migration flows in the process.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Recent {{estimates}} are that migrants send approximately US$ 300 billion in financial remittances from developed {{to developing countries}} annually and that such money is important at the micro and macro levels in relieving family poverty. As a <b>migrant-receiving</b> <b>country</b> with a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) population, Australia has many migrants from developing countries {{who are part of}} this phenomenon. Little is known, however, about the purposes for which migrants send money home, the role it plays in intergenerational care and the perceptions of the impact of these payments on the recipients and on their own families in Australia. This study has a specific focus. It is interested in understanding the financial support provided to aged relatives in developing countries from Australian citizens. The term intergenerational financial transfers (IFTs) is used to distinguish money sent overseas by migrant adult children to parents or older relatives from general remittances. In Australian government accounting systems, remittances, or money sent to the home country by migrants, is collected as aggregate data, and it is therefore not possible to obtain a statistical understanding of how much money is being sent for specific purposes. This thesis explores the practice of making IFTs within one group of Australian citizens - Filipino migrants. Filipinos are one of the more numerous recent groups migrating to Australia from within its own geographic region, are known to send IFTs home, and are known to have good English skills that will facilitate research participation. The exploratory study uses in-depth interviews with a purposive, cross-sectional sample of 20 permanent Filipino migrants (10 female and 10 male). The interviews explore participants’ current practices of sending money home to older relatives, the influences and motivation to send money over the life cycle, and the perceptions of the impacts of the practice on themselves and recipients. A thematic analysis of the transcribed data shows that sending money home is not only a migrant activity, since more than half the participants sent money home to parents before migrating to Australia. It also shows that this sample did not migrate to Australia primarily to make remittances, but for some, migration made it possible to do so. Cultural factors were the main motivation for making IFTs, followed by socio-economic circumstances of parents, and family values. No participant would consider abandoning their commitment and those who experienced difficulty in making IFTs over the life cycle were prepared to sell items or take out loans to continue their practice. The data analysis also showed that as well as females sending on average $ 500 per annum and males $ 1, 000 per annum as cash or cheques through agents or banks, participants also purchased other one-off items, and sent substantial amounts of money for various emergency situations. Participants provided other forms of caregiving including practical care, gave ongoing psychological and emotional support, and sent large packages of goods home, thereby assisting parents with a wider variety of personal caregiving. On occasion participants co-operated with their siblings to provide a wider framework of family caregiving for their parents. IFTs are an important component of support for older people in many developing countries, and are made without expectation of financial return. The data showed that the practice of making IFTs was problematic for some participants at different stages of the life cycle. Because of the strong cultural values and obligations underpinning the practice, participants sometimes felt pressure to make IFTs from potential savings when, for example, school-age family expenses were high and had to be met; some women in their intercultural marriages who were unable to meet IFTs from their own earnings as their preferred option had to negotiate IFTs from household income. The thesis builds knowledge in the area of intergenerational financial transfers, transnational families and transnational caregiving for older people. It also adds depth {{to the understanding of the}} caregiving responsibilities and commitments to older people of some Australian citizens. This research adds an understanding of the practice of one group of migrants who send money home to ageing parents in the 21 st century. It provides insight into current processes and practices and points to areas of policy where migrant Australian citizens might receive greater recognition for observing cultural obligations to care for parents and older relatives...|$|E

If factors for benefit eligibility or its termination (for example, number of children, end of unemployment, end of sickness, or end of life) cannot be properly observed abroad, however, then exportability of social benefits may become restricted. Furthermore, acquired rights based on contribution financing have a major savings component that by itself is not easily established; consequently, neither is the correct amount due for transfer. Even if acquired rights are fully aligned with individual contribution efforts, social benefits typically contain often a major redistributive component that is difficult to establish; even more difficult is determining how much to transfer across borders or to be repaid.|$|R

30|$|This study {{extends the}} {{empirical}} {{evidence in this}} literature in two ways. First, most studies have used cross-sectional data in analysing {{the economic impact of}} diversity. We use a large longitudinal data that allows us to investigate this relationship accounting for variation over time.

More than 19  % of the overseas-born population, aged 5  years and over, speak a language other than English at home (ABS 2012 b). Yet, the economic impact of this diversity has yet to be investigated.

In this paper, we focus explicitly {{on the impact of}} cultural diversity among migrant employees on the innovativeness of firms. We briefly synthesize empirical evidence from a range of contexts across Europe, North America, and New Zealand. We then utilize two unique and harmonized linked employer-employee datasets to provide comparative microeconometric evidence for Germany and the Netherlands. Our panel datasets contain detailed information on the generation of new products and services, determinants of innovation success, and the composition of employment in establishments of firms over the period 1999 to 2006. We find that innovation in both countries is predominantly determined by establishment size and industry. Moreover, obstacles encountered and organizational changes faced by firms drive innovation too. With respect to the composition of employment, the presence of high-skilled staff is most important. Cultural diversity of employees has a positive partial correlation with product innovation. The size and statistical significance of this effect depends on the econometric model specification and the country considered. We conclude from the literature synthesis and the new comparative evidence that cultural diversity of employees can make a positive, but modest and context dependent, contribution to innovation...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} people who are living outside their country of birth has been {{increasing}} rapidly in recent decades to some 200 million globally. The arrival of a growing number of legal and illegal migrants has raised concerns in host countries about the 'absorption capacity' of the labour market. This has fuelled extensive empirical research, not only in traditional <b>migrant-receiving</b> <b>countries,</b> but also in other high and middle income countries that attract migrants. Studies have been undertaken previously to synthesize the conclusions of this empirical research by means of formal meta-analyses of the impact of immigration on the wages of native workers and on the level of employment (Longhi et al., 2005, 2007). While these studies have shown that the labour market impacts in terms of wages and employment are rather small, the sample of studies available to generate comparable effect sizes has been severely limited by heterogeneity in study approaches, ranging from the econometric analysis of cross-regional differences to general equilibrium models and time-series approaches. In this paper we take a more qualitative approach that considers a broad range of impacts, consisting of effects on wages, employment, unemployment and labour force participation. By trichotomizing outcomes simply as a positive, negative or indiscernible impact, a relatively large database can be constructed for meta-analysis. Techniques such as ordered probit regression modelling allow an assessment of the relationship between study conclusions and key study characteristics such as type of country, methodology, period of investigation and migrant group...|$|R
40|$|Policy {{makers in}} <b>migrant-receiving</b> <b>countries</b> must often strike a {{delicate}} balance between economic needs, that would dictate {{a substantial increase in}} the number of foreign workers, and political and electoral imperatives, that typically result in highly restrictive immigration policies. Promoting integration of migrants into the host country would go a long way in alleviating the trade off between economic and political considerations. While there is a large literature on the economic assimilation of immigrants, somewhat less attention has been devoted to other - and equally crucial - dimensions of migrants' integration, namely the process of social assimilation. The aim of this paper is to take a close look at migrants' social integration into the host country. We rely on the European Community Household panel (ECHP), which devotes a full module to the role and relevance of social relations for both migrants and natives. An innovative feature of this analysis is that it relies on migrants perceptions about their integration rather than as is typically the case in most opinion surveys on natives attitudes toward migrants. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, migrants particularly from non EU origins - are at a disadvantage in the fields of social relations. Even after controlling for their individual characteristics, such as age, education, family size, and employment status, they tend to socialize less than natives. Second, migrants tend to converge, albeit quite slowly, to the standard of natives. This finding highlights the risks of short term migration, where migrants tend to be constantly marginalized. Third, education has a significant impact on the type of social activities that individuals undertake. More educated people tend to relate somewhat less with their close neighbourhood, but quite intensively with the broader community. The implication for policy makers concerned about the creation of ethnic enclaves is to promote education among immigrants' community...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decades, {{international}} migration has assumed much prominence. Manifested in flows of permanent settlers, asylum seekers, refugees, contract workers and undocumented migrants, the global stock of international migrants has increased steadily. The current stock of international migrants ranges from 130 to 145 million. The experience with international migration is common among all geographical regions; varying only in level, type, proportion of population, and {{the duration of}} migration. ^ International migration has raised much concern among both labor-sending and labor-receiving <b>countries.</b> <b>Migrant-receiving</b> <b>countries</b> are increasingly concerned about the adverse affects of large scale migration, perceived diminished capacity to absorb additional migrants, impact on cultural homogeneity and the law and order situation, and the effects on job conditions of unskilled workers. The loss of professional and technical people, leading to a decrease in native talent {{to participate in the}} global system, is a major concern among labor-sending countries. ^ Apprehensive of various adverse effects, policy planners in labor-sending countries have focused a considerable amount of attention on the use of trade, aid, and investment as disincentives to migration. These policies are aimed at creating greater and better job opportunities in-migrant sending countries, reducing wage differentials, paving the way for long-term development. Underlying these issues has been the assumption that trade is a substitute for migration, and that aid and investments are adequately and appropriately geared to economic development. Past experience has, however, demonstrated that such assumptions do not always hold in reality. Factor prices, therefore, do not necessarily equalize following trade; official development assistance is inadequate and caters to domestic interest groups; and foreign investment does not create jobs for those prone to migration. ^ A widely held contrary view is now emerging where international migration is seen as being a complement to commodity trade. Migrants bring with them not only new skills and training, but, also, food habits, tastes, cultural values, and individual preferences. Their presence abroad creates a new export market for labor-exporting countries. In free economies, market forces respond to such preferences, and the desired goods get imported. A casual look at shops and market places in areas with a concentration of migrant populations testifies to the existence of such a complementarity between international and migration. ^ This study has been an attempt towards understanding and explaining the role of international migration as a complement to trade. Based on the experience of Bangladesh, it has been demonstrated that complementarity between international migration exists with respect to the export of items such as fish, vegetables, fruits, feature films, books, magazines, handicrafts, ceramic products, etc. Broadly, these refer to export items such as food, clothing and apparel, recreational and household items. ^ Such a complementarity is re-enforced by the level, concentration and composition of migrants, as well as the duration of the process of migration. A greater concentration of migrants at a particular location helps market development; longer duration enables a gradual broadening of commodity composition of exports. The migration-trade link is also affected by trade policies pursued by both the labor sending and labor receiving countries. A liberal trade policy {{on the part of a}} labor-receiving country is fundamental. However, from a labor sending country 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, trade liberalization, deregulation of restrictive measures and the development of transportation links encourage migration and trade linkages.

30|$|Portability of {{pensions}} {{means that}} income generated {{in one country}} is transferred to another country, not dissimilar to remittances sent from <b>migrant-receiving</b> to migrant-sending <b>countries,</b> that is, a shift in purchasing power (Jousten 2012). It corresponds to the export of factor income (labor income for unfunded pensions and capital income for funded pensions) from the factor-using to the factor-providing country. If the pension benefit design is actuarially fair, then neither the transfer of acquired rights nor benefits in disbursement impede fiscal fairness. This may, however, be the case when the benefits contain significant distributive design components that are also transferred or in case of significant differences in life expectancy among socioeconomic groups that disadvantage lower-income groups, such as migrants, {{that would not be}} compensated. At the moment, the size of such unintended transfer components is unknown, as {{is the extent to which}} they may cancel out. The lack of a BSSA and thus portability of pension benefits clearly fiscally profits the host country—as no benefits are paid to return migrants and prior contributions were cashed—while the home country is fiscally hurt as it may have to compensate for the lack of portable old-age pensions through own and locally financed assistance benefits.|$|R
