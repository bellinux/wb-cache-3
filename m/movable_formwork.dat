50|$|Goldicott was Brisbane's first poured {{concrete}} house, {{constructed in the}} monolithic, or one stone, process, using Depree's patented system of <b>movable</b> <b>formwork</b> and apparently built to his design. Contractors Rose and James were employing the technique for the first time.|$|E
50|$|The early {{section of}} the house is {{constructed}} of mass concrete prepared in situ and cast with the specially devised <b>movable</b> <b>formwork.</b> The early concrete foundations have recently been underpinned. The external faces of the concrete walls on the verandah are rendered and scoured in imitation of ashlar stonework, whilst other external faces are plain rendered.|$|E
40|$|Thc develoment of {{tailor made}} {{materials}} {{by using a}} performance based approach are attracting research interest in different construction areas due to the advantages of having solutions that should perform according to the specified needs. If focus is put on concrete and on the fitness of Its functional requirements. the rational procedure would be to state the required main structural, durability and executíon indicators (PI) and subindicators (PSI). i. e. mechanical strength al different age or service life age with no major maintenance or execution ditficulties. This paper deals with the design and evaluation criteria undertaken {{to the production of}} a tailor made concrete solution in order to allow a new designed autonomous tunnelling machines using a <b>movable</b> <b>formwork</b> [1] to hold to this concrete lining and continue with the excavation in a continuous concreting process.

40|$|Formwork is {{a common}} system of {{elements}} and details which provides the necessary forms for monolithic structures. Efficiency of formwork is constantly increasing and more advanced formwork technologies are discovered; therefore, this improvement may speed up the construction installation time and positively influence the cost of installation. Proper choice of formwork systems {{is a key to}} a successful project. The aim of the master thesis is to analyse the appropriateness of sliding formworks compared with an alternative type of <b>movable</b> <b>formwork.</b> The study describes sliding and movable formworks. The study uses the construction indicators of the silo tower installed in the year 2011 in sliding formwork. It is compared with the movable formworks with working platforms system from Doka. After the calculations, installation of a building with different formwork systems is compared. The height from which it is appropriate to use sliding formwork was found. Various price components were compared. Construction costs and unit rates change depending on height charts were created...|$|E
40|$|The {{crossing}} of rivers in Katanga (Democratic Republic of Congo) by railway {{lines in the}} 1920 s and 1930 s gave Belgian engineers and contractors the opportunity to build record spans for railway bridges. The {{crossing of}} the Lualaba River at Bukama consists of four Vierendeel steel girders each with a 62 m span, which were the largest of their type {{at the time of}} their erection in 1925. The crossing of the Lualaba at Kongolo, built in 1937 – 1939, required a 495 m long reinforced concrete continuous beam bridge with 14 spans, the largest measuring 70 m. It was the first significant concrete beam bridge constructed with a travelling gantry supporting <b>movable</b> <b>formwork.</b> The crossing of the Lukaga River (1938 – 1939) is a three-span concrete bridge with the 70 m long central span built using the cantilever method, which makes this bridge the oldest of its type in the world. This paper highlights the landmark characteristic of these forgotten bridges. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The present diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{planning}} of a composite railway bridge. The planning has been pursued {{in accordance with the}} European standard Eurocode, where the national appendix has been taken into consideration. Since no real bridge has been taken into account, the outline has been chosen in the way that it represents the construction as near to the real conditions as possible. The bridge covers three fields and spans a river with the length of 70 m. Two railways tracks are planned on the bridge with standard and heavy-weight railway traffic. The bridge is located on the railway line Ormoţ–Pragersko, in the North-East of Slovenia. A thorough analysis of the construction stage has been made which covers incremental launching of main steel girders over the whole span and furthermore pouring of the concrete plate on the <b>movable</b> <b>formwork.</b> During the operation phase all essential variable influences on the bridge have been taken into account. However, no earthquake and fatigue analyses have been taken into consideration. The diploma thesis aims amongst others at testing the adequacy of the commercial programme SOFiSTiK for the advanced construction analysis. In the appendices to this thesis the explanation of some of the programme functions is given. The Appendix A covers the description and use of the CSM (Construction Stage Manager) module to perform the calculation of the construction phases. In addition, the ELLA (Extended Live Load Analysis) module which covers the calculation of the traffic influence on the bridge is described in the Appendix B...|$|E
