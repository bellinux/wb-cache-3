25|$|It {{approached}} the de Havilland Aircraft Company which prepared a {{design for a}} twin-engined biplane of metal construction, resembling a smaller version of the de Havilland Hercules to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification,</b> designated de Havilland DH.67. However, de Havilland was busy with production of the Hercules and DH.60 Moth and in November 1928 it transferred the project to Gloster Aircraft Company.|$|E
25|$|First {{flying at}} the Parnall factory in Yate, Bristol, in 1935 with Captain Howard John Saint at the controls, {{it was not}} {{delivered}} for evaluation by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Martlesham Heath until early 1936. The biplane Vickers Type 253 had already been selected to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> and then cancelled when the Ministry saw that Vickers monoplane alternative to the Type 253 was superior and that entered service as the Vickers Wellesley.|$|E
25|$|The B.19/27 {{specification}} {{meant that}} the Vickers submission would be tested competitively in trials against other manufacturer's designs. In the redesign to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification,</b> the B.19/27 project took the Virginia Mark X all moving rudder together with an all-moving tailplane. Three designs were submitted in total; two biplanes with Jupiter and geared Bristol Mercury engines respectively and a monoplane version. The Mercury-engined design, the Vickers Type 150 was selected by the Ministry for consideration and building, now to be funded by the Ministry, started. Partway through {{it was agreed that}} an alternative engine was allowable, the Rolls-Royce F.XIV (later developed into the Rolls-Royce Kestrel).|$|E

40|$|As a reminder, Software Testing {{is about}} both verifying that {{software}} <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> and also validating that <b>the</b> software system <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> business requirements (PMBOK Guide 4 th Ed.). Most {{of the activity}} of the software testing teams attempts to verify that <b>the</b> code <b>meets</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification.</b> A small amount of Validation occurs during User Acceptance Testing, at which point it is normal to discover many issues where the system does not do what the user needs or wants. It is only too clear that current approaches to software testing do not, so far, guarantee successful systems development and implementation...|$|R
25|$|On 5 May 1953, an {{advisory}} design conference was hosted at the Ministry of Supply, {{which focused on}} the Saunders-Roe submission; three days later, a formal contract {{for the production of}} three prototypes was received by Saunders-Roe. However, due to doubts within the RAF and the Ministry over the correct fuel/motor combination to select for the interceptor intended to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>Specification,</b> it was decided to issue a modified specification, which was later led to a development contract, for the competing Avro 720 aircraft as well. Of the six companies that decided to tender proposals, two were selected for development contracts: Avro with their Avro 720 and Saunders-Roe with the SR.53.|$|E
25|$|The Miles Aircraft {{company had}} its {{beginnings}} in the 1920s {{and made a}} name for itself during the 1930s by producing affordable ranges of innovative light aircraft, perhaps the best known amongst these being the Miles Magister and Miles Master trainers, large numbers of both types seeing heavy use by the RAF for fighter pilot training. Although the company's products were relatively low-technology trainers and light aircraft, and did not include any jet-propelled aircraft, Miles had a good relationship with the Air Ministry and the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), and had submitted several proposals for advanced aircraft in response to ministry specifications. Miles was invited to undertake a top-secret project to meet with the requirements of Specification E.24/43; thus begin Miles' involvement in high speed aviation. The decision to involve the company has been alleged to have been partially in order to resolve a dispute about a separated contract that had been allegedly mishandled by the Ministry of Aircraft Production; Woods states that the Minister of Aircraft Production Sir Stafford Cripps had been impressed by Miles' designs and development team and thus favoured it to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification.</b>|$|E

25|$|The early {{development}} stages validated the basic design concept, but many studies {{were required to}} <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specifications</b> which included fuel consumption (SFC), engine pressure ratio, weight/size and turbine entry temperature.|$|R
25|$|Despite this {{remarkable}} flight, the R.VI did not <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specifications</b> issued by <b>the</b> Idflieg in its contract with Siemens-Schuckert. Therefore, the Idflieg opted to relax <b>the</b> original <b>specifications</b> somewhat and complete {{the purchase of}} the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Formal {{circuit design}} usually {{involves}} {{a number of}} stages. Sometimes, a design specification is written after liaising with the customer. A technical proposal may be written to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> requirements of <b>the</b> customer <b>specification.</b> <b>The</b> next stage involves synthesising on paper a schematic circuit diagram, an abstract electrical or electronic circuit that will <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specifications.</b> A calculation of the component values to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> operating <b>specifications</b> under specified conditions should be made. Simulations may be performed to verify the correctness of the design.|$|R
50|$|Most British {{manufacturers}} provided {{their own}} suggestions for planes that would <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification.</b> At {{the same time}} the engine manufacturers were encouraged to develop the necessary powerplants. These included the de Havilland Gyron and Rolls-Royce RB.106.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s the British issued a {{specification}} (F.20/27) for a short-range fast-climbing daylight interceptor. The de Havilland DH.77 and Vickers Jockey monoplanes were among seven designs tendered to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> but neither went into production, the heavier but faster biplane Hawker Fury being preferred.|$|E
50|$|A {{production}} concern also {{plagued the}} industry when moving the oxide VCSELs from {{research and development}} to production mode. The oxidation rate of the oxide layer was highly dependent on the aluminium content. Any slight variation in aluminium would change the oxidation rate sometimes resulting in apertures that were either too big or too small to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> standards.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} early British {{destroyer}} classes, the Admiralty invited specialist private firms {{to submit their}} own designs for destroyers which would <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification.</b> The idea was to use the builders' knowledge of building small, fast, ships to help cram powerful machinery into a small hull. For this reason, details of the hull and internal arrangements differed between ships in the class.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{non-uniformity}} during {{temperature cycling}} contributes to variability in PCR and, unfortunately, some thermocyclers do not <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>specifications</b> claimed by manufacturers.

50|$|On 12 June 1934, at the {{conclusion}} of test flying, the Knuckleduster was flown to Felixstowe for official trials with the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE).

In October 1934 the boat was returned to Rochester for repair following an accident - a collision with another flying-boat. It was repaired and several modification incorporated before it returned to Felixstowe in March 1935.|$|E
50|$|Three {{prototype}}s were ordered, {{the first}} prototype J7508 {{made its first}} flight in 1925 from RAF Andover, with Captain Frank Courtney as the test pilot.

After evaluation the Yeovil and Berkley were not ordered into production, the Horsley had already been given a contract against a different specification.
