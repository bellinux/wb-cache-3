5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from <b>mechanical</b> <b>wear</b> of existing volcanic rock.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of the mechanical}} system {{is the use of}} breaker points to interrupt the low-voltage high-current through the primary winding of the coil; the points are subject to <b>mechanical</b> <b>wear</b> where they ride the cam to open and shut, as well as oxidation and burning at the contact surfaces from the constant sparking. They require regular adjustment to compensate for wear, and the opening of the contact breakers, which is responsible for spark timing, is subject to mechanical variations.|$|E
25|$|Many PID loops {{control a}} {{mechanical}} device (for example, a valve). Mechanical maintenance {{can be a}} major cost and wear leads to control degradation {{in the form of}} either stiction or a deadband in the mechanical response to an input signal. The rate of <b>mechanical</b> <b>wear</b> is mainly a function of how often a device is activated to make a change. Where wear is a significant concern, the PID loop may have an output deadband to reduce the frequency of activation of the output (valve). This is accomplished by modifying the controller to hold its output steady if the change would be small (within the defined deadband range). The calculated output must leave the deadband before the actual output will change.|$|E
500|$|As a {{development}} of the Nclass, the N1class represented the next step forward for the British 2-6-0 concept, creating a capable workhorse equally adept at hauling passenger and freight traffic. The prototype proved economical in service as it used 10percent less coal than the Nclass, but used 11percent more water. However, the N1 design proved capable of fast speeds; No.822 reached [...] during trials between Charing Cross and Tonbridge in 1923. Once run-in, No.822 became popular amongst its regular crews as they favoured the way the three cylinders balanced cyclic forces on the driving axle. This resulted in improved riding characteristics on the footplate at low speeds whilst reducing <b>mechanical</b> <b>wear</b> {{and the effect of}} hammerblow on the track. The Holcroft valve gear also meant that No.822 was a comparatively light locomotive that could be used on weight-restricted routes.|$|E

Holcroft incorporated a new method of driving the middle cylinder from the right-hand set of the two outside Walschaerts valve gear without the need to use a separate set of valve gear between the frames, saving overall weight.

2500|$|Keytops are an {{important}} element of keyboards. In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a [...] "dish shape" [...] on top, like typewriters before them. Keyboard key legends must be extremely durable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme <b>mechanical</b> <b>wear</b> from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by two-shot (or double-shot, or two-color) molding, where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to save cost, other methods were explored, such as sublimation printing and laser engraving, both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time.|$|E

40|$|The heat {{treatment}} and carburization has been acknowledged by some means {{of improving the}} various properties of metals and alloys. In the present investigation the <b>mechanical</b> and <b>wear</b> behaviours of mild steels carburized at different temperature range of 850, 900 and 9500 C have been studied and {{it is found that}} the simple {{heat treatment}} greatly improves the hardness, tensile strength and wear resistance of the mild steels. The aim has been {{to examine the effects of}} these different carburization temperatures and conditions on the <b>mechanical</b> and <b>wear</b> properties of the carburized mild steels. For above purpose firstly the mild steels are carburized under the different temperature range as stated above and then it is tempered at 2000 C for half an hour after this the carburized and tempered mild steels are subjected for different kind of test such as abrasive wear test, hardness test, tensile test and the toughness test. The results of these experiment shows that the process of carburization greatly improves the <b>mechanical</b> and <b>wear</b> properties like hardness, tensile strength and wear resistance and these properties increases with increase in the carburization temperature but apart from this the toughness property decreases and it is further decreases with increase in carburization temperature. The experimental results also shows that the mild steels carburized under different temperature range as stated above, with in which the mild steels carburized at the temperature of 9500 C gives the best results for the different kinds of <b>mechanical</b> and <b>wear</b> properties because at this temperature it gives highest tensile strength, hardness and wear resistance, so it must be preferred for the required applications...|$|R
