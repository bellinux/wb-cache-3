25|$|Intravenous <b>melarsoprol</b> was {{previously}} the standard treatment for second-stage (neurological phase) disease and is effective for both types. <b>Melarsoprol</b> {{is the only}} treatment for second stage T. b. rhodesiense; however, it causes death in 5% of people who take it. Resistance to <b>melarsoprol</b> can occur.|$|E
25|$|The organoarsenical <b>melarsoprol</b> (Arsobal) {{developed}} in the 1940s is effective for patients with second-stage sleeping sickness. However, 3–10% of those injected have reactive encephalopathy (convulsions, progressive coma, or psychotic reactions), and 10–70% of such cases result in death; it can cause brain damage in those who survive the encephalopathy. However, due to its effectiveness, <b>melarsoprol</b> is still used today. Resistance to <b>melarsoprol</b> is increasing, and combination therapy with nifurtimox is currently under research.|$|E
25|$|The related drug <b>Melarsoprol</b> {{is still}} in use against late-state African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), despite its high {{toxicity}} and possibly fatal side effects.|$|E
25|$|For T. b. gambiense the {{combination}} of nifurtimox and eflornithine (NECT) or eflornithine alone {{appear to be more}} effective and result in fewer side effects. These treatments may replace <b>melarsoprol</b> when available with {{the combination}} being first line. NECT has the benefit of requiring less injections of eflornithine.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{drugs are}} toxic {{in their own}} right in {{therapeutic}} doses because of their mechanism of action. Alkylating antineoplastic agents, for example, cause DNA damage, which is more harmful to cancer cells than regular cells. However, alkylation causes severe side-effects and is actually carcinogenic in its own right, with potential to lead to the development of secondary tumors. In similar manner, arsenic-based medications like <b>melarsoprol</b> for trypanosomiasis can cause arsenic poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Prevention {{of severe}} disease {{involves}} screening {{the population at}} risk with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or suramin. Treatment of the second stage involves eflornithine {{or a combination of}} nifurtimox and eflornithine for TbG. While <b>melarsoprol</b> works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E
500|$|Arsenic is {{notoriously}} poisonous {{and may also}} be an essential element in ultratrace amounts. During World War I, both sides used [...] "arsenic-based sneezing and vomiting agents…to force enemy soldiers to remove their gas masks before firing mustard or phosgene at them in a second salvo." [...] It {{has been used as}} a pharmaceutical agent since antiquity, including for the treatment of syphilis before the development of antibiotics. Arsenic is also a component of <b>melarsoprol,</b> a medicinal drug used in the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness. In 2003, arsenic trioxide (under the trade name Trisenox) was re-introduced for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Arsenic in drinking water, which causes lung and bladder cancer, has been associated with a reduction in breast cancer mortality rates.|$|E

50|$|<b>Melarsoprol</b> is {{produced}} by Sanofi-Aventis and under an agreement with WHO, they donate <b>melarsoprol</b> to countries where the disease is common.|$|E
50|$|The {{half-life}} of <b>melarsoprol</b> is {{less than}} one hour, but bioassays indicate a 35-hour half-life. This is commonly associated with pharmacologic agents that have active metabolites. One such metabolite, Mel Ox, reaches maximum plasma levels about 15 minutes after <b>melarsoprol</b> injection. <b>Melarsoprol</b> clearance is 21.5 ml/min/kg and the Mel Ox half-life is approximately 3.9 hours.|$|E

5000|$|Although <b>melarsoprol</b> cures about 96% {{of people}} with late stage disease, its {{toxicity}} limits its use. About 1-5% of people die from adverse events related to <b>melarsoprol</b> treatment. As a toxic organic compound of arsenic, <b>melarsoprol</b> is a dangerous treatment that is typically only administered by injection {{under the supervision of}} a licensed physician. Notable side effects are similar to arsenic poisoning. Among clinicians, it is colloquially referred to as [...] "arsenic in antifreeze". Severe and life-threatening adverse reactions are associated with <b>melarsoprol.</b> It is known to cause a range of side effects including convulsions, fever, loss of consciousness, rashes, bloody stools, nausea and vomiting. In approximately 5-10% of cases, it causes encephalopathy. Of those, about 50% die due to encephalopathy-related adverse reactions. Additional potentially serious side effects of <b>melarsoprol</b> include damage to the heart, presence of albumin in the urine that could be associated with kidney damage, and an increase in blood pressure.|$|E

50|$|Eflornithine is also {{effective}} {{in combination with}} other drugs, such as <b>melarsoprol</b> and nifurtimox. A study in 2005 compared the safety of eflornithine alone to <b>melarsoprol</b> and found eflornithine to be more effective and safe in treating second-stage sleeping sickness Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. Eflornithine is not {{effective in}} the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense due to the parasite's low sensitivity to the drug. Instead, <b>melarsoprol</b> is used to treat Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Another randomized control trial in Uganda compared the efficacy of various combinations of these drugs and found that the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination was the most promising first-line theory regimen.|$|E
50|$|Nifurtimox {{has also}} been used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), and is active in {{the second stage of}} the disease (central nervous system involvement). When {{nifurtimox}} is given on its own, about half of all patients will relapse, but the combination of <b>melarsoprol</b> with nifurtimox appears to be efficacious. Trials are awaited comparing melarsoprol/nifurtimox against <b>melarsoprol</b> alone for African sleeping sickness.|$|E
50|$|Routine {{laboratory}} testing is needed {{before and after}} <b>melarsoprol</b> initiation. Laboratory parameters for both therapeutic effects and toxic effects need to be evaluated.|$|E
50|$|Sanofi: A French {{multinational}} {{pharmaceutical company}} headquartered in Paris will extend its existing donation of eflornithine, <b>melarsoprol</b> and pentamidine for treating sleeping sickness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melarsoprol</b> is a {{treatment}} {{used during the}} second stage of the disease. So far, it is the only treatment available for late-stage T. b. rhodesiense.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melarsoprol</b> {{has been}} used {{medically}} since 1949. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. In regions of the world where the disease is common, <b>melarsoprol</b> is provided for free by the World Health Organization. It is not commercially available in Canada or the United States. In the United States, it may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in Canada it is available from Health Canada.|$|E
50|$|Two arsenic-containing {{stereoisomers}} {{exist in}} a 3:1 molar ratio. Since melarsarprol is insoluble in water, dosage occurs via a 3.6% propylene glycol intravenous injection. To avoid the risk of injection site reactions, <b>melarsoprol</b> must be given slowly.|$|E
50|$|Currently, <b>melarsoprol</b> is not {{recommended}} for use in pregnant women. The World Health Organization suggests that treatment be deferred until immediately after delivery since {{the effects of the}} medication on the developing fetus have not yet been established.|$|E
50|$|After its {{introduction}} to {{the market in the}} 1980s, eflornithine has replaced <b>melarsoprol</b> as the first line medication against Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to its reduced toxicity to the host. Trypanosoma brucei resistant to eflornithine has been reported as early as the mid-1980s.|$|E
50|$|For T. b. gambiense the {{combination}} of nifurtimox and eflornithine (NECT) or eflornithine alone {{appear to be more}} effective and result in fewer side effects. These treatments may replace <b>melarsoprol</b> when available with {{the combination}} being first line. NECT has the benefit of requiring less injections of eflornithine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melarsoprol</b> is a {{medication}} {{used for the}} treatment of sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis). It is specifically used for second-stage disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense when the central nervous system is involved. For Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the medication eflornithine is usually preferred. It is given by injection into a vein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melarsoprol</b> is a prodrug, {{which is}} metabolized to melarsen oxide (Mel Ox) as its active form. Mel Ox is an arsen-oxide that irreversibly binds to vicinal {{sulfhydryl}} groups on pyruvate kinase, which disrupts energy {{production in the}} parasite. The inability to distinguish between host and parasites renders this drug highly toxic with many side effects.|$|E
50|$|Due to high toxicity, <b>melarsoprol</b> is {{reserved}} {{only for the}} most dangerous cases. Other agents associated with lower toxicity levels are used during stage 1 of the disease. The approval of the nifurtimox/eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) in 2009 {{for the treatment of}} T. b. gambiense limited the use of merlarsoprol in the treatment of second-stage T. b. rhodesiense.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{is often}} missed {{in the first}} phase of the disease due to {{non-specific}} nature of symptoms. Pentamidine and Suramin are used for treatment {{in the first phase}}. <b>Melarsoprol,</b> nifurtimox and eflornithine are drugs used in second phase of the disease. However none of the therapies available are optimal in terms of adverse events and ease of administration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melarsoprol</b> has a {{high number}} of side effects. Common side effects include brain dysfunction, numbness, rashes, and kidney and liver problems. In those with glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (G6PD) deficiency, red blood cell breakdown may occur. It has not been studied in pregnancy. It works by blocking pyruvate kinase, an enzyme required for the parasite to make adenosine triphosphate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melarsoprol</b> {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of African trypanosomiasis with CNS involvement is given under a complicated dosing schedule. The dosing schedule for children and adults is 2-3.6 mg/kg/day intravenously for three days, then repeated every seven days for a total of three series. To monitor for relapse, follow-up is recommended every 6 months for at least 2 years.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{warnings}} must {{be examined}} before <b>melarsoprol</b> treatment can be initiated. Prior to initiation, the following must be noted: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, kidney or liver disease, cardiac problems (high blood pressure, irregular beating {{of the heart}} or arrhythmias, any damage to the heart muscles and potential signs of heart failure), preexisting nervous system disorders, and any signs of leprosy.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Aventis and the WHO {{formed a}} five-year partnership, during {{which more than}} 320,000 vials of pentamidine, over 420,000 vials of <b>melarsoprol,</b> and over 200,000 bottles of {{eflornithine}} were produced by Aventis, {{to be given to}} the WHO and distributed by the association Médecins sans Frontières (also known as Doctors Without Borders) in countries where sleeping sickness is endemic.|$|E
50|$|Sleeping sickness, or trypanosomiasis, {{is treated}} with {{pentamidine}} or suramin (depending on subspecies of parasite) delivered by intramuscular injection {{in the first}} phase of the disease, and with <b>melarsoprol</b> and eflornithine intravenous injection in the second phase of the disease. Efornithine is commonly given in combination with nifurtimox, which reduces the treatment time to 7 days of eflornithine infusions plus 10 days of oral nifurtimox tablets.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{drugs are}} toxic {{in their own}} right in {{therapeutic}} doses because of their mechanism of action. Alkylating antineoplastic agents, for example, cause DNA damage, which is more harmful to cancer cells than regular cells. However, alkylation causes severe side-effects and is actually carcinogenic in its own right, with potential to lead to the development of secondary tumors. In similar manner, arsenic-based medications like <b>melarsoprol</b> for trypanosomiasis can cause arsenic poisoning.|$|E

While <b>melarsoprol</b> works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E
50|$|Blood {{analysis}} {{is used to}} detect the presence of trypanosomes. An evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid via a lumbar puncture {{is also used to}} determine an individual's white blood count and level of protein. These are diagnostic criteria such that the presence of trypanosomes, an elevated white blood count greater than five per microliter, or a protein content greater than 40 mg are considered abnormal and initiation should be considered. Continuous cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should be repeated every six months {{for at least three years}} in individuals that have undergone <b>melarsoprol</b> treatment.|$|E
