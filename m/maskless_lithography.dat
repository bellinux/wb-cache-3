Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes {{as small as a}} few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of <b>maskless</b> <b>lithography,</b> in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate.

Recently, due to the unique advantages of a hemispherical image sensor, various methods have been proposed to implement optoelectronic devices on non-planar surfaces.

We used <b>maskless</b> laser-write <b>lithography</b> (LWL) system on a planar surface to demonstrate the feasibility of LWL in fabricating a-Si:H TFTs. We further develop necessary modifications of the LWL system for curved surface application. The fabricated a-Si:H TFTs with a channel length of 10 µm on a curved surface show acceptable electrical performance as a pixel switch. A high level-to-level alignment accuracy (< ± 2 µm) is achieved. The variations of electrical parameters over different curved locations are not significant. Extensive study of the a-Si:H TFTs threshold voltage shift (ΔVth) is conducted under prolonged bias-temperature stress condition. Metal interconnect lines over the transition between curved and flat surfaces of a single substrate is demonstrated, which is necessary for placing contact pads on the flat area.

40|$|In this chapter, the {{versatility}} of poly(ferrocenylsilanes) (PFSs) as resists in reactive {{ion etching}} (RIE) for nanofabrication is presented. PFSs, belonging to the class of organometallic polymers, possess skeletal ferrocene and alkylsilane units which provide these solution-processable materials with a very high RIE resistance. First, it is shown that among the different paths for synthesizing PFS, anionic polymerization creates an opportunity to produce well-defined PFSs with a targeted molar mass and low polydispersity. Block copolymers and more complex structures can also be realized, which leads to exciting openings in <b>maskless</b> self-assembly <b>lithography</b> for nanopatterning. Then, optimization of the etching process, aimed at maximizing aspect ratios for PFS-based resists, is discussed.

40|$|<b>Maskless</b> optical <b>lithography</b> is a {{technique}} for writing patterns into an optically sensitive material (photoresist) {{without the use of}} a photomask. The patterning process involves exposing selected areas of the photoresist film to the sensitizing light to produce the desired pattern. Unfortunately, the exposure pattern required to produce the desired pattern (output) is not a simple function of the desired pattern due to the geometric properties and focusing limits of the optical beam. Thus, we seek {{a technique}} capable of generating an exposure pattern which will result in the desired pattern being transferred to the photoresist. This goal can be achieved by exploiting an inverse lithography technique (ILT) which has previously been used for mask design in micro-photolithography systems. The technique is carried out by interpreting process flow in terms of forward modelling and presenting a regularization term in a cost function of the optimization problem to approach an efficient solution. This reduction in computational complexity in parts of the optimization calculation, results in a much faster convergence than has been previously reported. Finally, the effectiveness of this method in terms of fidelity of the desired features and the time of the calculation are verified by computer simulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to improve the resolution of dynamic <b>maskless</b> holographic <b>lithography</b> (DMHL) by using two-photon absorption, to provide a more thorough characterization of the process, and to expand the functionality of the process by adding previously undemonstrated patterning modes. Two-photon DMHL will be performed in both 2 D and 3 D configurations with specific characterization relating to process resolution and repeatability. The physical limits of DMHL will be discussed and ways to circumvent them will be proposed and tested. DMHL eliminates the need for a separate mask for every different pattern exposure and allows for real-time shaping of the exposure pattern. It uses an electrically addressable spatial light modulator (SLM) to create an arbitrary intensity pattern at the specimen plane. The SLM is a phase mask that displays a hologram. An algorithm is used to find an appropriate phase hologram for each desired intensity pattern. Each pixel of the SLM shapes the wavefront of the incoming laser light so that the natural Fourier transforming property of a lens causes the desired image to appear in the specimen plane. The process enables one-off projects to be done without the cost of fabricating a mask, and makes it possible to perform lithography with fewer (or even no) moving parts...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in stimulated-emission depletion (STED) microscopy {{have led to}} a step change in the achievable resolution and allowed breaking the diffraction limit by large factors. The core principle is based on a reversible molecular switch, allowing for light-triggered activation and deactivation in combination with a laser focus that incorporates a point or line of zero intensity. In the past years, the concept has been transferred from microscopy to <b>maskless</b> laser <b>lithography,</b> namely direct laser writing (DLW), in order to overcome the diffraction limit for optical lithography. Herein, we propose and experimentally introduce a system that realizes such a molecular switch for lithography. Specifically, the population of intermediate-state photoenol isomers of α-methyl benzaldehydes generated by two-photon absorption at 700 nm fundamental wavelength can be reversibly depleted by simultaneous irradiation at 440 nm, suppressing the subsequent Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction which constitutes the chemical core of the writing process. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed mechanism for STED-inspired DLW by covalently functionalizing the surface of glass substrates via the photoenol-driven STED-inspired process exploiting reversible photoenol activation with a polymerization initiator. Subsequently, macromolecules are grown from the functionalized areas and the spatially coded glass slides are characterized by atomic-force microscopy. Our approach allows lines with a full-width-at-half-maximum of down to 60 nm and line gratings with a lateral resolution of 100 nm to be written, both surpassing the diffraction limit...|$|R

As the primary matrix, either nonsubstituted or oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) -substituted AT SAMs were used, targeting mixed SAMs of chemical and biological significance. To demonstrate {{the flexibility of the}} approach, UV light with two different wavelengths (254 and 375 nm) was used, applied to the nonsubstituted and OEG-substituted AT SAMs, respectively. The surface density of the chemically active azide groups embedded in the nonreactive primary matrix could be varied according to the composition of the mixed SAMs, as demonstrated by the subsequent click reaction between these SAMs and several representative functional moieties bearing a suitable group for the click reaction with azide. For the OEG-AT/C 12 N 3 films, this resulted in the preparation of templates for specific protein adsorption, comprising biotin-bearing moieties embedded in the protein-repelling OEG-AT matrix. The density of the biotin receptors was varied according to the density of the C 12 N 3 moieties. The templates exhibited much higher affinity to the specific protein (avidin) as compared to a nonspecific one. The surface density of avidin could be varied in accordance with the density of the biotin receptors, i. e., directly controlled by the UV dose within the UVPER procedure.
