5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} war resided in the candidacy of a Prussian prince to the throne of Spain –– France feared encirclement by an alliance between Prussia and Spain. The Hohenzollern prince's candidacy was withdrawn under French diplomatic pressure, but Otto von Bismarck goaded the French into declaring war by altering a telegram sent by William I. Releasing the Ems Telegram to the public, Bismarck <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if the king had treated the French envoy in a demeaning fashion. Six days later, France declared war on Prussia and Southern German States immediately sided with Prussia.|$|E
500|$|StarGate's Mikkel Eriksen told The New York Times that Blanco took a {{recorded}} snippet of Eriksen's singing, altered it electronically, and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "dirtier". He then applied timbre and used audio software to create ghostly accompaniment lines. Eriksen described Blanco's style as [...] "unorthodox, as he almost never plays the keyboards but throws in weird samples and alters {{them to the}} right pitch {{to go with the}} song." [...] Australian singer-songwriter Sia later joined them and wrote the lyrics for [...] "Diamonds" [...] in 14 minutes.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{budgetary}} restraints, Seventeen Seconds {{was recorded}} and mixed in seven {{days on a}} budget of between £2000 and £3000, {{which resulted in the}} band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Hedges and Robert Smith knew [...] "A Forest" [...] would take more work to complete than other songs on the album, and would require more overdubs. [...] "A Forest" [...] {{was one of the last}} tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts, then Smith's vocals. Fiction Records owner Chris Parry told Smith that the song had the potential to be a hit if they <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "radio friendly", but Smith refused, stating that the way the track sounded was the sound he envisioned in his head, dismissing concerns about radio friendliness. Work on mixing [...] "A Forest" [...] took up much of the final day of sessions for the album.|$|E
500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, {{but he gave}} {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E
500|$|The Orb {{has been}} a {{prolific}} remixing team, having completed over 80 commissioned remixes since 1989. Even during periods of label conflict and contractual limbo, the Orb found steady work remixing for artists including Depeche Mode, Lisa Stansfield, and Front 242. The Orb's remixes from the early and mid-1990s feature {{a large number of}} comical samples, Progressive-Sounds describe them as [...] "ahead of their time" [...] and NME notes them as [...] "not entirely incompatible with contemporary chilling." [...] Some pieces, such as their Bee Gees cover collaboration with Robbie Williams, received criticism for being [...] "beyond a joke" [...] for their use of strange noises. The Orb's remix of Nine Inch Nails' [...] "The Perfect Drug", too, was described as [...] "silly", as they <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like Trent Reznor was [...] "drowning in his bathtub". Though Paterson maintains that much of the Orb's remix work is done to support other artists, he admits some of their remixes for major artists were performed so that they could [...] "pay the bills".|$|E

500|$|Gotye was {{initially}} {{reported to have}} been unimpressed with the Glee rendition of his song, but later stated that his words had {{been taken out of}} context. On April 22, 2012, two Australian newspapers, the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Herald Sun, quoted him as having said, [...] "They did such a faithful arrangement of the instrumentals but the vocals were that pop Glee style". The Mail's quote continued after a comma with [...] "ultra-dry, sounded pretty tuned and the rock has no real sense, like it's playing to you from a cardboard box." [...] The Herald Sun's continuation of the quote came after a period: [...] "It <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> dinky and wrong." [...] Gotye said in an interview the next day that he had been referring to [...] "this xylophone hook in my song—it's kind of dinky not just in the cover version but the original song". He added, [...] "I thought it was really clever to transpose the song to two guys ... It was a great idea." [...] In an interview published ten days later, Glee executive music producer Adam Anders said that although the iTunes version of the song that the show released was [...] "very true" [...] to Gotye's, that in the episode itself, [...] "the reality is, it was drier".|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Chillin" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Steve Roberts from MTV praised Gaga's verse and for employing a similar singing style to M.I.A.. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard complimented the [...] "club-ready single" [...] for its [...] "bouncy hook and slick verses" [...] {{and called the}} song [...] "the perfect precursor to Wale's long-awaited debut". Mehan Jayasuriya from PopMatters commended the song for being a [...] "token party jam" [...] on the album track list. She added that [...] "for all the flack that the [...] has caught, it's still an indisputably catchy song, even if the 9th Wonder and Nick Catchdubs reworking from [...] Back to the Feature stands as the definitive version." [...] Andres Tardio from HipHopDX believed {{the composition of the}} song as [...] "Pop-friendly". A reviewer for XXL compared and described [...] "Chillin" [...] as [...] "distinctly D.C.-sounding anthem". David Jeffries from AllMusic praised Wale's [...] "natural delivery and quirky sense of humor" [...] in the song, likening his vocals to that of Jay-Z and Gaga's vocals to that of singer Rihanna. Describing [...] "Chillin" [...] as a [...] "club-friendly hopper", Chris Richards from The Washington Post believed that using Rihanna or M.I.A. on the track would have made it successful, rather than Gaga who was then considered a relatively unknown singer. Richards recalled a similar situation when Washington D.C. based go-go band Experience Unlimited had collaborated with androgynous singer Grace Jones on a track. Sobhi Youssef from Sputnikmusic noticed that the song's production <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like a different track than the rest of Attention Deficit.|$|E

500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, until you see your name on a paper or it actually happens and you have something in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's beyond me why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You can call me M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E

5000|$|Paul Temple's catchphrase, [...] "by Timothy", first {{occurred}} in episode {{two of the}} first ever serial, Send for Paul Temple.

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} in the United States was also largely positive following PBS' {{acquisition of the}} show. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times labelled the series as [...] "the best new show of the fall" [...] describing it as [...] "a rapturous mix of absurdly fairy-tale-romance and frantic modern complications, set in the picturesque drear of Yorkshire and brought to life by masterfully shaded performances." [...] She opined that Reid and Jacobi [...] "are capable of doing more with a startled look or careful smile... than most actors can do in seven pages of dialogue". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe acknowledged that the public might not find the series appealing based on its title and premise alone, stating that PBS' description of the programme <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "as saccharine and hackneyed as a Geritol commercial". Upon viewing the series however, he praised the added dimensions of the series and wrote that it was [...] "so much more interesting" [...] than the central premise suggested. He also felt that Walker and Lancashire played an important part; [...] "both add a necessary amount of bitter to the sweet". Mike Hale of The New York Times was more cynical about the series, describing it as a [...] "warm comforter of a series" [...] and [...] "treacle". However he felt that series also distinguished itself from this category of media by its [...] "relatively dry style and careful modulation of tone and volume" [...] in addition to [...] "a crackerjack cast".|$|E
2500|$|Musically, {{the wind}} quintets {{represent}} {{a more conservative}} trend in Reicha's oeuvre when compared to his earlier work, namely the compositions of the Viennese period. [...] In the quintets, as he describes in his Preface, Reicha wanted to expand the technical limits of the five still evolving wind instruments (hand horn, 'un-rationalised' flute and clarinet, double reeds with fewer keys) and thereby the ambitions of amateur wind players by establishing a nucleus for a corpus of substantial work like that available to string players (and consciously more serious than the Harmoniemusik of the last century). [...] His writing combines virtuoso display (often still very challenging today, yet idiomatic for each instrument), popular elements (from the comic opera his soloists played, from his Bohemian folk heritage, from the military background to his life – many marches and 'walking' themes and, {{in the last two}} quintets, fanfares), and his lifelong more academic interests in variation form and counterpoint. [...] Four of the quintets have Trios in Passacaglia form, the repeating theme however being on different instruments in each case so not necessarily in the bass. Berlioz says the quintets [...] "enjoyed a certain vogue in Paris for a number of years. They are interesting pieces but a little cold", while Louis Spohr, who was visiting Paris in 1820 and reserved judgment until he had heard several performed, assessed them in a letter home (which he included in his autobiography) as having too many ideas linked carelessly or not at all, but excelling in the Minuets where this charge does not apply. Spohr was generally impressed by the virtuosity of the wind soloists and was very pleased with their performance of his own piano and wind quintet. Berlioz also comments on two of the players (in other works): [...] ", the first flute...has to dominate...so he transposes the flute line up an octave, thus destroying the composer's intention" [...] (p. 56); of 's cor anglais playing he says (p. 23) [...] "However remarkable the singer...I {{find it hard to believe}} she can ever have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as natural and touching as it did on Vogt's instrument".|$|E

50|$|At over 3,000 pounds, the GT Hawk {{was a bit}} {{heavier than}} GM and Ford cars of its class and era, and any of these engines <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a <b>sound</b> performer; the stock 289 isn't a muscle engine by any definition, but it can get up to 18 mpg on the highway. The blown R-engines amplified the Hawk's {{performance}} capabilities, making those cars far more collectable. Despite the fact that Studebaker's V8 was a heavy engine for its size, the Hawk was, with the Super Hawk package, a car with surprisingly good handling for a contemporary American car.
