5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease</b> include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
30|$|Platinum-based doublet {{chemotherapy}} prolongs {{survival and}} improves {{quality of life}} in patients with a PS of 0 – 2. Chemotherapy should be initiated while the patient maintains a good PS (Reck et al. 2014). Such a recommendation is based on findings from previous trials on <b>metastatic</b> <b>diseases,</b> including both primary <b>metastatic</b> and relapsed <b>diseases</b> after local therapies.|$|R
40|$|<b>Metastatic</b> Crohn’s <b>disease,</b> {{in which}} non-caseating granulomatous {{infiltration}} {{of the skin}} occurs at sites separated from the gastro-intestinal tract by normal tissue, is the least common dermatologic manifestation of Crohn’s disease. We report a 15 -year-old girl with <b>metastatic</b> Crohn’s <b>disease</b> presenting as granulomatous vulvar papules and nodules with typical histopathologic features. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case of <b>metastatic</b> Crohn’s <b>disease</b> in Chinese children reported in the English medical literature...|$|R
40|$|Intravital imaging enables {{to study}} dynamic tumour–stroma {{interactions}} within primary and metastatic sites, including the lung. The combination of optical windows with specific molecular probes targeting the tumour microenvironment will provide {{new insights into}} prometastatic stromal interactions and lead to novel therapeutic strategies for <b>metastatic</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{demonstrated}} in the Table below, individuals with stage III and IV disease have a significant risk of dying from thyroid cancer. While many present with widely <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease,</b> an equal number evolve over years and decades from stage I or II disease. Physicians who manage thyroid cancer of any stage recognize that {{a small percentage of}} patients with low-risk thyroid cancer will progress to <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most deaths due to {{colon cancer}} are {{associated}} with <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease.</b> A gene that appears {{to contribute to the}} potential for <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease,</b> metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), has been isolated. It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and metastasis in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{patients}} with paraneoplastic DM generally have poor prognoses with treatment resistance. However, the present report demonstrates {{that there are}} several cases with good, long-term results with resection of <b>metastatic</b> <b>diseases.</b> It is important to check for the exacerbation of DM symptoms because this symptom sometimes appears to precede cancer relapse in the follow-up of {{patients with}} colorectal cancer and DM.|$|R
40|$|<b>Metastatic</b> Crohn's <b>disease</b> is an {{uncommon}} extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease. Its hallmark features include {{the presence of}} cutaneous noncaseating granulomas that are noncontiguous with the gastrointestinal tract or fistula.

40|$|<b>Metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> is {{the most}} common {{malignancy}} of bone, it is estimated that 70 % of all malignant bone tumors are metastatic in origin. At autopsy it has been reported between 30 to 85 % of patients who die from cancer show occult skeletal metastases. Bone is the third most common site of metastatic process after lung and liver. 80 % of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> arise from Ca of breast, prostate, lung, kidney and thyroid. Typical location are thoracolumbal spine, pelvis, ribs, skull and proximal of femur and humerus. Pathogenesis of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> had been explained by Paget’s “Seed and Soil” theory and Ewing’s circulatory theory. Diagnostic procedures include complete laboratory examination, diagnostic bone imaging, chest x-ray, total body scan, CT-scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis and confirmed by histopathological examination. Management of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> is palliative that includes : chemotherapy, radiotherapy, bisphosphonates and surgical treatment for impending / established pathologic fracture to alleviate pain, ease nursing and restore functional activity.

25|$|In <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease,</b> where {{cancer has}} spread beyond the prostate, {{removal of the}} {{testicles}} (called orchiectomy) may be done to decrease testosterone levels and control cancer growth. (See hormonal therapy, below).|$|E
25|$|In the {{advanced}} cancer setting, trastuzumab use {{in combination with}} chemotherapy can both delay cancer growth as well as improve the recipient's survival. Pertuzumab may work synergistically with trastuzumab on the expanded EGFR family of receptors, although it is currently only standard of care for <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bone pain due to <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease</b> {{is treated}} with opioid pain {{relievers}} such as morphine and oxycodone. External beam radiation therapy directed at bone metastases may provide pain relief. Injections of certain radioisotopes, such as strontium-89, phosphorus-32, or samarium-153, also target bone metastases and may help relieve pain.|$|E

We sought to estimate the current number of US adults with <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> using two large administrative data sets. Methods: Prevalence was estimated from a commercially insured cohort (ages 18 &ndash; 64 years, MarketScan database) and from a fee-for-service Medicare cohort (ages &ge; 65 years, Medicare 5 % database) with coverage on December 31, 2008, representing approximately two-thirds of the US population in each age group. We searched for claims-based evidence of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> from January 1, 2004, {{using a combination of}} relevant diagnosis and treatment codes. The number of cases in the US adult population was extrapolated from age- and sex-specific prevalence estimated in these cohorts. Results are presented for all cancers combined and separately for primary breast, prostate, and lung cancer. Results: In the commercially insured cohort (mean age = 42. 3 years [SD = 13. 1]), we identified 9505 patients (0. 052 %) with <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease.</b> Breast cancer was the most common primary tumor type (n = 4041). In the Medicare cohort (mean age = 75. 6 years [SD = 7. 8]), we identified 6427 (0. 495 %) patients with <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease.</b> Breast (n = 1798) and prostate (n = 1862) cancers were the most common primary tumor types. We estimate that 279, 679 (95 % confidence interval: 274, 579 &ndash; 284, 780) US adults alive on December 31, 2008, had evidence of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> in the previous 5 years. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers accounted for 68 % of these cases. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that approximately 280, 000 US adults were living with <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> on December 31, 2008. This likely underestimates the true frequency; not all cases of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> are diagnosed, and some diagnosed cases might lack documentation in claims data.

25|$|Surgery for metastatic disease: If <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease</b> {{is present}} {{surgical}} treatment may still a viable option. Radical and partial nephrectomy can still occur, {{and in some}} cases if the metastasis is small this can also be surgically removed.

25|$|Interestingly, {{there are}} case reports of rhabdoid carcinomas {{recurring}} after unusually long periods, which is {{unusual for a}} fast-growing, aggressive tumor type. One report described a very early stage patient whose tumor recurred 6 years after initial treatment.

25|$|A paraganglioma {{is a rare}} neuroendocrine {{neoplasm}} {{that may}} develop at various body sites (including the head, neck, thorax and abdomen). Unlike other types of cancer, there is no test that determines benign from malignant tumors; long-term followup is therefore recommended for all individuals with paraganglioma. Approximately 50% of patients with recurrent disease experience distant metastasis. The five-year survival {{in the setting of}} <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease</b> is 40% to 45%.|$|E
25|$|Breast cancer {{management}} takes {{different approaches}} depending on physical and biological {{characteristics of the}} disease, {{as well as the}} age, over-all health and personal preferences of the patient. Treatment types can be classified into local therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) and systemic treatment (chemo-, endocrine, and targeted therapies). Local therapy is most efficacious in early stage breast cancer, while systemic therapy is generally justified in advanced and <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease,</b> or in diseases with specific phenotypes.|$|E
30|$|<b>Metastatic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{occasionally}} occur {{decades after}} successful {{treatment of the}} primary tumor. It has been proposed that this latency period {{is due to a}} clinical phenomenon named tumor dormancy. Several researchers have advocated that the dormancy of such cells might be caused by a non-proliferating state or an arrest in the cell cycle which thus results in a prolonged G 0 phase [4]. However, these mechanisms including how these cells can then trigger proliferation have not yet been fully explored.|$|R
40|$|<b>Metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> puts an {{enormous}} burden on patients {{and health care}} resources. Disruption of normal bone homeostasis by bone metastases leads to troublesome skeletal complications, such as bone pain, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and spinal cord compression. Bisphosphonates are an effective treatment for skeletal complications. These agents act primarily by initiating biochemical processes that ultimately result in apoptosis of osteoclasts, {{but they also have}} a number of other antitumor functions (eg, inhibition of angiogenesis). At present, the most widely used bisphosphonates are oral clodronate and intravenous pamidronate and zoledronic acid. Although these agents are effective in reducing skeletal complications, they are associated with varying safety and convenience issues. More recently, the availability of ibandronate as intravenous and oral formulations represents a new alternative for the treatment of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease.</b> Further studies are necessary to establish the comparative benefits of bisphosphonates in <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1999, the British Association of Surgical Oncology (BASO) {{published}} its {{guidelines for}} the management of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> in breast cancer in the UK, highlighting the role of the orthopaedic surgeon {{as an integral part of}} the multidisciplinary team. AIM: To establish the workload to our department of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease.</b> METHODS: A prospective study was performed over a 6 -month period aiming to study factors affecting length of stay, whether BASO recommendations were being adhered to for <b>metastatic</b> breast <b>disease</b> and whether BASO recommendations could be extended to other forms of <b>metastatic</b> bone <b>disease.</b> RESULTS: 36 patients were referred to the orthopaedic department during the study period. The majority of the patients were referred as emergencies, 83 % of patients were seen by an orthopaedic consultant on the day of referral but only 27 % were seen by the orthopaedic cancer liaison consultant. Only 16 patients required a therapeutic operative intervention and length of in-patient stay was increased by not having a known primary carcinoma at admission. Patients with bone metastases discussed at the breast cancer multidisciplinary meeting were also studied as were patients with bone metastases presenting to the oncology service. It was found that there was little overlap between these groups and our study group. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Metastatic</b> bone <b>disease</b> does form a workload to the orthopaedic department and BASO recommendations are generally followed for breast disease. The BASO recommendations could be extended to other tumours; however, it should be recognised that there is a significant workload involved and a need for sufficient resources to allow a high quality and timely service...|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that when using CAPP-Seq on ctDNA it still currently not known whether ctDNA is released at equal rates from primary tumors and <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease,</b> so this should be taken into consideration. This could cause problems with determining tumor burden and clonal evolution if different tumors or clones are dying off and releasing their DNA at different rates. It is also unknown how tumor histology affects ctDNA release.|$|E
25|$|Another tumor-lysing {{virus that}} {{specifically}} targets tumor cells with an activated Ras pathway {{is a type}} II herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) based agent, designated FusOn-H2. Activating mutations of the Ras protein and upstream elements of the Ras protein {{may play a role}} in more than two-thirds of all human cancers, including most <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease.</b> Reolysin, a formulation of reovirus, and FusOn-H2 are currently in clinical trials or under development for the treatment of various cancers. In addition, a treatment based on siRNA anti-mutated K-RAS (G12D) called siG12D LODER is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (NCT01188785, NCT01676259).|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer {{survival}} varies {{significantly with}} subtype. Dysgerminomas {{have a very}} favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%. Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I. Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with <b>metastatic</b> <b>disease</b> can survive a decade or more. Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.|$|E
