50|$|The ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> are the world-wide most {{commonly}} used type of general-purpose <b>screw</b> <b>thread.</b> They {{were one of the}} first international standards agreed when the International Organization for Standardization was set up in 1947.|$|R
50|$|However, internationally, {{the metric}} system was eclipsing inch-based {{measurement}} units. In 1947, ISO was founded; and in 1960, the metric-based International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Système International) was created. With continental Europe {{and much of}} the rest of the world turning to SI and ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread,</b> the UK gradually leaned in the same direction. The ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> is now the standard that has been adopted worldwide and is slowly displacing all former standards, including UTS. In the U.S., where UTS is still prevalent, over 40% of products contain at least some ISO metric screw threads. The UK has completely abandoned its commitment to UTS in favour of ISO metric threads, and Canada is in between. Globalization of industries produces market pressure in favor of phasing out minority standards. A good example is the automotive industry; U.S. auto parts factories long ago developed the ability to conform to the ISO standards, and today very few parts for new cars retain inch-based sizes, regardless of being made in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|Computer case screws are the {{hardware}} used to secure {{parts of a}} PC to the case. Although there are numerous manufacturers of computer cases, they have generally used three thread sizes. The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) originates from the United States while the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> is standardized worldwide. In turn, these thread standards define preferred size combinations {{that are based on}} generic units—some on the inch and others on the millimeter.|$|E
50|$|The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) {{defines a}} {{standard}} thread form and series—along with allowances, tolerances, and designations—for screw threads {{commonly used in}} the United States and Canada. It is the main standard for bolts, nuts, and {{a wide variety of}} other threaded fasteners used in these countries. It has the same 60° profile as the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread,</b> but the characteristic dimensions of each UTS thread (outer diameter and pitch) were chosen as an inch fraction rather than a millimeter value. The UTS is currently controlled by ASME/ANSI in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Bolts {{have been}} defined as headed {{fasteners}} having external threads that meet an exacting, uniform bolt thread specification (such as ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> M, MJ, Unified Thread Standard UN, UNR, and UNJ) such that they can accept a non-tapered nut. Screws are then defined as headed, externally threaded fasteners that {{do not meet the}} above definition of bolts. These definitions of screw and bolt eliminate the ambiguity of the Machinery's handbook distinction. And it is for that reason, perhaps, that some people favor them. However, they are neither compliant with common usage of the two words nor are they compliant with formal specifications.|$|E
5000|$|The term fine {{adjustment}} screw typically refers to screws with threads from 40-100 TPI (Threads Per Inch) (0.5mm to 0.2mm pitch) and ultra {{fine adjustment}} screw {{has been used}} to refer to 100-508 TPI (0.2 mm to 0.05 mm pitch). Even though these are non-standard threads, both ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> designations and UNC designations have been used to call out thread dimensions and fit (class). A typical use for a fine adjustment screw is in an optical mirror mount as an adjuster. Typically 80 TPI screws are used in mirror mounts. [...] Ultra fine adjuster screws are used in applications requiring extremely fine motion like laser alignment, fiber coupling.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{principles}} of the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the coarse pitch. For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal coarse pitch (e.g. 1.25 mm {{in the case of}} M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. [...] "M8×1" [...] if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360° rotation).|$|E
50|$|Below {{are some}} common wrench sizes for <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads.</b> Hex head widths (width across flats, wrench size) are for DIN 934 hex nuts and hex head bolts. Other (usually smaller) sizes may occur {{for reasons of}} weight and cost reduction.|$|R
25|$|The {{trapezoidal}} {{metric thread}} form {{is similar to}} the Acme thread form, except the thread angle is 30°. It is codified by DIN 103. While <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> are more prevalent worldwide than imperial threads for triangular thread forms, the imperially sized Acme threads predominate in the trapezoidal thread form. In some cases customers prefer Acme <b>threads</b> for power <b>screws</b> regardless of <b>metric</b> standards used elsewhere in the product.|$|R
40|$|In general, most bolt {{sizes are}} {{available}} in coarse and fine thread optiones. For example, ISO metric coarse and fine pitch series standard – ISO 724 : 1993 “General purpose <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> – Basic dimensiones ” specify the dimensiones for metric threads. Which type of thread is best for a particular application is a common question.

50|$|The M42 {{lens mount}} is a screw thread {{mounting}} standard for attaching lenses to 35 mm cameras, primarily single-lens reflex models. It is more accurately {{known as the}} M42 &times; 1 mm standard, which means {{that it is a}} <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> of 42 mm diameter and 1 mm thread pitch. (The M42 lens mount {{should not be confused with}} the T-mount, which shares the 42mm throat diameter, but differs by having a 0.75mm thread pitch.) It was first used in Zeiss' Contax S of 1949; this East German branch of Zeiss also sold cameras under the Pentacon name; after merger with other East German photographic manufacturers, the name Praktica was used. M42 thread mount cameras first became well known under the Praktica brand, and thus the M42 mount is known as the Praktica thread mount. Since there were no proprietary elements to the M42 mount, many other manufacturers used it; this has led to it being called the Universal thread mount or Universal screw mount by many. The M42 mount was popularized in the United States by Pentax; thus, it is also known as the Pentax thread mount, despite the fact that Pentax did not originate it.|$|E
5000|$|The Unified Thread Standard (UTS) is most {{commonly}} used in the United States, but is also extensively used in Canada and occasionally in other countries. The size of a UTS screw is described using the following format: X-Y, where X is the nominal size (the hole or slot size in standard manufacturing practice through which the shank of the screw can easily be pushed) and Y is the threads per inch (TPI). For sizes [...] inch and larger the size is given as a fraction; for sizes less than this an integer is used, ranging from 0 to 16. The integer sizes {{can be converted to}} the actual diameter by using the formula 0.060 + 0.013 &times; number. For example, a #4 screw is 0.060 + 0.013 &times; 4 = 0.112 inches in diameter. There are also screw sizes smaller than [...] "0" [...] (zero or ought). The sizes are 00, 000, 0000 which are usually referred to as two ought, three ought, and four ought. Most eyeglasses have the bows screwed to the frame with 00-72 (pronounced double ought - seventy two) size screws. To calculate the major diameter of [...] "ought" [...] size screws count the number of 0's and multiply this number by [...]013 and subtract from [...]060. For example, the major diameter of a 000-72 screw thread is [...]060 - (3 x [...]013) = [...]060-.039 = [...]021 inches. For most size screws there are multiple TPI available, with the most common being designated a Unified Coarse Thread (UNC or UN) and Unified Fine Thread (UNF or UF). Note: In countries other than the United States and Canada, the ISO <b>Metric</b> <b>Screw</b> <b>Thread</b> System is primarily used today. Unlike most other countries the United States and Canada still use the Unified (Inch) Thread System. However, both are moving over to the ISO Metric System. It is estimated that approximately 60% of screw threads in use in the United States are still inch based.67 ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{mechanistic}} cutting {{forces for}} thread milling of the ISO <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> are predicted. The force model {{is composed of}} surface and edge force components. The cutting edge is modelled from the geometry of the milling cutter, including the helix angle and thread tooth profile. To determine the specific cutting force coefficients for surface and edge force components, the cutting forces are measured with a dynamometer along a horizontal linear path and compared with the calculated force {{by means of the}} exact uncut chip thickness which results from the modelling of chip volume per tooth at a prescribed time on the thread milling cutter. The run-out errors are considered to estimate the uneven cutting force distribution for each tooth. The measured cutting forces for the brass workpiece material (CuZn 37) for a linear path shows quite good agreement with the simulated cutting forces. The results indicate that the proposed cutting force model for thread milling can be used in order to adapt cutting parameters, such as feed per tooth and axial depth of cut for the purpose of increasing productivity in practical application...|$|E

50|$|The Pelides was {{the first}} aero engine of Alvis design; the company had {{previously}} only built the French Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major under license. With the two companies working closely together the 14 cylinder radial layout of this engine retained metric dimensions but substituted <b>metric</b> <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> with British fasteners such as BSF and Whitworth. Material specifications were different as were the detail design of internal parts such as the crankpin. The Pelides passed a 50-hour Air Ministry type test in 1937 where it produced 1,065 hp (794 kW) but no aircraft application was found and only 15 engines were built. The onset of the Second World War caused the abandonment of any further development of the Pelides and its related designs.|$|R
