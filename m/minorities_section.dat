5000|$|Furthermore, Colban {{ensured that}} his <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> {{undertook}} an increasing {{responsibility for the}} examination and action upon these petitions. Specifically, the <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> employed detailed evaluation of the [...] "receivability" [...] of petitions. Colban and the Section became instrumental {{in the formation of}} and action regarding these petitions, he and his staff became the 'gatekeeper' of the petitions.|$|E
50|$|Again, using idols and personifications {{is heavily}} countered by Akilam, {{but is still}} in {{practice}} among a <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> of the followers. Also there is a practice of using only the 'Thirunamam' without the 1008 Petaled Lotus. This too is occasionally in practice.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1922, the Fareynikte merged into party. At {{the time of the}} merger, the Fareynikte had {{conditioned}} their entry into the party demanding that separate national <b>minority</b> <b>sections</b> (for Jews, Germans, Ukrainians, etc..) to be formed within the party. That re-organization never materialized, though.|$|R

50|$|When {{changes to}} the <b>minorities</b> <b>section</b> were laid for the general {{assembly}} later on, Chamberlain opposed the changes and argued it worked properly during Colban’s leadership.|$|E
50|$|Colban {{entered the}} Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1905. In 1918, Colban took the {{position}} as {{a director of the}} <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> at the League of Nations. In 1930, Colban went back to the Norwegian foreign service.|$|E
50|$|Conflicts {{between the}} <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> and the {{minority}} states eventually proved inevitable. Complaints from the minority states Poland and Czechoslovakia about floods of propagandistic petitions and accusations of the committees multiplying minority complaints, {{led to a}} challenge from several minority states within the League in 1923.|$|E
50|$|Harris {{has won the}} Rutter Award for Teaching Distinction (2003; {{established}} 1995), and the 2003 Matthew O. Tobriner Public Service Award, a San Francisco Bay Area award, for {{commitment to}} academic diversity and legal mentoring. In 2008, Harris won the Clyde Ferguson Award from the Association of American Law Schools <b>Minority</b> <b>Section.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 25 October 1925, Germany {{supported}} financially {{the organization}} of a European Minorities Congress. The leaders of the Minority Groups from Eastern Europe met in Geneva. Colban did not want, that this gathering changed {{the functioning of the}} <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> of the League by reform proposals. As a consequence, he reinforced the publicity about their achievements.|$|R
50|$|The Social Democratic Bund was a {{short-lived}} Jewish political party in Soviet Russia. It was formed as the Russian Bund was split at its conference in Gomel in April 1920. The Social Democratic Bund was formed {{out of the}} rightwing <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> of the erstwhile Russian Bund (the leftwing majority formed the Communist Bund). The party was led by Raphael Abramovitch.|$|R
50|$|Colban's {{personal}} {{interaction with}} major governmental figures of minority states {{was an important}} instrument {{to the success of}} the <b>minorities</b> <b>section.</b> By the end of 1924, Colban and members of the Section had travelled to Belgrade, Sofia, Bucharest, Transylvania, Athens, Bulgaria, Budapest, Vienna, and Prague multiple times, and Colban personally spent around six months each year abroad.|$|E
50|$|Colban was {{fundamental}} in {{the development}} of the League of Nations <b>minorities</b> <b>section.</b> As a consequence of the treaties of the 1919- Paris Peace Conference- the League of Nations found itself responsible for monitoring and defending minority groups across Europe. Theirregularity of the League Council's meetings and a sense of minority issues being of minor importance, made these issues increasingly treated by the secretariat itself.|$|E
50|$|James Eric Drummond, the {{secretary}} general of the League and Colban found another way of representing the <b>minorities</b> <b>section,</b> which excluded states, minorities and neighbouring states to participate in the decision making that could concern them in one way or the other. This was a compromise in order to gain support from the neighbouring states of Germany and the German government and was advised by Colban.|$|E
50|$|A major {{section of}} the Anushilan {{movement}} had been attracted to Marxism during the 1930s, many of them studying Marxist-Leninist literature whilst serving long jail sentences. A <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> {{broke away from the}} Anushilan movement and joined the Communist Consolidation, and later the Communist Party of India. The majority of the Anushilan Marxists did however, whilst having adopted Marxist-Leninist thinking, feel hesitant over joining the Communist Party.|$|R
50|$|The {{focus of}} Operation Better Block {{is to promote}} and revitalize the Homewood-Brushton Community, which {{is located in a}} <b>minority</b> {{populated}} <b>section</b> in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|The League soon {{started to}} publish Workers' News as its monthly publication. Initially, the group around leading WRP adherents Richard Price and Ian Harrison defended the Healyite tradition, albeit in a {{critical}} way. However, during and after a nine-month faction struggle against a <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> in the organisation who supported the idea of joining David North's ICFI, the group began to abandon the Healyite tradition {{and came to the}} conclusion that the Fourth International had degenerated by the late 1940s, needing to be rebuilt afresh.|$|R
50|$|Erik Colban, {{who became}} the {{director}} of the <b>minorities</b> <b>section</b> of the League of Nations and it's 'spiritual father' in 1919, found himself {{to be a member of}} an entirely new class of international bureaucrats. Thus, Colban proved to be an instrumental figure in creating and developing the policy on minorities. He created a system which ‘was surprisingly able to keep myriad minority problems from tearing Europe apart far sooner.|$|E
50|$|When Germany {{received}} its permanent {{seat at the}} council in 1926, Colban started tutoring Stresemann on how to attend to minority affairs. He even succeeded in convincing the German delegates to wait a year before participating in the <b>minorities</b> <b>section,</b> until they understood the situation completely. This manoeuvre kept Germany from presenting any questions regarding minorities to the general assembly until 1930. Working with the Germans, Colban managed {{to convince them that}} theLeague's system of secret compromise was effective and desirable.|$|E
50|$|Through {{personal}} {{interaction and}} administrative mastery, Colban helped {{to protect and}} develop the minorities system. As the League Council initially distanced itself from the responsibility of dealing with minority issues, it gave Colban the liberty to further develop the petition system (as seen below). The <b>Minorities</b> <b>section</b> attempted to develop a practical translation of the unworkable terms of article 12 of the League of Nations. Thus, Colban created a process where minority violations could be addressed through quiet and secret channels.|$|E
50|$|In July 1972 Lieutenant London Steverson was reassigned from Juneau, Alaska to Washington, D.C.. He {{became the}} Chief {{of the newly}} formed <b>Minority</b> Recruiting <b>Section</b> at Coast Guard Headquarters.|$|R
50|$|As the Chief of the <b>Minority</b> Recruiting <b>Section</b> he desegregated the all-white United States Coast Guard Academy by {{recruiting}} {{more than}} 50 minority cadets in {{a two-year period}} from 1973 to 1974.|$|R
50|$|A major {{section of}} the Anushilan {{movement}} had been attracted to Marxism during the 1930s, many of them studying Marxist-Leninist literature whilst serving long jail sentences. A <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> {{broke away from the}} Anushilan movement and joined the Communist Consolidation, and later the Communist Party of India (CPI). The majority of the Anushilan Marxists did however, whilst having adopted Marxist-Leninist thinking, feel hesitant over joining the Communist Party. The Anushilanites distrusted the political lines formulated by the Communist International.They shared some critiques against the leadership of Joseph Stalin and the Comintern, but the Anushilan Marxists did not embrace Trotskyism.|$|R
50|$|Pablo de Azcárate y Flórez (1890 - 1971) was a Spanish diplomat. He {{was born}} in Madrid. During the 1920s he worked in <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> of the League of Nations Secretariat. During the Spanish Civil War, Azcárate served as Ambassador of the Spanish Republican {{government}} to London. Following the British recognition of the Franco government in early 1939, he went into exile in Switzerland. From 1946 onward, he {{was attached to the}} UN. In 1948-1952 he served as secretary of the Consular Truce Commission in Jerusalem on behalf of the UN. Azcárate died in Geneva in 1971.|$|E
50|$|During the 1930s and '40s, Pâclișanu held {{a number}} of other {{government}} posts, heading the Education Ministry's arts office (1930), the <b>minorities</b> <b>section</b> of the prime minister's press bureau (1931), the minorities office at the Education Ministry and then the Religious Affairs and Arts Ministry, leaving in March 1942. For the following two years, he directed the studies and documentaries department of the Propaganda Ministry, also heading a section of the Institute of National History. After a ministerial reorganization in the summer of 1944, he and his department were transferred to the Foreign Ministry. There, he was given the title of cultural adviser within the press, propaganda and information cultural directorate. He also headed the minister's office of studies. A member Romanian delegation to the 1946 Paris Peace Conference, he sat on the political-judicial committee. In this capacity, he served as adviser on Transylvanian history; Gheorghe Tătărescu and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej asked him for information that would bolster Romania's claim over the entirety of the region.|$|E
40|$|The peace {{treaties}} following World War I {{dictated that}} certain newly created or enlarged nation-states in Eastern Europe accept, {{as a condition}} of their international recognition, agreements {{to protect the rights of}} minority populations within their borders. Responsibility to guarantee and supervise this protection fell to the League of Nations, an entirely new international organization. This thesis explores the <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> of the League of Nations, the part of the League's Secretariat concerned with minority rights, and how it developed a procedure to handle minority questions. Though actual power for enforcement fell to the League's Council, competing interests and general reluctance among the great powers and the minority states of Eastern Europe opened up a space for the Section to largely create and implement a system of supervision. Part of the world's first international civil service, the <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> worked to overcome many of the structural weaknesses of the League and to develop a process and procedure for identifying and resolving minority questions throughout Europe...|$|E
50|$|His next {{attempt to}} enter {{parliament}} {{was also in}} Scotland at the Ross and Cromarty by-election, 1936. In 1935, the Liberal National candidate was re-elected unopposed. When the by-election came around, a <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> of the local Liberal Association wanted a Liberal to stand and were unhappy when the majority decided to support a National Labour candidate. The Scottish Liberal Federation persuaded Thomas to stand as a Liberal candidate. However, {{the result was a}} disaster for Thomas as he finished fourth. Following this disappointment, Thomas decided to switch his support from the official Liberal party to the Liberal National party.|$|R
40|$|Housing Act all {{assign a}} key role to the formal banking sector, based on the view that it is vital for poor and ethnic <b>minority</b> <b>sections</b> of society {{to have access to}} banks and other {{mainstream}} financial institutions. The usual regulatory view rarely considers alternatives to the formal banking sector, contributing to the impression that rejected bank loan applicants and nonapplicants are left to fend for themselves, perhaps vulnerable to loan sharks and pawn merchants of dubious repute. It is beginning to be noticed, both theoretically and empirically, that such an extreme view cannot be supported. In this context, w...|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} main mines in this district, {{known as the}} Mysore, Oorgaum, NandiDurg, and Balghat mines. Out of the total {{population}} in the mining areas, there are about 10 to 15 thousand Roman Catholics, a few Protestants and a <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> of Buddhists. Most Of the Anglo-Indians and British citizens who settled in this mining area are Catholics. Since {{there were a number of}} Catholics in the K.G.F. area, two Churches were built between 1900 and 1912. One Of these churches was Our Lady Of Victories Church; the other being St. Anthony`s Church in the Balghat Mining Area. St. Mary`s Boys Primary and Middle School are also situated in the Champion Reefs church area.|$|R
40|$|The author {{argues that}} the {{minority}} homosexual section of our population [...] a larger minority than, for example, the ethnic <b>minorities</b> <b>section</b> [...] is {{more often than not}} excluded by the 'helping professions' from the right to be parents. The author appeals to the lack of scientific data supporting such exclusion and asks that homosexual parents and their children receive the same care from our institutions as other parents and children. Some instances of lack of care are cited. The paper was presented to the 1983 annual conference of the London Medical Group, 'Human Rights in Medicine'...|$|E
40|$|The peace {{treaties}} {{following the}} Great War dictated that certain nation-states accept, {{as the price}} of international recognition, agreements {{to protect the rights of}} their minority populations. Responsibility to 'guarantee' and 'supervise' the minority treaties fell to a novel and untried international institution, the League of Nations. It established the 'minority petition procedure', an unprecedented innovation within international relations that initiated transnational claims-making. Focusing on the supervision of agreements pertaining to the Macedonian region, I examine how the <b>Minorities</b> <b>Section</b> of the League of Nations Secretariat handled 'minority petitions' alleging state infractions of minority treaties. I consider, in particular, a preoccupation among both bureaucrats and states with 'violent language' in petitions. I argue that this preoccupation signalled anxieties about honour, sovereignty and legitimacy, about the ambiguous position of 'minority states' and about the potentially explosive effects of popular energies in the post-war international order...|$|E

500|$|The Minority Treaties {{were the}} basis of the League's system of {{minorities}}. Their aim was to protect the minorities without alienating the majority of the countries' population. The procedure was centered on the Council of the League (rather than the more encompassing Assembly) which had the right and obligation to raise complaints of treaty violations. Individual Council members had the unique privilege of placing complaints on the agenda, even through the petitions for that could be sent from any source. The majority of cases, however, has never been handled by the council. Before reaching the Council, the petition passed through: the <b>minority</b> <b>section</b> of the Secretariat which selected the petitions according to some criteria (prohibition of violent language, integrity of the state, complaints about specific violations...), tried a first mediation and asked for supplementary information; the special committee of three that was appointed by the council and had the faculty of: ...|$|R
