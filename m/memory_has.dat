5|$|Having {{arrived back}} on Earth, EVE repairs and reactivates WALL-E, but finds that his <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> been reset and his {{personality}} is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory {{back to life}} and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the Axiom begin to restore Earth and its environment.|$|E
5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and {{a great source of}} pride for the white community, as well as for some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E

25|$|Memory is {{the ability}} to preserve, retain, and {{subsequently}} recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> traditionally been a persistent theme in philosophy, {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of cognitive psychology. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called cognitive neuroscience, a marriage between cognitive psychology and neuroscience.|$|E

25|$|The role {{of sleep}} in <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> long been suspected.

Such behavioral and imaging measures in tests with both animal and human subjects have shown that pretraining sleep plays {{a critical role in}} preparing the memory for encoding and posttraining sleep {{plays a major role in}} memory consolidation.|$|E

Retrospective <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> been studied heavily and {{is known to be}} affected negatively by multiple sclerosis. However, a study by Rendell et al.

25|$|Zinc {{is needed}} to {{maintain}} normal vitamin A levels in blood plasma. It also helps vitamin A become metabolized by the liver. However evidence suggests that when someone is deficient in both vitamin A and zinc, memory is more improved when just vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased. Of course <b>memory</b> <b>has</b> the largest improvement when both are increased. When one of these nutrients is not balanced, the other {{is most likely to}} be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning.|$|E
