In order to assess biodegradability of the waste material the breath was determined. The results showed variability in physical characteristics between batches of compost from municipal waste, variability of the chemical characteristics of graded according including especially heavy metals and other hazardous elements.

During fiscal year 2001 (the most recent complete time-awaiting-training data), Marines exceeded 2, 800 <b>man</b> <b>years</b> of time awaiting training.

This thesis uses an integer linear program, Entry-Level Course Scheduler (ELCS), to optimize a course schedule that includes recommended seat assignments by MOS and gender.

First, we determined the level of ambiguity by three independent tests.

Both the independent test team and the third party development team found ways to cope with the high level of ambiguity.

40|$|Novels Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer, Falling Man by Don DeLillo and The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid all {{engage with}} the {{individual}} and collective traumas of 9 / 11. They do so in different ways and from different perspectives, but each struggles with the desire for (or impossibility of) achieving narrative closure. My thesis will use Mieke Bal’s theory linking trauma to the impossibility of closure in order to analyze the novels’ strategies to address the trauma of 9 / 11. I {{will argue that the}} level of healing achieved {{is directly related to the}} degree of narrative closure each novel reaches. Oskar, the child protagonist of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (year), addresses the trauma of losing his father in the attacks by going on a quest and keeping a scrapbook in which he collects his memories of his father’s life and death. This process allows him (and the novel) to achieve closure. Falling <b>Man</b> (<b>year)</b> collects the fragments of the lives of direct and indirect New York victims of the attacks, and tries to reassemble them. Here, the trauma is addressed on a more collective level than in the case of ELaIC, sometimes successfully, in other cases less so. The Reluctant Fundamentalist (year) is a novel from the other side: its speaker and main character is a Pakistani activist, whose trauma consists of his rejection by American society after 9 / 11. Changez and the other characters function as metaphors for the national traumas incurred. These remain unresolved and the novel accordingly does not reach narrative closure. Together, these novels suggest that individual 9 / 11 traumas may be worked through successfully, but that there remains an unresolved collective or even global trauma...|$|E
40|$|An {{inventory}} of the recently concluded, current and planned gerontological research in the Netherlands has been made. About 160 investigators are committed {{to this kind of}} research, on which they spend 71 <b>man</b> <b>years.</b> In terms of manpower, the most effort is spent in social gerontology (76 investigators, 29. 23 <b>man</b> <b>years),</b> followed by biomedical gerontology (34 investigators, 23. 18 <b>man</b> <b>years)</b> and medical gerontology (50 investigators, 18. 60 <b>man</b> <b>years).</b> For the medical and social sciences, it could be calculated that about 0. 4 to 1. 0 %, respectively, of research conducted at the Dutch universities is gerontologically oriented. The emphasis in biomedical gerontology is laid on studies of the immunological system, on general pathology and physiology of laboratory animals, on studies of the liver, heart and vascular system and the central nervous system. The problems are mostly approached {{from the point of view}} of biochemistry, physiology and pathology. In medical gerontology the research effort is almost exclusively dedicated to somatic and psychological aspects. Social medical studies in gerontology appeared to be nearly nonexistent. The research interests within medical gerontology are highly diverse. Only vascular diseases and diseases of the skin and sensory organs receive more than 2 <b>man</b> <b>years</b> of scientific research. Most reseach in social gerontology is aimed at psychological and sociological aspects of ageing. In terms of manpower, the following subjects receive more than average attention institutional care and services; home care and services; employment; and housing and housing facilities.

However, the last two subjects are mostly studied in conjunction with other subjects primarily connected with the social roles of the aged in the community. The larger part of the research in gerontology is conducted within a single discipline, such as biomedicine, medicine or the social sciences.

40|$|Effective {{management}} {{of a gas}} turbine development programme under commercial airline pressures demands very careful balancing of two separate cycling commodities. One is experimental engines and component parts or ‘hardware’. The other is data, information and conclusions, hereafter referred to collectively as ‘decisionware’. While techniques for hardware management are well documented, equivalent techniques for planning, monitoring and motivating decisionware activities are less developed. This paper describes experimental methods which have been evolved, and applied to some development activities within the Derby Engine Group of Rolls-Royce Limited. These methods include simulation modelling and performance monitoring of a staff organization and aim to achieve higher combined effectiveness of the two meshing cycles described. The work occupied a period of one <b>man</b> <b>year</b> and has applications in development associated departments outside the original field of study. 1 INTRODUCXION Development of any gas turbine design demands the provision of several ‘captive ’ development engines. This hardware is dismantled, modified, re-assembled and tested continuously {{with a view to}} overcoming operating problems, increasing the life or improving the performance of similar units in commercial operation. Commercial pressure is such that development engines executing such a cycle may pass a fixed point in the cycle at a rate approach-ing one per day. The majority of these engines will carry special instrumentation, applied for one particular cycle only and designed to investigate several different problems. The equivalent of sixty million track feet of magnetic tape is utilized annually by the Derby Engine Group of Rolls-Royce Limited in making recordings via special engine mounted instrumentation. Although complex equipment is used in its electrical processing, human effort alone can unravel the qualitative nature of each problem from a vast amount of amplitude and frequency data within which it is concealed.

Norway lobsters Nephrops norvegicus is only recently been target for research. Due to mismanagement, the collapsed Homarus stock has the last 25 years been studied by the Institute of Marine Research (IMR). IMR have today one of Europe’s strongest team of lobster scientist in Europe, and we are proud to host the 9 th International Conference and Workshop on Lobster Biology and Management in 2011. The majority of the Norwegian monitoring and research on the lobsters and Norway lobster are the IMR. Besides the IMR, the Norwegian Research Council supports on average 3 to 5 projects per year. This is mainly applied studies, directed to develop aquaculture as well as monitoring the reestablishment of lobster stocks and stock indexes. Monitoring of the fisheries {{is the responsibility of}} the IMR and is based on fisheries data (log books, landing weight and value, catch per unit effort (CPUE) and survey data. CPUE from selected fishermen has been monitored for lobsters in the Skagerrak for nearly a century. Due to illegal fishery the registered landings are not resentative for the total landings for these species. About 4 <b>man</b> <b>year</b> (5 500 h/year) are invested in the North Sea. The effort is split between the shrimp survey and various lobster studies. The lobster studies are partly monitoring of the lobster fishery in general, lobster migration and the lobster fishery in and around the MPAs, and ecological and rearing studies in sea ranching-related studies. Norway lobsters are not monitored except for as bycatch in shrimp surveys. This presentation will be a review of the ongoing activities and a short summary over results from previous projects.
