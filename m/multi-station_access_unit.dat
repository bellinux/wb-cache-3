30|$|The {{elementary}} concept at the NAL {{level is}} the NAL unit (NALU). An AVC NALU contains a header {{followed by a}} raw byte sequence payload. This header is made of a unique byte and includes a field to identify the type of NALU. A complete picture can be segmented into multiple NALUs, each carrying usually a coded slice or control information. The set of NALUs needed to decode a complete picture is called <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> AVC introduces a special type of <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> called instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR), which can be identified through the inspection of the NALU header. A sequence of <b>access</b> <b>units</b> starting with an IDR can be decoded independent of any previous pictures in the bitstream.

5000|$|A set of NAL {{units in}} a {{specified}} form {{is referred to}} as an <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> The decoding of each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> results in one decoded picture.Each <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> contains a set of VCL NAL units that together compose a primary coded picture. It may also be prefixed with an <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> delimiter to aid in locating the start of the <b>access</b> <b>unit.</b> Some supplemental enhancement information containing data such as picture timing information may also precede the primary coded picture.The primary coded picture consists of a set of VCL NAL units consisting of slices or [...] slice data partitions that represent the samples of the video picture.Following the primary coded picture may be some additional VCL NAL units that contain redundant representations of areas of the same video picture. These are referred to as redundant coded pictures, and are available for use by a decoder in recovering from loss or corruption of the data in the primary coded pictures. Decoders are not required to decode redundant coded pictures if they are present.Finally, if the coded picture is the last picture of a coded video sequence (a sequence of pictures that is independently decodable and uses only one sequence parameter set), an end of sequence NAL unit may be present to indicate the end of the sequence; and if the coded picture is the last coded picture in the entire NAL unit stream, an end of stream NAL unit may be present to indicate that the stream is ending.|$|R

30|$|SVC is {{backwards}} compatible with AVC. The base layer of a scalable video is represented {{with a set}} of NALUs that can be decoded by any compatible AVC decoder. Additional NALU types are defined by SVC. The main characteristic of these new NALUs is the use of a sequence of 3 bytes, following the AVC header, that contain three identifiers: temporal identifier (TID), dependency identifier (DID), and quality identifier (QID). These identifiers represent a point in the temporal, spacial, and quality scalable dimensions, respectively. The inspection of these fields permits to identify NALUs belonging to a specific enhancement layer. SVC <b>access</b> <b>units</b> start with base layer NALUs followed by enhancement layer NALUs, which are organized with increasing values in the (DID, QID, TID) triple identifier. The exact number of NALUs per <b>access</b> <b>unit</b> depends among others on the number of enhancement layers.|$|R

The scheme proposed is based on the Available Bit Rate (ABR) control mechanism currently standardized for ATM. Backpressure flow control is not terminated in the AU but is further extended to reach the non-ATM legacy LAN stations. This is achieved by using a subset of the Logical Link Control (LLC) protocol functionality executed between the AU and the legacy LAN stations. Apart from the QoS guarantees, the proposed method is transparent to the upper transport layer protocols and as such it does not require fundamental modifications to existing AUs and LAN stations...|$|R
