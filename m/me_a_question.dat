2500|$|Race {{relations}} {{continue to}} be a vexing issue in Bermuda, occasionally leading to heated exchanges with the press and the opposition UBP in Parliament. Brown rejected inappropriate questions as [...] "plantation questions". He later explained, [...] "A plantation question is for <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> which conjures up images of the plantation: of a master-servant relationship, a man-boy relationship. A question that would be asked of a black politician and not a white one. [...] I will continue to indicate to reporters if that is what a question is." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I wasn't a rabble rouser. [...] I wasn't a big {{noisemaker}} in the infield, {{which a lot}} {{of managers}} think you've got to be or you're not showing. [...] But I don't think it contributes much." [...] Gehringer also had a sense of humor about his reputation. [...] At a civic banquet in his honor, Gehringer's entire speech consisted of the following: [...] "I'm known around baseball as saying very little, and I'm not going to spoil my reputation." [...] When asked why he signed his name [...] "Chas. Gehringer", he responded: [...] "Why use seven letters when four will do?" [...] On another occasion, when asked about his closed-lip reputation, he responded: [...] "Not true; if somebody asked <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> I would answer them. If they said, 'Pass the salt,' I would pass the salt." ...|$|E
60|$|I WAITED {{in silence}} for the {{disclosure}} that was now to come. Naomi began by asking <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
50|$|Life {{hangs over}} <b>me</b> like <b>a</b> <b>question</b> mark.|$|R
60|$|As the {{fighting}} receded from our {{position for a}} moment, Thuvia turned toward <b>me</b> with <b>a</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Marx {{had been}} {{watching}} my face, and leaned over towards <b>me</b> with <b>a</b> <b>question</b> upon his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Jeanne answered, [...] "only {{you asked}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> and I felt an irresistible desire to answer you truthfully. It {{would have come}} sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You asked <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> at dinner-time," [...] she said, [...] "winch I did {{not answer}} at the time. You asked me why I disliked James Miller so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot sit {{and hear}} it. And what am I {{to say when}} he asks <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> as he did just now? He said that you had confessed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Brain. [Aside.] Oh, goes it there?--Why {{should you}} ask <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> when every {{body in the}} house can tell they are 'nown dear's? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That reminds <b>me</b> of <b>a</b> <b>question</b> I {{was going}} to ask you," [...] Jacob went on. [...] "What price are we going to charge for the {{electric}} light?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O! madam," [...] cried I, my {{bitterness}} breaking forth, [...] "do you ask <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question?</b> Indeed, then, I may {{go elsewhere}} for help; {{there is none}} here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing very much; mamma asked <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> or two this morning, and I said I {{was coming}} here. Had {{she asked me}} why, I should have told her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{something}} in {{your mind when you}} ask <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> like this!" [...] she said. [...] "What should I know about it at all? What makes you ask me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am off to-night," [...] he said. [...] "I {{am going}} to America. I have work there. I ought to have gone long ago. Will you answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> first?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Harris," [...] he whispered, as {{he handed}} her into the coach, [...] "how can you ask <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question?</b> You are very cruel. Drive on, coachman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> plain <b>question,</b> if {{you have}} the wit to answer with," [...] quoth the other, anger ever rising in his voice. [...] "Is there hereabouts a monk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is cruel}} in {{you to ask}} <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> after what I have already told you. You know that I have given to Miss Dale a promise of marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By a philosophic trick--by {{what they}} call induction. You know you have always your option of contradicting me. But kindly answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> Don't you give your brother money? I {{think you ought to}} answer that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can leave}} me, ma'am: but before you go" [...] (and he {{retained}} me by a firmer grasp than ever), [...] "you will be pleased just to answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> or two." [...] He paused.|$|E
60|$|She {{was unusually}} silent, and {{once or twice}} I caught her glancing curiously at me, {{as though she had}} {{something}} which it was in her mind to say, but needed encouragement. As we neared my cottage she asked <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh we shan't come to that," [...] {{our friend}} declared; {{and the next}} moment he had moved in another direction. [...] "Will you answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> plain <b>question?</b> Will she ever divorce?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am, and you can't {{get out of}} it now. Oh, Florence, {{will you}} answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> question,--one <b>question?</b> I asked it you before, and you did not vouchsafe me any answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can you ask <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> father, {{remembering what}} you have always taught me? I said----" [...] and with {{omissions}} she told me the gist of what had passed between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "One moment," [...] I said, [...] "if {{you will}} allow <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> that seems of importance--did he pass {{on and then}} smile and raise his hat, or did he smile into his hat, raise it, and then pass on afterwards?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Breckon gave a peal of delight, and answered, [...] "Yes, I {{certainly}} do." [...] He controlled {{himself so}} far as to say: [...] "Now I think I've been pretty open with you, and I wish you'd answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> Will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None at all, {{save that}} I could tell much such another story, if you cared to listen. But hear me out, and then answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{question}},</b> or rather, {{answer the question}} first. Would {{you like to be}} avenged upon this high-born knave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, {{there was}} no {{difficulty}} about it. Mr. Villiers asked <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few <b>questions</b> as to {{the situation on the}} frontier, and at once said that I should have Â£5,000 to take him." ...|$|R
60|$|And so our {{conversation}} {{appeared to be}} at an end. But {{after a few moments}} my intense desire to discover whether the savages knew aught of Rima or not made <b>me</b> hazard <b>a</b> <b>question.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Macdermot, {{surely you}} 'll not refuse to answer <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question</b> as that. Though--God knows why--we mayn't be friends, {{you would not}} wish to have such ill as that happen to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can call}} it curiosity, or {{whatever}} you like," [...] Deane answered. [...] "The only point is that I want you to answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> and forget that I have ever asked it you. Your lawyer is like your confessor, isn't he--your lawyer and your doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not to-night, Norris," [...] she said. [...] "I have {{something}} else to do; but before I go I want you to answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> Once before, when my father had you in a corner, I helped you out, {{and you know the}} price I paid." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby, {{moved by}} an impulse {{he did not}} understand, caught and held fast one of her hands. [...] "Hetty," [...] he said, [...] "aren't we old friends? There is nobody I would sooner take with me, but we shall {{certainly}} quarrel if you ask <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of that kind again." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was now {{suggested}} that I {{should attempt to}} influence the patient's arm, as heretofore. I made the attempt and failed. Dr. F--then intimated a desire to have <b>me</b> put <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> I did so, as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What an infamy--that {{you should}} dare {{to come here}} and ask <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>question.</b> If you will not leave me at once, sir, I myself must return to the house. Your {{presence}} here is an insult." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I beseech you, kind sir," [...] said he, in a cracked, melancholy tone, [...] "have pity on {{the most}} unfortunate man in the world. For Heaven's sake, answer <b>me</b> <b>a</b> single <b>question!</b> Is this the town of Boston?" ...|$|R
