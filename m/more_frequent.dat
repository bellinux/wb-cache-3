5|$|As of 2016, Line 2 {{was running}} at {{capacity}} with almost 26,000 peak-hour riders. Upgraded signalling {{would allow for}} <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> trains and expand peak-hour capacity to almost 33,000 riders by 2031.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin and {{adapalene}} {{in combination}} {{are also more}} effective than either drug alone, although adverse effects are <b>more</b> <b>frequent.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1916, as his {{seizures}} became <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> and severe, John {{was sent}} to live at Wood Farm, with Bill having charge of his care.|$|E
60|$|Leaving Launcelott's-Hey, I {{turned into}} a <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> street; and soon meeting a policeman, told him of the {{condition}} of the woman and the girls.|$|R
50|$|Celebrities such as Joe Paterno, Michael Bolton, Jim Kelly, Lynn Swann, {{and many}} <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> Lucy's Cafe {{throughout}} the years. The restaurant also was visited annually by {{players and coaches}} of the Big 33 Football Classic.|$|R
6000|$|One day the Warreners were strolling {{together}} through the town, {{and turned off}} from the <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> streets, {{with a view of}} seeing what the lower-class quarters were like. They had gone some distance, when Ned said: ...|$|R
5|$|The volcano then {{entered a}} stage of <b>more</b> <b>frequent,</b> but less violent eruptions, until the most recent Plinian eruption, which {{destroyed}} Pompeii and Herculaneum.|$|E
5|$|Threats to {{the park}} include overuse, urban traffic, {{encroaching}} development, invasive flora, and lack of maintenance money. Occasional serious crimes and <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> minor crimes occur in the park.|$|E
5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in the upper atmosphere. Methane concentrations {{have more than doubled}} in the past 100 years.|$|E
60|$|Such a place {{promised a}} traveller, who journeyed incognito, safer, {{if not better}} accommodation, than he was like to meet with in <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> inns; and {{at the door of}} the Cat and Fiddle, Julian halted accordingly.|$|R
50|$|This {{region of}} the field has been {{somewhat}} <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> in <b>more</b> recent forms of the game, including T20 matches, as batsmen have had {{to find ways to}} hit the ball to the boundary even for yorker-length deliveries.|$|R
50|$|From {{the start}} it functioned as an “amazing {{antidote}} to the uptown glitz of Studio 54 in the '70s”. As it became <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> by downtown celebrities, a door policy was established and it acquired a chic, often elitist reputation.|$|R
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Network Rail {{installed}} a 12-car turnback siding {{just south of}} Tunbridge Wells station between the Grove Hill and Strawberry Hill tunnels to facilitate a <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> service and to allow restricted types of London trains starting or terminating at Tunbridge Wells to be operated in 12-car formations. Previously such services were 11-car at most.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} done at Nosy Mangabe on {{black-and-white}} ruffed lemurs a fourth level or organization was defined: affiliates. Affiliates were individuals with more persistent social bonds and <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> interactions, usually within a core group, but sometimes also between core groups within a subgroup. Adult females typically had many affiliates, whereas adult males rarely interacted with conspecifics, living a more solitary existence.|$|E
6000|$|... [28] The mere {{warmth of}} St. Mark's in winter, {{which is much}} greater [...] {{than that of the}} other two churches above named, must, however, be [...] taken into consideration, {{as one of the most}} {{efficient}} causes of its [...] being then <b>more</b> <b>frequented.</b>|$|R
60|$|He swung {{away from}} the {{solitude}} {{to the other side}} of the steamer, paused in a sheltered spot while he lit a cigarette, and paced up and down the <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> ways. A soft voice from an invisible mass of furs and rugs, called to him.|$|R
60|$|But, in truth, {{no one can}} now {{travel through}} the <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> tracts, without being offended, at almost every turn, by an {{introduction}} of discordant objects, disturbing that peaceful harmony of form and colour, which had been through a long lapse of ages most happily preserved.|$|R
5|$|November is {{traditionally}} {{the start of}} the thunderstorm season along the eastern seaboard of Australia, with a rise in average humidity and warmer ground temperatures combining with <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> occurrences of cool air in the upper atmosphere. These conditions are conducive for producing severe thunderstorms, particularly those which feature hail.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{supernova}} explosions {{can have}} the same effects as GRBs on Earth's atmosphere if they are close enough. Locally, supernovas are much <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> events than GRBs, with a possibility of occurring closer to Earth. In the field of astrobiology, the rate and distribution of supernovas are used to define {{what is known as}} the Galactic Habitable Zone.|$|E
60|$|At {{times they}} conversed in low tones, {{so low that}} the little {{red-headed}} girl, dodging through the parkings in their wake, could not overhear the words they spoke. But {{as they approached the}} <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> part of the town, they separated, Kauffman turning into Broadway and the other continuing along a side street.|$|R
5000|$|Bad Hofgastein is {{generally}} <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> by Austrians, {{as well as}} a large number of Russian and Italian visitors, and has successfully maintained its image / standing next to {{the ups and downs of}} its neighbor Bad Gastein (which now once again is receiving vast investments aimed at restoring the former glory days of Archduke Ferdinand [...] ).|$|R
50|$|However, {{despite its}} notoriety, Rakshastal bears no less beauty than other lakes in Tibet. Rakshastal covers a total area of 250 km2, at an {{altitude}} of 4575 m. Though absent of nearby grasslands, the white cobbles, the hills and the island colored with dark red, and the deep blue lake water present another distinctive picture absent from many of the places <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> by visitors.|$|R
5|$|The El Niño-Southern Oscillation {{affects the}} {{precipitation}} distribution, by altering rainfall patterns across the western United States, Midwest, the Southeast, {{and throughout the}} tropics. There is also evidence {{that global warming is}} leading to increased precipitation to the eastern portions of North America, while droughts are becoming <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> in the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|To promote public transportation, NJT and PATH {{would offer}} <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> peak hour train {{services}} to Newark, Hoboken and Jersey City on the Hudson Waterfront, and Manhattan. NJT would {{add a new}} bus route for peak hour service between Watchung and Newark Penn Station, along the US22 corridor, and their bus schedules would accommodate additional passengers on existing routes.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Japan is facing some challenges, {{such as a}} decreasing population, declining investment, fiscal constraints, ageing facilities, an ageing workforce, a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities, and the vulnerability of {{parts of the country}} to droughts that are expected to become <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> due to climate change.|$|E
50|$|Arrowheads {{left behind}} by nomadic hunters suggest {{occupation}} during the Mesolithic period (about 6,000 to 7,000 years ago). Only occasionally occupied during the Neolithic and the Bronze Age until about 800 BC, when the site became <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> and a large fire place {{was set up in}} front of its entrance. The entrance area also seems to have been used for ceremonies or storage of personal items.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{considerable}} number of company in the Park when he entered it, but, his present state of mind inducing him to avoid society, he kept aloof from the <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> walks towards Westminster and Whitehall, and drew to the north, or, as we should now say, the Piccadilly verge of the enclosure, believing he might there enjoy, or rather combat, his own thoughts unmolested.|$|R
60|$|All this time, the <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> {{streets of}} Paris presented, in {{the height of}} the usual season too, the most deserted aspect. I have {{frequently}} walked on the terrace of the Tuileries when there were not a dozen others in the whole garden, and driven from my own hotel in the Rue St. Dominique to the Place Vendôme without meeting half a dozen vehicles, including fiacres and cabriolets de place.|$|R
5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males {{have been found to be}} <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Stapleton Road passed to Regional Railways. All trains along the Severn Beach Line ran to Severn Beach, but the service pattern was irregular. This was changed in the mid-1990s, with a <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> service to Avonmouth but very few on to Severn Beach and no Sunday services. Services at Stapleton Road were boosted due to the proximity of Eastville Stadium, but this use ended in 1986 when Bristol Rovers F.C. moved to Twerton Park in Bath.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, a few {{records of}} {{hybridization}} with the white-faced whistling duck {{have been noted}} in the wild, although {{in most parts of}} southern Africa, the two species breed at different times, bicolor during the dry season (April to September) and viduata during the rains (October to March). Hybridization in captivity is <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> but limited to other species in the genus Dendrocygna.|$|E
60|$|Without doubt those islands {{would make}} a very noble settlement, in order to victual and relieve the European merchants in so long a run as they have to make; and when this trade came to be <b>more</b> <b>frequented,</b> the calling of those ships there would enrich the islands, as the English at St. Helena are enriched by the {{refreshing}} which the East India ships find that meet there.|$|R
2500|$|The use {{of heated}} box blinds {{is a popular}} method of wolf hunting in modern Alberta. Bait {{stations}} are set {{in advance of the}} hunt, with blinds being erected in the <b>more</b> <b>frequented</b> spots. The method was developed {{as a response to the}} fact that finding wolves on foot was almost always a pure luck scenario, because of the wolf's elusiveness. Shots are usually fired when the wolf is [...] from the blind.|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of urban}} concept is adding value to solved area by filling the objects {{and making the}} public space bigger. Proposed object defines two new {{triangular}} squares but also stands for a dominant {{in the corner of}} Brabansko and Mala Dlazka streets.
