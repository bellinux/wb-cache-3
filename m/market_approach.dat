5|$|At {{the end of}} 1946, Renault {{abandoned}} the production of heavy trucks in view of its financial troubles, and the company lost the position of France's market leader which it had before World War II. However, the rapid development and production concentration on that sector made Renault to seek ways {{to enter into the}} market. In 1950, the Renault's technical chief, Fernand Picard, elaborated a plan to launch a limited range of trucks and buses with a single 105 CV engine, taking advantage of the economies of scale, which proved unsuccessful. In 1953, the strategy was changed and Renault decided to acquire rival manufacturers, starting with Somua and Latil. The company Saviem was formed in October 1955 by the merger of Renault's trucks and buses manufacturing operations with Somua and Latil and both Schneider (owner of Somua) and the Blum family (owner of Latil) had stakes in the new company. Initially, the Saviem name was added besides the existing badges of the three forming companies but, from 1957 onwards, Saviem-LRS appeared as marque's name on the company's products (the acronym representing the former marques Latil, Renault and Somua), which was simplified to Saviem in 1960. In 1959, Saviem became a whole-owned subsidiary of Renault. The early range of the company consisted of small commercial vehicles derived of Renault's existing models (Go√©lette and Galion), new medium and heavy trucks with Alfa Romeo engines and Chausson support for the coach/bus production. With an aggressive <b>market</b> <b>approach</b> focussed in volume rather than quality, Saviem became the leader by sales in France.|$|E
25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson we {{must learn}} from this experience: electricity is really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities {{to take advantage of}} a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a <b>market</b> <b>approach</b> to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a <b>market</b> <b>approach</b> for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.|$|E

25|$|Three {{different}} approaches {{are commonly used}} in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the <b>market</b> <b>approach.</b> Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining {{the value of a}} business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the net present value of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the First chicago method which essentially combines the income approach with the <b>market</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E

2500|$|It {{is similar}} to using the <b>market</b> <b>{{approach}}</b> in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach. [...] The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) {{is a relatively new}} concept. [...] It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business valuation community since it is based on modern portfolio theory. [...] Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>market</b> <b>approach</b> to {{business}} valuation {{is rooted in}} the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the [...] "comparable sales" [...] method that is commonly used in real estate appraisal. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.|$|E

2500|$|Chaudhry {{also spoke}} {{in favour of}} {{bringing}} more ethnic Fijians into the economic mainstream. [...] He attacked {{what he called the}} [...] "divide and rule" [...] policies of Fiji's former British colonial rulers, saying that indigenous Fijians had been isolated from other communities and marginalized economically. This colonial legacy had remained the status quo in society, even since independence in 1970, he maintained. [...] "The status quo is not good for the ordinary Fijians. It is good for the elites in society but not for the ordinary Fijians," [...] Chaudhry said. Positive discrimination programs would not achieve much without a dismantling of the traditional communal mindset, he said. He called for a more individualistic approach to society, based on incentives and appropriate training. [...] He did not believe that modernization would threaten the communal structure of Fijian society. [...] "No you can still fulfil your traditional obligations but the contradiction in the system between the communal approach and the free <b>market</b> <b>approach</b> needs to be addressed," [...] he said. He also insisted that culture could not be allowed to be stagnant.|$|E
2500|$|The Garnaut Climate Change Review notes many {{barriers}} to increased global biosequestration. [...] "There must be {{changes in the}} accounting regimes for greenhouse gases. Investments are required in research, development and commercialisation of superior approaches to biosequestration. Adjustments are required in the regulation of land use. New institutions {{will need to be}} developed to coordinate the interests in utilisation of biosequestration opportunities across small business in rural communities. Special efforts will be required to unlock potential in rural communities in developing countries." [...] Saddler and King have argued that biosequestration and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions should not be handled within a global emissions trading scheme because of difficulties with measuring such emissions, problems in controlling them and the burden that would be placed on numerous small-scale farming operations. Collett likewise maintains that REDD credits (post-facto payments to developing countries for reducing their deforestation rates below an historical or projected reference rate), simply create a complex <b>market</b> <b>approach</b> to this global public health problem that reduces transparency and accountability when targets are not met and will not be as effective as developed nations voluntarily funding countries to keep their rainforests.|$|E

40|$|Small {{business}} enterprises are {{the backbone}} of economic growth and innovation. The existence of the Internet provides opportunities for these enterprises to gain the benefits of Information and Communication Technologies in their business operations. However, small business enterprises often face a variety of challenges such as limited financial resources, a shortage of skilled workers, and inadequate infrastructure (such as communication connectivity or electricity supply particularly in rural areas) in adopting new technology in their business operations. Many small business enterprises are not engaged with appropriate business strategies which lead to informal and mixed <b>marketing</b> <b>approaches</b> in their businesses. This paper proposes an Internet marketing adoption framework for small business enterprises. The proposed framework of Internet marketing would be incorporated {{as part of the}} business strategies for small business enterprises in order to assist owners and managers (who are often poor planners). This paper presents a review of the main indicators in the proposed framework, which are e-readiness, aims and strategies (which will lead to the Internet <b>marketing</b> <b>approach</b> by small business enterprises), the Internet <b>marketing</b> <b>approach</b> and the evaluation of the Internet marketing performance.
