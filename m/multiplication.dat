A well-known result given by Motzkin [23 and Winograd [6 is that, even with preliminary adaptation of the coefficients, at least n/ 2 <b>multiplications</b> are required to evaluate a polynomial of degree n if the coefficients of the polynomial are algebraically independent.

Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E

30|$|N[*]−[*] 3  N/ 2 [*]+[*] 4 real <b>multiplications,</b> {{and this}} is {{approximately}} six {{times faster than the}} conventional approach. Further, a new algorithm was introduced for the 2 Npoint DCT as in [3]. This algorithm uses only half of the number of <b>multiplications</b> required by the existing efficient algorithms (12 <b>multiplications</b> and 29 additions), and it makes the system simpler by decomposing the N-point Inverse DCT (IDCT) into the sum of two N/ 2 -point IDCTs. A recursive algorithm for DCT [4] was presented with a structure that allows the generation of the next higher order DCT from two identical lower order DCTs {{to reduce the number of}} adders and multipliers (12 <b>multiplications</b> and 29 additions). Loffler came up with a practical fast 1 -D DCT algorithm [5] in which the number of <b>multiplications</b> was reduced to 11 by inverting add/subtract modules and found an equivalence for the rotation block (only 3 additions and 3 <b>multiplications</b> per block instead of 4 <b>multiplications</b> and 2 additions). Following these contributions in DCT implementation, many algorithms were constantly introduced to optimize the DCT.|$|R
2500|$|To {{illustrate}} the savings of an FFT, consider {{the count of}} complex <b>multiplications</b> and additions. [...] Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves N2 complex <b>multiplications</b> and N(N−1) complex additions, of which O(N) operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as <b>multiplications</b> by 1. The radix-2 Cooley–Tukey algorithm, for N a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (N/2)log2(N) complex <b>multiplications</b> (again, ignoring simplifications of <b>multiplications</b> by 1 and similar) and Nlog2(N) complex additions. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other {{than the speed of}} arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (see, e.g., Frigo & Johnson, 2005), but the overall improvement from O(N2) to O(NlogN) remains.|$|R
