5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty.

The good will is unique in that it is always good and <b>maintains</b> <b>its</b> moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E
