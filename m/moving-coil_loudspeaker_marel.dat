40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a time-domain {{technique for}} synthesizing acoustic impedance at the diaphragm of a loudspeaker using a proportional-plus-derivative output feedback. The dynamics of electroacoustic transducers such as <b>moving-coil</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> {{can be readily}} controlled either by direct feedback principle on acoustic quantities, or by plugging a shunt network at the electrical terminals. Any conventional loudspeaker first {{intended to be a}} sound transmitter may then become a versatile electroacoustic resonator capable of absorbing (or of reflecting as much) the incident sound energy in a frequency-dependent way by simple electronic controls. Instead of counteracting some unwanted sound by using superposition principle, as is the case for conventional active noise control, such actuator-based strategy aims at monitoring the reaction of a loudspeaker embedded into walls so as to control the proportion of reflected sound waves on this boundary. After a short description of the dynamics of <b>moving-coil</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> giving emphasis on the advantage of electromechanical coupling reversibility, a proportionalplus-derivative output feedback combined to a feed-forward action is proposed for synthesizing of desired acoustic impedance. As a conclusion, the overall performance of the proposed method is presented along with computed results and general discussions on practical implementation. 1...|$|R

From around 1954, the plant began to modernise and focus exclusively on telephone and microphone production. In 1957, Oktava small telephones and moving coil radial loudspeakers were displayed in the Russian section at the 1958 exhibition in Brussels. In 1961 Oktava introduced the D2 miniature telephone and began supplying dynamic microphones to the Kremlin. The plant also commenced a second round of modernisation and began producing electro-acoustic measuring instruments to test microphones and telephones.|$|R

40|$|<b>Moving-coil</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> are {{appropriate}} drivers for thermoacoustic refrigeration. They are cheap, commercially available, compact, light, {{and can be}} adapted to meet specific requirements. This paper deals with the optimization of loudspeakers for thermoacoustic refrigeration. Using an electrical model that describes the refrigerator, it is concluded that the electroacoustic efficiency can be maximized over a wider frequency range by matching the mechanical resonance frequency of the driver to the acoustic resonance frequency of the resonator. A gas-spring system is introduced as a practical tool to shift the mechanical resonance frequency of the driver. An electroacoustic efficiency of 35 % is obtained when the mechanical resonance frequency of the driver and the acoustic resonance frequency are equal. Additionally, the efficiency is constant over a relatively wide frequency range. This has advantages for thermoacoustic refrigeration. During cool-down, the operating acoustic frequency decreases so that the refrigerator will keep near the optimum performance...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a variety}} of needs in room acoustics, such as the control of {{ventilation}} noise, adjustment of reverberation time and selective enhancement of echos over some frequency bands. All these call for a tunable sound absorber. This work describes an electro-acoustic method to design such an absorber, which is here described as an acoustic filter. The absorber consists of a <b>moving-coil</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> diaphragm backed by a cavity. When incident noise pushes the diaphragm, it moves and its structural damping consumes some sound energy. An RLC shunt circuit is attached to the moving coil giving an electrically induced mechanical impedance that alters the acoustic behaviour of the shunted loudspeaker. By manipulating component values of the shunt RLC circuit, the absorber drains noise at flexibly chosen frequency bands and at any assigned absorption levels, much like designing an electronic filter. The essential part of the theory is validated by experiment. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|As {{agricultural}} and wine interests developed {{north of the}} city limits, much of the light industry, banking, commercial and retail activity in the county evolved within the city of Napa and in earlier times along the Napa River through the historic downtown. Napa Glove Factory was established in 1903 and was the largest plant of its kind west of Chicago. The owners, Raymond brothers, went to Gloversville, New York. They wore sandwich boards to recruit the relocation of immigrant southern Italian workers. The surnames Greco and Lui are some of the many Napa families that followed this chain migration to work at factory jobs in the town, not to own land for farming. Edwin Pridham and Peter L. Jensen invented the <b>moving-coil</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> in 1915 in their Napa workshop while working on an improvement for the telephone receiver. Pridham and Jensen went on to found the Magnavox Company in 1917. In the late 19th century and early 20th century Napa was known for having the largest red-light district for a California city of its size. In 1905, Napa had brothels primarily concentrated on and around Clinton Street.|$|R
40|$|There are two {{concentrations}} in this project. One {{is to explore}} the possibility to construct negative acoustic impedance by electronic techniques, {{and the other is}} to see whether such method can be utilized to build effective sound absorber using electromagnetic actuator (here we adopt the <b>moving-coil</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> as sample) with a shunt circuit. Our study begins with analytical analysis, and the result shows {{that it is impossible to}} gain independent control of basic acoustic impedance components (mass, stiffness and damping) by simple circuits. Two alternative designs are put forward as a compromise. One is the series circuit with NIC to simulate the negative acoustic impedance, and another is the series-parallel circuit with NIC. Theoretical prediction shows that we can indeed obtain broadband negative mass and local negative stiffness by these two types of circuits, and that we can achieve broadband noise control with simple electronic shunt circuits despite fact that completely independent control over each parameter is not possible. We argue that these conclusions represent significant technological and economic advantage worthy of further development. All analytical results are validated by experiments with satisfactory agreement. The sample loudspeaker with shunt circuit is tested with acoustic impedance tube. The rig consists of a DC powered op-amp circuit and a loudspeaker. An efficient Matlab code controls the excitation sound generation and data acquisition with AD/DA cards. Two typical and most interesting results are summarized here. In the first, a series type circuit with NIC is used to construct negative equivalent mass and local (banded in frequency domain) negative stiffness. We experimentally demonstrated that it is rather easy to reduce original mass of the loudspeaker to half of its original value and it could be reduced to almost zero. This is evidenced by a very flat sound absorption coefficient curve from 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. The second circuit is a series-parallel circuit. It’s an improved design from the first type. This type of circuit can, to a certain extent, decouple the stiffness and mass controls. The results show that we can reduce mass globally (in the frequency domain) and stiffness at low frequencies. The original mass of the sample loudspeaker is almost eliminated and the stiffness at low frequencies is reduced too. In terms of the spectrum of sound absorption coefficient, it manifests itself through a broadband absorption with prominent improvement in the low frequency region. Finally, potential applications for our designs are discussed. A tunable low frequency resonance absorber is designed. Prediction results point out that, by choosing the right parameters of the circuit, we can achieve 100 % absorption at any given low frequency. Thin absorber is another potential application. With the same dimension, the performance of a thin absorber is much better than that of the standard sound absorption construction. A 90 % noise absorption from 300 Hz- 600 Hz and 50 % absorption from 250 Hz- 1000 Hz is achieved by our new design. The dimension can be further reduced in theory. Finally, a broad-band absorber with 50 % or more absorption over 80 Hz- 1000 Hz is demonstrated. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
