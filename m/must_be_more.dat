5|$|Using a wheelchair, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan) {{continues}} to order Bree (Marcia Cross) around at his whim {{and refuses to}} let her give him a bath. When Orson refuses to say please while Bree brings him breakfast, she places the waffles on a shelf he cannot reach. When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. The therapist tells Bree she <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective of a life in which he needs {{to ask for help}} in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> to the story, refusing {{to believe a}} pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E

In general, the thrust-to-weight ratio is numerically equal to the g-force that the vehicle can generate. Take-off can occur when the vehicle's g-force exceeds local gravity (expressed as a multiple of g0).|$|E
25|$|Structures {{as defined}} above are {{sometimes}} called s to distinguish them from the more general s. A many-sorted structure can have an arbitrary number of domains. The sorts {{are part of the}} signature, and they play the role of names for the different domains. Many-sorted signatures also prescribe on which sorts the functions and relations of a many-sorted structure are defined. Therefore, the arities of function symbols or relation symbols <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> complicated objects such as tuples of sorts rather than natural numbers.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the other}} {{functional}} mutations are believed to result in hypoexcitability. The R859C mutation, for example, has a more depolarized voltage dependence of activation, meaning that the membrane <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> depolarized for the channel to open. This mutant also recovers more slowly from inactivation. The nonfunctional channels are believed to produce similar changes in cell excitability. Likewise, many of the nonsense mutations likely result in nonfunctional channels and hypoexcitability, though this {{has yet to be}} tested. It is also unclear how this membrane hypoexcitability leads to the GEFS+ phenotype.|$|E
25|$|The legend {{may result}} {{from the fact that}} the daddy long-legs spider preys upon deadly venomous spiders, such as the redback, a member of the black widow genus Latrodectus. To the extent that such entomological {{information}} was known to the general public, it was perhaps thought that if the daddy long-legs spider could kill a spider capable of delivering fatal bites to humans, then it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> venomous, and the uncate fangs were regarded as prohibiting it from killing people. In reality, it is able to cast lengths of silk onto its prey, incapacitating them from a safe distance.|$|E
25|$|See {{the image}} for the {{biological}} {{life cycle of}} the hookworm where it thrives in warm earth where temperatures are over 18°C. They exist primarily in sandy or loamy soil and cannot live in clay or muck. Rainfall averages <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than 1000mm (40inches) a year for them to survive. Only if these conditions exist can the eggs hatch. Infective larvae of Necator americanus can survive at higher temperatures, whereas those of Ancylostoma duodenale are better adapted to cooler climates. Generally, they live {{for only a few}} weeks at most under natural conditions, and die almost immediately on exposure to direct sunlight or desiccation.|$|E

25|$|Two {{landmark}} U.S. Supreme Court cases changed {{tenure in}} 1972: (i) Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 US 564; and (ii) Perry v. Sindermann, 408 US 593. These two cases {{held that a}} professor’s claim to entitlement <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than a subjective expectancy of continued employment. Rather, {{there must be a}} contractual relationship or a reference in a contract to a specific tenure policy or agreement. Further, the court held that a tenured professor who is discharged from a public college has been deprived of a property interest, and so due process applies, requiring certain procedural safeguards (the right to personally appear in a hearing, the right to examine evidence and respond to accusations, the right to have advisory counsel).|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out until you have the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{recorded}} with Queen singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, including a demo of [...] "State of Shock", [...] "Victory" [...] and [...] "There <b>Must</b> <b>Be</b> <b>More</b> to Life Than This". The recordings were intended for {{an album of}} duets but, according to Queen's then-manager Jim Beach, {{the relationship between the}} singers soured when Jackson insisted on bringing a llama into the recording studio.
