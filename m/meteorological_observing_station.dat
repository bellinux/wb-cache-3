5|$|Typhoon Gay first {{affected}} the Marshall Islands, striking several atolls in the archipelago with typhoon-force winds. On Mejit Island, the first island to be affected, the typhoon destroyed every wooden structure and left {{most of the}} islanders homeless. High winds downed all of the island's trees and destroyed 75% of the crops. Nearby, Ailuk Atoll experienced similar winds, though house damage was minor despite similar crop losses. The large wind field extended to the south, affecting Maloelap and Aur atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of Majuro experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and cuts to the water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the Marshall Islands International Airport for two days. On Ujae Atoll, the typhoon destroyed an automated <b>meteorological</b> <b>observing</b> <b>station</b> that had been installed in 1989. The typhoon left over 5,000people homeless across the country, {{but there were no}} native deaths and only one injury in the archipelago owing to well-executed warnings and preparations. However, large waves from the typhoon sank a boat in a small lagoon, killing one of the boat's two sailors.|$|E

40|$|Clouds {{represent}} {{a major source}} of uncertainty in understanding climate change, because potential changes in the way they affect the atmospheric and surface energy budget are difficult to predict. It is therefore important to determine how clouds affect radiation. Stratiform clouds in particular have an important effect on climate as they cover large areas. This article presents results of radiation transfer calculations with MODTRANTM for well-defined stratus cloud cases detected at the meteorological station of Payerne, Switzerland. These stratus situations are selected in a data set covering the years from 2000 to 2005 with a method using data widely available at national <b>meteorological</b> <b>observing</b> <b>stations.</b> For 18 single layer stratus situations the shortwave radiation fluxes calculated with MODTRANTM are compared to surface observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) site at Payerne and top of atmosphere (TOA) observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) experiment. A median bias on the order of 20 Wm&minus; 2 (TM. Based on the present results, the absorbance was calculated within the stratus cloud layer (cloud base to cloud top). For the 18 single stratus layer situations the median absorbance is 0. 07 [minimum 0. 04, maximum 0. 1], the median transmittance is 0. 29 [0. 15 0. 39], and the median cloud reflectance is 0. 70 [0. 63, 0. 80]...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCrop {{protection}} forecasting models currently use <b>meteorological</b> data <b>observed</b> at <b>stations</b> {{to produce}} pest infection and development indices. The indices are then extrapolated {{to the regional}} level by assuming that the weather conditions at the stations {{are similar to those}} in neighbouring fields in the region, which is not necessarily the case. Hence, this has {{a significant impact on the}} quality of the recommendations and diagnoses based on computerized plant protection models. The regionalization of model outputs between the stations comprising the weather network, using geostatistical techniques such as cokriging in conjunction with satellite data, is a worthwhile approach for addressing this need. The objective of this study is to develop and apply a methodology for regionalization of infection indices produced by two crop protection models contained in the CIPRA (Computer Centre for Agricultural Pest Forecasting) system, using geostatistical tools and NOAA-AVHRR images. This approach will help enhance our crop pest management and forecasting capabilities while optimizing the use of pest control products in vegetable crops in Quebec. To achieve our objective, a cokriging method was applied to regionalize the model outputs using air temperature and relative humidity estimated from NOAA-AVHRR images. The results were then validated against a regionalization approach using ordinary kriging and two conventional interpolation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{fires are}} a {{critical}} natural disturbance {{in most of}} the forested ecosystems around the globe, including the Canadian boreal forest where fires are recurrent. Here, our goal was to develop a new daily-scale forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS) using remote sensing data and implement it over the northern part of Canadian province of Alberta during 2009 – 2011 fire seasons. The daily-scale FFDFS was comprised of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) -derived four-input variables, i. e., 8 -day composite of surface temperature (TS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized multiband drought index (NMDI); and daily precipitable water (PW). The TS, NMDI, and NDVI variables were calculated during i period and PW during j day and then integrated to forecast fire danger conditions in five categories (i. e., extremely high, very high, high, moderate, and low) during j + 1 day. Our findings revealed that overall 95. 51 % of the fires fell under “extremely high” to “moderate” danger classes. Therefore, FFDFS has potential to supplement operational meteorological-based forecasting systems in between the <b>observed</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> and remote parts of the landscape...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{described}} as the most universal and irreversible environmental problem facing the planet Earth. While climate change is already manifesting in Ethiopia through changes in temperature and rainfall, its magnitude is poorly studied at regional levels. The objective {{of this paper was}} to assess and quantify the magnitude of future changes of climate parameters using Statistical Downscaling Mode (SDSM) version 4. 2 in Amhara Regional State which is located between 8 ° 45 ‘N and 13 ° 45 ‘N latitude and 35 ° 46 ‘E and 40 ° 25 ‘E longitude. Daily climate data (1979 - 2008) of rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures were collected from 10 <b>observed</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>stations</b> (predictand). The stations were grouped and compared using clustering and Markov chain model, whereas the degree of climate change in the study area was estimated using the coupled HadCM 3 general circulation model (GCM) with A 2 a emission scenarios (Predictors). Both maximum and minimum temperatures showed an increasing trend; the increase in mean maximum temperature ranges between 1. 55 °C and 6. 07 °C and that of the mean minimum temperature ranges from 0. 11 °C and 2. 81 °C. While the amount of annual rainfall and rainy days decreased in the study Regions in the 2080 s.

40|$|Abstract. Drought {{represents}} a combined heat-precipitation extreme {{and has become}} an increasingly frequent phenomenon in recent years. In order to access the entire analysis of drought, {{it is necessary to}} include the analysis of several types of drought. In this paper, impacts of meteorological and agricultural drought were analyzed across the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Agricultural Rainfall Index (ARI) on the territory of Serbia for the period from 1980 to 2010. For both types of drought, year 2000 is notable as the year when most of the <b>observed</b> <b>stations</b> had the highest drought intensity. It was found that meteorological drought for year 2000 has a higher intensity in the central and southeastern parts of the country, {{as well as in the}} north.
