40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to retrospectively study the feasibility for using truck transponder data to produce freight corridor performance measures (travel times) and real-time traveler information. To support this analysis, weigh-in-motion data {{from each of the}} twenty-two stations in Oregon were assembled, processed, and uploaded in the WIM data archive is housed under the Portland Transportation Archive Listing (PORTAL) umbrella at Portland State University’s Intelligent Transportation Systems Lab. Nearly 42, 000, 000 truck records were successful uploaded to the archive dating back to July 2005. Two separate algorithms necessary for this research were scripted, tested, and validated. The closest stations are 38. 3 miles apart; the greatest are 258 miles apart. The first algorithm matched transponders between of all vehicles in a time window between the upstream and downstream stations. The second algorithm filtered these <b>matches</b> for through <b>trucks.</b> The filter was validated by comparing estimated travel times during a winter weather-induced delay. The analysis showed that corridor-level travel times for trucks for 2007 and 2008 could be generated from the archived data. To explore the feasibility using these same data for real-time traveler information, ground truth probe vehicle data were collected. Travel time estimates from the WIM data and the probes were used to establish a simple linear relationship between passenger car and truck performance. It was concluded that the long distances between stations was a primary challenge to directly adapting the WIM data to real-time use. Recommendations were given on increased sensor spacing and filter improvement. Finally, potential performance metrics for station level, <b>matched</b> <b>trucks,</b> and filtered <b>matched</b> <b>truck</b> data were shown...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of re-identifying commercial trucks based on vehicle-attribute data automatically collected by sensors installed at traffic data collection stations. To support this work, archived data from weigh-in-motion (WIM) stations in Oregon are used for developing, calibrating, and testing vehicle re-identification algorithms. The vehicle re-identification methods developed in this research consist of two main stages. In the first stage, each vehicle from the downstream station is matched to the most “similar” upstream vehicle by using a Bayesian model. In the second stage, several methods are introduced to screen out those vehicles that cross the downstream site but not the upstream site and to tradeoff accuracy versus {{the total number of}} vehicles being matched. These methods involve calculating both the highest and the second highest similarity measures for each vehicle being matched. It is demonstrated that the proposed screening approach improves the accuracy of the re-identification methods significantly. The models are applied to the truck data collected by WIM sensors at three stations in Oregon, which together create two different “links” that are 125 and 145 miles long, respectively. It is observed that the algorithms can <b>match</b> <b>trucks</b> with approximately 90 % accuracy while the total number of <b>trucks</b> being <b>matched</b> at this accuracy level is about 95 % of the actual common trucks that cross both upstream and downstream sites. These methods allow the user to trade-off the accuracy vs. total vehicles being matched by adjusting a threshold parameter. For example, <b>trucks</b> can be <b>matched</b> with 98 % accuracy if one is willing to match about 40 % of all common trucks. It is also found that when travel times of vehicles between the upstream and downstream sites exhibit larger variation, mismatch rate increases. Overall, for estimating travel times and origin-destination flows between two WIM sites, the methods developed in this project can be used to effectively match commercial vehicles crossing two data collection sites that are separated by long distances...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In Thailand {{pickup truck}} {{is the most}} popular vehicle both for {{individual}} and organization. Manufacturing sector also uses pickup trucks to delivery products. Empty truck run is a major problem for transportation sector which increases transportation cost and inefficient use of energy. This paper attempts to present the information gathered from the survey and to provide general characteristics of pickup truck runs in manufacturing sector. More than 95 percent of backhaul trips using pickup truck were empty. Information of truck trips from each factory is the key point to lower empty miles by joint transportation processes. The survey showed that if the information of empty truck runs was shared and the <b>matching</b> of <b>truck</b> trips was carried out, a total empty mile of 15, 161 kilometers out of 220 pairs of matching backhaul trips, or 15. 36 percent of total truck runs, could be saved.

40|$|Trends in truck freight {{energy use}} and carbon {{emissions}} In {{the age of}} global supply chains and "just in time" logistics, fast and efficient goods movement is often seen as an economic imperative. Growth in global goods movement not only translates into growth in commercial trucking activity but also into growth in the share of trucking compared to other modes of in-country freight transportation. These trends {{have a significant impact}} on the energy intensity of freight transport. Using a bottom-up approach relying on national data, this study compares the energy intensity of truck freight in Australia, France, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States from 1973 to the present. The analysis builds on previous work by Schipper et al. (1997) and Schipper and Marie-Lilliu (1999) decomposing energy use for freight. Intensity is expressed in terms of vehicle intensity (megajoules/vehicle-kilometer), modal energy intensity (megajoules/tonne-kilometer), and carbon intensity (grams/tonne-km). The cross-country comparison highlights in part the influence of geography, transportation infrastructure, and truck utilization patterns on energy and carbon intensity from this sector. While improving fuel economy of individual vehicles is very important, large reductions in trucking energy use and emissions will also come from better logistics and driving, higher load factors, and better <b>matching</b> of <b>truck</b> capacity to load.

50|$|Investigators {{initially}} believed Amy Bechtel to {{have fallen}} victim to the elements or potentially attacked by a bear or mountain lion; however, law enforcement later suspected Bechtel's husband, Steve, after uncovering a series of his journals describing violence towards women, and specifically, Amy.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether feed trucks and feed could be sources of Salmonella contamination in swine operations. Materials: Five hundred forty-nine swab samples {{were taken from}} approximately 25 different places in the grain box on 22 different feed trucks and cultured for Salmonella spp. In addition, {{a sample of the}} feed components from 17 of those trucks was cultured for the presence of Salmonella. Results: Culture of both truck swab and feed samples indicate that Salmonella was present on five of the 22 (22. 7 %) trucks. A total of 549 swabs were cultured and the rate of isolation was 0. 7 % (four of 549 positive for Salmonella). Positive swabs were recovered from three trucks for a recovery rate of 13. 6 %. Feed was submitted for 17 of 22 trucks and Salmonella was recovered from four of 17 samples (23. 5 %). However, positive swabs and feed samples only <b>matched</b> for two <b>trucks.</b> No trucks had been used to transport livestock within the past 30 days nor were any trucks cleaned or disinfected between loads. Implications: While sample prevalence of Salmonella in feed trucks is low (0. 7 %), the overall contamination rate for feed trucks is much higher (22. 7 %). The presence of positive feed samples suggests that feed could be a source of Salmonella contamination for swine...|$|R
