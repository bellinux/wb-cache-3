25|$|The diesel {{version of}} the TRAXX {{platform}} was introduced with the 2E {{version of the}} TRAXX platform. In the diesel version, the fuel tank occupies the same space as the transformer in the electric versions, centrally and below the <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> members. Installed motor power is 2.2MW. The diesel and electric TRAXX locomotives share the same driver cabin and control desk, body, bogies, and drive system. The maximum tractive effort is slight reduced by 30kN to 270kN due to the lower power of the diesel engine.|$|E
25|$|The TRAXX carbody {{design and}} {{internal}} configuration was modified again in 2006 {{when the first}} actual Diesel-electric version was built, to provide the same layout for Diesel and electric versions. In the electric versions, the central location of the diesel engine {{was used for the}} AC transformer or the DC chokes. The weight of the component at the central location is supported on a horizontal mounting plate that fits onto the <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> using the same fixtures. This generation of the family is also referred to as the TRAXX2E platform, the type designations themselves didn't change. The TRAXX2E generation also included the first actual deliveries of the DC versions of the TRAXX platform. The AC version of the TRAXX2 remained in production in parallel with the 2E versions of other types.|$|E
25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of <b>main</b> <b>frame,</b> eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} discuss {{the three most}} {{important}} strategic framing choices by political actors ("substantive emphasis choice," "oppositional emphasis choice," and "contest emphasis choice") of direct-democratic campaigns. The authors investigate these strategic framing choices in the media input and look at how the political actors change their choices in another communication channel (political advertisement) and over time. The results provide the following insights: First, political actors tend to emphasize one to two <b>main</b> <b>frames</b> in their media input. They generally also use their <b>main</b> <b>frames</b> in the political advertisements and stay on their <b>main</b> <b>frames</b> over time. Second, although political actors tend to emphasize their own frames, they do not exclusively revert to this behavior. The authors find that the political actors pay more attention to their opponents’ frames in the media input than in the ads. With regard to variation over time, the authors can state that campaign dialogue does not disappear {{over the course of the}} campaign. Third, framing is primarily accomplished in substantive terms. In the advertisements and toward the end of the campaign, the authors do not find more contest frames...|$|R
25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is one of}} the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore {{processing}} plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to gyrate. The vertical spindle is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the main shaft is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.|$|E
500|$|The {{panel is}} made from six {{horizontal}} boards linked by butt joins reinforced with a cylindrical rod, with the joins glued with plant fibres. The reverse is not painted, indicating {{it was intended to}} hang against a wall. The frame comprises a <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> nailed and screwed at the side to two outer parts. The borders do not show signs of having hinges, indicating that the work was meant as a stand-alone panel, and not as part of a triptych. The corners are assembled with mortise and tenon. Each corner is reinforced by two pegs. The boards were originally painted a uniform brown, and were degraded by gloss and overprint over the centuries. Following a series of restorations, mainly by Jef Van der Veken in 1933-34 and Edmond Florens in 1977, they are in good condition. The inscriptions were placed on flat strips between the mouldings.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{development}} for the Telefunken <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> [...] began in 1965, Mallebrein and his team {{came up with the}} idea of [...] "reversing" [...] the existing [...] into a moveable mouse-like device, so that customers did not have to be bothered with mounting holes for the earlier trackball device. Together with light pens and trackballs, it was offered as an optional input device for their system since 1968. Some Rollkugel mouses installed at the [...] in Munich in 1972 are well preserved in a museum. Telefunken considered the invention too unimportant to apply for a patent on it.|$|E
5|$|The {{engine was}} mounted on two <b>main</b> support <b>frames</b> that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The <b>main</b> <b>frames</b> were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|R

2500|$|The ACTWU {{represented}} {{workers in}} the most vulnerable industries, clothing and textile and instead of opposing trade and economic integration in general, it advocated {{for the inclusion of}} strong labor and environmental protections in the <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> of the proposed treaty in order to protect and raise the standard of living of workers affected by the agreement in all three countries, the US, Mexico and Canada. In the early 1990s La Luz became one of the leading voices in debating these topics in many forums sponsored by one of the major Latino organizations in the country, the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project before NAFTA was ratified. [...] La Luz engaged in a cross-country discussion with important political figures such as Felipe Calderón long before he became President of Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Walking beam engines {{remained}} {{popular with}} American shipping lines and excursion operations {{right into the}} early 20th century. Although the walking beam engine was technically obsolete in the later 19th century, it remained popular with excursion steamer passengers who expected to see the [...] "walking beam" [...] in motion. There were also technical reasons for retaining the walking beam engine in America, as {{it was easier to}} build, requiring less precision in its construction. [...] Wood could be used for the <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> of the engine, at a much lower cost than typical practice of using iron castings for more modern engine designs. Fuel was also much cheaper in America than in Europe, so the lower efficiency of the walking beam engine was less of a consideration. The Philadelphia shipbuilder Charles H. Cramp blamed America's general lack of competitiveness with the British shipbuilding industry in the mid-to-late 19th century upon the conservatism of American domestic shipbuilders and shipping line owners, who doggedly clung to outdated technologies like the walking beam and its associated paddlewheel long after they had been abandoned {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> of the {{skyscraper}} rises 36 stories, {{capped by}} two asymmetric spires, one extending for four additional stories. The roof {{height of the}} building is 496ft (151m), the top floor is 489 feet (149m), and the spire reaches 632ft (192.6m). Its nickname, Cathedral of Finance, alludes both to the building's resemblance to a cathedral, with its tower over the main entrance and octagonal apse {{at the opposite end}} and to New York City's Woolworth Building, which had earlier been dubbed the Cathedral of Commerce. Native American themes are common inside and outside the building. Wirt C. Rowland, of the Smith, Hinchman & Grylls firm, was the building's architect. The building rises from a granite and stone six story base with two Corrado Parducci created sculptures flanking the Griswold Street entrance. The exterior blends brickwork with tile, limestone, and terra cotta. Rowland's attention to detail was meticulous. He supervised the creation of the colored brick cladding to achieve the desired color for the exterior. Afterward, the brick was marketed by the manufacturer as [...] "Union Trust Brick" [...] and after 1939, as Guardian brick". Rowland designed furniture for the bank's offices and his attention went as far as designing tableware, linens and waitress uniforms for a restaurant in the building.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>main</b> <b>frame</b> story {{concerns}} Shahryār [...] ( [...] , from Middle Persian šahr-dār, lit. [...] "holder of realm"), {{whom the}} narrator calls a [...] "Sasanian king" [...] ruling in [...] "India and China". He is {{shocked to learn}} that his brother's wife is unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she {{has a chance to}} dishonour him. Eventually the vizier, whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade ( [...] , from Middle Persian čehr/lineage + āzād/noble), the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins (and only begins) a new one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of this tale, postpones her execution once again. So it goes on for 1,001 nights.|$|E
2500|$|Built in 1880 (Beyer, Peacock works number 2038) {{and named}} after the Manx Parliament, this {{locomotive}} has the dubious honour {{of being the first}} locomotive to have been withdrawn from service, as early as 1947 which accounts for the lack of photographs of her. [...] No. 7 {{was the first of the}} fleet to have sandboxes placed just ahead of the water tanks. [...] As a result, the shape of the feedwater pipe was changed from the original [...] "C" [...] shaped end to an [...] "S" [...] shape entering the boiler between the smokebox and first cladding ring, rather than between the first and second cladding rings. [...] The locomotive was involved in a collision with No. 10 G.H. Wood in 1928 and the frames were badly buckled at this time; owing to the large amount of work required to repair this, she was not selected for any further attention when withdrawn in 1947 and the locomotive dismantled. [...] Stripped down, the frames were stored on a siding at Douglas Station for many years, with the tanks and cab being stored separately and scrapped in 1974. Upon nationalisation, the remaining frames were purchased by what is now the Isle of Man Railway & Tramway Preservation Society and stored in the open air at Santon, later Castletown. Very little remains of them, other than the <b>main</b> <b>frame,</b> coal bunker, and buffer beams but they have however survived over the course of three decades and are an integral part of the railway's history. [...] In store off-site for a number of years, the frames were returned to public display on the goods platform at Castletown Station during November 2009. The frames have since been sent off Island and are now at the Southwold Railway.|$|E
