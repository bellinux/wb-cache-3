5000|$|Dujardin, a French {{biologist}} {{interested in}} protozoan evolution, recorded the morphological similarities of choanoflagellates and sponge choanocytes and proposed {{the possibility of}} a close relationship as early as 1841. Over the past decade, this hypothesized relationship between choanoflagellates and animals has been upheld by independent analyses of multiple unlinked sequences: 18S rDNA, nuclear protein-coding genes, and mitochondrial genomes (Steenkamp, et al., 2006; Burger, et al., 2003; Wainright, et al., 1993). Importantly, comparisons of mitochondrial genome sequences from a choanoflagellate and three sponges confirm the placement of choanoflagellates as an outgroup to Metazoa and negate the possibility that choanoflagellates evolved from metazoans (Lavrov, et al., 2005). Finally, recent studies of genes expressed in choanoflagellates have revealed that choanoflagellates synthesize homologues of <b>metazoan</b> <b>cell</b> signaling and adhesion genes. (King, 2003) Genome sequencing shows that, among living organisms, the choanoflagellates are most closely related to animals.Because choanoflagellates and metazoans are closely related, comparisons between the two groups promise to provide insights into the biology of their last common ancestor and the earliest events in metazoan evolution. The choanocytes (also known as [...] "collared cells") of sponges (considered among the most basal metazoa) have the same basic structure as choanoflagellates. Collared cells are found in other animal groups, such as ribbon worms, suggesting this was the morphology of their last common ancestor. The last common ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates was unicellular, perhaps forming simple colonies; in contrast, the last common ancestor of all eumetazoan animals was a multicellular organism, with differentiated tissues, a definite [...] "body plan", and embryonic development (including gastrulation). The timing of the splitting of these lineages is difficult to constrain, but was probably in the late Precambrian, >.|$|E

40|$|Membrane fusion with vacuoles, the {{lysosome}} {{equivalent of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is among the best understood membrane fusion events. Our precise understanding of this fusion machinery stems from powerful genetics and elegant in vitro reconstitution assays. Central to vacuolar membrane fusion is the multi-subunit tether the HO motypic fusion and Protein Sorting (HOPS) complex, a complex of proteins that organizes other necessary components of the fusion machinery. We lack a similarly detailed molecular understanding of membrane fusion with lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles in metazoans. However, {{it is likely that}} fundamental principles of how rabs, SNAREs and HOPS tethers work to fuse membranes with lysosomes and related organelles are conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans. Here, we discuss emerging differences in the coat-dependent mechanisms that govern HOPS complex subcellular distribution between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans. These differences reside upstream of the membrane fusion event. We propose that the differences in how coats segregate class C Vps/HOPS tethers to organelles and domains of <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells</b> are adaptations to complex architectures that characterize <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells</b> such as those of neuronal and epithelial tissues...|$|R
40|$|The high {{fidelity}} of chromosome transmission in eukaryotes is achieved, in part, by {{the activity of}} the spindle checkpoint. This checkpoint monitors the status of chromosome-microtubule attachments and delays the onset of anaphase until all kinetochores have formed stable bipolar connections to the mitotic spindle. We have characterized the localization of the Bub and Mad spindle checkpoint proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells,</b> all known spindle checkpoint proteins are recruited to kinetochores during normal mitoses. In contrast, we show that whereas S. cerevisiae Bublp and Bub 3 p are bound to kinetochores early in mitosis as part of the normal cell cycle, Madlp and Mad 2 p are kinetochore-bound only in the presence of spindle damage or kinetochore lesions that interfere with chromosome-microtubule attachment. We propose that differences in the behavior of spindle checkpoint proteins in <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells</b> and budding yeast are due primarily to evolutionary divergence in spindle assembly pathways. The spindle checkpoint proteins Madlp and Mad 2 p exhibit perinuclear localization in both budding yeast and metazoans. We find that the perinuclear localization of Madlp i...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInhibition of GSK 3 by 7 -TM Wnt/wg {{receptor}} signaling {{is critical}} for specifying embryonic cell fate patterns. In Dictyostelium, the 7 -TM cAMP receptors regulate GSK 3 by parallel, antagonistic pathways to establish a developmental body plan. We describe here a novel tyrosine kinase, ZAK 1, downstream of 7 -TM cAMP receptor signaling that is required for GSK 3 activation during development. zak 1 -nulls have reduced GSK 3 activity and are defective in GSK 3 -regulated developmental pathways. Moreover, recombinant ZAK 1 phosphorylates and activates GSK 3 in vitro. We propose that ZAK 1 is a positive regulator of GSK 3 activity required for cell pattern formation in Dictyostelium and speculate that similar mechanisms exist to antagonize Wnt/wg signaling for <b>metazoan</b> <b>cell</b> fate specification...|$|E

In patients with exudative AMD, choroidal blood vessels grow through Bruch’s membrane into the subretinal space. This is followed by leakage and accumulation of serum or blood beneath the RPE, leading to retinal damage and rapid loss of vision [2]. Human ocular neovascularization may be caused or facilitated by altered expression of integrins [3, 4].

40|$|Cytokinesis in <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells</b> is {{mediated}} by an actomyosin-based contractile ring that assembles {{in response to}} activation of the small GTPase RhoA. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates RhoA during cytokinesis, ECT- 2, is highly regulated. In most <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells,</b> with the notable exception of the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, RhoA activation and furrow ingression require the centralspindlin complex. This exception {{is due to the}} existence of a parallel pathway for RhoA activation in C. elegans. Centralspindlin contains CYK- 4 which contains a predicted Rho family GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain. The function of this domain {{has been the subject of}} considerable debate. Some publications suggest that the GAP domain promotes RhoA activation (for example, Zhang and Glotzer, 2015; Loria, Longhini and Glotzer, 2012), whereas others suggest that it functions to inactivate the GTPase Rac 1 (for example, Zhuravlev et al., 2017). Here, we review the mechanisms underlying RhoA activation during cytokinesis, primarily focusing on data in C. elegans. We highlight the importance of considering the parallel pathway for RhoA activation and detailed analyses of cyk- 4 mutant phenotypes when evaluating the role of the GAP domain of CYK- 4...|$|R
40|$|Using {{computational}} modeling, {{we investigate}} mechanisms of signal transduction. We {{focus on the}} spindle assembly checkpoint, where a single unattached kinetochore is able to signal to prevent cell cycle progression. The inhibitory signal switches off rapidly once spindle microtubules have attached to all kinetochores. This requirement tightly constrains the possible mechanisms. Here we investigate two possible mechanisms for spindle checkpoint operation in <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells,</b> both supported by recent experiments. The first involves the free diffusion and sequestration of cell cycle regulators. This mechanism is severely constrained both by experimental fluorescence recovery data and by the large volumes involved in open mitosis in <b>metazoan</b> <b>cells.</b> By using a simple mathematical analysis and computer simulation, we find that this mechanism can generate the inhibition found in experiment but likely requires a two-stage signal amplification cascade. The second mechanism involves spatial gradients of a short-lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion but then primarily by active transport along spindle microtubules. We propose that both mechanisms may be operative in the metazoan spindle assembly checkpoint, with either able to trigger anaphase onset even without support from the other pathway...|$|R

Binding to lipid vesicles made from L-alpha-phosphatidyl-L-serine is enhanced in the presence of millimolar amounts of free calcium. ATPase activity remains unimpaired after vesicle association. Myosin II was also shown to remain in tight association with purified plasma membranes, even after depletion of actin.

40|$|Mitosis is {{a moment}} of {{exquisite}} vulnerability for a <b>metazoan</b> <b>cell.</b> Failure to complete mitosis accurately can lead to aneuploidy and cancer initiation. Therefore, if the exit from mitosis is delayed, normal cells are usually removed by apoptosis. However, how failure to complete mitosis activates apoptosis is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a phosphorylated form of the BH 3 -only protein Bid regulates apoptosis if mitotic exit is delayed. Bid is phosphorylated on serine 66 as cells enter mitosis, and this phosphorylation is lost during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable version of Bid or a BH 3 -domain mutant were resistant to mitotic-arrest-induced apoptosis. Thus, we show that Bid phosphorylation primes cells to undergo mitochondrial apoptosis if mitotic exit is delayed. Avoidance of this mechanism may explain the selective pressure for cancer cells to undergo mitotic slippage...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{alignment}} in {{the middle}} of the bipolar spindle is a hallmark of <b>metazoan</b> <b>cell</b> divisions. When we offset the metaphase plate position by creating an asymmetric centriole distribution on each pole, we find that metaphase plates relocate to the middle of the spindle before anaphase. The spindle assembly checkpoint enables this centering mechanism by providing cells enough time to correct metaphase plate position. The checkpoint responds to unstable kinetochore-microtubule attachments resulting from an imbalance in microtubule stability between the two half-spindles in cells with an asymmetric centriole distribution. Inactivation of the checkpoint prior to metaphase plate centering leads to asymmetric cell divisions and daughter cells of unequal size; in contrast, if the checkpoint is inactivated after the metaphase plate has centered its position, symmetric cell divisions ensue. This indicates that the equatorial position of the metaphase plate is essential for symmetric cell divisions...|$|E
