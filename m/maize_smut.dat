5000|$|Maize head smut {{occurs in}} most maize-growing areas, {{including}} many regions of North America, Australia, Asia, and southern Europe. It causes tremendous loss of yield during outbreaks {{due to the}} replacement of the ear with large smut sori. [...] To infect maize roots, S. reilianum f. sp. zeae must form a dikaryotic parasitic hypha which results for the mating of two compatible haploid strains. The infection always occurs in soil via the root, unlike Ustilago maydis, another <b>maize</b> <b>smut,</b> which infects maize plants via aerial parts. Temperatures of 23-30 °C are optimal for field infection of corn, suspected to be due to maximum teliospore germination.|$|E
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PMT, KRE 2 /MNT 1, and MNN 1 mannosyltransferase protein {{families}} catalyze {{the steps}} of the O-mannosylation pathway, sequentially adding mannoses to target proteins. We have identified members of all three families and analyzed their roles in pathogenesis of the <b>maize</b> <b>smut</b> fungus Ustilago maydis. Furthermore, we have shown that PMT 4, one of the three PMT family members in U. maydis, is essential for tumor formation in Zea mays. Significantly, PMT 4 seems to be required only for pathogenesis and is dispensable for other aspects of the U. maydis life cycle. We subsequently show that the deletion of pmt 4 results in a strong reduction in the frequency of appressorium formation, with the few appressoria that do form lacking the capacity to penetrate the plant cuticle. Our findings suggest that the O-mannosylation pathway {{plays a key role in}} the posttranslational modification of proteins involved in the pathogenic development of U. maydis. The fact that PMT homologs are not found in plants may open new avenues for the development of fungal control strategies. Moreover, the discovery of a highly specific requirement for a single O-mannosyltransferase should aid in the identification of the proteins directly involved in fungal plant penetration, thus leading to a better understanding of plant–fungi interactions...|$|E
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how cell cycle regulation and virulence are coordinated during the induction of fungal pathogenesis is limited. In the <b>maize</b> <b>smut</b> fungus Ustilago maydis, pathogenesis and sexual development are intricately interconnected. Furthermore, {{the first step in}} the infection process is mating, and this is linked to the cell cycle. In this study, we have identified a new G 1 cyclin gene from U. maydis that we have named cln 1. We investigated the roles of Cln 1 in growth and differentiation in U. maydis and found that although not essential for growth, its absence produces dramatic morphological defects. We provide results that are consistent with Cln 1 playing a conserved role in regulating the length of G 1 and cell size, but also additional morphological functions. We also present experiments indicating that the cyclin Cln 1 controls sexual development in U. maydis. Overexpression of cln 1 blocks sexual development, while its absence enables the cell to express sexual determinants in conditions where wild-type cells were unable to initiate this developmental program. We conclude that Cln 1 contributes to negative regulation of the timing of sexual development, and we propose the existence of a negative crosstalk between mating program and vegetative growth that may help explain why these two developmental options are incompatible in U. maydis...|$|E
50|$|Sporisorium reilianum {{causes the}} {{diseases}} <b>maize</b> head <b>smut</b> and sorghum head smut. This soil borne smut fungus has two formae speciales. S. reilianum f. sp. reilianum is specific to sorghum and S. reilianum f. sp. zeae is specific to maize. It is unknown why the two formae speciales cannot form spores on their respective non-favored hosts.|$|R
40|$|A {{suppression}} subtractive hybridization (SSH) {{approach was}} used to generate cDNA libraries representing genes differentially expressed in the haploid cells of the <b>maize</b> head <b>smut</b> pathogen Sporisorium reilianum exposed to GR 24, a strigolactone analogue. Strigolactones are present in root exudates and {{have been known to}} trigger germination of parasitic plant seeds and signal mycorrhizal fungi to connect to root systems forming mutualistic relationships. Cell respiration increased within 1 h after GR 24 addition, but decreased after 5 and 8 h. All induced cells were used to construct a cDNA library, which contained 1440 clones. The cDNA ESTs were deposited on macro-array membranes and hybridized with P 32 cDNA probes obtained from mRNA isolated from S. reilianum yeast cultures exposed or not to 100 nM GR 24 for three time intervals. A total of 678 ESTs were identified as differentially expressed during three time-courses in response to GR 24. A set of 36 candidate genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR that presented an induction of the genes at 1 h, confirming the hybridization data. Induced genes mostly affect catalysis functions (45 %) like cell respiration (27 %), and cell signaling (26 %). Although the biological significance of this perception remains hypothetical, these results indicate that strigolactones could have a wider biological influence in the rhizosphere than previously recognized...|$|R
40|$|Ustilago maydis is a biotrophic {{pathogen}} causing <b>maize</b> (Zea mays) <b>smut</b> disease. Transcriptome profiling {{of infected}} maize plants {{indicated that a}} gene encoding a putative cystatin (CC 9) is induced upon penetration by U. maydis wild type. By contrast, cc 9 is not induced after infection with the U. maydis effector mutant Δpep 1, which elicits massive plant defenses. Silencing of cc 9 resulted in a strongly induced maize defense gene expression and a hypersensitive response to U. maydis wild-type infection. Consequently, fungal colonization was strongly reduced in cc 9 -silenced plants, while recombinant CC 9 prevented salicylic acid (SA) -induced defenses. Protease activity profiling revealed a strong induction of maize Cys proteases in SA-treated leaves, which could be inhibited by addition of CC 9. Transgenic maize plants overexpressing cc 9 -mCherry showed an apoplastic localization of CC 9. The transgenic plants showed a block in Cys protease activity and SA-dependent gene expression. Moreover, activated apoplastic Cys proteases induced SA-associated defense gene expression in naïve plants, which could be suppressed by CC 9. We show that apoplastic Cys proteases play {{a pivotal role in}} maize defense signaling. Moreover, we identified cystatin CC 9 as a novel compatibility factor that suppresses Cys protease activity to allow biotrophic interaction of maize with the fungal pathogen U. maydis...|$|R
40|$|The <b>maize</b> <b>smut</b> fungus Ustilago maydis {{switches}} from yeast to hyphal {{growth to}} infect maize (Zea mays) plants. This switching is promoted by mating of compatible cells {{and seems to}} be required for plant penetration. Although many genes distinctively expressed during this dimorphic switch have been identified and shown to be essential for the infection process, none seems to be explicitly required for polar growth control. Here, we report the characterization of pcl 12, encoding a cyclin that interacts specifically with Cdk 5, an essential cyclin-dependent kinase with regulatory roles in morphogenesis in U. maydis. Pcl 12 fulfills the requirements to be a virulence-specific regulator of polar growth in U. maydis. First, pcl 12 expression is induced during the pathogenic development. Secondly, Pcl 12 is sufficient to induce hyperpolarized growth in U. maydis cells, as haploid cells overexpressing pcl 12 in axenic conditions produce filaments that were morphologically indistinguishable from those produced during the infection process. Finally, cells defective in pcl 12 showed impaired polar growth during the formation of the b-dependent filament, the induction of the conjugation tubes, or the formation of a promycelium in spore germination. However, in spite of this pivotal role during morphogenesis, pcl 12 mutants were virulent. We discuss the implications of these results for the role of polar growth during the infection process...|$|E
40|$|In {{the genome}} of the biotrophic plant {{pathogen}} Ustilago maydis, {{many of the}} genes coding for secreted protein effectors modulating virulence are arranged in gene clusters. The vast majority of these genes encode novel proteins whose expression is coupled to plant colonization. The largest of these gene clusters, cluster 19 A, encodes 24 secreted effectors. Deletion of the entire cluster results in severe attenuation of virulence. Here we present the functional analysis of this genomic region. We show that a 19 A deletion mutant behaves like an endophyte, i. e. is still able to colonize plants and complete the infection cycle. However, tumors, the most conspicuous symptoms of <b>maize</b> <b>smut</b> disease, are only rarely formed and fungal biomass in infected tissue is significantly reduced. The generation and analysis of strains carrying sub-deletions identified several genes significantly contributing to tumor formation after seedling infection. Another of the effectors could be linked specifically to anthocyanin induction in the infected tissue. As the individual contributions of these genes to tumor formation were small, we studied the response of maize plants to the whole cluster mutant {{as well as to}} several individual mutants by array analysis. This revealed distinct plant responses, demonstrating that the respective effectors have discrete plant targets. We propose that the analysis of plant responses to effector mutant strains that lack a strong virulence phenotype may be a general way to visualize differences in effector function...|$|E
40|$|Secreted fungal effectors mediate plant-fungus {{pathogenic}} interactions. These proteins {{are typically}} N-glycosylated, a common posttranslational modification affecting their location and function. N-glycosylation {{consists of the}} addition, and subsequent maturation, of an oligosaccharide core in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. In this article, we show that two enzymes catalyzing specific stages of this pathway in <b>maize</b> <b>smut</b> (Ustilago maydis), glucosidase I (Gls 1) and glucosidase II β-subunit (Gas 2), are essential for its pathogenic interaction with maize (Zea mays). Gls 1 {{is required for the}} initial stages of infection following appressorium penetration, and Gas 2 is required for efficient fungal spreading inside infected tissues. While U. maydis Δgls 1 cells induce strong plant defense responses, Δgas 2 hyphae are able to repress them, showing that slight differences in the N-glycoprotein processing can determine the extent of plant-fungus interactions. Interestingly, the calnexin protein, a central element of the ER quality control system for N-glycoproteins in eukaryotic cells, is essential for avoiding plant defense responses in cells with defective N-glycoproteins processing. Thus, N-glycoprotein maturation and this conserved checkpoint appear {{to play an important role}} in the establishment of an initial biotrophic state with the plant, which allows subsequent colonization. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} {{study of the}} {{resistance}} of early maize genotypes, 44 lines, and hybrids in 2008 and 30 genotypes in 2009 in RCBD were conducted at Karaj and Esfa-han Stations. All of the ears were inoculated by tip injection method at suitable time. In-oculation was carried out with syringe (3 ml/each ear) at silking stage. Evaluation was done on ears 3 - 4 weeks after inoculation. The results of variance analysis and mean comparison showed {{that there is a}} different reaction among material to disease. In this study, after har-vesting of ears, the resistance of each genotype was determined based on disease severity index (0 - 7). Among examined lines in 2008, line no. (41) (KE 77004 / 1 - 1 - 1) was specified as susceptible and no. (28 and 42) (KE 77003 / 1 - 8 - 1) and (37 A) as resistant lines. Also among hybrids, K SC 400 was identified as resistant hybrid. Also, among lines in 2009, line no. (29) (KE 77004 / 1 - 1 - 1) was specified as susceptible and line no. (27) (KE 77005 / 4) as resistant line respectively. Among hybrids, hybrid no.

40|$|Importance {{of maize}} and {{production}} constrains Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) disease is “a looming threat unlike anything farmers have ever faced before”i {{especially in the}} Eastern and Central Africa (ECA) region where maize is an important staple and food security crop. About 90 % of the regional population depends on maize for food, labor and income. Maize production {{in the region is}} constrained by both biotic and environmental factors. The abiotic factors include drought, low use of farm inputs especially fertilizers, low soil fertility, low rates of adoption of new technologies and in-appropriate agronomic practices. The main biotic factors include infestation by weeds particularly striga spp and insect pests such as the maize stalk borers, soil pests like termites, nematodes, cutworms, and chaffer grubs. Diseases include Grey leaf spot, Northern leaf blight, rusts, different types of rots (root, stalk and ear), <b>smuts,</b> <b>Maize</b> streak virus and Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) disease. Other biotic factors include wildlife damage on crops that neighbor forested areas, birds and post-harvest losses. Managing these constraints has been a continuous process involving different stakeholders in the maize industry and production was on the increase with the introduction of different maize varieties which met different consumers. However, the emerging of MLN disease in the region has thrown everyone back to the drawing board. Maize Lethal Necrosis Disease Maize lethal necrosis disease was first reported in the ECA region in Kenya in the year 2011 (Adams et al., 2012; Wangai et al., 2012). The following year, MLND was reported in all the major maize growing districts of Kenya. The disease has since spread to other ECA countrie...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to study climate change and its impacts on major crops production in Khotang district of Nepal. The effect of climate variables on crops yield and farmers` respond to climate change {{in the last eight}} to ten years were studied and analyzed. Monthly precipitation data in Aiselukharka, Kuruleghat, Khotangbajar and Diktel; and monthly minimum and maximum air temperatures data in Okhaldhunga, Chainpur East and Udayapur Gadhi available from the Department of Hydrology and meteorology in Nepal were used to study their annual and seasonal trends. Time-series annual yield data in maize, paddy, wheat, millet and potato were collected from the District Agriculture Development Office Khotang. The linear trends in various sites were computed to study the climate variations whereas multiple regressions were used to study the relationships between climate variables and crop yields. Focal group discussions, key informants interviews, household survey and field observations were carried out in Bamrang Khola micro-watershed in Khotang district as an empirical survey. Variations in temperatures and precipitations trends were observed in different sites. There was a tendency towards increased mean air temperature and a tendency towards a decreased yearly precipitation in Khotang district; however, these trends were not significant. Yields have increased for most crops and this is likely to be related with improved management practices, increased use of fertilizers and pesticides. The significant effects of climate variables were observed in maize and wheat yields. The yield of maize has a negative relationship with minimum air temperature and a positive relationship with maximum air temperature whereas the yield of wheat has positive relationships with maximum air temperature and precipitation, and a negative relationship with minimum air temperature. Farmers’ perceptions in Bamrang Khola micro-watershed revealed that the changes have been observed in frequencies, durations and intensities in monsoon and winter rainfall, fogs, snowfalls and storms. The impacts of these changes have resulted in increased attack of white grub in roots and <b>maize</b> <b>smut</b> in cobs, rice blast in panicle and stem, rust and blight disease and grain borer in wheat, red ants in potato. Farmers adapt to these changes by altering crop management practices as sowing time, sowing methods, weeding practices, varieties and in the methods of irrigation practices. M-IE...|$|E
40|$|The plant {{pathogen}} Ustilago maydis is the causative agent of <b>maize</b> <b>smut</b> disease {{and serves as}} a model system to study plant-fungal interactions. In this pathogen, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade controls mating, invasive growth and virulence on maize plants. The key players for infection-related processes and pathogenicity are the conserved mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) Kpp 2 and Kpp 6. Specifically, the MAP kinase Kpp 2 is involved in appressorium development while Kpp 6 is required for penetration of plant epidermal cells. Neither for Kpp 2 nor for Kpp 6 have the immediate downstream phosphorylation targets been identified. The aim of this work was to identify crucial virulence factors which act downstream of the MAP kinases Kpp 2 and Kpp 6. To artificially induce MAP kinase signaling we used the strain FB 1 fuz 7 DD in which a constitutive active allele of the MAP kinase-kinase Fuz 7 (Fuz 7 DD) is expressed under the control of an arabinose inducible promoter. Using a phospho-proteomic approach we detected phosphorylated proteins upon induction of the MAP kinase cascade in the presence and absence of kpp 2 and kpp 6. Enrichment of phosphorylated proteins involved a two-step chromatographic procedure, using Al(OH) 3 -based metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC), tryptic digestion of enriched phospho-proteins, and TiO 2 -based MOAC for phospho-peptide enrichment. LC-MS/MS analysis of the phospho-peptide fraction yielded 111 potential MAP kinase substrates that were differentially phosphorylated in strains FB 1 fuz 7 DD and FB 1 Δkpp 6 Δkpp 2 fuz 7 DD. Fifteen of these differentially phosphorylated proteins, that could possibly be targets of Kpp 2 and Kpp 6, were selected for further studies based on extensive bioinformatic analysis. To assess a possible contribution of the selected genes to mating and virulence, the respective genes were deleted in a solopathogenic strain and for some of the genes also in compatible haploid strains. Analysis of the respective deletions strains showed that, um 12335 was required for virulence. Subsequent studies suggest that Um 12235 is a microtubule-associated protein that is a direct substrate of the MAP kinase Kpp 2 and/or Kpp 6...|$|E
