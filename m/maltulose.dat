50|$|This {{variability}} in ancestral specificity {{has not only}} been observed between different genes, but also within the same gene family. In light of {{the large number of}} paralogous fungal α-glucosidase genes with a number of specific maltose-like (maltose, turanose, maltotriose, <b>maltulose</b> and sucrose) and isomaltose-like (isomaltose and palatinose) substrates, a study reconstructed all key ancestors and found that the last common ancestor of the paralogues was mainly active on maltose-like substrates with only trace activity for isomaltose-like sugars, despite leading to a lineage of iso-maltose glucosidases and a lineage that further split into maltose glucosidases and iso-maltose glucosidases. Antithetically, the ancestor before the latter split had a more pronounced isomaltose-like glucosidase activity.|$|E
40|$|Spores of {{the fungus}} Myrothecium verrucaria are cryptic to maltose and isomaltose. Induction of a {{transport}} {{system can be}} effected by several sugars whose order of effectiveness is: turanose > <b>maltulose</b> > sucrose > d-arabinose, d-fructose, nigerose, maltotriulose, kestose > melezitose, raffinose, nystose, and stachyose. The transport system is not specific to maltose and isomaltose, and it is apparently identical to an induced trehalose permease described previously. Induction of the permease is markedly influenced by spore age—older spores being more responsive. Pure maltose is not absorbed by spores. Absorption of commercial reagent-grade maltose is due to permease induction by <b>maltulose</b> as an impurity. <b>Maltulose</b> contamination of maltose was demonstrated by charcoal column chromatography and comparison of its physical, chemical, and permease-inductive properties with those of authentic <b>maltulose.</b> Maltose accumulates temporarily in spores after absorption and then decreases, although no conversion to glucose can be detected. Although spores contain small quantities of maltase, metabolism of maltose may be via some nonhydrolytic pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} {{occurring in}} disaccharide-casein reaction mixtures during heating at 120 degreesC and pH 6. 8 were studied. The existence of two main degradation routes were established: (1) Isomerisation of the aldose sugars lactose and maltose in their ketose isomers lactulose and <b>maltulose,</b> respectively, and subsequent degradation. Lactulose was degraded into galactose and formic acid, whereas <b>maltulose</b> was degraded into glucose and formic acid among other unidentified reaction compounds. (2) The Maillard reaction, {{in which the}} aldose sugars and sugar degradation products react with the protein, eventually leading {{to the formation of}} brown compounds. Based on these reactions a kinetic model was built and extensively tested using multiresponse modelling. The iterative process of kinetic modelling-proposing a model, confronting it with experiments and criticising the model-was passed through several times. The final kinetic model was able to describe the observed changes in reactants and products and allowed a quantitative prediction of reactions in heated disaccharide-casein systems.

40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae is {{presently}} unique among bac-terial species {{in its ability}} to metabolize not only sucrose but also its five linkage-isomeric -D-glucosyl-D-fructo-ses: trehalulose, turanose, <b>maltulose,</b> leucrose, and pal-atinose. Growth on the isomeric compounds induced a protein of molecular mass 50 kDa that was not present in sucrose-grown cells and which we have identified as an NAD and metal ion-dependent 6 -phospho [...] glucosi-dase (AglB). The aglB gene has been cloned and se-quenced, and AglB (Mr 49, 256) has been purified from a high expression system using the chromogenic p-nitro-phenyl -glucopyranoside 6 -phosphate as substrate. Phospho [...] glucosidase catalyzed the hydrolysis {{of a wide variety of}} 6 -phospho [...] glucosides including malt-ose- 6 -phosphate, maltitol- 6 -phosphate, isomaltose- 6...|$|E
40|$|Volatile {{composition}} and carbohydrate content of Spanish honey samples from uncommon botanical origins {{have been studied}} by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. About 100 volatile compounds were identified; some of them appeared to be characteristic of particular honey types, such as methyl salycilate in willow (Salix spp.), 2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 2, 4 -cycloheptadien- 1 -one (eucarvone) in almond tree (Prunus dulcis) and isophorone in strawberry-tree (Arbutus unedo). Concentration ranges for major carbohydrates {{were similar to those}} previously reported in other honeys with different botanical origins, although concentrations of <b>maltulose</b> in avocado honeys (Persea americana) and of melezitose in Quercus ilex honeys were higher. Some carbohydrate alcohols could also be considered as markers of honey botanical origin, such as quercitol for Q. ilex and perseitol for avocado. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Fusobacterium mortiferum {{utilizes}} sucrose [glucose-fructose in a(1 ! 2) linkage] and {{its five}} isomeric a-D-glucosyl-D-fructoses as energy sources for growth. Sucrose-grown cells are induced for both sucrose- 6 -phosphate hydrolase (S 6 PH) and fructokinase (FK), {{but the two}} enzymes are not expressed above constitutive levels during growth on the isomeric compounds. Extracts of cells grown previously on the sucrose isomers trehalulose a(1 ! 1), turanose a(1 ! 3), <b>maltulose</b> a(1 ! 4), leucrose a(1 ! 5) and palatinose a(1 ! 6) contained high levels of an NADM plus metal-dependent phospho-a-glucosidase (MalH). The latter enzyme was not induced during growth on sucrose. MalH catalysed the hydrolysis of the 6 H-phosphorylated derivatives of the five isomers to yield glucose 6 -phosphate and fructose, but sucrose 6 -phosphate itself was not a substrate. Unexpectedly, MalH hydrolysed both a- and b-linked stereomers of the chromogenic analogue p-nitrophenyl glucoside 6 -phosphate. The gene malH is adjacent to malB and malR, which encode an EII(CB) component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar:phosphotransferase system and...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that NIR might {{be capable of}} discriminating one floral source from another was explored. No prior analysis of NIR for New Zealand honeys has been reported. A visual inspection of the NIR spectra of ten New Zealand honey types indicates that beech honeydew honey is significantly different from nectar honeys. Rata honey is the most unique nectar honey with very little variability seen in the NIR spectra compared to other honey types. Both beech honeydew and rata honey can be distinguished from other floral types using Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) on selected wavelengths. A degree of clustering within other honey types is achieved, however none of these are fully resolved. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) model successfully classified all main New Zealand unifloral honeys with an average correct classification of 93 %. 100 % of all beech honeydew honeys were correctly classified with close to 100 % achieved for rata, kamahi, manuka, rewarewa and clover honeys. Honeys with a clover contribution: tawari, thyme, nodding thistle and vipers‟ bugloss displayed reduced performance in this model with a proportion of samples misclassified as clover honey. These {{results indicate that the}} NIR spectra evaluated using a PLS model would be an effective industry classification method for the identification of New Zealand unifloral honeys with the exception of nodding thistle and vipers‟ bugloss honeys. A multi-technique classification model incorporating NIR classification results with conductivity, colour and sugar analysis has been proposed. A series of compounds in manuka honey were examined in respect to UMF activity. The carbohydrate profiles of 38 manuka honeys of varying UMF activity were determined using a combination of HPLC, GC-FID and GC-MS. A method was developed to determine the proportion of nigerose, turanose, maltose and <b>maltulose</b> in reduced and silylated honey using the ratio of m/z 307 to m/z 308 ion responses as determined by GC-MS-SIM. An examination of the glucose and fructose concentrations in manuka honey revealed a moderate correlation between the glucose/fructose ratio and UMF activity. Due to an improvement in chromatographic resolution, the peak assignment of three disaccharides (cellobiose, laminaribiose and gentibiose) differed from that of a previous investigation. Despite the retention time of palatinose being identical to the corresponding peak in honey, an examination of the mass spectra provided strong evidence to suggest that the corresponding honey disaccharide is α- 1 → 2 linked as opposed to β- 1 → 6 linked and that it was therefore unlikely that this peak arose from palatinose. The mono and disaccharide composition of manuka honey was evaluated with respect to the level of UMF activity. Linear Discriminant analysis successfully distinguished between high, moderate and low UMF activity honeys. Glucose was identified as the single most important compound in the discriminant model. The connection between glucose concentration and UMF activity was not unexpected as a significant proportion of UMF activity has been attributed to the presence of methyl glyoxal, a degradation product of glucose. The existences of indicator compounds in honeys from various floral origins were examined. The extractable organic substances of five New Zealand honeys: beech honeydew honey, kamahi, pohutukawa, rata and tawari were determined by GC-MS of methylated extracts. This survey confirmed the results of a previous investigation and established ranges for marker compounds. Due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient certified unifloral honeys, previous studies on these honey types were exploratory only and not published. Statistical analysis of the extractable organic substances showed that each honey contains a unique fingerprint of compounds. Agglomerative clustering successfully separated all honeys into the correct floral group with the exception of two samples. Well separated clusters were produced in the score plot of the first and second Linear Discriminants. 4 -Hydroxyphenylacetic acid, salicylic acid, indole- 3 -acetic acid and an unknown compound (identified by characteristic ions in the mass spectra) were identified as being the most important discriminants, all of which were present in a single floral source...|$|E
