5|$|Exeter {{had been}} badly damaged {{in the battle}} with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire {{arrived on the scene}} shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Juliette {{can be traced}} back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September12. After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming steadily better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September27 and convection steadily increased; around 0000UTC on September19, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette. Turning northwest as a result of an upper-level trough, the system attained its peak with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mb (hPa; 29.44inHg) at 1200UTC on September30. Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter, causing it to steadily weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000UTC on October2. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low. The low meandered several hundred <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October5.|$|E

5|$|On 25 January 1942 U-105 left Lorient on {{her fifth}} patrol. On 31 January she sank the British warship , part of Convoy SL-98, {{south-west}} of Ireland, and, on 5 February 1942, she rescued seven men from a crashed German Dornier Do 24 350 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> France. U-105 returned to Lorient on 8 February. Seventeen days later, on 25 February, U-105 left Lorient. Between 25 and 27 March, she sank the British merchant ship Narragansett and the Norwegian merchant ship Svenør off {{the east coast}} of the United States. U-105 returned to Lorient on 15 April after spending 50 days in the North Atlantic, and left on another patrol on 7 June. While crossing the Bay of Biscay, she was attacked by an Australian Short Sunderland aircraft from No. 10 Squadron RAAF. U-105 sought shelter in Ferrol, Spain and did not leave until 28 June, when she departed for Lorient, which she reached on the 30th. The attack apparently caused serious damage, as she did not sail again until 23 November. During this period, Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Adolf Schweichel was put in command of the boat, but did not undertake any patrols and was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Jürgen Nissen, under whose command U-105 left Lorient.|$|E

25|$|In early 1995, the Philippines {{discovered}} a primitive Chinese military structure on Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands, {{one hundred and}} thirty nautical <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Palawan. The Philippine government issued a formal protest over China's occupation of the reef and the Philippine Navy arrested sixty-two Chinese fishermen at Half Moon Shoal, eighty kilometers from Palawan. A week later, following confirmation from surveillance pictures that the structures were of military design, President Fidel Ramos had the military forces in the region strengthened. He ordered the Philippine Air Force to dispatch five F-5 fighters backed by four jet trainers and two helicopters, while the navy sent two additional ships. The People’s Republic of China had claimed that the structures were shelters for fishermen but these small incidents could have triggered {{a war in the}} South China Sea.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30 PM on {{the evening}} of Saturday June 8, 1990, an {{explosion}} in the cargo room of the Norwegian oil tanker the Mega Borg “ruptured the bulkhead between the pump room and the engine room”, causing the ship to catch fire and begin to leak oil. The 853-foot-long, 15-year-old vessel was about 50 <b>miles</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> Galveston, Texas when the explosion occurred. The weather at the time was calm and the tanker had easily passed Coast Guard safety inspections in April earlier that year. While the direct cause of the engine room explosion remains unknown, the initial blast occurred during a lightening process in which the Mega Borg was transferring oil onto a smaller Italian tanker, the Fraqmura, in order to then transport the oil to Houston. This transfer was necessary, as the Mega Borg was too large to dock at the Texas port. Three million gallons of the total 38 million gallons of light Angolan Palanca crude oil on board the tanker were able to be transferred to the Fraqmura before the blast.|$|E

While located about [...] east-southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, the storm weakened {{back to a}} Category1 hurricane. A high pressure system over Atlantic Canada caused Alma to turn east-southeastward, while weakening to a tropical storm on August30. Later that day, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while situated about [...] south-southeast of the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia. The high pressure system also caused the extratropical remnants to execute a cyclonic loop between August31 and September2.

40|$|The {{sailfish}} {{fisheries chart}} {{is a tool}} to determine the concentration areas and movement patterns of schools that are incidentally caught during migration for reproduction by boats that target mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) and tunas (Thunnus atlanticus and T. albacares). There are 350 boats regularly operating in that studied area of <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>coast.</b> That information is based on logbooks and is related to four migratory cycles observed from 2002 to 2006. A model developed by COPPE/UFRJ was used for making the fisheries chart.
