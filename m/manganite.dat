To {{come closer to}} the {{understanding}} of its nature, we discuss its three important features : 1) correlation between magnetization and electrical resistivity in the same temperature range; 2) detection of chemical constitution and the arrangement of Mn 3 + and Mn 4 + ions at different hole concentrations; and 3) how electrical current flows through double exchange in <b>manganites.</b> The first feature will be discussed for three-dimensional manganies. The features 2 and 3 are inscrutable in three-dimensional <b>manganites.</b> So they will be discussed for one-dimensional <b>manganites</b> and then generalized.
