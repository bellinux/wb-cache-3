5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach {{that focuses on}} a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use of}} radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the <b>metabolome.</b> Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
25|$|The English-language {{neologism}} omics informally {{refers to}} a field of study in biology ending in -omics, such as genomics, proteomics or metabolomics. The related suffix -ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the genome, proteome or <b>metabolome</b> respectively. The suffix -ome as used in molecular biology {{refers to a}} totality of some sort; similarly omics has come to refer generally {{to the study of}} large, comprehensive biological data sets. While the growth {{in the use of the}} term has led some scientists (Jonathan Eisen, among others) to claim that it has been oversold, it reflects the change in orientation towards the quantitative analysis of complete or near-complete assortment of all the constituents of a system. In the study of symbioses, for example, researchers which were once limited to the study of a single gene product can now simultaneously compare the total complement of several types of biological molecules.|$|E

If this is the case, we expect that closely related species of pines will tend to reach similar metabolomic solutions to the same environmental stressors. We examined the <b>metabolomes</b> of two sympatric subspecies of Pinus sylvestris in Sierra Nevada (southern Iberian Peninsula), in summer and winter and exposed to folivory by the pine processionary moth. The overall <b>metabolomes</b> differed between the subspecies but both tended to respond more similarly to folivory. The <b>metabolomes</b> of the subspecies were more dissimilar in summer than in winter, and iberica trees had higher concentrations of metabolites directly related to drought stress. Our {{results are consistent with}} the notion that certain plant metabolic responses associated with folivory have been phylogenetically conserved. The larger divergence between subspecies <b>metabolomes</b> in summer is likely due to the warmer and drier conditions that the northern iberica subspecies experience in Sierra Nevada. Our results provide crucial insights into how iberica populations would respond to the predicted conditions of climate change under an increased defoliation in the Mediterranean Basin...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of fungal {{secondary}} <b>metabolomes</b> {{has become}} a challenge due to the industrial applications of many of these molecules, and also due to the emergence of fungal threats to public health and natural ecosystems. Given that, the aim {{of the present study was}} to develop an untargeted method to analyze fungal secondary <b>metabolomes</b> by combining high-accuracy mass spectrometry and double isotopic labeling of fungal <b>metabolomes.</b> The strain NRRL 35693 of Aspergillus fumigatus, an important fungal pathogen, was grown on three wheat grain substrates: (1) naturally enriched grains (99 % 12 C), (2) grains enriched 96. 8 % with 13 C, (3) grains enriched with 53. 4 % with 13 C and 96. 8 % with 15 N. Twenty-one secondary metabolites were unambiguously identified by high-performance liquid chromatography−high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC−HRMS) analysis. AntiBase 2012 was used to confirm the identity of these metabolites. Additionally, on the basis of tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) experiments, it was possible to identify for the first time the formula and the structure of fumigaclavine D, a new member of the fumigaclavines family. Post biosynthesis degradation of tryptoquivaline F by methanol was also identified during HPLC− HRMS analysis by the detection of a carbon atom of nonfungal origin. The interest of this method lies not only on the unambiguous determination of the exact chemical formulas of fungal secondary metabolites but also on the easy discrimination of nonfungal products. Validation of the method was thus successfully achieved in this study, and it can now be applied to other fungal <b>metabolomes,</b> offering great possibilities for the discovery of new drugs or toxins...|$|R

5000|$|Because an organism’s <b>metabolome</b> {{is largely}} defined by its genome, {{different}} species will have different metabolomes. Indeed, {{the fact that}} the <b>metabolome</b> of a tomato is different than the <b>metabolome</b> of an apple is the reason why these two fruits taste so different. Furthermore, different tissues, different organs and biofluids associated with those organs and tissues can also have distinctly different metabolomes. The fact that different organisms and different tissues/biofluids have such different metabolomes has {{led to the development of}} a number of organism-specific of biofluid-specific <b>metabolome</b> databases.

40|$|The trophic {{interactions}} of entomopathogenic fungi in different ecological niches viz., soil, plants, or insect themselves are effectively regulated by their maneuvered <b>metabolomes</b> and {{the plethora of}} metabotypes. In this article, we discuss a holistic framework of co-evolutionary <b>metabolomes</b> and metabotypes to model the {{interactions of}} biocontrol fungi especially with mycosed insects. Conventionally, the studies involving fungal biocontrol mechanisms are reported {{in the context of}} much aggrandized fungal entomotoxins while the adaptive response mechanisms of host insects are relatively overlooked. The present review asserts that the selective pressure exerted among the competing or interacting species drives alterations in their overall <b>metabolomes</b> which ultimately implicates in corresponding metabotypes. Quintessentially, metabolomics offers a most generic and tractable model to assess the fungal-insect antagonism in terms of interaction biomarkers, biosynthetic pathway plasticity, and their co-evolutionary defense. The fungi chiefly rely on a battery of entomotoxins viz., secondary metabolites falling in the categories of NRP's (non-ribosomal peptides), PK's (polyketides), lysine derive alkaloids, and terpenoids. On the contrary, insects overcome mycosis through employing different layers of immunity manifested as altered metabotypes (phenoloxidase activity) and overall <b>metabolomes</b> viz., carbohydrates, lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, and eicosanoids. Here, we discuss the recent findings within conventional premise of fungal entomotoxicity and the evolution of truculent immune response among host insect. The metabolomic frameworks for fungal-insect interaction can potentially transmogrify our current comprehensions of biocontrol mechanisms to develop the hypervirulent biocontrol strains with least environmental concerns. Moreover, the interaction metabolomics (interactome) in complementation with other -omics cascades could further be applied to address the fundamental bottlenecks of adaptive co-evolution among biological species...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>metabolome</b> {{refers to}} the {{complete}} set of small-molecule chemicals found within a biological sample. [...] The biological sample can be a cell, a cellular organelle, an organ, a tissue, a tissue extract, a biofluid or an entire organism. The small molecule chemicals found in a given <b>metabolome</b> may include both endogenous metabolites that are naturally produced by an organism (such as amino acids, organic acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, amines, sugars, vitamins, co-factors, pigments, antibiotics, etc.) as well as exogenous chemicals (such as drugs, environmental contaminants, food additives, toxins and other xenobiotics) that are not naturally produced by an organism. In other words, there is both an endogenous <b>metabolome</b> and an exogenous <b>metabolome.</b> The endogenous <b>metabolome</b> can be further subdivided to include a [...] "primary" [...] and a [...] "secondary" [...] <b>metabolome</b> (particularly when referring to plant or microbial metabolomes). A primary metabolite is {{directly involved in the}} normal growth, development, and reproduction.

Secondary metabolites may include pigments, antibiotics or waste products derived from partially metabolized xenobiotics. To qualify as a metabolite, or to be considered {{to be part of the}} <b>metabolome,</b> a small molecule must typically have a molecular weight <1500 Da.

We have set-up a robust quantitative metabolomics platform that allows the analysis of 'snapshot' <b>metabolomes.</b> In this study, we have applied this platform for the comprehensive analysis of the metabolite composition of Pseudomonas putida S 12 grown on four different carbon sources, i. e. fructose, glucose, gluconate and succinate. This paper focuses on the microbial aspects of analyzing comprehensive <b>metabolomes,</b> and demonstrates that <b>metabolomes</b> can be analyzed reliably. The technical (i. e. sample work-up and analytical) reproducibility was on average 10 %, while the biological reproducibility was approximately 40 %. Moreover, the energy charge values of the microbial samples generated were determined, and indicated that no biotic or abiotic changes had occurred during sample work-up and analysis. In general, the metabolites present and their concentrations were very similar after growth on the different carbon sources. However, specific metabolites showed large differences in concentration, especially the intermediates involved in the degradation of the carbon sources studied. Principal component discriminant analysis was applied to identify metabolites that are specific for, i. e. not necessarily the metabolites that show those largest differences in concentration, cells grown on either of these four carbon sources. For selected enzymatic reactions, i. e. the glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase and phosphoglyceromutase reactions, the apparent equilibrium constants (Kapp) were calculated. In several instances a carbon source-dependent deviation between the apparent equilibrium constant (K app) and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (Keq) was observed, hinting towards a potential point of metabolic regulation or towards bottlenecks in biosynthesis routes. For glucose- 6 -phosphate isomerase and phosphoglyceromutase, the Kapp was larger than Keq, and the results suggested that the specific enzymatic activities of these two enzymes were too low to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium in growing cells. In contrast, with triosephosphate isomerase the Kapp was smaller than Keq, and the results suggested that this enzyme is kinetically controlled. © The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|R
