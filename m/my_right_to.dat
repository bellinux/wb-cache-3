500|$|On February 2, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Williams would travel to the United States to have heart surgery. The move raised questions about the quality and availability of health care services and procedures in Canada's health care system. According to Deputy Premier Kathy Dunderdale, [...] "It was never an option offered to him to have this procedure done in this province." [...] Dunderdale refused to answer how the procedure would be paid for, or whether the procedure could have been scheduled to be performed in another province of Canada. On February 8, 2010, it {{was reported}} that Williams' surgery had been successful. On his return, Williams later defended his choice saying: [...] "I did not sign away <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> get the best possible health care for myself when I entered politics". Williams said although he had [...] "the utmost confidence" [...] in his own province's health care system, his decision was to go to Mount Sinai Medical Center, Miami to undergo [...] "a very specialized piece of surgery [...] somebody who's doing this {{three or four times a}} day, five, six days a week." ...|$|E

[...] "If those men bought what they thought were the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> this island, they were defrauded, that's all! And that has {{absolutely}} nothing <b>to</b> do with <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> this land!" ...|$|R

"Oh," [...] {{she cried}} that night, [...] "would but Elizabeth {{be content to}} let me resign <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> son, making them secure to him, and then let me retire to some convent in Lorraine, or in Germany, or {{wherever}} she would, so would I never trouble her more!" ...|$|R

Now, I can't draw back my claim without {{throwing}} the mine open to anybody, but I'm willing to hold on and trade <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> you when I've got my improvements in. Of course, you'd {{have to make it}} worth while, but I'm not going to be unreasonable." ...|$|R
500|$|Edward {{continued}} {{to pay for}} the gardeners, insurance and upkeep of the fort in the initial years following his abdication, because it was his wish that he would return there. His possessions from the fort were transferred to the Château de la Croë in the south of France (where he had named the sitting room [...] "The Belvedere") in the spring of 1938, but many were damaged in transit. Edward was informed in March 1940 that the fort was no longer in his possession as his warrant to occupy the grace and favour residence had expired on the termination of his reign and was not to be renewed by the present sovereign, his brother, now George VI. Edward was greatly upset by this, writing in 1940 that [...] "It is crystal clear that this proposed reserving of the Fort by the use of Crown Lands {{is nothing more than a}} piece of bluff, and the first excuse that the king has been able to find to deprive me of <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> occupy the place should I ever desire to do so..." [...] Edward believed that the incident was an example of his 'brother's failure to keep his word to me' after the fort had apparently been reserved for him if he should reside once more in England.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 September 2008 the Jerusalem District Court announced: [...] "In {{light of}} (Vanunu's) ailing {{health and the}} absence of claims that his actions put the country's {{security}} in jeopardy, we believe his sentence should be reduced." [...] Vanunu said his health is fine and that, [...] "The issue is about <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be free, <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> speak and <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> leave the state." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palestinian {{president}} Mahmoud Abbas {{was born}} in Safed and left with his family when tensions arose in 1948. In 2012, he publicly stated, [...] "I visited Safed before once. I want to see Safed. It's <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> see it, but not to live there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Allenby {{wrote on}} 25 January: [...] "I want to extend <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> <b>to</b> include Jericho and the N of the Dead Sea." [...] This advance would remove {{the more serious}} threat to his right by pushing all the enemy across the Jordan River and {{securing}} the Jordan River crossings. It would also prevent raids into {{the country to the}} west of the Dead Sea and provide a narrow starting point for operations against the Hedjaz Railway.|$|E
2500|$|Kashgari {{described}} his intentions {{in terms of}} human rights: [...] "I view my actions as part of a process toward freedom. I was demanding <b>my</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> practice the most basic human rights—freedom of expression and thought—so nothing was done in vain. I believe I'm just a scapegoat for a larger conflict. There {{are a lot of people}} like me in Saudi Arabia who are fighting for their rights." [...] Kashgari described the status of women's rights in Saudi Arabia by stating that Saudi women [...] "won't go to hell 'because it's impossible to go there twice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{weather was}} {{beginning}} to improve and railways and roads were being repaired and developed. A lateral line of communication north of the Jaffa to Jerusalem road required the complete reconstruction of the track from Amwas through Beit Sira by the Egyptian Labour Corps. The standard gauge line reached Ludd and was within [...] of Allenby's headquarters [...] west of Ramleh. He wrote on 25 January: [...] "I want to extend <b>my</b> <b>right,</b> <b>to</b> include Jericho and the N. of the Dead Sea." [...] On 3 January two Australian aircraft discovered boats carrying corn and hay produced on the plains {{to the east and}} south-east of the Dead Sea for the forces at Amman. The boats moving from Ghor el Hadit (behind Point Costigan) and Rujm el Bahr at the northern end of the Sea were bombed and sprayed with bullets by the Australian aircraft which returned again and again until the boat service stopped.|$|E

6000|$|... "Stay, mamma; stay, madam!" [...] {{she cried}} out, {{with a gesture}} which was always appropriate, though rather theatrical; [...] "I have no heart, have I? I keep the secret of my mother's shame. I give up <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{half-brother}} and my bastard brother, yes, <b>my</b> <b>rights</b> and <b>my</b> fortune.
