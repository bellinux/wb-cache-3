40|$|Abstract Background Updated World Health Organization {{guidelines}} have amplified {{debate about}} how resource constraints should impact <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> for HIV-infected persons on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We estimated the incremental benefit and cost effectiveness of alternative <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> for east Africans with known HIV infection. Methods Using a validated HIV computer simulation based on resource-limited data (USAID and AMPATH) and circumstances (east Africa), we compared alternative <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> for HIV-infected persons newly started on cART. We evaluated clinical, immunologic and virologic <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies,</b> including combinations and conditional logic (e. g., only perform virologic testing if immunologic testing is positive). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in units of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. Costs were measured in 2008 US dollars, and {{costs and benefits}} were discounted at 3 %. We compared the ICER of <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> {{with those of other}} resource-constrained decisions, in particular earlier cART initiation (at CD 4 counts of 350 cells/mm 3 rather than 200 cells/mm 3). Results <b>Monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> employing routine CD 4 testing without virologic testing never maximized health benefits, regardless of budget or societal willingness to pay for additional health benefits. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> employing virologic testing conditional upon particular CD 4 results delivered the most benefit at willingness-to-pay levels similar to the cost of earlier cART initiation (approximately $ 2600 /QALY). <b>Monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> employing routine virologic testing alone only maximized health benefits at willingness-to-pay levels (> $ 4400 /QALY) that greatly exceeded the ICER of earlier cART initiation. Conclusions CD 4 testing alone never maximized health benefits regardless of resource limitations. Programmes routinely performing virologic testing but deferring cART initiation may increase health benefits by reallocating monitoring resources towards earlier cART initiation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective : To {{identify}} {{patient safety}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> in primary care. Design : Open-ended questionnaire survey. Participants/Setting : 113 healthcare professionals based in North-West London returned the survey {{from a group}} of 500 who were invited to participate achieving a response rate of 22. 6 per cent. Method : A paper-based and equivalent online survey was developed and subjected to multiple stages of piloting. Respondents were asked to suggest <b>strategies</b> for <b>monitoring</b> patient safety in primary care. These monitoring suggestions were then subjected to a content frequency analysis which was conducted by two researchers. Outcome measures: Respondent-derived <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies.</b> Results : In total, respondents offered 188 suggestions for monitoring patient safety in primary care. The content analysis revealed that these could be condensed into twenty-four different future <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> with varying levels of support.

50|$|Although {{pathogens}} are {{the primary}} focus of attention, the principal monitoring effort is almost always directed at much more common indicator species such as Escherichia coli, supplemented by overall coliform bacteria counts. The rationale behind this <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategy</b> is that most human pathogens originate from other humans via the sewage stream. Many sewage treatment plants have no sterilisation final stage and therefore discharge an effluent which, although having a clean appearance, still contains many millions of bacteria per litre, the majority of which are relatively harmless coliform bacteria. Counting the number of harmless (or less harmful) sewage bacteria allows a judgement to be made about the probability of significant numbers of pathogenic bacteria or viruses being present. Where E. coli or coliform levels exceed pre-set trigger values, more intensive monitoring including specific monitoring for pathogenic species is then initiated.|$|E

50|$|Continuous or quasi-continuous {{monitoring}} involves {{having an}} automated analytical facility {{close to the}} environment being monitored so that results can, if required, be viewed in real time. Such systems are often established to protect important water supplies {{such as in the}} River Dee regulation system but may also be part of an overall <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategy</b> on large strategic rivers where early warning of potential problems is essential. Such systems routinely provide data on parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and colour but it is also possible to operate gas liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry technologies (GLC/MS) to examine a wide range of potential organic pollutants. In all examples of automated bank-side analysis there is a requirement for water to be pumped from the river into the monitoring station. Choosing a location for the pump inlet is equally as critical as deciding on the location for a river grab sample. The design of the pump and pipework also requires careful design to avoid artefacts being introduced through the action of pumping the water. Dissolved oxygen concentration is difficult to sustain through a pumped system and GLC/MS facilities can detect micro-organic contaminants from the pipework and glands.|$|E
40|$|Ischemic stroke cause remains {{undetermined}} in 30 % of cases, {{leading to}} a diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) is {{a major cause of}} ischemic stroke but may go undetected with short periods of ECG monitoring. The Cryptogenic Stroke and Underlying Atrial Fibrillation trial (CRYSTAL AF) demonstrated that long-term electrocardiographic monitoring with insertable cardiac monitors (ICM) is superior to conventional follow-up in detecting AF in the population with cryptogenic stroke. We evaluated the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of various external monitoring techniques within a cryptogenic stroke cohort. Simulated intermittent <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> were compared to continuous rhythm monitoring in 168 ICM patients of the CRYSTAL AF trial. Short-term monitoring included a single 24 -hour, 48 -hour, and 7 -day Holter and 21 -day and 30 -day event recorders. Periodic monitoring consisted of quarterly monitoring through 24 -hour, 48 -hour, and 7 -day Holters and monthly 24 -hour Holters. For a single monitoring period, the sensitivity for AF diagnosis was lowest with a 24 -hour Holter (1. 3 %) and highest with a 30 -day event recorder (22. 8 %). The NPV ranged from 82. 3 % to 85. 6 % for all single external <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies.</b> Quarterly <b>monitoring</b> with 24 -hour Holters had a sensitivity of 3. 1 %, whereas quarterly 7 -day monitors increased the sensitivity to 20. 8 %. The NPVs for repetitive periodic <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> were similar at 82. 6 % to 85. 3 %. Long-term continuous monitoring was superior in detecting AF compared to all intermittent <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> evaluated (p < 0. 001). Long-term continuous electrocardiographic monitoring with ICMs is significantly more effective than any of the simulated intermittent <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategies</b> for identifying AF in patients with previous cryptogenic stroke...|$|R

50|$|All {{physical}} principles {{which are}} capable {{to provide information}} about the position of an object are suitable to serve as the starting basis for a sensor function. The ambient conditions prevailing during arc welding and also the requirements which are made by fully mechanised equipments have, however, many restrictions as a consequence. Figure 1 depicts the system overview. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>strategy</b> of the sensor (process or geometry) has been chosen as the superordinate criterion, the further subdivision is orientated on the measuring principle.A further distinctive feature of sensor systems is their design. Leading sensors are, thus, marked by the fact that measuring point and joining point are not located in the same position. Here, the measuring and joining process are mainly running in sequence. For making position-relevant statements about the welding process, those systems require calibration of the relative position. If process-oriented sensors are used, the measuring point and the joining point are identical.What the measuring principles all have in common is the fact that through the evaluation of the sensor signal, geometrical information about the joint and its relative position to the measuring head is provided. The individual active principles allow different processing speed for acquiring the information.|$|E
