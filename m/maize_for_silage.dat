40|$|Abstract. On a {{certified}} organic field {{a trial of}} the hull-less oat variety Mina was conducted, sown after peas-sunflower mixture, <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage,</b> and fallow. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of predecessors on the productivity and phytosanitary condition of hull-less oats in organic farming. The {{study was conducted in}} the period 2012 – 2014 under field conditions on leached, moderately loamy to slightly clayey smolniza at the Institute of Agriculture in Karnobat, Bulgaria, on a field certified for organic farming. The trial was conducted with spring hull-less oat, variety Mina. Predecessors – peas-sunflower mixture, <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> and fallow. Phytosanitary monitoring was conducted. The insect reporting was performed through direct investigation for plant pests. The weed reporting – species composition and density of weed infestation by a quantity-weight method, at the end of tillering and beginning of ear formation stage. Disease infestation was determined by walking through the plots during crop vegetation, by the route method, by inspection of the plants. The best predecessor for hull-less oats was fallow, followed by peas-sunflower mixture. The yield was high and the level of weed infestation was comparatively lower than after <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage.</b> During the studied period a tendency for the effect of predecessor on disease infestation was not formed.

40|$|<b>Maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> {{has been}} used as fodder in {{different}} parts of the world for a long time and has recently become more common also in Sweden. Our cold climate has been a problem as maize is very sensitive to low temperatures and frost. With new varieties and better techniques for cultivation it is now possible to grow maize in the southern and middle parts of Sweden. As for the north of Sweden the length of the cultivation season is a limiting factor as there are too few days with temperatures of over + 10 ºC. Maize is well suited for silage making but oxygen-free conditions are required. Its low buffer capacity reduces pH very fast, which usually minimizes unwanted micro-organisms which are not healthy for the animals and keeping nutrition values high. As the energy value is high and the protein value low in maize silage it is recommended to give maize in combination with some other forage, for example clover. For enough structure hay or straw should be given together with maize. Maize silage has been shown to have a positive effect on high producing animals and because of the high content of energy it can be given as an energy complement to cow and calf in beef production, to heifers and dairy cows. More studies are needed as an increased production of <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> in Sweden may be profitable economically as well as nutritionally...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Forage {{plants are}} the basis of {{ruminant}} nutrition. Among cereal forages, <b>maize</b> cropped <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> making is the most widely used. Much research in genetics, physiology, and molecular biology of cereal forages is thus devoted to maize, even if silage of sorghum or immature small-grain cereals and straws of small-grain cereals are also given to cattle. Cell wall digestibility is the limiting factor of forage feeding value and is, therefore, the first target for improving their feeding value. Large genetic variation for cell wall digestibility was proven from both in vivo and in vitro experiments in numerous species. Among the regular maize hybrids [excluding brown-midrib (bm) ones], the cell wall digestibility nearly doubled from 32. 9 % to 60. 1 %. Genetic variation has also been proven in cell wall digestibility of sorghum and wheat, barley or rice forage, or straw, with lower average values than in maize.

This experiment was conducted on loamy chernozem soil in sugar-beet producing region in Ivanovice na Hané. Yields obtained between years 1990 [...] 2014 were evaluated. Spring barley was grown in three crop rotations. The forecrop of the spring barley was always sugar beet grown after <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage,</b> winter wheat and spring barley. Four variants of tillage were evaluated: ploughing to the depth of 0, 22 m, ploughing to the depth of 0, 15 m, straight sowing into non-tilled soil and shallow loosening soil to the depth of 0, 10 m. In all three crop rotations, the highest average yield was obtained in variant - ploughing to the depth of 0, 15 m and the lowest average yield was obtained in variant - ploughing to the depth of 0, 22 m.

Food and Naturall Resources at the Czech Agricultural University in Prague in Červený Újezd (district Prague - West). After the harvest, all variants of maize were examined from the perspective of profit in green state and in the dry state. Within the one-year experiment, we found following results that may help in the planning the basic or supplemental fertilization of silage maize. Therefore, based on the results launched, we present that the wide top use of Zeastim fertilizers in combination with Urea Stabil fertilizer has impact on higher growth of green mass, so it proves higher profit of green and dried mass...|$|R
40|$|This project should {{generate}} current regional results over {{a period}} of three years about the parameter yield and quality of alternative fodder crops to maize; this includes grass and clover grass mixtures, silage maize, varieties of Sorghum/millets and whole plant silages of wheat, rye and triticale. The tested silage maize showed the highest and most reliable average dry matter yield with 23 tons per hectare, with a very low variance. The Sorghum and millet varieties had dry matter yields of 3 to 5 tons per hectare below the silage maize yield but with individual values fluctuating in a broad range within years and locations. With values far below 28 % the dry matter contents were not suitable for ensiling. The grass and clover grass mixtures are good, stable and established alternatives to <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage.</b> They achieved high yields comparable with these of Sorghum but stable and with a highly suitable dry matter content for ensiling. The yield of the whole plant silages was up to 22 % lower compared with maize. So none of the alternative crops can compete with the high level yield of silage maize in its favoured region, therefore would be a combination of two crops recommended. But some individual locally adapted mixtures or varieties of the alternative crops reached nearly 80 % of the maize yield. Silage maize showed the highest level of the net energy content for lactation (NEL), followed by the values of the fodder crops and the whole plant silages. The Sorghum varieties showed the lowest NEL value of all tested cultures. The highest crude protein showed the fodder crops contents. Silage maize, Sorghum and the whole plant silages had values lying nearly around the 50 % mark of the fodder crops...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a study on application of minimum tillage technologies when growing winter wheat. Experiments were performed in the sugar-beet-growing region with loamy chernozem within the period of 2005 – 2009. Aanalysed and evaluated were effects of different methods of soil processing on yield-forming factors in stands of winter wheat grown after three different preceding crops (i. e. alfalfa, <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> and pea). Evaluated were the following four variants of tillage: (1) conventional ploughing to the depth of 0. 22 [*]m (Variant 1); (2) ploughing to the depth of 0. 15 [*]m (Variant 2); (3) direct sowing into the untilled soil (Variant 3), and (4) shallow tillage to the depth of 0. 10 [*]m (Variant 4). The effect of different tillage intensity on winter wheat yields was statistically non-significant after all forecrops. After alfalfa, the highest and the lowest average yields were recorded in Variant 2 (i. e. with ploughing to the depth of 0. 15 [*]m) and Variant 3 (direct sowing into the untilled soil), respectively. After maize grown for silage, higher yields were obtained in Variant 2 and Variant 1 (conventional ploughing) while in Variants 4 and 3 the obtained yields were lower. When growing winter wheat after pea as a preceding crop, the highest and the lowest average yields were recorded after direct sowing (Variant 3) and in Variant 1 (i. e. ploughing to the depth of 0. 22 m), respectively. Results of studies on effect of different tillage technologies on yields of winter wheat crops indicate that under the given pedological and climatic conditions {{it is possible to}} apply methods of reduced tillage intensity. However, the choice of the corresponding technology must be performed with regard to the type of preceding crop...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is the {{non-food crop}} {{with the largest}} acreage in the world. Tobacco is criticized because it causes health {{problems}} to its consumers and because production causes environmental damage such as soil degradation, deforestation and water pollution. Diversification has been indicated as the strategy for a sustainable economic development for farmers. In the specific case of Valle de Lerma, many years of continuous tobacco mono-cropping, excessive ploughing and poor irrigation control have caused soil degradation of the land used for tobacco. Tobacco farming in Salta also entails a production and a price risk which is increasing because of uncertainty surrounding governmental subsidies. The objective {{of this article is}} to assess the impact of diversification on expected farm income, income risk and soil organic matter (as an indicator of soil degradation) on specialized tobacco farms. To reach this objective, a quadratic programming model of a typical specialized tobacco farm is developed. Soil organic matter is included in the model by means of the concept of the carbon balance. The carbon balance is the difference between carbon supply and carbon decline in a year. Two different situations with respect to soil degradation are evaluated using the model. The current situation includes no restriction on carbon balance while the desired situation includes the restriction that the carbon balance cannot be negative. So farmers’ choices are valuated with and without carbon balance constraints. The model results for the current situation show that, no matter which risk attitude is used, the maximum area of land given irrigation possibilities is devoted to tobacco, while the rest of the land is assigned to the non-irrigated crop soybean. The carbon balance is negative and soil continues to degrade. In the desired situation, tobacco and soybean are partly replaced by bull beef production (including the production of alfalfa and <b>maize</b> <b>for</b> <b>silage)</b> to fulfill the requirement of a no negative carbon balance. As the risk aversion coefficient in this situation increases, the low risk crop chickpea enters the solution and bull beef decreases. The requirement of no further soil degradation comes at a high cost since gross margin of the farm is decreased by some 35 % compared to the current situation. Finally, the model is used to explore the effects of an abolishment of governmental subsidies on tobacco. In this situation the production plan consists of soybean, bull beef and tobacco in such a proportion that the carbon balance is positive. Income effects of an abolishment of governmental subsidies on tobacco would be large as the gross margin of the farm decreases by some 60 %...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} PolyFunKur and Agromik biofertilizers on the biometrics of maize, {{as well as on}} its green mass and grain yield on sod–podzolic light loamy soil. Methods: phenological, agrochemical, microbiological. The use of Agromik and PolyFunKur biochemicals increases biometric indicators of maize during its development phases in comparison with the control. The highest yield of the <b>maize</b> green mass <b>for</b> <b>silage</b> was in the test with the treatment of seeds and vegetative organs in the tillering phase in Poli funk ur.
