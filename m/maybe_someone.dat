500|$|The {{experience}} with King, despite only {{resulting in the}} completion of one track, [...] "Bad Boyfriend", gave the band perspective and direction. Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized {{that they needed to}} work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously. Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, [...] "It was kind of seductive to think that <b>maybe</b> <b>someone</b> else [...] solve all of our problems, but in the end you gotta do it yourself".|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "Michelle carries the one unexploded secret—the child. But there are ways around that! So, yes, it was one of my original ideas—bringing Michelle in and the secrets she brings.

2500|$|Though {{her speech}} {{was met with}} much praise from the media, on August 17, it was {{announced}} that anti-gay Russian campaigners would sue Madonna for $10.4 million, arguing that she was promoting [...] "homosexual propaganda" [...] which was against the law, and allegedly [...] "insulted their feelings when she spoke out for gay rights" [...] at the concert. According to one of the 10 activists who filed the lawsuit, [...] "She (Madonna) had been warned with words that she should behave in line with the law and she ignored it. So we will speak in the language of money… <b>maybe</b> <b>someone</b> does not see the link but after Madonna's concert maybe some boy becomes gay, some girl becomes lesbian, fewer children are born as a result and this big country cannot defend its borders— for me it causes moral suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lofty (George) Holloway {{was one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Both felt that to help complete the community there was a need for a character in his early twenties. He had to be someone a bit different. Not brash and confident like a lot of the older men, and not boisterous like the younger ones. A loner, <b>maybe</b> <b>someone</b> forced to be a loner. A person who [...] "stuck out like a sore thumb". Someone that was happiest in a group but still couldn't find one that he fit in with. Tony Holland had previously been in the army and found that ex-soldiers had these problems when they tried to reintegrate as civilians. So they decided that Lofty would be an ex-soldier, forced to quit because of his asthma. He was happiest in the army and felt incomplete without the group setting, the all-male camaraderie and even the security of the uniformity that the army provides.|$|E
