50|$|Sporisorium reilianum {{causes the}} {{diseases}} <b>maize</b> <b>head</b> smut and sorghum head smut. This soil borne smut fungus has two formae speciales. S. reilianum f. sp. reilianum is specific to sorghum and S. reilianum f. sp. zeae is specific to maize. It is unknown why the two formae speciales cannot form spores on their respective non-favored hosts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Maize</b> <b>head</b> smut {{occurs in}} most maize-growing areas, {{including}} many regions of North America, Australia, Asia, and southern Europe. It causes tremendous loss of yield during outbreaks {{due to the}} replacement of the ear with large smut sori. [...] To infect maize roots, S. reilianum f. sp. zeae must form a dikaryotic parasitic hypha which results for the mating of two compatible haploid strains. The infection always occurs in soil via the root, unlike Ustilago maydis, another maize smut, which infects maize plants via aerial parts. Temperatures of 23-30 °C are optimal for field infection of corn, suspected to be due to maximum teliospore germination.|$|E
40|$|A {{suppression}} subtractive hybridization (SSH) {{approach was}} used to generate cDNA libraries representing genes differentially expressed in the haploid cells of the <b>maize</b> <b>head</b> smut pathogen Sporisorium reilianum exposed to GR 24, a strigolactone analogue. Strigolactones are present in root exudates and {{have been known to}} trigger germination of parasitic plant seeds and signal mycorrhizal fungi to connect to root systems forming mutualistic relationships. Cell respiration increased within 1 h after GR 24 addition, but decreased after 5 and 8 h. All induced cells were used to construct a cDNA library, which contained 1440 clones. The cDNA ESTs were deposited on macro-array membranes and hybridized with P 32 cDNA probes obtained from mRNA isolated from S. reilianum yeast cultures exposed or not to 100 nM GR 24 for three time intervals. A total of 678 ESTs were identified as differentially expressed during three time-courses in response to GR 24. A set of 36 candidate genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR that presented an induction of the genes at 1 h, confirming the hybridization data. Induced genes mostly affect catalysis functions (45 %) like cell respiration (27 %), and cell signaling (26 %). Although the biological significance of this perception remains hypothetical, these results indicate that strigolactones could have a wider biological influence in the rhizosphere than previously recognized...|$|E
50|$|The Fusarium genus {{as a whole}} {{includes}} {{species that}} cause several crop diseases, including ear rot in <b>maize,</b> and <b>head</b> blight in wheat, thus contributing to significant crop yield reduction. Although F. sporotrichioides itself causes only wheat head blight, this disease is a significant concern in the agricultural industry, as crop yield losses due to head blight can be extensive. In Russia for example, head blight has in past years been responsible for 25 to 50% reductions in crop yield. F. sporotrichioides, along with F. poae and F. avenaceum also cause the discolouration of cereals such as oats, and several Fusaria {{have been shown to}} contribute to the rotting of certain fruits and vegetables in suboptimal storage conditions. In the case of F. sporotrichioides, the affected produce includes peas and apples.|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{of factors}} {{affecting}} adoption of hybrid and open pollinated maize varieties {{had not been}} taken yet in Nepal. Viewing this fact, this study was undertaken consisting of four purposively selected VDCs from two central Terai districts, Bara and Sarlahi, of Nepal. A total of 110 maize growers including 86 adopters and 24 non adopters of hybrid maize varieties (adopters of open pollinated maize varieties) were interviewed {{with the help of}} structured questionnaire. Results of t-test showed that adopters of hybrid maize varieties had significantly larger farm size and, size of maize farm, were more experienced on maize farming, and used significantly higher amount of chemical fertilizers but lower amount of organic manures than the non-adopters. Further, more adopters used irrigation water, pesticides and hired labor than the non-adopters. The result showed that a substantial proportion of land area grown to maize was cultivated to hybrid maize varieties with an adoption rate of 81. 9 % while the adoption rate for open pollinated varieties was estimated as 18. 1 %. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis showed that adoption of hybrid maize was positively influenced by farm size, irrigation availability, farmer’s attitude towards insect and disease tolerance characteristics of hybrid <b>maize,</b> male <b>headed</b> family and credit availability in the surveyed area. However, farming experience on maize was negatively associated with the adoption of hybrid maize varieties...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground The genus Fusarium includes a large group of phytopatho-genic fungi, each having a different or partially overlapping host range. F. graminearum is an important pathogen on wheat, barley and <b>maize,</b> causing Fusarium <b>head</b> blight [1, 2], while F. verticillioides mainly infects maize, causing rot and wilting [3]. In contrast, F. oxysporum causes dis-ease on more than 100 different plant species, but specific strains usually infect only a single host species [4]. This has led to the introduction of the forma specialis concept in F. oxysporum, where strains are categorized according to the host plant they infect, such as tomato or banana [5]. In addition, some strains of F. oxysporum may also cause infections in humans [6]. Genomic sequences of several Fusarium species have been generated, including F. grami-nearum (strain PH- 1), F. verticillioides (strain FGSC 7600), F. pseudograminearum (strain CS 3096), F. solani (strai...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHead smut, {{caused by}} the fungal {{pathogen}} Sporisorium reilianum, poses a grave threat to maize (Zea mays) production worldwide. Here we report cytological and molecular evidence for <b>maize</b> resistance to <b>head</b> smut. During early stages of root infection, S. reilianum mycelium was capable of penetrating the root epidermis of both resistant (Ji 1037) and susceptible (HZ 4) inbred lines. S. reilianum hyphae were observed in the root–stem junction at 6 days after inoculation. In an attempt to monitor hyphal spread within the maize plant, a highly specific and sensitive real-time PCR method was established to estimate the hyphal content in infected maize tissues. During the upward growth of endophytic S. reilianum, the extent of hyphal spread was markedly different between Ji 1037 and HZ 4. Very little or no pathogen was detected in aerial parts of Ji 1037, whereas large amounts of pathogen accumulated in aboveground tissues, particularly inflorescences, of HZ 4. Thus, maize resistance to S. reilianum was achieved mainly by inhibition of endophytic hyphal growth rather than by prevention of early-root penetration by the pathogen...|$|R
40|$|This study {{uses the}} 2004 / 05 {{household}} income and consumption expenditure survey {{to examine the}} determinants of household teff expenditures by using heteroskedastic double-hurdle model to accommodate zero observations in the sample. Mostly importantly, the study also calculates elasiticties parameters for the explanatory variables to examine their effect on teff consumption. The double hurdle model for teff consumption suggested that age of {{head of the household}} was determining the level of consumption while it was not important to influence the household’s decision to consume. The estimated results indicated that sociodemographic characteristics (household sizes, dependency ratios, education, employment status, gender) were significant in explaining both the decision to consume and the level of teff consumption. In addition, economic factors such as income and prices were among the significant determinants of teff consumption demand. Calculated own price elasiticties for the main regions indicated that Addis Ababa was relatively less sensitive to changes in teff prices. Finally, Tobit model was used to observe consumption patterns for maize, sorghum wheat and teff. Income and education were positively and significantly affecting teff expenditures while they were negatively associated with <b>maize</b> consumption. Educated <b>head</b> of the household had remarkably low consumption of maize and sorghu...|$|R
40|$|Subsistence maize {{production}} {{has long been}} a dominant economic activity of households in Santiago Apóstol, a Zapotec community in the Central Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico. A baseline study from 1973 documents a regionally pervasive form of household level agriculture whereby cultivators prioritize land for subsistence maize above commercial crops. Since then, much has transformed the face of rural Mexico, including migration to the United States. Migration accelerated beginning in the 1970 s as a response to government disinvestment in maize, but it may also be a new force of cultural and economic change impacting agriculture. The question arises, has migration modified longstanding subsistence agricultural practices centered on local varieties of rainfed maize? If not, what might explain the continuities and changes in agricultural practice observed? Ethnographic land use and maize consumption surveys among 19 migrant headed households conducted in Santiago Apóstol in the summer and winter of 2012 indicate that mean production of maize remains equivalent to that documented in the late 1960 s, suggesting that migration has not engendered a generalized shift to commercial crops. Potential explanations for the persistent use of rainfed, local <b>maize</b> among migrant <b>headed</b> households are drawn from a mixed methods methodology involving triangulated analyses of household economic data, land tenure arrangements, perceptions of environmental change, participant observation, and archival research. Triangulated analyses allow speculation on linked human environmental changes in the landscape that may have reinforced use of a traditional, rainfed grain crop...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium verticillioides are fungal plant {{pathogens}} {{that can}} cause yield losses, reductions in grain quality, and produce mycotoxins {{that can cause}} serious diseases in animals and humans when contaminated grain is consumed. Both pathogens can infect and cause disease in seedlings. F. graminearum infects cereals and other crops and produces mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (DON), which {{can act as a}} virulence factor for Gibberella ear rot in <b>maize</b> and <b>head</b> blight of wheat. F. verticillioides infects maize and produces fumonisins, a group of mycotoxins with phytotoxic properties. Previous research into the role of these mycotoxins in seedling diseases has been conflicting. To assess the roles of deoxynivalenol and fumonisins in seedling disease, wild-type and mycotoxin non-producing mutants of both fungi were used to inoculate seeds in rolled-towel experiments. F. verticillioides isolates were used to infect dent and sweet varieties of maize while F. graminearum isolates were used to infect dent maize, soybeans and wheat. Plant weights, shoot lengths and disease severity (soybean only) were measured at 7 days. Additionally, infection levels were compared by quantifying fungal biomass present in plant tissue between fungal isolates using qPCR. Finally, an experiment to determine changes in gene expression in maize inbred B 73 when infected with wild-type or deoxynivalenol non-producing isolates of F. graminearum was performed to better understand the infection process and response of the plant to DON. Results of experiments with F. graminearum differed among the varieties for all crop species. In soybean, only the susceptible cultivar demonstrated significant differences between plants inoculated with the wild-type and the DON non-producing mutant for plant weight and length. In wheat, the wild type, but not the mutant, caused reductions in weight and length in the susceptible cultivar. The partially resistant variety was reduced in plant weight by both isolates, but neither isolate reduced shoot or root length. In maize, the wild type and the mutant had an impact on shoot length and plant weight for all three hybrids tested. In one susceptible hybrid the wild-type caused greater effects than the DON non-producing mutant. Results indicate that DON production is not required for pathogenicity in seedlings, but the wild-type isolate generally produced greater symptoms and there are interactions between host genotype and DON effects. Gene expression changes in maize in response to infection with wild-type and a DON- mutant revealed that different genes were expressed during early infection and plant germination in comparison to genes expressed after 7 days. There were minimal differences between the wild-type and the mutant isolates for any of the time points sampled. There were greater differences between wild-type infected plants and mock-inoculated plants. Experiments with Fusarium verticillioides in sweet and dent maize did not provide conclusive results about the effects of fumonisins on seedling disease. For hybrid dent maize, shoot length and plant weight were reduced by only two out of ten isolates tested, regardless of fumonisin production. Fungal biomass was higher in the root tissues than mesocotyl tissues but did not show consistent differences between fumonisin producing and non-producing isolates. In sweet maize {{there were no significant differences}} in plant weight or shoot length between plants inoculated with fumonisin-producing and non-producing isolates. All isolates were significantly different from the control for both plant weight and shoot length. Fungal biomass quantification for F. verticillioides in sweet maize was highly variable but fumonisin-producing strains did not consistently colonize the plant tissue to a greater extent than non-producing strains...|$|R
