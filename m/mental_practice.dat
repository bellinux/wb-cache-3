50|$|<b>Mental</b> <b>practice</b> is a {{technique}} used in music as well. Professional musicians may use <b>mental</b> <b>practice</b> when they are away from their instrument or unable to physically practice due to an injury. Studies show {{that a combination of}} physical and <b>mental</b> <b>practice</b> can provide improvement in mastering a piece equal to physical practice alone. This is because <b>mental</b> <b>practice</b> causes neuron growth that mirrors growth caused by physical practice. And there is precedent: Vladimir Horowitz and Arthur Rubinstein, among others, supplemented their physical practice with mental rehearsal.|$|E

40|$|Background: Mental health {{problems}} {{have a high}} prevalence. Most adults with mental {{health problems}} in need of help, receive primary care treatment. Since 2008 <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse (in Dutch named Praktijkondersteuner Huisartsenzorg GGZ (POH-GGZ)) are available to support GPs with the care of patients with mental health problems. Most important functions are problem clarification, advising, process steering, guiding, case management and short treatment. Practice research of the <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse {{is needed to determine}} to which extent the <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse works in accordance with the intended task assignment. In part 1 of this current survey, the task realisation of 19 <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurses working in the province Groningen (The Netherlands) has been studied. This second part of the study focuses on patients’ experiences with the help of their <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse. Method: During three months the 19 <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse have registered their first contact and the follow-up contacts with the patient in registration forms. The patients completed a questionnaire after the first contact and in case informed consent was given, a second questionnaire three months after the first contact. The registration forms and patient questionnaires have been processed and analyzed with SPSS 19. 0. It appeared form the non-response analysis that patients who completed the second patient questionnaire (N= 159) were a good reflection of the patients who have completed the first patient questionnaire (N= 456). Results: 68 % of the patient population seeing the <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse is female and the mean age is 45 years. After three month the patients especially pointed out that they got help for the problems ‘stress/stressed’ and ‘depressive feeling’. 82 % of the patients reported to have received ‘counselling’ and as such it is the most frequently received service. Patients consider ‘information about the possibilities for help or treatment’ and ‘availability’ as the most important issues. Improvement occures on five of the seven aspect of the functional status according the WONCA-COOP. The patients give a mean value of 7. 5 to the aid of the <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse. 87 % of the population points out that they see surplus value of the involvement of the <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse. Conclusion and discussion: Concluding, patients experience the help of the <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse as good. The results of this study are mainly based on the patients of a limited number of <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse. There are no relations between the improvement in functional status and the kind of problems patients come with or the kind of received help. The tendency towards the increase of inflow of <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> nurse, is a good sign for the future and must be stimulated. ...|$|R

40|$|The remit of {{the opening}} chapter is to {{introduce}} the reader to the core underpinning themes, theories and research of approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice.</b> As is the case throughout the book, readers are asked to reflect upon {{what it means to}} be an approved mental health practitioner. Here the author focuses on areas which as editors we feel are the foundation of approved mental health practice; the social perspective and independence. We were also mindful of the sociological and psychological influences that underpin the responsibility, whether consciously or not, and these are also introduced. No book on approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> can ignore the political context; the responsibility is sanctioned in legislation and based upon decisions that reflect a wider political environment. Devolved nations add to this complexity. The chapter, therefore, asks the reader to consider the impact of political decisions, in particular the opening up of the responsibility of approved <b>mental</b> heath <b>practice</b> beyond social work. Mirroring a policy of the redistribution of mental health roles in England and Wales, this change was also based on research reporting the negative impact of approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> on social workers including high levels of stress and a "disappearing" workforce. The chapter, therefore, asks the reader to reflect upon the influence of research. These themes, theories and research add to the uncertainty common to approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> and are revisited throughout the book...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the impact of professional background on role fulfilment. In the United Kingdom current policy in health and social care in mental health is underpinned by integration; the idea that responsibilities can be accomplished irrespective of profession. Approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> is one example of a psychiatric statutory role and function, until recently carried out by the profession of social work, which is now extended to other, non-medical, mental health professions. This thesis aims to explore the role and experiences of current practitioners {{in order to understand the}} impact, if any, of professional background on the fulfilment of approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> and the way in which it is experienced. Qualitative data are generated through semi-structured individual interviews with twelve approved mental health practitioners: five nurses, two occupational therapists and five social workers and the use of rich pictures to supplement the interview discussions. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was applied to the verbatim transcripts. Key findings were that approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> can be accomplished irrespective of professional background. Its practitioners require particular shared attributes, specifically a cognitive and affective capacity to deal with and use discord and to manage the disparate emotions that occur. Conceptualised in this thesis as “pull,” this finding constitutes a different understanding of the use of emotion in the workplace and provides evidence of a new emotional dimension; the active use of dissonance. Professional identity is also found to be influenced by approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> thereby turning on its head the original hypothesis of this thesis. Last, personhood is found to be an additional aspect of the moral framework for approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> and is being practiced in a different circumstance than previously considered. The implications of this work are that it challenges the perception that approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> is synonymous with the profession of social work. It also revives the theory that its normative moral framework is inherently contradictory. The present study appears to be the first to associate personhood with approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> and shows role fulfilment as sophisticated emotion management, primarily the active use of dissonance. Both provide new insights into the enactment of approved <b>mental</b> health <b>practice</b> and are important issues for the future training and development of practitioners. The influence on role of professional identity may also help policy makers better understand the impact that new ways of working in mental health might have on traditional professional roles and boundaries in integrated services...|$|R
