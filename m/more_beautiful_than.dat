5|$|Mary's robe is {{embroidered}} with Latin text, {{taken from the}} : Est enim haec speciosior sole et super omnem stellarum dispositionem. Luci conparata invenitur prior ("For she is <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she {{is found to be}} superior"). Van Eyck used a similar device in his Berlin Madonna in the Church, completed c. 1438–40.|$|E
5|$|E. Newton {{noted that}} he had {{expected}} the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing, but {{that the absence of}} this indicated it was immature. He still found it <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen, and subfossil remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The genus Palaeornis was later declared a junior synonym of Psittacula, and all species within the former were transferred to the latter. The genus name Psittacula is derived from the Latin words Psittacus, which means parrot, and -ula, which is a diminutive suffix.|$|E
5|$|Kanhopatra {{was trained}} in dance and song from early {{childhood}} {{so that she}} could join her mother's profession. She became a talented dancer and singer. Her beauty was compared to the apsara (heavenly nymph) Menaka. Shama suggested that Kanhopatra should visit the Badshah (Muslim king), who will adore her beauty and gift her money and jewelry, but Kanhopatra flatly refused. Traditional tales narrate that Shama wanted Kanhopatra to marry, but Kanhopatra longed to marry a man who was <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> her. Scholar Tara Bhavalkar states that Kanhopatra's marriage was forbidden, as it was not socially acceptable for a daughter of a courtesan to marry.|$|E

5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth {{played a central role}} in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|Banjo-Kazooie {{is set in}} the Spiral Mountain {{and follows}} the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her {{cauldron}} Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> her. Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty. She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping. In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.|$|E
5|$|The legendary sagas tend {{to focus}} on elves as legendary {{ancestors}} or on heroes' sexual relations with elf-women. Mention of the land of Álfheimr is found in Heimskringla while Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar recounts a line of local kings who ruled over Álfheim, who since they had elven blood were said to be <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> most men. According to Hrólfs saga kraka, Hrolfr Kraki's half-sister Skuld was the half-elven child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (álfkona). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (seiðr). Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. The Þiðreks saga version of the Nibelungen (Niflungar) describes Högni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, Völsunga saga, or the Nibelungenlied. The relatively few mentions of elves in the Chivalric sagas tend even to be whimsical.|$|E

25|$|The {{constellation}} {{is named}} after Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia and mother of Princess Andromeda. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed {{next to each other}} among the stars, along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> the Nereids or, alternatively, that she herself was <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> the sea nymphs. She was forced to wheel around the North Celestial Pole on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and Poseidon decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster Cetus. Andromeda was then rescued by the hero Perseus, whom she later married.|$|E
25|$|Adonis {{was the son}} of Myrrha, who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable {{lust for}} her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus, after Myrrha's mother bragged that her {{daughter}} was <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> the goddess. Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree, but still gave birth to Adonis.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, the Paris Pike Committee {{was formed}} {{with representatives from}} Fayette and Bourbon {{counties}} and two preservation organizations. This new committee would later set specific guidelines regarding roadway design, land use, and preservation, stating that the new highway could be <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> what currently existed. Later meetings extended those statements with a pact to preserve the land around the highway from development forever.|$|E

25|$|In 1742, {{the north}} wing {{became the first}} one to be finished. Building work on the south wing started in June 1740 but ground to a halt by the autumn due to {{difficulties}} in obtaining supplies. Work did not recommence until January 1744, now {{under the supervision of the}} young architect Nicolai Eigtved. Eigtved's superior artistic insight meant it turned out <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> the north wing. In 1746, 87 hunting horses and 165 carriage horses moved into the new stables, the largest number ever.|$|E

25|$|The country {{north from}} Damascus, with its grand {{mountains}} and fertile valley and slopes, {{was described as}} being <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> that {{to the south of}} the city. The Nahr el Litani or Leontes river flowing south between the parallel ranges of the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon enters the sea between Tyre and Sidon.

25|$|In the 1710s, {{the area}} around the upper lake of Bhopal was mainly {{populated}} by the Bhil and the Gond tribals. Nizam Shah, the strongest of the local Gond warlords, ruled his territory from the Ginnor fort (Ginnorgarh in the present-day Sehore district). Ginnor was considered an impregnable fort, located at the summit of a steep 2000-foot-high rock, and surrounded by thick forest. Rani Kamlapati (or Kamlavati), the daughter of Chaudhari Kirpa-Ramchandar, was one of the seven wives of Nizam Shah. She was famous for her beauty and talents: the local legends describe her as <b>more</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>than</b> a pari (fairy).|$|E
