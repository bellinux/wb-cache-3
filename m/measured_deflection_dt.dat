40|$|There {{are many}} <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> {{profiles}} in the flexural structural elements, like piles, walls and etc, {{obtained from the}} instrumentation programme of the projects. However, {{the use of these}} measurements is only limited to comparison the <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> against the predetermined threshold values in the design criteria. It could be due to the tedious process involved that further interpretation on the induced moment is not being seriously carried out to get the best value out of the verification processes. It is certainly very wasteful for not doing so. As such, this paper presents a procedure for back-calculation of bending moment based on the valuable <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> profile. Consideration is also given to the post-cracking behaviour of a reinforced concrete (RC) flexural element and the computation of bending moment of the cracked section in relation to the measured curvature.

30|$|Structural {{adequacy}} {{is associated}} with the load transfer efficiency of the road and is evaluated using <b>measured</b> <b>deflections</b> inflicted at the surface of the pavement. The deflections are created by applied loads such as static or slowly moving loads (e.g., Benkelman beam, California travelling deflectometer, and LaCroix deflectometer), steady-state vibration (e.g., Dynaflect and road rater), or impulse loads (e.g., falling weight deflectometers). The <b>measured</b> <b>deflections</b> are used to backcalculate elastic moduli or the load-transfer efficiency of the subsurface layers. Predicting this type of behavior via remote sensing, without being able to apply pressure to the surface, is difficult.|$|R
40|$|The {{non-destructive}} {{measurement of}} deflection basins {{has come a}} long way from <b>measuring</b> only maximum <b>deflection</b> or radius of curvature and using empirical relationships in rehabilitation design. New equipment was developed world-wide and analysis techniques moved towards utilising the full deflection basin in fundamental analysis procedures. This author addressed the problem of a proper description of the full deflection basin by doing a detailed literature survey on this subject. Various deflection basin parameters that describe the deflection basin are listed, as well as the various measuring apparatus related to them. The apparatus are all discussed in detail and related to the equipment available in South Africa. The measurement of deflection basins with the road surface deflectometer (RSD) under accelerated testing with the fleet of heavy vehicle simulators (HVSs) are described in detail. An improved data manipulation procedure is proposed which simplifies the calculation of all the deflection basin parameters found in literature. Various models to fit the <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> basins are also investigated in an effort to describe the deflection basin in full too. The <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> basin parameters of a bitumen, granular, cemented and light structured granular base pavement are discussed in detail as being tested with the fleet of HVS's. It is shown how the deflection basin parameters reflect the structural capacity of the various layers and behaviour states. A more accurate description of the behaviour states is made possible with the proposal of ranges for the various behaviour states for these deflection basins selected. A literature study was carried out to investigate the various analysis procedures that use <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> basins as basic input in the characterization of materials. On the basis of this study, linear elastic programmes were used to calculate effective elastic moduli for each pavement layer, using <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> basins as input. The possibility to relate typical distress determinants to <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> basins were investigated in the literature. Based on this, typical South African flexible pavement structures were analysed mechanistically and typical design curves were established for typical bitumen and. granular base pavements. The effect of overlays were investigated too, resulting in typical overlay design curves. In the final chapter the author endeavours to summarise the research by indicating how deflection basins can be measured and enhance the South African mechanistic rehabilitation design process. Only the latter rehabilitation design procedure is discussed with specific reference to the enhancement of the behaviour state identification, material characterization, analysis procedure and rehabilitation design with <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> basin parameters. The author ends off by giving an indication of the future research need in this field of deflection basins. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Civil Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a measurement for micro-deflection of miniaturized cantilever using phase-shift shadow moiré (PSSM) method and determines the Young’s modulus of the cantilever material. The measurement equipment is calibrated by measuring and comparing the known surface {{profile of a}} cylinder with the results from PSSM. The calibration shows that PSSM technique applied has the measurement error of 6 μm. The PSSM method is then applied to measure the micro-deflection of a miniaturized cantilever. The cantilever has the dimensions of 6. 49 mm x 0. 96 mm x 0. 16 mm and the Young’s modulus is unknown. The Young’s modulus of the cantilever material is estimated from theory by using the <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> profile. Both the <b>measured</b> and estimated <b>deflection</b> profile are plotted to check for any discrepancy. The comparison shows that the <b>measured</b> <b>deflection</b> profile {{is similar to the}} estimated deflection profile. Therefore, the Young’s modulus of the cantilever is estimated to be 60. 65 GPa with the uncertainty of ± 2. 66 GPa.

40|$|A new {{pavement}} design procedure, {{known as the}} Mechanistic-Empirical Design Guide (MEPDG), is in development and incorporates new mechanistic-based models and performance prediction models. Structural response models are used to compute critical stresses, strains, and displacements in pavement systems due to traffic loads and climatic factors. These responses of the pavement structure are determined using finite element. Therefore, the MEPDG developed neural networks to reduce the necessary computational time. It is essential that the finite element models accurately depict {{the response of the}} slab to insure that calculated stress is representative of actual pavement stresses. Therefore, the focus of this study will be to develop finite element models that will be validated/calibrated from actual field strain measurements. The following study analyzes the response of a joint plain concrete pavement (JPCP) to an applied load. The response of the pavement is characterized by performing seasonal load testing on an instrumented JPCP. The load testing consists of traversing trucks with known axle loads and configurations across the pavement and performing falling weight deflectometer (FWD) testing. The effects of varying restraint conditions, temperature and moisture gradients, and load magnitudes on the <b>measured</b> <b>deflections</b> and strains are characterized. These <b>measured</b> <b>deflections</b> and strains are also used in the development and validation/calibration of finite element models. It was determined that temperature gradients at the time of FWD testing have an impact on load transfer efficiency, <b>measured</b> <b>deflections,</b> and the magnitude of the Void parameter, as well as the measured strain. An analysis of measured strains indicated the interface between the base and the slab is unbonded for the unrestrained slabs and bonded for the restrained slabs, indicating that the life of the bond might be a function of the restraint conditions. The primary factor affecting the <b>measured</b> <b>deflections</b> and strains was the slab restraint conditions...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} in translating wire deflection measurement to clinical application is mounting the measurement device in the small space between the ring of the frame and the patient’s leg. Guidelines dictate that at least 2  cm of clearance should be present between the leg and each ring [21]. In testing, the clearance between the bone substitute and the ring was 4  cm and measurements were easily obtained within this space. Measurements were taken 3  mm away from the bone substitute; therefore, the device should easily fit inside 2  cm of clearance. The soft tissues will, however, mean that it is unlikely one {{would be able to}} <b>measure</b> <b>deflection</b> this close to the bone in clinical practice, which would likely reduce the <b>measured</b> <b>deflection.</b> If the device used is sensitive enough, this should, in itself, not present a problem.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{geotextile}} separator beneath a granular base, or subbase in a flexible pavement system is to prevent the road aggregate and the underlying subgrade from intermixing. It has been hypothesized that {{in the absence of}} a geotextile, intermixing between base course aggregate and soft subgrade occurs. Nine heavily instrumented flexible pavement test sections were built in Bedford County Virginia to investigate the benefits of geosynthetic stabilization in flexible pavements. Three groups of different base course thicknesses (100, 150 and 200 mm) test sections were constructed with either geotextile or geogrid stabilization or no stabilization. Woven geotextile was used in sections 2, 5 and 8. Geogrids were used in sections 3, 6 and 9, and sections 1, 4 and 7 were controls.
