5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass <b>manufacturer</b> <b>in</b> Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud.

5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its <b>manufacturer</b> <b>in</b> Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
