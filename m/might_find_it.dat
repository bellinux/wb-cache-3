Four years later, on 25–26 August 1960, Guido Magnone and Spyros Antypas climbed the northeastern face of Gamila. Currently there are 17 climbing fields on the mountain, covering {{most of the major}} peaks and other geological features of the mountain. From the aforementioned fields, the northeastern face of Gamila counts 8 climbing routes, and Gamila II 6. The fields of Astraka and Tsouka Rossa have several climbing routes each. The former counts 30 routes in both its northwestern and northeastern faces, and the latter 19 routes. Potential climbers should take into account that several of the routes were first ascended several years ago and thus pitons might be compromised if present at all. Furthermore, some locations in the mountain are isolated and rescue services <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> particularly challenging to access the area in case of emergency.|$|E

25|$|However, Bohr {{had argued}} that the {{uranium-235}} isotope was {{far more likely to}} capture neutrons and fission even from neutrons with the low energies produced by fission. Frisch began experimenting uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion, a process first demonstrated in Germany by Klaus Clusius. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources. He wondered what would happen if he were able to produce a sphere of pure uranium-235. When he used Peierls' formula to calculate its critical mass, he received a startling answer: less than a kilogram would be required. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum in March 1940. They reported that a 5 kilogram bomb would be the equivalent to several thousand tons of dynamite, and even a one kilogram bomb would be impressive. Because of the potential radioactive fallout, they thought that the British <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> morally unacceptable.|$|E

[...] In reality, of course, a wounded or weary knight <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult, and rely on a vigilant squire to assist him.

500|$|Different {{kinds of}} homosexuals were {{compared}} {{to see whether they}} had differing developmental histories. The [...] "Identification with Father" [...] variable appeared to be important in the development of homosexuality among effeminate, but not non-effeminate, white homosexual men. Bell et al. noted that failure to identify with the father might serve to encourage effeminacy, but that alternatively boys who were effeminate for other reasons <b>might</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to identify with their fathers. Pre-adult homosexual behavior was more important among men who were not effeminate. Bell et al. suggested that for effeminate males early homosexual feelings were the only important predictor of adult homosexuality, while other males were influenced by a combination of homosexual feelings and other factors. Comparing white bisexual men and white homosexual men, Bell et al. found that for the bisexuals sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings. Based on this and other findings, they concluded that exclusive homosexuality tends to emerge from a [...] "deep-seated predisposition" [...] but that bisexuality is [...] "more subject to influence by social and sexual learning." [...] Exclusively homosexual white men tended to report that they had not identified with their fathers, but there was no significant tendency for white bisexual men not to identify with their fathers. Only white homosexual men who had undergone psychotherapy had [...] "paternal variables" [...] that were consistent with what clinicians had considered typical of homosexual males.|$|E

The landlord of the Castle Inn, a local pub, showed Morrison to the house in which Murrell had once lived, and the journalist was also able to meet with Choppen, the smith who had made Murrell's witch bottles. Morrison found that Choppen was living in a small house on the outskirts of Hadleigh; the craftsman revealed that while he had none of the bottles left, he was in possession of Murrell's spectacles. Morrison subsequently met with Murrell's son Edward [...] "a short, sturdy old fellow, with ashock head of loose, white hair" [...] who was then living in Thundersley. Morrison subsequently authored Cunning Murrell, a fictitious account of Murrell's life, as well as a more objective account, the latter for The Strand magazine.

[...] In spite of this, they found that the game had several notable positive aspects, including a [...] "solid" [...] control scheme and [...] "well done" [...] Japanese voice acting and English subtitling. X-Play pointed to the game's [...] "original visual style and a quirky sense of humor" [...] as characteristics that distinguished the game from roguelikes.
