The current onboard practice is recalled, both of <b>mandatory</b> <b>surveys</b> (including class surveys and particularly the new requirements introduced by the IACS Common Structural Rules) and of non mandatory industry-driven inspections. Then, reviews of few databases of marine casualties, available to authors, are presented aiming at assessing the role of aging effects in the marine accidents. Even if it should be admitted that available statistical samples are not always complete and accurate, the intent is to identify trends in the pattern of structural failures and to develop recommendations for improving the inspection regimes and procedures for condition assessment analyses by which to reduce the number and severity of such occurrences...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{monetary}} and non-monetary incentives for increasing response {{is considered a}} proven and widely used method in surveys of individuals or households. This applies not only to mail, but also to face-to-face and telephone surveys. Experimental {{research shows that the}} technique is also effectively used in non-official surveys of organizational populations, not only to increase unit response rates but also to improve response completeness, response quality and speed and even attitude towards the survey sponsor, without negative influence on bias. Nevertheless the use of incentives is typically not applied in official business surveys. We report the meta-analysis of 34 experimental studies that implemented a monetary or non-monetary incentive in order to increase response rates in an establishment survey.

Such activities led to the interception of X. Â fastidiosa-infected coffee plants in consignments originating from Central America.

Here we report the interception of three novel bacterial sequence types in Italy, based on multi-locus sequence typing, that cluster with different X. fastidiosa subspecies, illustrating the risk of the introduction of additional pathogen genetic diversity into Europe. In the epidemic area of Apulia, new foci as well as host plant species positive with X.

40|$|This is a reportThe {{notion of}} independence, as {{commonly}} used, is somewhat fuzzy. Some public bodies, {{such as the}} Federal Reserve System in the United States or the European Central Bank are independent. The Court of Justice of European Communities is also an independent and autonomous institution. These institutions have characteristics consistent with the formal definition {{of the notion of}} independence. They are independent, in the limits of their missions, because they are not subject to outside control. They are separate and do not take instructions from other public bodies. They are financially autonomous and the members of these institutions themselves are qualified and independent. In relation to the field of research, the meaning of independence does not seem excessively problematic. As for the central banks or the judicial institution, a certain amount of independence –independence of the entity, that of the researchers and of the research itself– would be vital for the impartiality {{and the quality of the}} research process and its results. Therefore, an independent accident investigation body should not be subject to outside control in the pursuit of its mission. It should be separate from other bodies, public or private, having financial or other interests in the results of its investigations. It should not take instructions from other bodies or outside personalities. It should have adequate control over the use of its investigation results. Finally, it should be financially autonomous and its members be qualified and independent themselves. In the United States, the contrast between National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is most interesting. While NTSB has a solid reputation as an investigation body, wearing several hats puts NHTSA in a somewhat uncomfortable position. In that particular case, the main problem seems to arise from the ties it has to the manufacturers as the authority responsible for the safety regulations and for the safety investigation. In Europe there are several Directives or Regulations, as well as a White Paper, a Communication from the Commission and a Work Programme, that concern transport safety. In the field of civil aviation, there are two specific European Directives: 1. Council Directive 94 / 56 /EC of 21 November 1994 establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents; and 2. Directive 2003 / 42 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2003 on occurrence reporting in civil aviation The purpose of a safety (or accident) investigation, the authorised methods and practices, as well as the definitions have been set by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) since the 1944 Chicago Convention. Accident investigations in Europe and worldwide rely on the Chicago Convention Annex Bibliographical Analysis Project co-financed by the European Commission, Directorate-General Transport and Energy sn_inrets_wp 4 _d 4. 1 _ 14 / 11 / 2005 _final Page 5 13. The first version of the Annex 13 was drafted in 1951; the current version (9 th) was agreed upon in 2001. The European Directives’ focus is on the structural, financial and functional independence of the investigating body. National laws adapting the international and European requirements concerning the independence of the safety investigation and of the investigation body exist in all studied Member States, namely in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and United Kingdom. All these Member States have an independent civil aviation accident investigation body. In the field of maritime transport, there is one general European Directive: 1. Council Directive 1999 / 35 /EC of 29 April 1999 on a system of <b>mandatory</b> <b>surveys</b> for the safe operation of regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services The purpose of a safety (or accident) investigation, the methods and practices, as well as the definitions have been set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The accident investigation in Europe and worldwide tends to respect the IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents, agreed upon by the Resolution A 849 / 20 from 1997. The European Directive structures the maritime transport in a quite general manner. It is not specific to accident investigation and does not require the Member States to establish an independent investigation body. However, the Directive’s aim is to ensure the harmonised enforcement of some principles agreed upon within the IMO, particularly the IMO Code for the Investigation of Marine Casualties and Incidents. The IMO Code states that ideally an investigation on a marine casualty should be separate from, and independent of, any other form of investigation. Therefore, while the Member States have no formal obligation to establish an independent investigation body for the investigation of marine casualties, this remains an objective. National laws adapting the international and European recommendations concerning the independence of the safety investigation and of the investigation body exist in Germany, France, Finland and United Kingdom. In the field of rail transport, there are three general Directives: 1. Council Directive 91 / 440 /EEC on the development of the Community's railways amended by the 2. Directive 2001 / 12 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001; and 3. Directive 2004 / 49 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on safety on the Community's railways The purpose of a safety (or accident) investigation, the methods and practices as well as the definitions are set by the 2004 Directive. It requires the Member States to establish an independent accident investigation body. The European Directives’ structure the rail transport in a quite general manner. The International Union of Railways (UIC) uses the European definitions for its Bibliographical Analysis Project co-financed by the European Commission, Directorate-General Transport and Energy sn_inrets_wp 4 _d 4. 1 _ 14 / 11 / 2005 _final Page 6 Safety Data Base project. National laws adapting the European requirements concerning the independence of the safety investigation and of the investigation body exist or will shortly be acted in all studied Member States. In the field of road transport, there are no European Directives or Regulations nor any other international legal framework. National laws on safety (or accident) investigation and the investigation body exist in France and in Finland. Italy, Germany and United Kingdom have opted for separate investigation bodies for different transport modes. France has opted for separate investigation bodies for civil aviation and maritime, while all the land transports are investigated by one body. Finland has an investigation body for civil aviation and all major accidents, whether they involve a mode of transport or not, and another system for investigating road and cross-country accidents. It is clear that road accident investigations differ from the accident investigation in other transport modes. Only two of the Member States, whose accident investigation practices have been assessed, have a legal national framework applicable to road accident safety investigation. In France, the decision on opening a safety investigation on a road accident is taken by the Minister of Transport. In 2004, only three accidents involving road traffic vehicles were investigated. In Finland, all fatal road accidents and some non-fatal road accidents are investigated. On average, some 500 road accidents, of which 370 fatal, are investigated annually. The bulk of the research in road safety in all involved Member States, with the exception of Finland, is therefore made by research bodies that do not have the legal status of a body responsible for conducting safety (or accident) investigations...|$|E

The Internet had become "a staple of college students' educational experience…a functional tool" (p. 2). In the Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, Cyber Orientation was implemented to provide transfer students the option of participating in an academic orientation using a web-based program rather than attending an on-campus program. Transfer students were chosen for the pilot because they already had experienced college and possessed a cognitive structure to assimilate the information. Most transfer students admitted to Arts and Sciences have already completed 48 credits or two years of college experience. The assumption was made that transfer students either own computers or have access to computers at their current institutions. The participants of Cyber Orientation were self-selected. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate Cyber Orientation, the website and process, to determine whether the students and academic advisors have been satisfied with this option and to make recommendations for improvement.

40|$|Historical {{maps of the}} Negev Desert which {{comprises}} half of {{the total}} land area of Palestine can be viewed from several intersecting perspectives relating to aspects such as their contribution to tracing patterns of settlement and agricultural history, imperialism and mapping, and legal geography of land ownership and indigenous people. Here we focus mainly on the first theme, incorporate new methods and demonstrate their application to studies in historical geography. Since {{the end of the}} 18 th century the Negev has attracted considerable attention due to its strategic location straddling three continents, its history, and its archeology. After the European powers recognized the geopolitical importance of this area in the mid 19 th century, numerous surveys and mapping efforts were conducted. In this study we reviewed 375 historical maps covering parts or all of the Negev between 1799 and 1948. These historical maps are crucial to the understanding of colonial developments, as well as landscape and settlement processes and the sedentarization of the Bedouin population. We scanned and rectified these maps using geographic information systems (GIS) to enable quantitative analysis of their accuracy, and to reveal new insights into settlement and sedentarization processes. Whereas the median error of maps that were based on explorers notes during most of the 19 th century were at the order of several kilometers, the various Palestine Exploration Fund surveys (1872 - 1890) reduced these errors to the order of several hundred meters, and later maps produced by the British during World War I and by British <b>Mandatory</b> <b>Survey</b> of Palestine obtained errors well below 100 m. Careful analysis of these maps allows us to delineate the boundary between cultivated land and the desert, to follow the establishment of new settlements, and to quantify the sedentarization process of the nomadic Bedouin population. We conclude that analyzing historical maps with GIS provides a tool to determine their accuracy and hence potential usefulness for the study of topics such as settlement processes and legal disputes over land ownership...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO has reviewed several major issues associated with the proposed full implementation of the American Community Survey (ACS) by the Bureau of the Census for 2003. If the ACS is approved, this <b>mandatory</b> mail <b>survey</b> would cost from $ 120 to $ 150 million a year, and would require responses from a sample of 3 million households to some 60 to 70 questions. The ACS would replace the decennial census long form for 2010 and subsequent decennial censuses. On the basis of sampling errors and related measures of reliability, the Census Bureau has decided that ACS data will be published annually for geographic areas {{with a population of}} over 65, 000; as 3 -year averages for geographic areas with a population of 20, 000 to 65, 000; and as 5 -year averages for geographic areas with a population of less than 20, 000. According to the Bureau, the annual ACS data and 3 -year averages would be significantly less accurate than data for 2010 from the decennial census long form; 5 -year averages, which would be available at the detailed long-form level of geographic detail, would be about as accurate as the long-form data. Federal agencies that extensively use the 2000 Decennial Census long-form data for program implementation would use ACS data in the future if the long form was eliminated. The questions to be asked in the 2003 ACS reflect justifications [...] specific statutes, regulations, and court cases [...] provided to the Bureau by federal agencies. To identify these justifications, the Bureau worked with the agencies using a process similar to that used to prepare the justifications for the questions on the 2000 Decennial Census long form. The Bureau's plan to use responses to ACS questions to develop samples for additional surveys is not prohibited by the disclosure provisions in 13 U. S. C. 9, as long as the Bureau conducts the surveys. Some ACS questions duplicated or are similar to questions on two existing federal surveys. Identical questions could be eliminated from the existing surveys because the ACS data would be more accurate, available at greater geographic detail, and more timely. Similar questions could be eliminated if the greater ACS accuracy, detail, and timelines offset the advantage of asking additional and more relevant questions on these surveys. The Bureau determined, and GAO has agreed in a recently issued legal opinion, that it has the statutory authority to conduct the ACS as a <b>mandatory</b> <b>survey,</b> like the decennial census long form the ACS would replace. If the ACS was conducted as a voluntary survey, the Bureau would need {{to make up for the}} lower mail response with more interviews to maintain the proposed level of accuracy of the ACS. Because obtaining responses by interview is more costly than obtaining responses by mail, conducting the ACS as a voluntary survey would be more expensive. The Bureau used a number of strategies to encourage participation in the ACS test program, which started in 1996. Two of the key strategies were (1) the training of interviewers, whose job it was to collect data from households that did not return the mail questionnaires, and (2) outreach and promotion efforts. Telephone and in-person interviewers were provided scripted replies, designed to overcome the objections of nonrespondents, that highlighted themes such as the importance of ACS data to the community and the legal requirement to participate in the ACS. Since 1997, outreach and promotion efforts have increased to include local workshops and town hall meetings, as well as contacts with representatives of print and broadcast media, professional journals, and umbrella organizations. ...|$|R

This historical, geographic distribution led to heterogeneity of various local standards of working and managing methods and procedures, data formats, hardware and software facilities, etc. In the era of worldwide standardization, the Israeli cadastre practice remained anachronistically particular and essentially not standardized. At the end of 2003, a comprehensive project was initiated aiming at the establishment of a better, highly standardized and homogeneously regularized cadastral practice. The existing working procedures will be critically studied and analyzed, and practical steps for their improvement will be proposed. Furthermore, a software application will be specified fo...|$|R
40|$|Populations of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, were {{evaluated}} from five pit-lakes in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, {{to determine if}} accurate proportional stock density (PSD) data {{can be obtained from}} a <b>mandatory</b> creel <b>survey.</b> It was hypothesized that the proportion of stock-to-quality (300 - 400 mm) and quality (+ 400 mm) largemouth bass from four years (2007 - 2010) of creel survey data would be statistically similar to those generated through on-site sampling in 2011. Fish were collected via a combination of gill netting, seining, hook-and-line fishing, and boat-mounted electro-fishing. In two of the pit-lakes, the sampling-generated length frequency data was not significantly different from the creel survey data (Pump Gadj[1]= 0. 03, P= 0. 8629, Goose Gadj[1]= 0. 76, P= 0. 3850). There were significant differences between creel and sampling data for the other pit-lakes (Big Reno Gadj[1]= 5. 74 P= 0. 0166, Airstrip Gadj[1]= 14. 3 P= 0. 0002, Lime Gadj[1]= 9. 81 P= 0. 0017). At least one of the lakes likely demonstrated significances because of low sample size (Airstrip and/or Lime). Changes in population structure due to modified harvest regulations may be responsible for the significant differences (Big Reno and Lime). Population structures were verified with relative weight, length-at-age, and an assessment of five years of largemouth bass and bluegill PSD data. It appears that creel survey data does accurately reflect that of simple sampling techniques and can help guide management decisions...|$|R
40|$|The Survey of Israel (SOI) is a {{national}} agency for geodesy, cadastre and geographic information. According to a British <b>mandatory</b> law (<b>Survey</b> Ordinance, 1929), the SOI is responsible for cadastral mapping, including inspection and approval of block maps and mutation plans. Private licensed surveyors are {{deeply involved in the}} cadastral activity. One of their most important tasks is the preparation of mutation plans of changes in the cadastre. In 1964, a special law of public dwelling was enacted by the parliament. This law permitted the government to build a large number of houses within a short time and to carry out re-parcellation and registration of rights to land following the completion of the building and housing process. The objective of the law was to assist mass immigration. As the result of various difficulties in the procedure, more than 600, 000 existing apartments are not registered in Israel until the present. An inter-ministry governmental committee analyzed the whole process and proposed improvements for its acceleration. One of them should be the classification of licensed surveyors according to the quality of cadastral block maps and mutation plans prepared by them. The idea is to correlate between the classification of the surveyor and the level of inspection carried out by the Survey, establishing a more effective, faster, selective inspection and approval procedure. At the end of 2003, a project was initiated for the completion of such a classification. The paper details the principal ideas of the project...|$|R
40|$|A {{spatially}} explicit coupled hydrodynamic-mass {{transport model}} system {{was used to}} simulate dispersal of particulate organic matter from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming in central Norway. Model setups of 32 m horizontal resolution were run for periods of up to 650 days for 3 sites of different oceanographic characteristics: one fjord location, one medium-exposed location influenced by fjord water, and one coastal location. Records on feed used for each cage at each location were converted to feces released based on a published mass balance model. The results from the simulations were compared with scores from corresponding <b>mandatory</b> benthic <b>surveys</b> (MOM-B) of the sediment layer beneath the farms. The correspondence between simulated and measured thickness of the sediment layer was good, and improved with the inclusion of resuspension processes. At all sites the distribution of organic matter in the bottom layer was non-homogeneous, with significant temporal variation and transport and settling of matter up to at least 0. 5 km away {{from one of the}} farms. Our results indicate that the monitoring practice used in Norway until now, with a few sediment grab samples taken mainly within the fish farm, may not adequately determine the areal impacts of all salmon farming operations. The patchy distribution of organic matter and the correspondence between simulation and survey results is attributed to the use of full 3 D current fields of a high spatiotemporal resolution and a good model for resuspension processes that some previous model studies have failed to properly account for...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Abacavir is a {{nucleoside}} {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor indicated for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) infection. In Japan, Ziagen® (300 -mg abacavir sulfate) has been marketed since 1999. To obtain safety data on Ziagen, a mandatory postmarketing surveillance was conducted between September 1999 and September 2009. Methods: A joint survey [HIV-related Drug Surveys (HRD) ] has been conducted involving manufacturers of drugs for HIV treatment in Japan. Safety data from total 643 cases (1345. 7 person-years) registered to the HRD surveys and received Ziagen were obtained. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) was defined as adverse event of which association with abacavir could not be "ruled out. " Results: It {{was found that the}} overall frequency of ADR was 47. 6 % (306 / 643); the common ADRs were "hyperlipidemia," "nausea," "increased γ-glutamyltransferase level," "increased blood triglycerides," "abnormal hepatic function," and so on. Serious adverse events were reported in 65 subjects; however, none of the three fatal cases were clearly associated with Ziagen use. The survey-defined hypersensitivity has been infrequently reported in 15 subjects (2. 3 %). Although some studies had indicated of the association between abacavir and myocardial infarction, no ischemic heart diseases were reported in the present survey. Two of the three pregnant cases delivered normal neonates (one induced abortion). Conclusions: During the <b>mandatory</b> postmarketing <b>survey</b> of Ziagen, there were no cases of ischemic heart diseases, and the incidence of hypersensitivity was considerably low. These indicated that abacavir can be safely used in Japanese HIV+ population. However, the safety profile of Ziagen should be continued to be monitored through pharmacovigilance...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to perform a survey among European clinical microbiology (CM) and infectious disease (ID) trainees on training satisfaction, training tools, and competency assessment. An online, anonymous survey in the English language was carried out between April and July 2015. There were 25 questions: seven in a 5 -point Likert scale (1 : worst scenario, 5 : best scenario) and the remainder as closed multiple-choice questions in five areas (satisfaction, adequacy, system, mentorship, and evaluation of training). Included were 419 respondents (215 CM, 159 ID, and 45 combined CM/ID) from 31 European countries [mean age (standard deviation) 32. 4 (5. 3) years, 65. 9 % women]. Regarding satisfaction on the training scheme, CM and ID scored 3. 6 (0. 9) and 3. 2 (1. 0), respectively. These scores varied between countries, ranging from 2. 5 (1. 0) for Italian ID to 4. 3 (0. 8) for Danish CM trainees. The majority of respondents considered training in management and health economics inadequate and e-learning and continuing medical education programs insufficient. Many trainees (65. 3 % of CM and 62. 9 % of ID) would like to have more opportunities to spend a part of their training abroad and expected their mentor to be more involved in helping with future career plans (63. 5 % of CM and 53. 4 % of ID) and practical skills (53. 0 % of CM and 61. 2 % of ID). Two-thirds of the respondents across the specialties agreed that a European exam should be developed, but half of them thought it should not be made <b>mandatory.</b> This <b>survey</b> shows high heterogeneity in training conditions in European countries, identifies perceived gaps in training, and suggests areas for improvements...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{neonatal}} and pediatric antimicrobial {{point prevalence}} survey (PPS) of the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children project ([URL] aims to standardize {{a method for}} surveillance of antimicrobial use in children and neonates {{admitted to the hospital}} within Europe. This article describes the audit criteria used and reports overall country-specific proportions of antimicrobial use. An analytical review presents methodologies on antimicrobial use. METHODS: A 1 -day PPS on antimicrobial use in hospitalized children was organized in September 2011, using a previously validated and standardized method. The survey included all inpatient pediatric and neonatal beds and identified all children receiving an antimicrobial treatment on the day of <b>survey.</b> <b>Mandatory</b> data were age, gender, (birth) weight, underlying diagnosis, antimicrobial agent, dose and indication for treatment. Data were entered through a web-based system for data-entry and reporting, based on the WebPPS program developed for the European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption project. RESULTS: There were 2760 and 1565 pediatric versus 1154 and 589 neonatal inpatients reported among 50 European (n = 14 countries) and 23 non-European hospitals (n = 9 countries), respectively. Overall, antibiotic pediatric and neonatal use was significantly higher in non-European (43. 8...|$|R

Unlike typical campus surveys that rely on volunteer student responses, the University of Kentucky made their <b>survey</b> <b>mandatory.</b> Diane Follingstad, Director of the Center for Research on Violence Against Women at UK, said that volunteered data is not always representative. “A survey that goes out to a campus is relying on whomever is willing to complete it. There is always a concern that samples are skewed.” She added, [...] "As best we understand, {{we do not know}} of another survey at a university that includes all their students" [...] The UK survey encompassed 80% of students (24,300 respondents), roughly 5,000 students did not participate in time for the first round of data, and students had the option of opting out of questions if they felt uncomfortable answering them. According to preliminary results, 5% of students reported incidents of completed or attempted vaginal, oral, or anal sex that occurred without their consent in the last year. These results were comparable to previous surveys that used similar measures of sexual assault, such as the 2007 Campus Sexual Assault survey.|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} Area Health Education Centers (AHECs) is {{to recruit and}} educate {{students}} to serve as practicing health care professionals in rural, primary care, and medically underserved communities. We sought to determine if participation in an AHEC-sponsored family medicine clerkship experiences during medical school are significantly associated with a self-reported intent to practice primary care in a medically underserved environment upon graduation. The study was a prospective cohort study comparing third-year family medicine students with the Indiana University School of Medicine who participated in either an AHEC-sponsored family medicine clerkship to those who completed their required family medicine clerkship outside of the AHEC setting. Following the 160 -h clinical clerkship, all students completed a <b>mandatory,</b> electronic <b>survey</b> {{and were asked to}} self-report their intent to the following question: “Which of the following statements best describes the impact of the family medicine clerkship on your intention to provide care to underserved patients when you complete residency training?” The question was integrated into a mandatory post-clerkship evaluation form required by the Indiana University School of Medicine, Department of Family Medicine. A Chi square test of independence as well as a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent association of AHEC clerkship participation and reported intent. A total of 1138 students completed the survey. There were not significant differences in age, gender, race, and ethnicity between students that completed an AHEC clerkship and those that did not. After adjusting for gender, race, and ethnicity, AHEC participants {{were significantly more likely to}} report an intention to practice primary care in a medically underserved setting upon graduation. Female students were found to be 1. 2 – 3. 4 times as likely to report increased intent compared to male students (95 % CI 1. 241 – 3. 394). Participation in an AHEC-supported clerkship was associated with a significant increase in self-reported intent to practice primary care in a medically underserved setting. Additional research is required to determine if participation and/or reported intent are predictive of practice selection after graduation...|$|R

As part of the Illinois Educational Reform Package of 1985, educational administrators were faced with mandatory recertification. This mandate provided the opportunity to study and formulate a recertification plan that had the highest possible chance for success in improving principal behaviors that {{have a positive impact on}} teacher and student performance. To accomplish this goal, diffusion of innovation and policy science literature and research were reviewed to establish a theoretical foundation. In addition to surveying the recertification requirements of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, other professional recertification plans were also reviewed. Finally, a survey instrument was administered to 1, 000 Illinois elementary, junior high, and high school principals to determine their perceptions about various issues related to <b>mandatory</b> recertification. The <b>surveys</b> revealed that a vast majority of states require mandatory recertification for educational administrators every five years and generally includes the option of formal college courses. While a majority of practicing Illinois principals agree with the concept of mandatory recertification, they feel formal college courses are the least effective method for meeting their needs. Theoretical findings and other professional recertification models suggested that a recertification plan should include an appraisal of the individual's strengths and weaknesses, an individually developed plan to address weaknesses, and an evaluation phase to determine if progress has been made. Recertification should be viewed as a cyclical process not a group, isolated experience. The study concludes with a proposed model for recertification...|$|R
