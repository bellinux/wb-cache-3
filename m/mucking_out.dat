50|$|Development mining is {{composed}} of excavation almost entirely in (non-valuable) waste rock {{in order to gain}} access to the orebody. There are six steps in development mining: remove previously blasted material (<b>muck</b> <b>out</b> round), Scaling (removing any unstable slabs of rock hanging from the roof and sidewalls to protect workers and equipment from damage), installing support or/and reinforcement using shotcrete etceteras, drill face rock, load explosives, and blast explosives. To start the mining first step is to make the path to go down. The path is defined as 'Decline' as describe above. Before the start of Decline all preplanning of Power facility, drilling arrangement, dewatering, ventilation and, muck withdrawal facilities are required.|$|R

50|$|The novel {{takes place}} in a fictional {{location}} called the Isles of Bresal which are protected by a bank of mist called The Veil. On Bresal there are stables that train dragons. Cara, the protagonist, cleans dragons for the stable Dragonsdale. Many children attend Dragonsdale to learn to train dragons and take them to competitions, but Cara is forbidden to ride any dragon even though her father is the head of Dragonsdale.This is because her mother had died in an accident during a flight with dragons, and her father, Huw, couldn't afford to lose Cara as well. However, Cara is allowed to help clean the dragons, and she has a favorite one called Skydancer. She ends up having to train a young farm boy called Drane to <b>muck</b> <b>out</b> the stables and do all the things she does.

5000|$|Some verbs {{conjugate}} {{differently in}} Norfolk. The past tense of 'show', for example is 'shew', {{and of the}} verb to snow, 'snew', swam becomes 'swum'. The past of drive is 'driv'. e.g. 'I driv {{all the way to}} Yarmouth, and on the way back that snew.' 'Sang' is always 'sung' ('She sung out of tune'), and 'stank' is always 'stunk' ('After they had <b>mucked</b> <b>out</b> the pigs their clothes stunk'). Many verbs simply have no past tense, and use the present form. e.g. 'Come', 'say' and 'give'. 'When my husband come home, he say he give tuppence for a loaf of bread' meaning 'When he came home, he said, he gave tuppence...'. This even applies to a verb like 'go'. 'Every time they go to get the needle out, it moved'. Verbs whose past participles differ from their active past tenses e.g.'spoken', are mostly ignored in Norfolk. e.g. 'If you were clever you were spoke to more often by the teacher', or 'If I hadn't went up to Mousehold that night'.|$|R

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{survey of}} dairy farms with low bulk milk somatic cell counts {{was carried out}} to assess the level of clinical mastitis and to quantify risk factors associated with the incidence rate of clinical mastitis. Questionnaires were sent to 3009 milk operations with an annual mean bulk milk somatic cell count of less than 100, 000 cells/ml during 1997. A response rate was 61 %. The mean incidence of clinical mastitis reported was 22. 8 cases per 100 cows/yr. Negative binomial regression models {{were used to assess}} statistically significant risk factors associated with the incidence of clinical mastitis. The incidence increased when farmers reported that they had straw yard housing for milking cows (compared with cubicle housing), <b>mucked</b> <b>out</b> the calving area less frequently than once per month, kept cows standing in a yard after milking, always practiced postmilking teat disinfection, had greater than 50 % replacement rate, had some cows that leaked milk on entry to the parlor, had some cows that leaked milk at other times, and foremilked before cluster attachment. The incidence of clinical mastitis was lower on farms when the gathering yard used before milking was scraped at least twice a day, cows were offered feed after both milkings, rubber gloves were not worn during milking, teat liners were changed after 6000 milkings, and the average dry period was less than 40 d. The study has identified areas of the environment in which efforts to improve hygiene should be focused...|$|R

50|$|Corey was a {{champion}} high school wrestler who became intrigued by racing after visiting Santa Anita {{with his father}} after a wrestling tournament {{at the age of}} sixteen. Nakatani eventually approached horse trainer Roger Stein for work. After three days of <b>mucking</b> <b>out</b> stalls and walking horses, he decided he wanted to ride even though he had never been on a horse before. Stein then suggested that he get some experience on a working farm, so he learned the ropes on the Thoroughbred farm of Tony Matos. He then went on and broke and galloped horses for Johnny Longden and Longden's son, Eric Longden before starting his career as a jockey. He graduated from jockey school in Castaic, California, and won his first race, a dead heat, in Caliente, Mexico in 1988 aboard Blue King. He moved to Southern California in April 1989, and became the leading apprentice jockey that same year. His current residence is Southern California.|$|E
40|$|Most work in horse stables is {{performed}} manually {{in much the}} same way as a century ago, with old-fashioned tools and equipment. It is one of the least mechanised sectors dealing with large animals, which often involves work in awkward postures and lifts of heavy loads. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the ergonomic risks in the human-horse work environment. This thesis seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the human-horse work environment, work tasks, workload and frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms and to identify potential risk factors for the development of musculoskeletal symptoms. Self-reporting methods (questionnaires, rating scales), observation methods (OWAS, REBA), descriptive task analysis (HTA, HA, GTS) and biomechanical analysis (JACK) were used to collect and analyse data. Riding instructors surveyed in the questionnaire study reported high levels of perceived musculoskeletal symptoms in at least one of nine anatomical areas during the past year and the past week. The most frequently reported problem areas were the shoulders, the lower back and the neck. <b>Mucking</b> <b>out</b> stables was considered to be the task involving the heaviest work. OWAS analysis showed that three work tasks contained a high proportion of unacceptably awkward work postures, namely <b>mucking</b> <b>out,</b> preparing bedding and sweeping. During <b>mucking</b> <b>out</b> and sweeping, the back was bent and twisted for most of the time. There were many high-risk operations involved in <b>mucking</b> <b>out</b> boxes and disposing of bedding material. Emptying a wheel barrow on the muck heap included high-risk operations with awkward postures such as twisted, bent back arms over shoulder level and handling high loads. The analytical methods used clearly revealed where in the work tasks the ergonomic problems occurred. In almost all operations with a high risk level, a shafted tool or wheelbarrow was used. Analysis of the shaft length of two hand-held tools used for <b>mucking</b> <b>out</b> (manure fork, shavings fork) showed that the manure fork should have a longer shaft to reduce loading on the back. The results for the shavings fork were inconclusive, but indicated the importance of changes in work technique. More in-depth knowledge of the musculoskeletal symptoms and work tasks performed in the human-horse work environment makes it easier to plan and implement measures to prevent musculoskeletal symptoms in this particular group of workers. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the month}} of May, 1867, a pioneer named Stephen <b>Muck</b> pushed <b>out</b> into the {{unsettled}} Graham Lakes region and squatted on land {{on the bank of}} West Graham Lake. When surveyed, this land proved to be on section 22 of Graham Lakes Township. There he built a log structure from timber growing near the lake, the first house of wood in the county. In the fall of 1867, Muck brought his family from Jackson County, Minnesota. He earned his livelihood by trapping for a few years, then turned to farming. He lived continuously on his farm from 1867 until {{the time of his death}} in 1897. Stephen Muck was the first permanent resident of Nobles County.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Red Cross, numerous charity and relief organizations stepped up their activities to aid hurricane victims. The United Methodist Church provided volunteers to help <b>muck</b> <b>out</b> homes and rebuild affected areas. According to the church's volunteer service arm, UMVIM, over thirty thousand United Methodist volunteers have worked in the affected areas since Katrina. Southern Baptist Disaster Relief mobilized hundreds of units from across the US. Southern Baptist Disaster relief manned massive feeding units, shower and laundry facilities, assessment teams, Mud-Out, and chainsaw and debris removal teams across the affected area. The Catholic Charities activated a disaster response plan. The plan targeted areas outside of the disaster that are providing refugee relief and agencies located in or nearby are mobilizing to assist the needy. Operation Blessing began organizing to ship food and relief supplies into the affected areas, as it has done in disaster zones around the world before. America's Second Harvest, a food bank that operates in many communities, began coordinating efforts to ship food donations to coastal areas. Habitat for Humanity announced plans to check on all Habitat-built homes and their residents, and then turn to providing assistance to Habitat families, partners, and volunteers in need of help. The American Public School Endowments began collecting funds to rebuild schools in the affected area, and to aid schools suffering from an onslaught of refugees. Mercy Corps is accepting donations and sending a team of emergency relief experts to the Gulf region to offer financial and technical assistance for immediate and longer-term relief and recovery efforts. Conservative Mennonites sent many volunteer laborers to help with cleaning and rebuilding of homes affected.|$|R
50|$|Shafts can be sunk either dry or for {{methods such as}} the caisson method {{they can}} be sunk wet. Sinking a dry shaft means that any water that flows into the {{excavation}} is pumped out to leave no significant standing or flowing water {{in the base of}} the shaft. When wet sinking a shaft the shaft is allowed to flood and the <b>muck</b> is excavated <b>out</b> of the base of the shaft underwater using a grab {{on the end of a}} crane or similar excavation method. Because the shaft is flooded, the lining can not be constructed at the excavation level of the shaft so this method only suits methods where the lining is installed before shaft sinking (such as the use of sheet piles) or where the lining is sunk down with the shaft such as the caisson method.|$|R
