50|$|The Supreme Court {{has held}} that every fact that {{increases}} the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorized</b> sentence or minimum mandatory sentence must be named in the charging instrument, submitted to a jury, and proved {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} - whether or not statutory law labels that fact as an element of the offense or a sentencing factor. The only exception is the fact of prior conviction, which may be found by a judge. Because the relevant <b>maximum</b> is the <b>authorized</b> sentences that arises from the fact of conviction alone, without additional fact-finding, this principle invalidates mandatory sentencing guidelines that are the equivalent of increasing the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorized</b> sentence.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{optimizing}} the task cycle time of industrial robots integrated in complex robot cells. Trajectory optimizers are usually based on models and can't properly deal with uncertainties due to {{interactions between the}} robot and its environment. We propose here a trajectory optimizer with {{hardware in the loop}} which can take into account constraints such as <b>maximum</b> <b>authorized</b> temperature and <b>maximum</b> <b>authorized</b> torque. Our approach is based on unconstrained optimization algorithms without derivatives and penalty methods. Experiments on real industrial applications showed good robustness properties of this algorithm even with a high number of parameters and with changes of the robot task...|$|R

50|$|Review of {{the train}} event {{recorder}} showed that the Night Owl had exceeded the <b>maximum</b> <b>authorized</b> speed of 100 mph, apparently to make up lost time between New Haven and Boston.

Data from the recorder did not substantiate this, and {{in the view of}} the NTSB even if the Night Owl had begun braking at that point it would still have been going too fast when it reached the curve. Any speed over 59 mph would have led to the derailment and subsequent collision.|$|R
