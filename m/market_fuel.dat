40|$|There is {{continued}} {{interest in}} improving the fuel conversion efficiency of internal combustion engines and simultaneously reducing their emissions. One promising technology is that of Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) combustion. The lack of direct combustion control makes control of CAI combustion challenging. Practical implementation of CAI an engine, the engine's behavior must be predictable. This work investigates the impact of <b>market</b> <b>fuel</b> composition variation and cetane improver additives on CAI combustion in a gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine. The test fuels were blends of different commercial refinery products, containing hundreds of hydrocarbon species. The blends were selected to vary Research Octane Number (RON), olen content, and aromatic content. The blends were chosen based on a <b>market</b> <b>fuel</b> study done by the project sponsor, and subsequent research conducted at MIT. Cetane number improvers are diesel fuel additives used to shorten ignition delay in Diesel engines. Di-tert-butyl ether (DTBP) and 2 -ethylhexylnitrate (2 EHN) were added in concentrations of 4800 ppm and 2000 ppm respectively {{to one of the}} test fuels in an attempt to extend the low load limit (LLL) of CAI operation. Fuel type was found to have a modest impact on the CAI operating range. Valve timing was largely capable of compensating for the changes observed. Neither cetane additive had any significant impact on CAI operation. GDI allowed the use of a split injection strategy involving a pilot injection during negative valve overlap (NVO) recompression, before the main injection during the intake stroke. This strategy, employed at low loads, resulted in heat release during the NVO recompression, which advanced and stabilized main combustion process. At higher engine speeds, the split injection strategy resulted in lower indicated fuel conversion efficiency. by Kevin David Cedrone. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to achieve energy independence, rural {{economic}} development, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction, the United States has turned to fuels derived from agriculture. The U. S. Congress and Environmental Protection Agency mandated the blending of biofuels into conventional gasoline until 2022 under the Renewable Fuel Standard. However, largely missing from the discussion of biofuels is their feasibility regarding environmental protection and end-use marketing to consumers. This thesis investigates the motive for biofuel mandates in the U. S., the irony in the EPA’s decision to back a resource-exhaustive fuel source, and the questionable ability of the U. S. to supply and consume greater volumes of biofuels in the transportation sector. Barriers to consumption are outlined as increased production costs and high <b>market</b> <b>fuel</b> prices, strong political backing of traditional energy sources, and environmental implications of production on ecosystems in certain regions of the United States. By analyzing Iowa and Texas as two biofuel-producing states held in high regards for biofuel production capacity—yet varying degrees of consumption—the feasibility of reaching federal biofuel mandates and promoting this alternative fuel is determined...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{cogeneration}} {{facilities are}} finding electrical procurement contracts with Real Time Pricing (RTP) clauses attractive. By accepting {{a portion of}} the variable energy cost risk, the industrial can reduce the average cost of electricity procurement. From the utility perspective, RTP pricing signals can shape load demand profiles by clipping demand peaks and filling valleys to reduce generation variability and cost. While this may be a Win-Win for both parties, it does increase the operating complexity of both systems. A solution to this class of control problem has evolved over a twelve year period to address an increasing complex problem. Effective cogeneration management is required to ensure that byproduct electric power is produced as dictated by <b>market,</b> <b>fuel,</b> and header conditions while maintaining overall system reliability and stability. Discretionary loads such as condensers and vents must be coordinated to minimize total energy costs as the decision to self generate power changes.
