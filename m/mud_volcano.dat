The island {{is now part of}} the Tiga Island National Park together with Kalampunian Besar and Kalampunian Damit islands as a tourist attractions, with a mud bath tourism. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is a group of five islands of Gaya, Manukan, Mamutik, Sapi and Sulug. These islands are believed to once connected to the Crocker Range but separated when sea levels rose since the last ice age. The Tun Mustapha Marine Park is the largest marine park located in the north of Sabah. It covers the three major islands of Banggi, Balambangan and Malawali. Another marine park is the Tun Sakaran Marine Park located in the south-east of Sabah. The park comprising the islands of Bodgaya, Boheydulang, Sabangkat and Salakan along with sand cays of Maiga, Mantabuan and Sibuan. Bodgaya is gazetted as a forest reserve, while Boheydulang as a bird sanctuary. These islands are formed by Quaternary pyroclastic material that was ejected during explosive volcanic activities.|$|E

2500|$|The thermal {{features}} at <b>Mud</b> <b>Volcano</b> and Sulfur cauldron [...] {{are primarily}} mud pots and fumaroles because {{the area is}} situated on a perched water system with little water available. Fumaroles or [...] "steam vents" [...] occur when the ground water boils away faster than it can be recharged. Also, the vapors are rich in sulfuric acid that leaches the rock, breaking it down into clay. Because no water washes away the acid or leached rock, it remains as sticky clay to form a mud pot. Hydrogen sulfide gas is present deep in the earth at <b>Mud</b> <b>Volcano.</b> As this gas combines with water and the sulfur is metabolized by cyanobacteria, a solution of sulfuric acid is formed that dissolves the surface soils to create pools and cones of clay and mud. Along with hydrogen sulfide, steam, carbon dioxide, and other gases explode through the layers of mud.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{biological}} {{evidence for}} reduced environments in the Mediterranean Sea was {{the presence of}} Lucinidae and Vesicomyidae bivalve shells cored {{on the top of}} the Napoli <b>mud</b> <b>volcano</b> ( [...] ; [...] "Napoli" [...] is only a name of a seamount. It locates south of Crete), located at 1,900m depth on the Mediterranean Ridge in the subduction zone of the African plate. This was followed by the description of a new Lucinidae bivalve species, Lucinoma kazani, associated with bacterial endosymbionts. In the southeastern Mediterranean, communities of polychaetes and bivalves were also found associated with cold seeps and carbonates near Egypt and the Gaza Strip at depths of 500–800m, but no living fauna was collected. The first in situ observations of extensive living chemosynthetic communities in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea prompted cooperation between biologists, geochemists, and geologists. During submersible dives, communities comprising large fields of small bivalves (dead and alive), large siboglinid tube worms, isolated or forming dense aggregations, large sponges, and associated endemic fauna were observed in various cold seep habitats associated with carbonate crusts at 1,700–2,000 m depth. Two <b>mud</b> <b>volcano</b> fields were first explored, one along the Mediterranean Ridge, where most of them were partially (Napoli, Milano mud volcanoes) or totally (Urania, Maidstone mud volcanoes) affected by brines, and the other on the Anaximander mounds south of Turkey. The latter area includes the large Amsterdam <b>mud</b> <b>volcano,</b> which is affected by recent mudflows, and the smaller Kazan or Kula mud volcanoes. Gas hydrates have been sampled at the Amsterdam and Kazan mud volcanoes, and high methane levels have been recorded above the seafloor. Several provinces of the Nile deep-sea fan have been explored recently. These include the very active brine seepage named the Menes Caldera in the eastern province between 2,500m and 3,000m, the pockmarks in the central area along mid- and lower slopes, and the mud volcanoes of the eastern province, as well as one in the central upper slope (North Alex area) at 500m depth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> {{are often}} {{associated}} with lava volcanoes, and the typical relationship is that where they are close, the <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> emit incombustible gases, while the ones further away emit methane.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> {{exist on}} the shores of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Tectonic forces and large {{sedimentary}} deposits around the latter have created several fields of <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes,</b> many of them emitting methane and other hydrocarbons. Features over 200 m high occur in Azerbaijan, with large eruptions sometimes producing flames of similar scale. There are <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> in Georgia, such as at Akhtala.|$|R

The most similar terrestrial feature to these formations are <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes.</b> On Mars, <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> have an average diameter of ~1km and a relief of 10 to 180 meters. Their higher albedo {{is a result of}} more crystalline iron oxides than the rest of Acidalia Planitia. <b>Mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> erupt sediments from deep beneath the surface and change the rising rocks very minimally. These rocks are used to analyze organic matter as <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> also create subterranean conduits for ancient ground water that may have hosted microbiota.|$|R
6000|$|Then by {{companies}} after tiffin we walked chattering to the uplands of Hell. They {{call it the}} Norris Geyser Basin on Earth. It was as though the tide of desolation had gone out, but would presently return, across innumerable acres of dazzling white geyser formation. There were no terraces here, but all other horrors. Not ten yards from the road a blast of steam shot up roaring every few seconds, a <b>mud</b> <b>volcano</b> spat filth to Heaven, streams of hot water rumbled under foot, plunged through the dead pines in steaming cataracts and died on a waste of white where green-grey, black-yellow, and pink pools roared, shouted, bubbled, or hissed as their wicked fancies prompted. By {{the look of the}} eye the place should have been frozen over. By the feel of the feet it was warm. I ventured out among the pools, carefully following tracks, but one unwary foot began to sink, a squirt of water followed, and having no desire to descend quick into Tophet I returned to the shore where the mud and the sulphur and the nameless fat ooze-vegetation of Lethe lay. But the very road rang as though built over a gulf; and besides, how was I to tell when the raving blast of steam would find its vent insufficient and blow the whole affair into Nirvana? There was a potent stench of stale eggs everywhere, and crystals of sulphur crumbled under the foot, and the glare of the sun on the white stuff was blinding. Sitting under a bank, to me appeared a young trooper--ex-Cape mounted Rifles, this man: the real American seems to object to his army--mounted on a horse half-maddened by the noise and steam and smell. He carried only the six-shooter and cartridge-belt. On service the Springfield carbine (which is clumsy) and a cartridge-belt slung diagonally complete equipment. The sword is no earthly use for Border warfare and, except at state parades, is never worn. The saddle is the McClellan tree over a four-folded blanket. Sweat-leathers you must pay for yourself. And the beauty of the tree is that it necessitates first very careful girthing and a thorough knowledge of tricks with the blanket to suit the varying conditions of the horse--a broncho will bloat in a night if he can get at a bellyful--and, secondly, even more careful riding to prevent galling. Crupper and breast-band {{do not seem to be}} used,--but they are casual about their accoutrements,--and the bit is the single, jaw-breaking curb which American war-pictures show us. That young man was very handsome, and the grey service hat--most like the under half of a seedy terai--shaded his strong face admirably as his horse backed and shivered and sidled and plunged all over the road, and he lectured from his saddle, one foot out of the heavy-hooded stirrup, one hand on the sweating neck. [...] "He's not used to the Park, this brute, and he's a confirmed bolter on parade; but we understand each other." [...] Whoosh! went the steam-blast down the road with a dry roar. Round spun the troop horse prepared to bolt, and, his momentum being suddenly checked, reared till I thought he would fall back on his rider. [...] "Oh no; we've settled that little matter when I was breaking him," [...] said Centaur. [...] "He used to try to fall back on me. Isn't he a devil? I think you'd laugh to see the way our regiments are horsed. Sometimes a big Montana beast like mine has a thirteen-two broncho pony for neighbour, and it's annoying if you're used to better things. And oh, how you have to ride your mount! It's necessary; but I can tell you at the end of a long day's march, when you'd give all the world to ride like a sack, it isn't sweet to get extra drill for slouching. When we're turned out, we're turned out for anything--not a fifteen-mile trot, but for the use and behoof of all the Northern States. I've been in Arizona. A trooper there who had been in India told me that Arizona was like Afghanistan. There's nothing under Heaven there except horned toads and rattlesnakes--and Indians. Our trouble is that we only deal with Indians and they don't teach us much, and of course the citizens look down on us and all that. As a matter of fact, I suppose we're really only mounted infantry, but remember we're the best mounted infantry in the world." [...] And the horse danced a fandango in proof.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} our {{estimation}} of fluid sources suggest that the mode of transport differs between the Oomine Ridge and the Kumano <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes.</b> In {{the case of the}} Kumano <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes,</b> both source fluids in sediments and the sediments themselves ascend to the seafloor, whereas on the Oomine Ridge, the source fluids mix with SPF sediments and with fluid from MH dissociation as they ascend to the seafloor, although the sediments themselves do not ascend. These different modes of fluid transport are consistent with hydrocarbon distribution differences between the Kumano <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> and the Oomine Ridge.

Thus, sediments containing hydrocarbons of thermogenic origin rise to the seafloor within the Kumano <b>mud</b> <b>volcanoes</b> and are observed in the pore fluids in the subsurface sediments. In contrast, the fluids supplied to the Oomine Ridge contain CH 4 of microbial origin from the shallow sediments through which the fluids passed during their ascent to the seafloor.|$|R
