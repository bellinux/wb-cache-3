40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a macroscopic nonlinear constitutive law for <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>alloys</b> and ferroelectric ceramics. It accounts for the hysteresis effects which occur in the considered class of materials. The uniaxial model is thermodynamically motivated {{and based on the}} definition of a specific free energy function and a switching criterion. Furthermore, an additive split of the strains and the magnetic or electric field strength into a reversible and an irreversible part is suggested. Analog to plasticity, the irreversible quantities serve as internal variables. A one-to-one-relation between the two internal variables provides conservation of volume for the irreversible strains. The material model is able to approximate the ferromagnetic or ferroelectric hysteresis curves and the related butterfly hysteresis curves. Furthermore, an extended approach for ferrimagnetic behavior which occurs in magnetostrictive materials is presented. A main aspect of the constitutive model is its numerical treatment. The finite element method is employed to solve the coupled field problem. Here the usage of the irreversible field strength permits the application of algorithms of computational inelasticity. The algorithmic consistent tangent moduli are developed in closed form. Hence, quadratic convergence in the iterative solution scheme of governing balance equations is obtained...|$|R

40|$|<b>Magnetostrictive</b> <b>alloys,</b> {{materials}} that change in dimension under an applied magnetic field, are desired candidates for transducers. Unfortunately, common <b>magnetostrictive</b> metals, <b>alloys,</b> and oxides produce such small strains {{that they are}} not a viable option. In the early 1960 's rare earths were found to possess extraordinary magnetostriction values at cryogenic temperatures. When alloyed with traditional transition metals they form a Laves phase compound of the form AB 2. These Laves phase compounds have shown large magnetostriction values, up to 2500 &# 956;&# 949; in TbFe 2. A major drawback to using these materials as transducers is their huge magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants, K 1 and K 2. However, it was found that TbFe 2 and DyFe 2 have opposing signs of K 1 and K 2. A pseudo-binary alloy, Tb 1 -x Dy x Fe 2 (Terfenol-D) TDFx, was formed to decrease the total magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The anisotropy reached a room temperature minimum for TDF 73. It is suspected that this minimum of the anisotropy is accompanied by a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at which the crystal structure changes from tetragonal to rhombohedral. Unraveling the nature of the temperature and composition dependence of the magnetic and crystalline properties along this MPB is the primary focus of this thesis. The structure of the TDF alloys was probed through macroscopic and microscopic techniques. The maximum in the DC magnetization at the transition temperature from tetragonal to rhombohedral broadens as the transition temperature is increased. This is attributed to decreasing anisotropy at increased temperature. Synchrotron and neutron powder diffraction are utilized to elucidate the microscopic changes in the structure and magnetism. Neutron powder diffraction results were somewhat inconclusive but were sufficient to produce magnetic moments that were invariant, within experimental error, across the transition region. Synchrotron powder diffraction was used to probe the structure at temperatures across the MPB. Reitveld refinement of the structure in TDF 65 reveals that large strain gradients exist across the MPBs. This was supplemented by temperature dependent scans of various TDF alloys showing a broadening of the phase transition with increasing temperature which we attribute a widening of the meta-stable [100] and [111] easy directions...|$|R

Elasto-magnetic (EM) sensors are promising for stress monitoring of steel structural components, because of their great capabilities for actual stress measurement, noncontact monitoring, and long service life. However, the low sensitivity, low signal-to-noise ratio, slow response, and complicated installation of the EM sensors limit their application flexibility.

Magnetostrictive Galfenol (Fe 1 -xGax, x = 10 % - 40 %) alloys have generated tremendous interest {{in recent times}} because of their potential as functional materials in various micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) -based transducers and sensors. Among the giant magnetostrictive alloys, Terfenol-D (Tb 1 -xDyxFe 2) has the largest magnetostriction, but its brittle nature limits its applications. In contrast, the next best <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>alloy,</b> Galfenol, is highly malleable and ductile while having the tensile strength of Iron. Electrochemistry is an economical route to fabricate 'very thick' films (upto several microns) or high-aspect ratio structures like nanowire arrays. However, the highly electropositive nature of gallium makes {{it very difficult to}} electrodeposit from aqueous solutions, similar in behavior to other non-ideal elements like molybdenum, phosphorus, tungsten etc. As a result, Fe 1 -xGax alloy plating has been severely plagued by non-repeatability in compositions from growth to growth, lack of uniformity in filling of pores when growing nanowires in nanoporous templates, undesired secondary hydrogen evolution reactions etc. In this study, a thorough understanding of the complex interplay between various deposition parameters (pH, overpotential, concentration, hydrodynamic conditions) was achieved, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deposition mechanism itself, thus allowing excellent control and ability to tune the alloy compositions. Arrays of nanowires were fabricated with alternating segments of the <b>magnetostrictive</b> <b>alloy</b> Fe 1 -xGax and Cu in nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates. A novel rotating disk electrode-template (designed in-house) was used to optimize the nanowire length distributions by controlling the various aspects of electrodeposition like nucleation, kinetics and mass-transfer. Extensive structural characterization was done by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and magnetic characterization by vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Furthermore, of excellent promise in semiconductor spintronics, the feasibility of fabricating epitaxially nucleated Fe 1 -xGax thin films on GaAs having the desired (001) texture was demonstrated. Structural characterization using microdiffraction, high resolution &# 969; - 2 &# 952; and rocking curve analysis revealed that the films grown on GaAs(001) are highly textured with orientation along the substrate normal, and the texture improved further upon annealing at 300 °C for 2 hours in N 2 environment. This was in contrast to films grown on polycrystalline brass substrates which exhibited undesired texture out-of-plane. Rocking curve analysis on Fe 1 -xGax/GaAs structures further confirmed that the texture in the Fe 1 -xGax thin film was indeed due to epitaxial nucleation and growth.

40|$|A stress-biased magnetoelectric sensor with a {{built-in}} permanent magnet has been fabricated using piezoelectric lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate single crystal and <b>magnetostrictive</b> Terfenol-D <b>alloy.</b> The resonance characteristics and magnetoelectric performance of the sensor have been evaluated under different stress-biased conditions. The resonance of the sensor shifts to higher frequency with increasing preloading stress. Due to the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive enhancements under preload, the device exhibits a giant magnetoelectric voltage coefficient of 0. 22 V/Oe at a preloading stress of 2. 5 MPa. This compact device {{has the potential to}} be used as a standalone sensor without requiring external power input. Department of Applied PhysicsAuthor name used in this publication: K. H.

40|$|Magnetic {{properties}} of the hysteresis loop of <b>magnetostrictive</b> amorphous ferromagnetic <b>alloys</b> are predominantly determined by the magnetoelastic coupling energy between the spontaneous magnetization and internal stresses. Domain structures {{as well as the}} pinning of domain walls are governed by long-range and short-range stresses, respectively. As sources of elastic stresses we have detected quasidislocation dipoles exerting stress fields which vary as 1 /r 2. The coercive field is shown to be determined by four types of interactions : 1) volume pinning by stress sources; 2) intrinsic fluctuations of material properties; 3) surface irregularities; 4) relaxation phenomena...|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} sensor was designed, constructed, and evaluated {{for use as}} flow or tactile sensor. Vibrissa-like beams (whiskers) were cut from sheets of the <b>magnetostrictive</b> iron-gallium <b>alloy,</b> Galfenol. These beams were cantilevered, with the fixed end of the whisker attached to a permanent magnet to provide the whisker with a magnetic bias. The free portion of the whisker was quasi-statically loaded, causing the whisker-like sensor to bend. The bending-induced strain caused the magnetization of the whisker to change, resulting in a changing magnetic field in the area surrounding the whisker. The change in magnetic field was detected by a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor placed in proximity to the whisker. Therefore, the electrical resistance change of the GMR sensor was {{a function of the}} bending in the whisker due to external forces. Prototype design was aided using a bidirectionally coupled magnetoelastic model for computer simulation. The prototype was tested and evaluated under tactile loading and low speed flow conditions...|$|R
