40|$|Many plants make varying {{amounts of}} {{aliphatic}} 2 -methylketones, but their mode of synthesis is unclear. High concentrations of 2 -undecanone and 2 -tridecanone in the trichomes {{of a wild}} tomato species Solanum habrochaites {{have been found to}} be toxic to pests. Since cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) produces only low levels of methylketones, the creation of genetic hybrids that produce high levels of methylketones was previously attempted but was unsuccessful. Thus, elucidating <b>methylketone</b> biosynthesis may allow the generation of cultivated tomatoes capable of producing methylketones by genetic engineering. A recent study from our laboratory suggested that plants produce methylketones through de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and identified ShMKS 1 (S. habrochaites <b>methylketone</b> synthase 1) as a gene involved in <b>methylketone</b> biosynthesis. Further genetic analysis of the segregated progenies of the interspecific crosses between S. habrochaites X S. lycopersicum identified another gene, ShMKS 2 (S. habrochaites <b>methylketone</b> synthase 2), which was shown to be necessary for <b>methylketone</b> production. I heterologously expressed of ShMKS 2 in Escherichia coli and observed the production of methylketones. Enzymatic studies of ShMKS 1 and ShMKS 2 showed that ShMKS 2 has a thioesterase activity, hydrolyzing the thioester bond in 3 -ketoacyl-ACPs to produce the corresponding 3 -keto acids, and that ShMKS 1 has a decarboxylase activity towards 3 -keto acids, resulting in the production of 2 -methylketones. Both enzymes were found to be localized in plastids, the site of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants. Constitutive co-expression of ShMKS 1 and ShMKS 2 led to the synthesis of methylketones in Arabidopsis and tobacco but also disrupted growth and development of the transgenic plants. Trichome-specific expression of these two genes in cultivated tomato, by using the promoters of ShMKS 1 and ShMKS 2, did not result in detectable <b>methylketone</b> production. All transgenic plants expressing ShMKS 2 in leaves produced myristic acid, suggesting that ShMKS 2 can hydrolyze myristoyl-ACP as well. The specificity of two tomato trichome-specific promoter was found to be maintained in other species. The results demonstrated the mechanism for <b>methylketone</b> biosynthesis in plants and that any plant species could be engineered to produce methylketones by co-expressing ShMKS 1 and ShMKS 2 in leaves...|$|E

40|$|The trichomes of {{the wild}} tomato species Solanum habrochaites subsp. glabratum {{synthesize}} and store high levels of methylketones, primarily 2 -tridecanone and 2 -undecanone, that protect the plants against various herbivorous insects. Previously, we identified cDNAs encoding two proteins necessary for <b>methylketone</b> biosynthesis, designated <b>methylketone</b> synthase 1 (ShMKS 1) and ShMKS 2. Here, we report the isolation of genomic sequences encoding ShMKS 1 and ShMKS 2 {{as well as the}} homologous genes from the cultivated tomato, Solanum lycopersicum. We show that a full-length transcript of ShMKS 2 encodes a protein that is localized in the plastids. By expressing ShMKS 1 and ShMKS 2 in Escherichia coli and analyzing the products formed, as well as by performing in vitro assays with both ShMKS 1 and ShMKS 2, we conclude that ShMKS 2 acts as a thioesterase hydrolyzing 3 -ketoacyl-acyl carrier proteins (plastid-localized intermediates of fatty acid biosynthesis) to release 3 -ketoacids and that ShMKS 1 subsequently catalyzes the decarboxylation of these liberated 3 -ketoacids, forming the <b>methylketone</b> products. Genes encoding proteins with high similarity to ShMKS 2, a member of the “hot-dog fold” protein family that is known to include other thioesterases in nonplant organisms, are present in plant species outside the genus Solanum. We show that a related enzyme from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) also produces 3 -ketoacids when recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Thus, the thioesterase activity of proteins in this family appears to be ancient. In contrast, the 3 -ketoacid decarboxylase activity of ShMKS 1, which belongs to the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily, appears to have emerged more recently, possibly within the genus Solanum...|$|E

The rate of {{oxidation}} and {{the catalyst}} {{stability in the}} oxidation of 1 -alkenes with O 2 using [PdCl(NO 2) (MeCN) 2] as catalyst is considerably improved {{by the use of}} amides as ligands or solvents. Transition metal catalyzed oxidation of olefins with molecular oxygen has attracted considerable attention from a synthetic, mechanistic, and industrial point of view 1. Environmental constraints with commonly used oxidants and the formation of stoichiometric amounts of co-products are important incentives to develop selective nonradical oxidations with O 2. Various transition-metal dioxygen complexes and studies of oxygen activation have recently been described. 2, 3. The Wacker process, based on palladium dichloride is extremely useful for the conversion of vinyl-substituted compounds into <b>methylketones</b> although there are severe limitations for higher α-olefins due to olefin isomerization or low catalyst stability 1, 4. It has been demonstrated that catalysts based on palladium (II) nitro complexes in some cases offer an excellent alternative to the Wacker oxidation 5. We reported that [PdCl(NO 2) (MeCN) 2], modified with CuCl 2 as co-catalyst and t-BuOH or i-PrOH as ligand or solvent, is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of α-olefins to aldehydes (60 - 70 % selectivity) or <b>methylketones</b> (> 90 % selectivity) using molecular oxygen 6.

Towards transition metal cations, ketones 2 b, 2 c and 2 d are reasonable binders, showing in general preference for Cu 2 +. <b>Methylketone</b> 2 a is a poor binder for these cations, due to its partial cone conformation.

Lactic acid bacteria are weakly lipolytic and mainly possess nonlipolytic esterases located intracellularly. Lipolysis level is, thus, low in many internal bacterially ripened cheeses. It is higher in certain varieties, such as Swiss cheese, smear-ripened, and particularly mold-ripened cheeses, in which specific lipolytic secondary microbiota develops.

Inhibition of AAM formation with arachidonyl trifluoro <b>methylketone</b> (ATMK) in chronically inflamed rabbit intestine reversed the diminished Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange activity. Kinetics studies showed that the reversal was secondary to restoration of the altered affinity of transporter. Downstream regulation of Cl−/HCO 3 − inhibition by AAM was determined to be by the cyclooxygenase pathway since only inhibition of cyclooxygenase with piroxicam treatment reversed the inhibited Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange. Further, DRA was shown to be the primary Cl−/HCO 3 − exchanger in villus cells. Kinetics and molecular studies indicated that the mechanism of inhibition of Cl−/HCO 3 − exchange by cyclooxygenase pathway metabolites was secondary to diminished affinity of the transporter for Cl− without a change in DRA BBM expression. Thus our data indicated that cyclooxygenase pathway metabolites mediate the inhibition of DRA during chronic intestinal inflammation...|$|E

A comparison of gland EST databases from accession PI 126449 and a second L. hirsutum accession, LA 1777, whose glands do not contain methylketones, showed that the expression of genes for fatty acid biosynthesis is elevated in PI 126449 glands, suggesting de novo biosynthesis of methylketones. A cDNA abundant in the PI 126449 gland EST database but rare in the LA 1777 database was similar in sequence to plant esterases.

Geotrichum klebahnii also produces a broad spectrum of ethylesters of branched carboxylic acids, generating a pleasant fruity flavour. Also, precursor speciality fatty acids and PUFA’s can be converted by fungi (such as Penicillum sp. and Botryodiplodia sp.) into flavour compounds, that provide “green notes”, mushroom flavour, fruity lactones and cheese-flavoured <b>methylketones.</b> Similarly, a two step fungal process has been developed, whereby Aspergillus niger tranforms ferulic acid into vanillic acid, which basidiomycetes such as Pycnoporus cinnabarinus or Phanerochaete chrysosporium can further convert into vanillin. Furanone-flavours occur in many fruits, but have also been detected in microbial cultures. In this context, the soy sauce yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii forms the DMHF-furanone compound from glucose, when fed with fructose- 1, 6 -biphosphate. Apart from precursore...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} rapid and direct gas Chromatographic (GC) method for the {{analysis}} of methyl-kelones and secondary alcohols in blue cheese using headspace with constant heating temperature coupled to GC with a mass spectrometric detector. Repeatibility of the method is assessed; the coefficient of variation for individual methyl-ketones ranges from 4. 5 to 9. 6 %, and the total mean value for methyl-ketones is 466. 1 ± 5. 1 μg/ 100 g with a coefficient of variation of 1. 1 %. The coefficient of variation found for individual secondary alcohols in this study ranges from 11. 2 for 2 -pentanol to 22. 6 for 2 -nonanol. The total mean concentration for secondary alcohols (2 -propanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -heptanol, and 2 -nonanol) is 80. 5 ± 5. 0 μg/ 100 g with a coefficient of variation of 6. 2 % (2 -pentanol and 2 -propanol representing 62 % of the total secondary alcohols studied). Recovery ranges between 80. 3 to 88. 6 % for individual <b>methylketones</b> and between 81. 3 and 85. 4 % for secondary alcohols. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Production of 2 -pentanone, a <b>methylketone,</b> is {{increased}} in fasting ketotic humans. Its origin is unknown. We hypothesised {{that it is}} formed via β-oxidation of hexanoic acid by the peroxisomal pathway proposed for methylketone-producing fungi and yeasts. We used Penicillium roqueforti cultured on fat (margarine) to investigate 2 -pentanone production. Headspace gas of incubates of the mould {{with a range of}} substrates was analysed using solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Consistent with the proposed pathway, 2 -pentanone was formed from hexanoic acid, hexanoyl-CoA, hexanoylcarnitine, and ethyl- 3 -oxohexanoic acid but not from ethylhexanoic, 2 -ethylhexanoic, octanoic, or myristic acids, octanoylcarnitine, or pentane. However, the products from deuterated (D) hexanoic-D 11 acid and hexanoic- 2, 2 -D 2 acid were 9 D- and 2 D- 2 -pentanone, respectively, and not 8 D- and 1 D- 2 -pentanone as predicted. When incubated under 18 O 2 / 14 N 2, there was only a very small enrichment of [16 O 2]- with [18 O 2]-containing 2 -pentanone. These are new observations. They could be explained if hydrogen ions removed from hexanoyl-CoA by acyl-CoA oxidase at the commencement of β-oxidation were cycled through hydrogen peroxide and reentered the pathway through hydration of hexenoyl-CoA. This would protect other proteins from oxidative damage. Formation of 2 -pentanone through a β-oxidation cycle similar to Penicillium roqueforti would be consistent with observations in humans...|$|E

Cr(VI) -Oberflächenverbindungen auf oxydischen Trägern und anschließender Protolyse lassen sich oligomere Reaktionsprodukte fassen, die zumindest teilweise durch Zersetzung eines löslichen Chrom-organischen Komplexes entstanden sind. Je nach Katalysatortyp entstehen dabei verschiedene homologe Reihen: mit Cr(II) -Kontakten erhält man -Olefine (bei Ablösung nach O 2 -Zutritt die entsprechenden n-Aldehyde), mit Cr(VI) -Kontakten die geradkettigen <b>Methylketone.</b> Während die Aldehyd-Bildung durch eine Sekundär-Reaktion erfolgt, entsteht die CH 3 CO-Endgruppe offenbar durch primäre Oxydation des C 2 H 4 durch O 2 ̆ 7 fl. Cr(VI). Auf Grund der Protolyseprodukte läßt sich ein Polymerisationsverlauf diskutieren, bei dem die Alken- bzw. Acetyl-Endgruppen an den nicht an Cr gebundenen Kettenenden eingebaut werden. Short time {{polymerization}} of ethylene with Cr(II) and Cr(VI) surface {{species on}} oxide carriers produces oligomeric reaction products, when followed by protonolysis, that originate, {{at least in}} part, from the decomposition of a soluble organochromium complex. Different homologous series result according {{to the type of}} heterogeneous catalyst employed: with Cr(II) contact -olefines are obtained (in presence of O 2 the corresponding n-aldehydes are formed), Cr(VI) contacts give straightchain methylketones. Whereas the aldehyde formation occurs in secondary reactions the CH 3 CO endgroup is produced evidently through the primary oxidation of C 2 H 4 with surface Cr(VI). A polymerization sequence is then discussed in terms of protonolysis products wherein the alkene and acetyl endgroups are attached at that chain end which is not bound to chromium...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{suspensions}} of methane-utilizing bacteria {{grown on}} methane oxidized n-alkanes (propane, butane, pentane, hexane) to their corresponding methylketones (acetone, 2 -butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone). The product methylketones accumulated extracellularly. The {{rate of production}} of methylketones varied with the organism used for oxidation; however, the average rate of acetone, 2 -butanone, 2 -pentanone, and 2 -hexanone production was 1. 2, 1. 0, 0. 15, and 0. 025 μmol/h per 5. 0 mg of protein in cell suspensions. Primary alcohols and aldehydes were also detected in low amounts as products of n-alkane (propane and butane) oxidation, but were rapidly metabolized further by cell suspensions. The optimal conditions for in vivo <b>methylketone</b> formation from n-alkanes were compared in Methylococcus capsulatus (Texas strain), Methylosinus sp. (CRL- 15), and Methylobacterium sp. (CRL- 26). The rate of acetone and 2 -butanone production was linear for the first 60 min of incubation and directly increased with cell concentration up to 10 mg of protein per ml for all three cultures tested. The optimal temperatures {{for the production of}} acetone and 2 -butanone were 35 °C for Methylosinus trichosporium sp. (CRL- 15) and Methylobacterium sp. (CRL- 26) and 40 °C for Methylcoccus capsulatus (Texas). Metal-chelating agents inhibited the production of methylketones, suggesting the involvement of a metal-containing enzymatic system in the oxidation of n-alkanes to the corresponding methylketones. The soluble crude extracts derived from methane-utilizing bacteria contained an oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase which catalyzed the oxidation of secondary alcohols...|$|E
40|$|Western {{flower thrips}} {{is one of}} the most serious crop pests worldwide. Its control relies mainly on {{pesticides}} whose excessive use leads to resistance development and environmental contamination. As an alternative, in this thesis host-plant resistance in wild and domesticated tomatoes was studied using metabolomics. Different resistance mechanisms in which mechanical and chemical defenses work coordinately to fend thrips off were observed and contrasted. In all cases resistance was associated with the exudates of the glandular trichomes on the leaf surface. Different tomato species produce different exudates, mainly acylsugars, sesquiterpenes, <b>methylketones</b> and rutin. Surprisingly, the most effective and efficient defense mechanism was that observed among the domesticated tomatoes: polyphenol oxidase-catalyzed polymerization of rutin upon rupture of glandular trichomes literally welds thrips to the leaf surface. The genetics of chemically-based thrips resistance was also investigated using a chromosomal substitution set consisting of 76 introgression lines. Nine quantitative trait loci for thrips resistance and 268 for foliar metabolites were independently identified, but no chemical compounds in the lamella of tomato leaves could be identified as resistance factors against western flower thrips.

40|$|Xanthomonas campestris is a phytopathogenic {{bacterium}} {{and causes}} many diseases of agricultural relevance. Volatiles {{were shown to}} be important in inter- and intraorganismic attraction and defense reactions. Recently it became apparent that also bacteria emit a plethora of volatiles, which influence other organisms such as invertebrates, plants and fungi. As a first step to study volatile-based bacterial&# 8211;plant interactions, the emission profile of Xanthomonas c. pv. vesicatoria 85 - 10 was determined by using GC/MS and PTR&# 8211;MS techniques. More than 50 compounds were emitted by this species, the majority comprising ketones and <b>methylketones.</b> The structure of the dominant compound, 10 -methylundecan- 2 -one, was assigned {{on the basis of its}} analytical data, obtained by GC/MS and verified by comparison of these data with those of a synthetic reference sample. Application of commercially available decan- 2 -one, undecan- 2 -one, dodecan- 2 -one, and the newly synthesized 10 -methylundecan- 2 -one in bi-partite Petri dish bioassays revealed growth promotions in low quantities (0. 01 to 10 &# 956;mol), whereas decan- 2 -one at 100 &# 956;mol caused growth inhibitions of the fungus Rhizoctonia solani.

The reaction of ArTeCl 3 (Ar = I-C lO H 7, Np; 2, 4, 6 -Me 3 C 6 H 22 ̆ 7 Mes) with (SB) HgCI [SB = the Schiff base, 2 -(4, 42 ̆ 7 -N 0 2 C 6 H 4 CH=NC 6 H 3 -Me) ] or a methyl ketone (RCOCH 3) afforded the corresponding dichlorides (SB) ArTeCI 2 (Ar = Np, 1 Aa; Mes, 1 Ba) or (RCOCH 2) ArTeCl 2 (Ar = Np; R = Ph (2 Aa), Me (3 Aa), Np (4 Aa); Ar = Mes, R = Ph (2 Ba)). Reduction of 1 Aa and 1 Ba by Na 2 S 2 0 5 readily gave the tellurides (SB) ArTe (Ar = Np (1 A), Mes, (1 B) but that of dichlorides derived from <b>methylketones</b> was complicated due to partial decomposition to tellurium powder and diarylditelluride (Ar 2 Te 2), resulting in poor yields of the corresponding tellurides 2 A, 2 B and 3 A. Oxidation of the isolated tellurides with S 0 2 Cl 2, Br 2 and I 2 yielded the corresponding dihalides. All the synthesized compounds have been characterized {{with the help of}} IR, 1 H, l 3 C, and 125 Te NMR {{and in the case of}} 2 Aa, and 2 Ba by X-ray crystallography. Appearance of only one 125 Te signal indicated that the unsymmetric derivatives were stable to disproportionation to symmetric species. Intramolecular 1, 4 -Te·. · 0 secondary bonding interactions (SBIs) are exhibited in the crystal structures of both the tellurium(IV) dichlorides, 2 Aa, and 2 Ba. Steric repulsion of the mesityl group in the latter dominates over lone pair-bond pair repulsion, resulting in significant widening of the equatorial C-Te-C angle.
