BBSes {{that did not have}} {{integrated}} FidoNet capability could usually add it using an external FidoNet front-end mailer such as FrontDoor, BinkleyTerm, InterMail or D'Bridge, and a <b>mail</b> <b>processor</b> such as FastEcho or Squish. The front-end mailer would conduct the periodic FidoNet transfers, while the <b>mail</b> <b>processor</b> would usually run just before and just after the mailer ran. This program would scan for and pack up new outgoing messages, and then unpack, sort and [...] "toss" [...] the incoming messages into a BBS user's local email box or into the BBS's local message bases reserved for Echomail. As such, these mail processors were commonly called [...] "scanner/tosser/packers." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{system works}} by {{automated}} {{optical character recognition}} of postcodes. Integrated <b>mail</b> <b>processors</b> scan {{the front and back}} of an envelope and translate addresses into machine-readable code. Letters are given a red barcode that represents the address. The barcode follows the RM4SCC pattern.|$|R
50|$|Integrated <b>Mail</b> <b>Processors</b> (IMPs) {{read the}} {{postcode}} on the item and translate it into two phosphorous barcodes, {{unique to the}} inward and outward parts of the postcode, which the machines subsequently print and read, to sort the mail to the correct outward postcode. Letters may also be sequentially sorted by a Compact Sequence Sorter (CSS) reading the outward postcode, in the order that a walking postman/woman will deliver, door to door. On such items the top phosphorous barcode is the inward part of the code, the bottom is the outward.|$|R

As a result, the USPS began a massive change effort in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s. One of the initiatives implemented to improve labor-management relations was a derivative of the self-managed work team known as the crew chief program. This study provides a mixed-methods and multi-level approach to understand the impact this unique program had on organizational attitudes. The first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the crew chief program reduced employees 2 ̆ 7 stress and strain and improved job and supervisory satisfaction and company and union commitment, while controlling for the nesting of employees within sites and employee demographic characteristics. The second aim was to replicate and extend the stressor-strain-outcome (SSO) model of stress and to determine whether employee perceptions of crew chief support moderated the relationships between stressors, strain, and outcomes. I evaluated Aim 1 using data from 177 <b>mail</b> <b>processors</b> from 27 units matched from baseline to one-year follow-up with hierarchical linear modeling. This was followed up with an implementation analysis of qualitative data to determine the extent to which the program was implemented compared to the original design. I evaluated Aim 2 using structural equation modeling from 538 <b>mail</b> <b>processors</b> who participated at follow-up. There was little quantitative support for Aim 1. However, the results of the implementation analysis suggested that the crew chief program was not functioning as conceived. Aim 2 received strong support, with almost all of the main effects of the SSO model replicated. However, there was no support for the moderator effects. Additionally, I found role ambiguity to have direct relationships with other organizational outcomes beyond the indirect effects via strain and that crew chief support was strongly related to stressors and outcomes. These findings reinforce the notion that employing both quantitative and qualitative methods can dramatically improve the quality of organizational research. Based on these findings, I describe several suggestions for improvements to this specific program and for improving future initiatives aimed at enhancing labor-management relations...|$|R

40|$|Intrusion detection, anomaly detection, {{time series}} analysis, Markov processes. We present an {{approach}} to anomaly detection based {{on the construction of}} a Hidden Markov Model trained on processor workload data. Based on processor load measurements, a HMM is constructed as a model of the system normal behavior. Any observed sequence of processor load measurements that is unlikely generated by the HMM is then considered as an anomaly. We test our approach taking real data of a <b>mail</b> server <b>processor</b> load to construct a HMM and then we test it under several experimental conditions including a simulated DoS attacks. We show some evidence suggesting that this method could be successful to detect attacks or misuse that directly affects processor performance. ...|$|R
