40|$|The {{identifiable}} {{pattern of}} the qualitative geomorphologic parameters such as steepness and concavity values that derived from the slope-area analysis of 28 tributaries in the San Gabriel Mountains were used to estimate relative rock uplift rates. The {{results suggest that the}} eastern region of the San Gabriel Mountain is controlled by a high rock uplift rate while the western region is controlled by a low rock uplift rate. Furthermore, arrangement of the variations of the steepness and concavity values suggests the presence of an active fault zone between the western and the eastern region of the San Gabriel Mountains. This tectonic zone is responsible for the apparent differentiation in rock uplift rates between the two mountain regions. This conclusion is supported from previous knowledge that suggests faster exhumation and high erosion rates of the East San Gabriel (ESG) block and slower exhumation and lower erosion rates of the Western San Gabriel (WSG) block (Spotila, J., Blythe, A., House, M., Niemi, N., Gregory, B., 2002). Moreover on the technological side of this project, plots of steepness or concavity values derived from analysis of SRTM (30 meter resolution), ASTER (30 meter resolution), USGS (30 meter resolution) and USGS (10 meter resolution) DEMs analysis suggest that USGS DEM- 10 meters and SRTM DEM- 30 meters are currently the most accurate methods to accurately quantify differential steepness and concavity values for the area of the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California. Finally, the application of different smoothing options on the plots of slope-drainage area analysis of the tributaries of the San Gabriel Mountains suggests that a 600 <b>meter</b> <b>window</b> size is the optimum size with more reliable information and better noise elimination.

The inverse kinematics of the robotic arm was solved using a Newton-Raphson numerical method with a numerically calculated Jacobian. The system was validated by testing its ability to find a kinematic solution for the catch position and successfully catch the ball within the robot's workspace. The tests were conducted by throwing the ball such that its path intersects different target points within the robot's workspace. The method used for determining the catch location consists of finding the intersection of the ball's trajectory with a virtual catch plane. The hand orientation was set so that the normal vector to the palm of the hand is parallel to the trajectory of the ball at the intersection point and a vector perpendicular to this normal vector remains in a constant orientation during the catch.

30|$|First, {{methods for}} {{back-light}} compensation detection and operation, {{that are based}} on the (difference of) measured signals in various areas of the image, have intrinsic problems if the object of interest is miss-positioned, or if it leaves the area of interest. The consequence is the severe underexposure of the important foreground object. To detect the change of object position, areas of interest are often set several times larger than the size of the object. However, the average intensity level of the whole <b>metering</b> <b>window</b> can be so high {{and the size of the}} object of interest can be very small, that insufficient back-light compensation occurs and the object details still remain invisible. Second, the changed object position can also give problems to the video-level controller, due to a considerable change of the measured signal because of the large differences in weights of the metering zones. These problems can be solved by dynamic weighting schemes.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The {{statistics}} describing {{variations of}} turbulent motions within {{the so called}} inertial range of length scales depend on the scale over which the motions are varying and the "average" {{rate at which the}} turbulent kinetic energy is being dissipated on the molecular scale. This hypothesis stemmed from the similarity arguments published by A. N. Kolmogorov in 1941 and implies specific scaling relations between the average amplitude and length scale of turbulent motions. Turbulent motions agree to a good approximation with Kolmogorov scaling provided the fluid flow admits to the underlying assumptions. More recently it has been recognized that the large spatial variations in the rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation may be a partial explanation for deviations from Kolmogorov scaling. This recognition {{is due in part to}} the observation that the total volume occupied by turbulent motions of a given scale decreases as the scale decreases. These observations imply that active small scale turbulence is intermittent. This study aims to better understand how scaling relations describing more active regions are different from the relations describing turbulence where the small scales are less active. The thesis is that the relations are different. An 18 hour segment of wind data measured in near-neutral stratification 45 meters above a relatively flat ground is analyzed. There is virtually no trend in the mean wind speed, so the describing statistics are essentially stationary. Small scale activity is measured in terms of the difference in wind speed (structure function) at a separation distance of 1 / 16 of a second, which translates to about a meter. The differences in wind speed are raised to the sixth power and then averaged over 4 second (50 <b>meter)</b> <b>windows.</b> Non-overlapping windows containing a local maximum in the averaged sixth order structure function form one (MASC) ensemble of more active small scale samples and the local minima form another (LASC) ensemble of less active small scale samples. The variations in wind speed as a function of length scale within each ensemble are decomposed five different ways. Each of the five decompositions obey scaling relationships that are approximately linear in log-log coordinates. The MASC and LASC ensembles include 32...|$|R

50|$|Heating {{glass is}} mostly used for heating of windows. It is {{especially}} useful for rooms where people {{spend much time}} by the windows, at home or at work. The most common usage of heating glass—windows of cottages, office buildings and also big areas—leaded panes, translucent roofing, garret windows, canopies and so on. Heating glass is used for defogging and prevention of frosting of windows of pools, saunas and other buildings of such kind. Insofar as heatable glass has a current-carrying coating, {{it can be used}} as the sensor of alarm systems. When the glass is destroyed the system of protection is activated and it results in activation of alarm system. This kind of product is widely used on objects of tightened standards in questions of protection: nuclear power plants, stations of air navigation control, museums, special storehouses, etc. Heatable glass is also used in production of windows for different kinds of vehicles: electric and diesel locomotives, vessels and boats, various kinds of aircraft and automobiles. One of well-known examples of application of heating glass is armored windows, because the protective glazing is very thick and is disposed to frosting. The usage of heating glass is especially urgent in terms of being the part of armored multiple glass of Smart Glass of switchable transparency, because the heating significantly decreases the period of reaction of liquid crystals structure. The power consumed by products depends on the type of use. Power of about 50-100 watts per square <b>meter</b> of the <b>window</b> is generally enough for maintenance of comfort temperature in the room and for maintenance of glass surface temperature at the rate from +20 degrees to +30 degrees. When the heatable glass is used as the only source of heat it is necessary to maintain the glass surface temperature at the rate from +30 degrees to -45 degrees and provide the power of 100 to 300 watt for 1 square <b>meter</b> of the <b>window.</b> The power needed for vehicle windows reaches 1.5 kilowatts per square meter or more, which is why there are such tight standards in terms of sputtering of current-carrying components. Heat power of about 500-700 watts per square meter of glazing is necessary for snow unloading and taking ice-covering off the outside protective translucent constructions in low temperatures and windy environments.|$|R

A key factor for success is to deliver material in the right quantity, {{at the right time}} and to the right place. Other factors that play an important role are quality standards, leadership and above all, customer first. The customer should be placed {{at the top of the}} value chain, and be treated with respect. Markets are driven by short lead time and companies cannot rely on brand loyalty. The purpose of this study is to develop a general model for analysis and improvement of the supply chain for manufacturing companies, with focus on components from external suppliers. The model is created based on a literature review and to examine this, the model was tested at Företaget. The empirical data is mainly conducted by interviews, complemented by one observation. The analysis model consists of seven areas based on Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Lean. A key factor to analyze these seven areas is to map the current situation. The results have been filtered through the analysis model and have led to suggestions for improvement. These suggestions are only recommendations and the companies choose what to take further into action. Företaget is one of Sweden’s leading window manufacturers with two strong brands, Produkt 1 and Produkt 2. Most of the production process is carried out in Edsbyn and the size of the factory is as big as ten football pitches at 65, 000 squares <b>meters.</b> Wooden-aluminum <b>windows</b> are an increasing trend and stands for two thirds of the sales. The study is focusing on one selected component which is the flow for aluminum profiles.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 119). Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed December 20, 2011). The two ways to produce electricity using solar radiation are (1) direct, {{by the use of}} photovoltaic cells or (2) indirect with an intermediate step of production of solar thermal energy. Solar thermal energy is being produced by solar power plants, which consist of a power tower with a central solar receiver on top where concentrated solar radiation coming from a heliostat field is reflected, absorbed and later transformed into electricity. The work presented in this thesis contributes to the design of a prototype for such a central solar receiver called the small particle solar receiver. It {{is part of a larger}} project and builds on an older design for the small particle heat exchange receiver first conceived 30 years ago. This thesis has the main goal of giving calculations and a feasible design for a much larger, pressurized, more efficient version of the above-mentioned solar receiver. The theoretical base comprises the previously published literature on the subject, as well as an investigation of similar products or products that share one or more features with the concept developed in this research. The methodology includes the study of theory of thin shells of revolution and follows the logical steps of a traditional design process. The techniques include finite element analysis of the model, structural optimization and other relevant studies such as failure theories and the study of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Following this research, it is shown how a final, feasible and efficient design can be built on an initial simple concept of a pressure vessel that is 3 meters in diameter and 5 <b>meters</b> deep with <b>windows</b> on the end exposed to solar radiation, called the aperture structure. Each individual window mounts in its own special flange welded onto the aperture porthole and its own secondary concentrator is also mounted onto the flange. The secondary concentrators are mirrors that redirect scattered and lost sunlight into the receiver through the window. It is suggested that they are made out of highly reflective aluminum. Stainless and carbon steels were analyzed and the final product was suggested to be an austenitic stainless steel pressure vessel with custom ellipsoidal heads and with 6 same-size fused silica windows mounted on the aperture head. The presence of portholes on the aperture structure increases the maximum stress concentration by 167 %. Several thermal and structural analyses were performed on the receiver model for different work conditions. The receiver walls were calculated to be a minimum of 1. 7 cm for the ideal work conditions of 5 bar pressure and 100 - 400 ??C wall temperature and 2. 7 cm thick for 8 bar pressure and the same wall temperature. The window calculations showed that a theoretical minimum of 0. 75 cm thickness is necessary for the spherical cap profile and 0. 2 cm for a custom designed ellipsoidal shape for temperatures as high as 800 ??C and 5 bar pressure...|$|R
