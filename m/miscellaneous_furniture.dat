60|$|All the {{articles}} first mentioned were, doubtless, presents from foreign powers. They {{were more or}} less injured: the fowling-pieces and swords were rusted; the finest woods were scratched; and a folio volume of Hogarth lay open, with a cocoa-nut shell of some musty preparation capsized among the <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>furniture</b> of the Rake's apartment, where that inconsiderate young gentleman is being measured for a coat.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Tillotson's {{room was}} {{about ten feet}} {{below the level of}} the soil of South Holloway. A little grey light percolated through the area bars, forced a {{difficult}} passage through panes opaque with dirt, and spent itself, like a drop of milk that falls into an inkpot, among the inveterate shadows of the dungeon. The place was haunted by the spur smell of damp plaster and of woodwork that has begun to moulder secretly at the heart. A little <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>furniture,</b> including a bed, a washstand and chest of drawers, a table and one or two chairs, lurked in the obscure corners of the den or ventured furtively out into the open. Hither Spode now came almost every day, bringing the old man news of the progress of the banquet scheme. Every day he found Mr. Tillotson sitting in the same place under the window, bathing, as it were, in his tiny puddle of light. [...] "The oldest man that ever wore grey hairs," [...] Spode reflected as he looked at him. Only there were very few hairs left on that bald, unpolished head. At the sound of the visitor's knock Mr. Tillotson would turn in his chair, stare {{in the direction of the}} door with blinking, uncertain eyes. He was always full of apologies for being so slow in recognising who was there.|$|E
5000|$|Currently the {{building}} houses approximately 3.5 acre of used cubicle partitions and other <b>miscellaneous</b> office <b>furniture.</b> It {{also is the}} site of Russ Parsons' famous collection of [...] "hot dog cars," [...] rumored in certain circles to be worth tens of thousands of dollars.|$|R

Private sidings were operated by British Sugar, Burlingham & Son, J Gough & Son, Ridley Coal & Iron and H A& D Taylor.|$|R
50|$|With {{more than}} 3100 {{commercial}} ship calls each {{year at the}} port, Melbourne provides access to more than 300 ports of call across the globe. In 2009-10, the ten main containerised commodity exports, in decreasing quantity, were: miscellaneous manufactures, cereal grains, beverages, dairy products, fruit & vegetables, paperboards & fibreboards, pulp & wastepaper, timber, stockfeed, paper & newsprint. In 2009-10, the ten main containerised commodity imports, in decreasing quantity, were: <b>miscellaneous</b> manufactures, <b>furniture,</b> electrical equipment, paper & newsprint, fruit & vegetables, machinery, clothing, vehicle parts, metal manufactures, rubber manufactures.|$|R
50|$|Later, these food {{shipments}} {{from foreign}} sources changed mainly to shipments from Oregon and internal shipments in California as agriculture {{was developed in}} both states. Food like molasses, flour, oysters, hams, barrels of salted meat, rice, coffee, tea, eggs (from Mexico); cheese, sugar, coffee, potatoes, onions, limes, coconuts, raisins, almonds. Some of the goods that were imported by ship included liquor: absinthe, alcohol, ale, beer, whiskey, cognac, cider, champagne, wine, sherry, brandy, claret. Tools like shovels, picks and gold balances. Consumables like cigars, cards, candles; clothing: boots, shoes, underwear; pants, shirts, etc. Fruit like bananas, oranges, and lemons. Lumber from Oregon {{and other parts of}} the U.S. and England (500,000 board feet of lumber and 500,000 bricks from Bath, England in one ship's cargo). Building materials like nails, bricks, linseed oil, shingles, windows, stoves, lumber, etc.. <b>Miscellaneous</b> items like <b>furniture,</b> wagons, carts, fishing boats, steam engines, etc. Coal that was needed to power the steam ships. Livestock like hogs, cows, horses, sheep, chickens, etc. Completed knocked down houses both metal and wooden. Some ships carried mostly mail and passengers. Almost anything could eventually be bought at some price. As time went on many or indeed most of these supplies were grown or made locally; but some specialized items were nearly always cheaper to import on shipsâ€”still true today.|$|R
60|$|In {{this most}} venerable and {{sheltered}} little nest have I passed several quiet years of existence, comfortably {{lodged in the}} second floor of one of the smallest but oldest edifices. My sitting-room is an old wainscoted chamber, with small panels and set off with a <b>miscellaneous</b> array of <b>furniture.</b> I have a particular respect for three or four high-backed, claw-footed chairs, covered with tarnished brocade, which bear the marks of having seen better days, and have doubtless figured in some of the old palaces of Little Britain. They seem to me to keep together and to look down with sovereign contempt upon their leathern-bottomed neighbors, as I have seen decayed gentry carry a high head among the plebeian society with which they were reduced to associate. The whole front of my sitting-room is taken up with a bow window, on the panes of which are recorded the names of previous occupants for many generations, mingled with scraps of very indifferent gentleman-like poetry, written in characters which I can scarcely decipher, and which extol the charms of many a beauty of Little Britain who has long, long since bloomed, faded, and passed away. As I am an idle personage, with no apparent occupation, and pay my bill regularly every week, I am looked upon as the only independent gentleman of the neighborhood, and, being curious to learn the internal state of a community so apparently shut up within itself, I have managed to work my way into all the concerns and secrets of the place.|$|R
