To attune the transmitted vibration, a typical isolation system was installed without a significant amount of analysis, and consisted of unrestrained pump base <b>mount</b> <b>pads</b> and flexible couplings on the suction and discharge pipes. Initial testing shows that while the base <b>mount</b> <b>pads</b> worked well, the lack of a positive seismic restraint made those devices unsuitable for use in an earthquake zone.

40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} measurement parameters and boundary conditions on shape accuracy of parabolic trough concentrator mirrors of RP 3 geometry by means of optical measurements and finite element analyses. Deflectometric measurements of mirror panels are performed in common laboratory setups: in vertical and horizontal measurement position, both with and without tightening the mirrors to a support frame with screws. The results serve for validation of finite element models which are applied to calculate the difference in shape accuracy between, firstly, the individual setups and secondly, between mirrors horizontally fixed to differently rigid support frames. The effect of angular deviations of the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> is assessed. Gravity-induced deformation of mirrors mounted to two exemplary collector support structures is determined for the relevant working positions. The transferability of shape accuracy data measured in laboratory to data applying for mirrors mounted to a collector is assessed. For RP 3 inner mirror panels a difference of up to 0. 8 mrad in root mean square slope deviation (SDx) and 3. 3 mm in root mean square focus deviation (FDx) from vertical to horizontal position is measured. Gravity-induced deformation and resulting slope and focus deviation on three different types of horizontally oriented support frames is modeled: an ideally rigid support frame, a laboratory support frame, and an ideal support frame with elastic brackets. A variation of 0. 5 mrad (SDx) and 1. 8 mm (FDx) is calculated for perfectly shaped RP 3 inner mirrors mounted onto an ideally rigid support frame compared to the case when mounted to a support frame with elastic brackets. In case of an angular deviation of the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> mirror panels fixed to an ideally rigid support frame show additional local slope deviation in {{the magnitude of the}} angular pad deviation. Due to gravity-induced deformation and slope deviation the shape accuracy of RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to an ideally rigid collector support structure varies up to 1. 0 mrad in SDx and up to 1. 2 mrad in SDx when compared to the ideal shape and the shape in zenith collector angle, respectively. For RP 3 inner mirrors mounted to a collector structure with elastic brackets the values are 1. 6 mrad and 2. 1 mrad. Whereas the models of mirrors mounted to a laboratory support frame allow for a conversion and thus a comparison of results obtained in different setups, the models for the collector support structure need to be refined in order to allow for a conversion from laboratory to collector measurement results. The results demonstrate that measurement position, mounting mode and employed support structure have to be documented in order to obtain reproducible measurement results. They should hence be included as measurement boundary conditions in guidelines for the measurement and assessment of mirror shape accuracy for concentrating solar collectors. The inspection of the angular accuracy of the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> is part of a complete optical mirror assessment.

For components mounted directly on the PWB <b>mounting</b> <b>pads,</b> that is, surface mounted components, the tin-lead solder also constitutes the mechanical interconnection. Eutectic solder has a melting point of 183 °C (361 °F). It is {{important to realize that}} its homologous temperature, defined as the temperature in degrees Kelvin over its melting point temperature (T(m)), also in degrees Kelvin, is defined as T/T(m). At room temperature (25 °C = 298 K), eutectic solder's homologous temperature is 0. 65. It is widely acknowledged that materials having a homologous temperature ≥ 0. 5 are readily subject to creep, and the solder joints of printed wiring assemblies are routinely exposed to temperatures above room temperature. Hence, solder joints tend to be subject to both thermal fatigue and creep. This can lead to premature failures during service conditions. The geometry, that is, the lead configuration, of the joints can also affect failure. Various geometries are better suited to withstand failure than others.

40|$|Here are {{guidelines}} for deembedding the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> in standard component models to achieve accurate EM simulation By default, Modelithics library models include mounting pad effects. Hence, when performing full wave electromagnetic (EM) analyses the pad geometries {{should not be}} included in the geometry setup used to define the EM analysis. However, there are reasons to include the pads in the EM simulation instead of having them inside the components models. Some of these reasons are: • Use of a pad size different from the one included with the model, or outside the range of pad dimensions if using a padscalable model. • Including the step effect when the feed line is different from the pad width. This step can also be included using an analytical model in a circuit simulation. • Including the effects of coupling between the pads and another part of the circuit. • Desire to simulate the pads along with other printed circuit patterns as a standard practice. Modelithics models include a feature that allows the pads to be deembedded from the model, thus leaving the part effectively without the pads.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the limits}} to {{characterization}} of tissues at the microscopic level is the substantial {{costs associated with the}} instrumentation required for such investigations. The use of strain gages for displacement or force measurements can be adapted to this microscopic scale provided the gages are incorporated into a transducer consisting of a curved geometry. Materials and Methods: Uniaxial strain gages 13 mm (L) × 6 mm (W) were secured to 0. 2 -mm thick brass shim stock fabricated to yield a 12. 5 -mm diameter semicircle with mounting tabs on either end. The terminal ends of the strain gage <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> were connected to an adjustable strain gage amplifier with adjustable gain and offset. For displacement calibration, the transducer was secured to the jaws of a digital caliper. Caliper displacement was set to ± 0. 25 mm increments from 0 to a maximum of ± 1. 5 mm. In this configuration, positive represents tension. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000, and 5000 to observe nonlinearity. For each of three displacement calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded at each distance with the mean output at absolute distances averaged across each of three runs for each of six transducers. Using the same transducers, a mass balance was used to identify the unique individual mass associated with a total of 10 masses to within ± 10 μg. The masses were sequentially secured to the transducer and the respective output voltage recorded. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000 and 5000. For each of three force calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded with respect to the force generated by the suspended masses. The mean output across each of three runs for each of six transducers was subjected to linear regression. Results and Discussion: All transducers displayed good linearity when calibrated for displacement with regression R 2 values of 0. 9994, 0. 9967, and 0. 9941 for amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. Further, in displacement mode, the transducers provided a mean output of 0. 66, 1. 01, and 3. 86 V/mm at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. In force mode, regression R 2 in excess of 0. 9995 were observed over all amplifier gain settings examined. When employed as force transducers, the devices provided mean outputs of 0. 60, 1. 15, and 5. 85 V/N at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. The response of these devices to either applied displacement or force permits the use of a single device type to be used as either a displacement or force transducer. The electrical output in either mode at modest amplification gains of 5000 combined with excellent linearity affords the use of these devices for studies where characterization of tissues requires mN and μm level resolution. Conclusions: A transducer employing a strain gage had been configured so as to function as either a displacement or force measuring instrument.

This configuration, {{similar to that}} found on marine G-engines beginning in 1965, consisted of an iron intake manifold with open-plenum 2-barrel carburetor <b>mounting</b> <b>pad,</b> a Carter BBD carburetor, and associated air cleaner, linkage and plumbing changes. Also installed on these export 2-barrel engines was a slightly hotter camshaft (244° duration rather than 240°), and a distributor with modified advance curves. This engine, rated at , was popular in Central and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Driveability characteristics were generally superior {{to those of the}} 1-barrel engine, but to avoid cutting into sales of the more expensive V8 engine, this 2-barrel setup was not offered in the North American market. Of particular note is the automatic choke design found in this export 2-barrel setup. Most Chrysler products used remote automatic chokes, with a bimetal coil spring mounted on the exhaust manifold, exposed to exhaust heat and operating a pushrod which rotated the choke lever on the carburetor. The export 2-barrel setup used an integral heat-tube style automatic choke: Air heated by the exhaust manifold was routed to a round bakelite housing on the carburetor air horn, which contained a bimetal spring acting directly on the choke lever.|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines tested {{new designs}} of drag bit cutters with {{sintered}} diamond inserts instead of standard tungsten carbide tips. The bits were tested for orthogonal cutting forces, primary dust generation, and incendivity, {{with a standard}} plumb-bob type conical cutter (600 included tip angle) as the reference. Preliminary wear and impact-failure testing were also done. The results were mixed. Two new designs had forces {{similar to those of}} the reference bit, but one new design had about twice the normal force. This same design had almost twice the specific energy during shallow cutting but generated an equal or slightly lower amount of primary dust than did the reference bit. Incendivity was eliminated for two radial designs. One conical design had ignition only after more than 15 impacts, but the other conical design was incendive. Impact failure occurred, but not so quickly as anticipated. Over 7, 500 impacts on a sandstone face, with a total cutting distance of more than 1, 981. 2 m, only scuffed the leading edge of the sintered diamond cutting face but put hairline cracks in the substrate <b>mounting</b> <b>pad.</b> Additional design and testing are needed to develop an optimum cutter, but prospects look good for this material...|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Ford {{offered the}} Highway Pilot Speed Control Option, with {{steering}} wheel <b>pad</b> <b>mounted</b> rocker switches, on its Thunderbird. Uniquely, the Thunderbird also lightly applied {{the brakes and}} illuminated the stop lamps when the Retard was continuously depressed with the cruise control on, but not engaged.|$|R
