5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for <b>making</b> <b>art,</b> tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It {{disappeared}} from its mainland range {{at the end}} of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat, hunting by humans, or a combination of the two. Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. It has been proposed the species could be recreated through various means, but none of these are yet feasible.|$|E

40|$|Students are {{regularly}} involved in <b>art</b> <b>making</b> {{as a part}} of the general school curriculum. This study investigated and documented sixth grade students' <b>art</b> <b>making</b> in terms of thinking and the construction of knowledge. Following qualitative research procedures the study took place in two sixth grade classrooms. Four questions directed the investigation. These included inquiries into the subjects' <b>art</b> <b>making</b> knowledge base, how knowledge is used in the practice of classroom <b>art</b> <b>making,</b> ways in which <b>art</b> <b>making</b> exhibits cognitive and reflective thinking, and finally how student production is affected by interactions with other members of the environment. Data was collected through observation and informal interview. Data collection activities focused on three student subgroups, identified by peers as having an interest, disinterest or a neutral attitude toward classroom <b>art</b> <b>making.</b> Analysis of data revealed three broad patterns of behavior relative to student <b>art</b> <b>making.</b> Reflecting the research questions these behaviors considered ways <b>art</b> <b>making</b> knowledge is constructed by students, how <b>art</b> <b>making</b> knowledge is used for the process of art production problem solving, and the impact of other members of the environment on the <b>art</b> <b>making.</b> These data indicate that subjects are especially able to construct and use <b>art</b> <b>making</b> knowledge in terms of technique and procedure. Knowledge exhibited through the use of analytical and critical language was observed less frequently, and with less skill. Subjects' processed <b>art</b> <b>making</b> as cognitive and reflective thinking, rather than as spontaneous activity.

Junctures of the <b>art</b> <b>making</b> activity specifically considered the envisioning of the problem, choosing appropriate production actions and the determination of a work's completion. Interaction between members of the setting was also prevalent during class observations.

25|$|At {{the outset}} of the First World War many artists were mobilized: Metzinger, Gleizes, Braque, Léger, de La Fresnaye, and Duchamp-Villon. Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to {{continue}} <b>making</b> <b>art,</b> sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an evasion of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift between art and life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation.|$|E

500|$|The non-toxic, non-staining, {{reusable}} {{modeling compound}} {{that came to}} be known as [...] "Play-Doh" [...] was a pliable, putty-like substance concocted by Noah McVicker of Cincinnati-based soap manufacturer Kutol Products. It was devised at the request of Kroger Grocery, which wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper. [...] Following World War II, with the transition from coal-based home heating to natural gas and the resulting decrease in internal soot, and the introduction of washable vinyl-based wallpaper, the market for wallpaper cleaning putty decreased substantially. McVicker's nephew, Joe McVicker, joined Kutol with the remit to save the company from bankruptcy. Joe McVicker was the brother-in-law of nursery school teacher Kay Zufall, and Zufall had seen a newspaper article about <b>making</b> <b>art</b> projects with the wallpaper cleaning putty. Her students enjoyed it, and she persuaded Bill Rhodenbaugh (who also sold the putty) and Joe McVicker to manufacture it as a child’s toy.

Minecraft and Lego were also used to create little items like fruits and chairs in the video. The 3D theme also expanded onto using artist Nathan Sawaya's Lego sculpture Yellow—which showed a man ripping his chest out—in a sequence showing Gaga's head being transposed on the artpiece. Sawaya recalled that Gaga had contacted him for collaborating on the music video. They mutually agreed on the idea of <b>making</b> <b>art</b> [...] "accessible" [...] and decided on the different sculptures to be created, including a duplicate of Yellow, without the head. Sawaya then traveled to Hearst Castle to install the art pieces for the shoot. Multiple designer dresses were also used in the video namely, a white ensemble with a giant headpiece by Jean Paul Gaultier, jeans by Versace, a red swimsuit by La Perla and a black one by Madrid label POL, jewelry from Lynn Ban, and custom made sandals form Ruthie Davis. The homicide scenes showed designs by Helen Yarmak, lace bodysuits by Somarta and Aturo Rios feathered headpiece.
