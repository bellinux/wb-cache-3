5|$|A {{traditional}} {{game played}} {{under the rules}} of the Canadian Lacrosse Association consists of three periods of 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>each</b> (similar to ice hockey), with the teams changing ends each period. The NLL plays four 15-minute quarters rather than three periods. If the game is tied at the end of regulation play, a 5-minute overtime (15 in NLL) can be played. Overtime {{may or may not be}} sudden victory, depending on the league.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these team-specific efforts, the Panthers participate {{in a number of}} regular initiatives promoted by the NFL and USA Football, the league's youth football development partner. These include USA Football Month, held throughout August to encourage and promote youth football; A Crucial Catch, the league's Breast Cancer Awareness Month program; Salute to Service, held throughout November to support military families and personnel; and PLAY 60, which encourages young NFL fans to be active for at least 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>each</b> day.|$|E

5|$|Indoor soccer {{features}} {{six players}} per team {{as opposed to}} the standard eleven, and is played without an offside rule on an artificial field of play. The pitch is far smaller than that used in regular soccer, with a regulation size of 200 feet by 85 feet, identical to a North American ice hockey rink. The goals and penalty areas are also scaled down. Instead of two halves of 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>each,</b> matches are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The show's writers, all {{newcomers}} aged between 17 and 22, {{were selected}} through a writing competition, {{and created the}} series at a BBC summer school. The theme tune was also selected through a competition, promoted on BBC Radio 1. The show primarily operates as a standalone series but also cross-references storylines of the main soap, and features cameo appearances from several of the regular characters from EastEnders. The episodes are between three and 16 <b>minutes</b> <b>each</b> in length and are available via EastEnders official website. Omnibus editions were also available on BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and, from April 2010, BBC Three.|$|E
5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>each</b> in duration. Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, {{it was possible to}} upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it was possible to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Chartjackers was {{distributed}} both {{on television and}} online. It ran for a single series of eleven episodes: the first ten episodes lasted for five <b>minutes</b> <b>each,</b> with the final compilation episode running {{for half an hour}} and gaining a viewership peak of half a million. Chartjackers premiered on BBC Two on 12 September 2009 at 12:50p.m., as part of the channel's two-hour-long BBC Switch segment – it was uploaded to the YouTube channel BBCSwitch the same day. This practice of broadcasting an episode on BBC Two and uploading it to the BBCSwitch channel the same day continued throughout the series. Episodes were also streamed online through BBC iPlayer to UK residents for seven days after their initial broadcast. The show was not broadcast outside of the UK and, , is not available on DVD.|$|E

5|$|Friday's late {{afternoon}} qualification session {{was divided into}} two groups lasting 25 <b>minutes</b> <b>each.</b> Cars in LMGTE Pro and AM were sent out first and, after a five-minute interval, LMP1 and LMP2 vehicles drove onto the track. All cars were required to be driven by two participants for one timed lap each, with the starting order determined by the competitors' fastest average times. The fastest qualifier was awarded one point which went towards the Drivers' and Manufacturers' Championships. The session took place in clear, mild and dry weather. Hülkenberg's first timed lap of 1:55.130 surpassed the LMP1 pole position record time only to be surpassed by Hartley's 1:54.777 lap time to place the No. 17 Porsche in provisional pole position. Bernhard took over from Hartley and recorded a lap that was 0.027 seconds faster than the latter lowering the car's two-lap average time to 1:54.767 clinching pole position. It was the third consecutive event where Bernhard, Mark Webber and Hartley started from pole position.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Disney {{contracted}} with the Stratemeyer Syndicate and Grosset & Dunlap to produce two Hardy Boys TV serials, starring Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk. The {{first of the}} serials, The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure, was aired on The Mickey Mouse Club in 1956 during the show's second season. To appeal to the show's audience, the Hardy Boys were portrayed as younger than in the books, seeming to be twelve or thirteenyears old (Considine was 15 and Kirk was 14 during filming). The script, written by Jackson Gillis, {{was based on the}} first Hardy Boys book, The Tower Treasure, and the serial was aired in 19episodes of fifteen <b>minutes</b> <b>each</b> with production costs of $5,700. A second serial, The Mystery of Ghost Farm, followed in 1957, with an original story by Jackson Gillis. However, for unknown reasons, no more serials were produced.|$|E
5|$|Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations of {{blue and}} fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept {{infrasonic}} pulses from 16 to 40hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20hertz and 20kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>each.</b> The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186decibels relative to 1micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected {{hundreds of miles from}} their source.|$|E

5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve <b>minutes</b> <b>each</b> to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and fourth}} sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>each.</b> Conditions were dry and overcast for the Friday {{practice sessions}} and was held on a dirty track which was caused by rainfall in the run up to the event. Michael Schumacher set the first session's fastest time with an early lap of 1 minute and 21.982 seconds, half a second quicker than teammate Barrichello. Häkkinen had the third fastest time, ahead of Ralf Schumacher and Jean Alesi. The two Benetton drivers were sixth and eighth (with Fisichella ahead of Alexander Wurz); the two were separated by Johnny Herbert. Eddie Irvine and Verstappen completed the top ten. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher was unable to improve his time but remained fastest; Ralf Schumacher had the second fastest time after putting on a new set of tyres {{towards the end of the}} session. Barrichello was third-fastest, ahead of Jarno Trulli, Coulthard and Jenson Button. Häkkinen, Pedro Diniz, Frentzen and Alesi followed in the top ten.|$|E

The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and fourth}} sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>each.</b> Conditions were dry for the Friday morning and afternoon {{practice sessions}}. Coulthard set the first session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 53.398 seconds, eight-tenths of a second quicker than Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen had the third-fastest time, with Jarno Trulli, Barrichello and Jacques Villeneuve in the next three positions. The two Benetton drivers were seventh and eighth (with Wurz ahead of Fisichella), and the Williams cars of Ralf Schumacher and Button completed the top ten. Alesi's Prost had a fuel-pressure problem which prevented him from completing a timed lap, and he was the slowest overall. In the second practice session, due to a slow rear puncture Coulthard's first-session lap was still the fastest; Häkkinen had the second-fastest time. Jaguar driver Johnny Herbert changed his car's balance, improving its performance and finishing third-fastest. Villeneuve moved into fourth after changes to his car's setup; Michael Schumacher slipped to fifth, and Wurz finished sixth. Jos Verstappen was seventh-fastest, ahead of Fisichella, Barrichello and Trulli.|$|E

Verstappen, Michael Schumacher and Coulthard filled in the next three positions. Fisichella, Johnny Herbert, Jacques Villeneuve and Mika Salo rounded out the top ten positions. Häkkinen's car was afflicted with a mechanical fuel pump issue; this restricted him to one out lap and he was slowest overall. In the second practice session, Coulthard set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:12.464; Häkkinen had a trouble free season and ended with the second fastest time. Salo ran quicker during the session and was third fastest. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello had the fourth and seventh fastest times respectively; they were separated by Zonta and Trulli. Villeneuve, Diniz and Fisichella completed the top ten positions. After the second session, Irvine, who had only participated in the first practice session, withdrew from the Grand Prix.

Porsche led the time sheets early on with a flying lap from Hartley in the No. 1 entry before Bernhard improved it to clinch the team's first pole position of the season with an average time of one minute and 55.793 seconds. This was Hartley's, Bernhard's and Webber's seventh of their careers, and the 13th for the German manufacturer. They were joined on the grid's front row by team-mates Jani and Lieb who were nearly eight-tenths of a second off Bernhard and Hartley's pace but it marked the first occasion that Porsche began an World Endurance Championship in the first two starting positions since the 2015 6 Hours of Bahrain. Lieb was not happy with his fastest lap because he braked early and was unable to achieve a rhythm he liked.|$|E
5|$|HD 93083 is {{an orange}} dwarf star of {{spectral}} type K3V that is smaller and cooler than the Sun.
