50|$|In a ship mortgage, a {{shipowner}} gives {{a lender}} (or mortgagee) {{an interest in}} a ship as security for a loan. Similar to other types <b>of</b> <b>mortgage,</b> a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage</b> legally consists <b>of</b> three parts: the mortgage loan, the mortgage document (deed) and the rights derived from the mortgage deed onto money lender. Ship mortgages differ from other types <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> in three ways. First, some privileged claims could have a higher ranking over that of mortgagee against the ship. Second, ships naturally move between jurisdictions. And third, a ship is always at risk of partial or total damages at sea. The use <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> <b>mortgages</b> emerged as a widely accepted practice in shipping industry in the 19th century as a major source <b>of</b> finance for <b>ship</b> owners.|$|R

40|$|Bank {{and other}} {{financial}} institutions providing ship finance require legal protection {{just as much as}} other entrepreneurs. When a bank finances the purchase <b>of</b> a <b>ship,</b> the borrower has to execute a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage</b> in favour <b>of</b> the bank. By definition, a ship mortgage is a security over the ship which enables the bank, on default by the borrower, to take possession <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> and sell it to discharge the debt. In order to enforce the ship mortgage, the bank may ask a maritime court to arrest the ship and, through judicial procedure, sell or auction it. This paper comparatively explores the legal and practical issues regarding the nature and the enforcement <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> <b>mortgages</b> in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. When a bank finances the purchase <b>of</b> a <b>ship,</b> the borrower has to execute a <b>ship</b> <b>mortgage</b> in favour <b>of</b> the bank. By definition, a ship mortgage is a security over the ship which enables the bank, on default by the borrower, to take possession <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> and sell it to discharge the debt. In order to enforce the ship mortgage, the bank may ask a maritime court to arrest the ship and, through judicial procedure, sell or auction it. Ownerships and <b>mortgages</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> may be registered with any registries located in jurisdictions such as Panama, Liberia, Bahamas, Vanuatu and the Marshall Islands. These registries are {{often referred to as the}} “flags of convenience”. As these countries depend significantly on income from shipping, they open their registers to non-nationals. Anyone can register a <b>ship</b> on one <b>of</b> these open registers, and a link between the nationals of the flag state and the ship is not required (1). On the other hand, a ship is a highly mobile vehicle of carriage. It may not return to its home base nor visit the same port again. It is a well-established international shipping practice that ship mortgages can be enforced world-wide, regardless <b>of</b> where the <b>mortgages</b> are registered. This paper comparatively explores the legal and practical issues as regards the nature and the enforcement <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> <b>mortgages</b> in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The introduction <b>of</b> laws on <b>ship</b> <b>mortgages</b> and registration were prompted by the China’s need to purchase more vessels and obtain shipping finance through various finance structure such as equity, debt or charters that are consistent with international standards. In fact, most major shipping companies in China expand their fleets by adopting these types of financing structures or arrangements. The Rules of the People’s Republic of China Governing Registration <b>of</b> <b>Ships</b> came into force on 1 st January 1995 (the Registration Rules). Under the Registration Rules, the following ships shall be registered: ships owned by citizens of the PRC whose residence or principal places of business are located within the territory thereof; ships owned by enterprises with legal person status established under the laws of the PRC and whose principal places of business are located within the territory thereof, provided that if foreign investment is involved, the proportion of registered capital contributed by Chinese investors shall not be less than 50 %; public service <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> the PRC Government and ships owned by institutions with legal person status; and other ships whose registration is deemed necessary by the competent authority of harbour superintendency of the PRC. The Bureau of Harbour Superintendency is the competent authority in charge of the registration <b>of</b> <b>ships,</b> but the Ship Registration Administration (situated at various ports) is the agency in control of actual registration. Before registration can occur, the Harbour Superintendency requires submission of proper documentation (2). Having examined and verified the application for registration <b>of</b> ownership, the <b>Ship</b> Registration Administration shall issue to the shipowner whose application meets the requirements of the Rules, a Certificate <b>of</b> Registration <b>of</b> <b>Ship’s</b> Ownership and a Certificate <b>of</b> <b>Ship’s</b> Nationality. Where <b>mortgage</b> is established with respect to a <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> 20 tons gross tonnage or over, the mortgagee and the mortgagor shall apply to register it with the Ship Registration Administration (3) to obtain a Certificate <b>of</b> Registration <b>of</b> <b>Ship</b> <b>Mortgage.</b> Where two or more mortgages have been established on the same ship, the authority will make the registration in sequence of dates on which the applications were registered, and indicate the respective dates in the register <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> Special provisions covering the making of commercial loans also exist. Thus, a Chinese shipping company wishing to borrow foreign currencies in its own name directly from a foreign entity for the purpose of purchasing vessels, must first seek approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). This is governed by the Administration of Borrowing of International Commercial Loans by Domestic Organisations Procedures promulgated by SAFE in 1997. Under the laws, all international commercial loans (4) require SAFE approval or risk being declared void. In addition, all international commercial loans must be registered with SAFE which will then issue a Foreign Debt Registration Certificate, to be presented to authorised banks. This will enable borrowers to open foreign exchange bank accounts and undertake procedures for remitting foreign exchange abroad. Bearing in mind that some overseas lenders may be reluctant to take a mortgage over a vessel under the PRC flag, there has been a recent tendency for domestic shipping enterprises wishing to avoid the red tape of the above procedures, to set up subsidiaries in developed maritime countries such as Liberia and Panama. Under such schemes, loans are advanced to these subsidiaries for the purchase <b>of</b> <b>ships,</b> but once the transactions are completed, both the ownership and mortgages must be registered with the appropriate Liberian or Panamanian authorities. The offshore subsidiaries may then charter the ships back to their mother companies in China (5). As part of the transaction, the Liberian or Panamanian shipowners must also assign all their rights and benefits (e. g. assignment of insurance proceeds, charter, sub-charter and freight) in favour of the overseas lender as security. When a foreign mortgagee enforces his foreign registered mortgage in China, the law of the flag state (not Chinese Law) shall apply to the <b>mortgage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> (6). It is speculated that this strategy will continue to dominate the market <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> financing in the PRC, unless the relevant authorities relax the control of foreign exchange. Although cutting down on the red tape, the SAFE may not be entirely excluded from these proceedings, as the overseas financial institutions involved may require guarantees from the parent companies in China for the loans advanced to their overseas subsidiaries in addition to taking <b>mortgages</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ships.</b> Assignment by the Chinese companies, the bareboat charter, rights in relation to the various insurances <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> and the sub-charter freight may also be regarded as guarantees which require SAFE approval. Under the Rules Governing Guarantees, only qualified financial institutions authorised by the central government can provide guarantees to foreign lenders for foreign debts. Government departments and unincorporated institutions cannot issue guarantees for foreign debts. Any subsequent amendment to the principal loan agreement shall be subject to the consent of the guarantor and to the approval of SAFE...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>mortgage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> as a security in shipping finance, charterparty has increasingly developed its role {{as one of the}} important securities which the creditor will commonly take it as a supplemental security to secure the sum of loan granted to the shipowner. The charterparty is considered as a major source of income of the shipowner which will generate the cash flow to sustain the business. The law governing the assignment of charterparty as a security varies from country to country therefore the perfection or requirement in order to acquire the legal protection and the rights given to the assignee are subsequently different. The choice of law to govern the assignment of charterparty may create a difficulty when the enforcement is brought to a court of the country other than the country of governing law. This thesis illustrates the different of the law governing the assignment of charterparty by giving the comparison between Norwegian and English laws. Moreover, the thesis points out the possibility of the application of a foreign law as well as suggest a possible guideline {{in order to avoid the}} unexpected difficulty through the attempts of the international organizations...|$|R
