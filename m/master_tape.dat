5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The group {{achieved}} a satisfactory rhythm track {{in a single}} take. On 7 September, this recording – comprising two organ parts, bass guitar and drums – was reduced to two tracks on the 4-track <b>master</b> <b>tape,</b> after which Harrison overdubbed his double-tracked lead vocal, and he, Lennon and Paul McCartney added backing vocals. Among Beatles biographers, MacDonald credits Harrison as the sole organ player on the song, while Kenneth Womack and John Winn write that Lennon played the second keyboard part. Recording was completed at Abbey Road on 6 October, {{with the addition of}} tambourine, played by Ringo Starr, and cello. The latter was performed by an unnamed session musician. As with all the songs recorded for Magical Mystery Tour, final mixing was carried out on 7 November.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles taped {{the main}} track, {{consisting}} of guitars, piano and drums, at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. The session {{took place on}} 2 June 1966, the day after Harrison met Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar {{for the first time}} and secured Shankar's agreement to help him master the sitar. The band recorded five takes of the song before Harrison selected the third of these for further work. After reduction to a single track on the four-track <b>master</b> <b>tape,</b> their performance consisted of Harrison on lead guitar, treated with a Leslie effect, McCartney on piano and Ringo Starr on drums, with Lennon adding tambourine. The group then overdubbed vocals, with McCartney and Lennon singing parallel harmony parts beside Harrison's lead vocal. Further overdubs included maracas, the sound of which Pollack likens to a rattlesnake; additional piano, at the end of the bridge sections and over the E79 chord in the verses; and handclaps.|$|E

5|$|During {{his initial}} {{research}} into cyberculture, Idol ordered Beyond Cyberpunk! from Gareth Branwyn. The HyperCard stack, which included collections of essays on cyberpunk culture, inspired Idol to include similar material within the Cyberpunk album {{as a special}} edition digipak feature. Discussing the matter with Branwyn, Idol received an initial bid {{for the job of}} producing the disk from the writer. While this bid was under consideration by Idol's management company, Idol had purchased a book-on-disk by Jaime Levy at a Los Angeles bookstore. At the time, Levy was the author and publisher of Electronic Hollywood, one of the first magazines produced on floppy disk. Impressed by its contents, Idol set about contacting her for the job of producing the disk. Successfully under-bidding Branwyn, she was then given the job and a <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> of recorded songs – which were not yet compiled into CD format – for use in sampling. Levy was given permission to include whatever content she desired. Meeting Idol to find what he was interested in presenting in the disk, his only concern was that the whole cyberpunk genre be represented as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|These songs, however, {{were pulled}} from the album before the final <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> was compiled.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of that year, someone stole a <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> of a rough draft of the album from one of Gaye's {{traveling}} musicians, Frank Blair, taking the <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> to Motown's Hollywood headquarters. Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981. When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of an unfinished production (Far Cry), altering the album art of his request and removing the album title's question mark, muting its irony. He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Picasso painting. Gaye then vowed not to record any more music for Motown.|$|E

25|$|In late 1980, {{the group}} signed with IRS Records {{subsidiary}} Faulty Products and recorded their second album, Wild in the Streets, released in 1982. The title track was a cover {{version of a}} song by Garland Jeffreys. Faulty Products ceased operations several months after its release, forcing Circle Jerks to seek their third record deal in as many years. While they regained the copyright to Wild in the Streets, the original stereo <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> was lost, forcing the band to remix it from the multi-track tapes when they reissued the album in 1988.|$|E
25|$|David Wheeler, {{who earned}} the world's first Computer Science PhD {{working on the}} project, is {{credited}} with inventing {{the concept of a}} subroutine. Users wrote programs that called a routine by jumping {{to the start of the}} subroutine with the return address (i.e. the location-plus-one of the jump itself) in the accumulator (a Wheeler jump). By convention the subroutine expected this and the first thing it did was to modify its concluding jump instruction to that return address. Multiple and nested subroutines could be called so long as the user knew the length of each one in order to calculate the location to jump to; recursive calls were forbidden. The user then copied the code for the subroutine from a <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> onto their own tape following the end of their own program.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} seen video clip of Bobby Orr's famous overtime goal ("The Flight") in Game 4 of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals is the American version broadcast on CBS as called by Dan Kelly. This archival clip {{can be considered}} a rarity, since about 98% of the time, any surviving kinescopes or videotapes of the actual telecasts of hockey games from this era usually emanate from CBC's coverage. According to Dick Irvin, Jr.'s book My 26 Stanley Cups (Irvin was in the CBC booth with Danny Gallivan during the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals), he was always curious why even the CBC prototypically uses the CBS replay of the Bobby Orr goal (with Dan Kelly's commentary) instead of Gallivan's call. The explanation that Irvin received was that the CBC's <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> of the game (along with others) was thrown away in order clear shelf space at the network.|$|E
5000|$|The Masters at Work Remix and Frankie Knuckles remixes all contain {{previously}} unheard vocals and ad-libs {{not heard}} on the original album version.

25|$|Mascis {{listened to}} classic rock {{artists such as}} the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, {{elements}} of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound. In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as The Birthday Party, and has frequently noted Nick Cave as an influence. Dinosaur Jr.'s members also combined elements of hardcore punk and noise rock in their songs, which often featured {{a large amount of}} feedback, distortion and extreme volume. When the <b>master</b> <b>tape</b> of You're Living All Over Me arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound. To accentuate their use of volume, the band employed and popularised the quiet–loud change of dynamic in many of its songs, a technique that would be later popularised by Pixies, Nirvana and alternative rock in general during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Captioning is {{modulated}} {{and stored}} differently in PAL and SECAM 625 line 25 frame countries, where teletext is used {{rather than in}} EIA-608, but the methods of preparation and the line 21 field used are similar. For home Betamax and VHS videotapes, a shift down of this line 21 field must be done due to the greater number of VBI lines used in 625 line PAL countries, though only {{a small minority of}} European PAL VHS machines support this (or any) format for closed caption recording. Like all teletext fields, teletext captions can't be stored by a standard 625 line VHS recorder (due to the lack of field shifting support); they are available on all professional S-VHS recordings due to all fields being recorded. Recorded Teletext caption fields also suffer from a higher number of caption errors due to increased number of bits and a low SNR, especially on low-bandwidth VHS. This is why Teletext captions used to be stored separately on floppy disk to the analogue <b>master</b> <b>tape.</b> DVDs have their own system for subtitles and/or captions that is digitally inserted in the data stream and encoded on playback in video field lines.|$|E
