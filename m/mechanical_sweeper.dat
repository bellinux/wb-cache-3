60|$|The room is, of course, {{very clear}} and clean and simple; {{not by any means}} cheaply equipped, but {{designed}} to economise the labour of redding and repair just as much as is possible. It is beautifully proportioned, and rather lower than most rooms I know on earth. There is no fireplace, and I am perplexed by that until I find a thermometer beside six switches on the wall. Above this switch-board is a brief instruction: one switch warms the floor, which is not carpeted, but covered by a substance like soft oilcloth; one warms the mattress (which is of metal with resistance coils threaded to and fro in it); and the others warm the wall in various degrees, each directing current through a separate system of resistances. The casement does not open, but above, flush with the ceiling, a noiseless rapid fan pumps air out of the room. The air enters by a Tobin shaft. There is a recess dressing-room, equipped with a bath and all that is necessary to one's toilette, and the water, one remarks, is warmed, if one desires it warm, by passing it through an electrically heated spiral of tubing. A cake of soap drops out of a store machine on the turn of a handle, and when you have done with it, you drop that and your soiled towels and so forth, which also are given you by machines, into a little box, through the bottom of which they drop at once, and sail down a smooth shaft. A little notice tells you the price of your room, and you gather the price is doubled if you do not leave the toilette as you found it. Beside the bed, and to be lit at night by a handy switch over the pillow, is a little clock, its face flush with the wall. The room has no corners to gather dirt, wall meets floor with a gentle curve, and the apartment could be swept out effectually by a few strokes of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>sweeper.</b> The door frames and window frames are of metal, rounded and impervious to draught. You are politely requested to turn a handle at the foot of your bed before leaving the room, and forthwith the frame turns up into a vertical position, and the bedclothes hang airing. You stand at the doorway and realise that there remains not a minute's work for anyone to do. Memories of the foetid disorder of many an earthly bedroom after a night's use float across your mind.|$|E

50|$|Sweeper {{manufacturers}} in Asia have also developed less sophisticated mechanical and regenerative air sweepers which differ in design to the American and European sweepers.

40|$|Street Sweepers are {{designed}} to remove material from road surfaces by mechanical means, such as brooms, or by suction through a vacuum or regenerative air system. Street sweepers are semi custom vehicles in that a cab and chassis is mounted with the sweeping equipment, including hoppers, brooms, vacuums, engines and additional equipment. Sweepers are configured into either a single engine or dual engine configuration. In a dual engine configuration an auxiliary engine is bolted {{to the top of}} the vehicle or integrated into the machinery. The majority of street sweepers have twin steer capability for driver vision and maneuverability. Sweepers can be categorized into two main types: <b>mechanical</b> and air <b>sweepers.</b> The <b>mechanical</b> <b>sweepers</b> are equipped with water tanks and sprayers that are used to loosen particles and reduce dust. The brooms gather debris into a main collection area from which it is vacuumed and pumped into a collection bin. A regenerative air street sweeper uses forced air to create a swirling knifing effect inside a contained sweeping head and then uses the negative pressure on the suction side to place the road debris inside a containment hopper. The debris laden air is then cleaned and reused to start the process anew. The cost of replacement of these specialized vehicles range from $ 150, 000 to $ 250, 000 depending on configuration and fuel used. Sweepers depreciate at a slower rate than many other vehicle types so significant value remains in the used vehicle market as shown in the cost curve in Figure- 1. Body transfer is possible but rare, expensive, and typically done at the manufactures own facility...|$|R
50|$|By the 1840s, Manchester, England, {{had become}} known as the first {{industrial}} city. Manchester was home to the first passenger rail service in the world and had one of the largest textile industries of that time. As a result, the robust metropolis was said to be England’s unhealthiest place to live. In response to this unsanitary environment, Joseph Whitworth invented the <b>mechanical</b> street <b>sweeper.</b> The street sweeper was designed with the primary objective to remove trash from streets in order to maintain aesthetic goals and safety.|$|R

Vehicles were somewhat similar to Dinky Toys in concept, but other toys were also marketed, like a [...] "dulcimer" [...] xylophone and a toy drum (Johnson 1998: pp. 178-179). Some vehicles, like the <b>mechanical</b> road <b>sweeper</b> were equipped with clockwork motors. Often Morestone vehicles {{were made by the}} company Modern Products, thus [...] "A Modern Product" [...] or simply [...] "Modern" [...] would be stated on the boxes, and some models were marketed as 'A Modern Product' without any reference to Morestone. Some boxes say, [...] "Modern" [...] within a diamond-shaped logo (Nigel 2013). Models later in the 1950s were apparently made by Morestone as the Modern Product label was dropped, usually replaced by [...] "Morestone Series". Morestone Series vehicles were varied, but commonly featured AA and RAC Land Rovers and motorcycles with sidecars. Later, reissues of Morestone Series vehicles were made in white metal by 'Zebra Toys'. Another company, Autocraft / DGM acquired many of the dies for early Morestone Series models and reintroduced various motorcycles.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{level of}} {{anthelmintic}} resistance within some cyathostomin parasite populations has increased {{to the level}} where sole reliance on anthelmintic-based control protocols is not possible. Management-based nematode control methods, including removal of faeces from pasture, are widely recommended for use in association with a reduction in anthelmintic use to reduce selection pressure for drug resistance; however, very little work has been performed to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of such methods. Methods: We analysed data obtained from 345 donkeys at The Donkey Sanctuary (Devon, UK), managed under three different pasture management techniques, to investigate the effectiveness of faeces removal in strongyle control in equids. The management groups were as follows: no removal of faeces from pasture, manual, twice-weekly removal of faeces from pasture and automatic, twice-weekly removal of faeces from pasture (using a <b>mechanical</b> pasture <b>sweeper).</b> From turn-out onto pasture in May, monthly faecal egg counts were obtained for each donkey and the dataset subjected to an auto regressive moving average model. Results: There was little to no difference in faecal egg counts between the two methods of faecal removal; both resulted in significantly improved cyathostomin control compared to the results obtained from the donkeys that grazed pasture from {{which there was no}} faecal removal. Conclusions: This study represents a valuable and unique assessment of the effectiveness of the removal of equine faeces from pasture, and provides an evidence base from which to advocate twice-weekly removal of faeces from pasture as an adjunct for equid nematode control. Widespread adoption of this practice could substantially reduce anthelmintic usage, and hence reduce selection pressure for nematode resistance to the currently effective anthelmintic products. </p...|$|R
40|$|TRAKER is a vehicle-based {{method for}} {{measuring}} road dust emissions. Particulate matter is sampled {{in front and}} behind a vehicles tire and the difference in PM concentration (TRAKER signal) is used to infer the airborne flux of particles from the roadway. Two independent tests indicated that the TRAKER signal increases as the cube of the speed for a given road dust loading. Simultaneous measurement of PM 10 dust emitted behind the tires by TRAKER with PM 10 flux measured using upwind/downwind towers suggested that the emissions factor for road dust was proportional to the cube root of the TRAKER signal. The results also showed a linear relationship between distance based unpaved road dust PM 10 emission factors and vehicle speed. Once calibrated with the flux tower measurements, the system was used to investigate temporal changes in emissions from paved roads in both the winter and summer in the Treasure Valley in Southwest Idaho. Measurement of road dust emissions potential after road sanding on dry roads indicated a 75 % increase in PM 10 emissions after 2. 5 hours. This effect was short lived and emissions returned to their pre sanding levels within 8 hours of the sand application. Street sweeping with <b>mechanical</b> and vacuum <b>sweepers</b> was found to offer no immediate measurable reduction in PM 10 emissions potential howeve...|$|R
