For an unconstraint wind farm, UIGF is based upon actual megawatt output received through supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system while in case of constraint wind farms, UIGF is based on meteorological forecast based upon number of available wind turbine, wind speed and megawatt set point. AWEFS performs three validation checks prior to every dispatch interval {{to determine if a}} wind farm’s output is being limited below its wind speed-based forecast (potential power): ① Is the wind farm control system set point less than the <b>registered</b> <b>capacity</b> of the wind farm? ② Is the wind farm control system set point less than active power plus 5 % of <b>registered</b> <b>capacity?</b> ③ Is the wind farm control system set point less than potential power?

Verdi wrote many roles for this voice in the Italian repertoire and there are also a few good roles in the French Literature.

40|$|Conventional {{register}} file architectures cannot optimally exploit temporal locality in data references due {{to their}} limited capacity and static encoding of register addresses in instructions. In conventional embedded architectures, the <b>register</b> file <b>capacity</b> cannot be increased without resorting to longer instruction words. Similarly, loop unrolling is often required to exploit locality in the register file accesses across iterations because naming registers statically is inflexible. Both optimizations lead to significant code size increases, which is undesirable in embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce the Register Pointer Architecture (RPA), which allows registers to be accessed indirectly through register pointers. Indirection allows a larger register file to be used without increasing the length of instruction words. Additional <b>register</b> file <b>capacity</b> allows many loads and stores, such as those introduced by spill code, to be eliminated, which improves performance and reduces energy consumption. Moreover, indirection affords additional flexibility in naming registers, which reduces the need to apply loop unrolling {{in order to maximize}} reuse of register allocated variables. ...|$|R

The efficiency was studied by comparing the methanol yield for each. A slurry ty pe photoreactor with a UV lamp of 365 nm wavelength was used. CO 2 photoreduction to methanol using NaOH as the reaction <b>medium</b> <b>registered</b> the highest yield of 431. 65 µ m ole/g - cat • hr.

It was obvious the choice of reaction medium affected the photoreduction of CO 2 to methanol. The trend of results indicated the use of NaOH as a reaction medium improved the efficiency of the photoreduction process.

However, participation in the REC markets is low and RECs have failed to attract significant investment so far. In this study a preliminary attempt {{has been made to}} assess the performance of existing REC mechanism in India. After highlighting the salient features of the Indian renewable energy policy framework a brief description of renewable purchase obligation (RPO) and source specific RPOs for different states is discussed along with an overview of REC market in India to date.
