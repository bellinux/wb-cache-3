5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At {{the early stages}} of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1970 saw {{the initiation of}} the 18th Engineers Brigade's Operation Last Chance, a program of command emphasis and organization for motivation and success of that year's engineer operations. The goals of the program were to maintain primary missions of the combat support as well as insure {{the completion of the}} <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> planned for the 1970 construction operations.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject high up the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, {{it is probable that}} there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E

5|$|Josef Müller {{took over}} as CEO in 1950. A {{decision}} was taken to undertake more international projects, following a period of essentially domestic work after World War II. This included a series of power infrastructure works in Turkey and bridge and smelting works construction in Egypt during the early 1950s. It {{is interesting to note}} that <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> from this period were undertaken outside of the First World;many were funded from development aid budgets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>projects</b> aim {{to prevent}} or slow this loss by revitalizing {{endangered}} languages and promoting education and literacy in minority languages. Across the world, many countries have enacted specific legislation to protect and stabilize the language of indigenous speech communities. A minority of linguists have argued that language loss is a natural process {{that should not be}} counteracted, and that documenting endangered languages for posterity is sufficient.|$|E
5|$|SR78 {{was one of}} the {{original}} state highways designated in 1934, although portions of the route existed as early as 1900. However, it was not designated east of Brawley until 1959. The freeway section in the North County of San Diego that connects Oceanside and Escondido was built {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century in several stages, including a transitory stage known as the Vista Way Freeway, and has been improved several times. An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley was completed in 2012. There are <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in the region.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Many</b> <b>project</b> {{managers}} and risk managers currently use [...] "home-grown" [...] methods for listing, identifying, assessing, and tracking risks in their projects.

5|$|The {{original}} {{facilities at}} Black Moshannon State Park were {{constructed by the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, from 1933to 1937. The CCC created many jobs for unemployed industrial workers from throughout the United States.

However, many people used the area for recreation {{as far back as the}} early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|While Edison {{seems to}} have {{conceived}} the idea and initiated the experiments, Dickson apparently performed {{the bulk of the}} experimentation, leading most modern scholars to assign Dickson with the major credit for turning the concept into a practical reality. The Edison laboratory, though, worked as a collaborative organization. Laboratory assistants were assigned to work on <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> while Edison supervised and involved himself and participated to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1890s {{the station}} {{entrance}} had {{been incorporated into}} a larger building. In 1922, a new entrance and canopy was designed for the Bridge Street entrance by Charles Holden and, in 1924, he designed a plainly rendered replacement elevation for the eastern entrance on to the Embankment. These were the first of <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> by the architect for the London Electric Railway (the main forerunner of London Transport and Transport for London). The station platforms were also refurbished with new wall tiling in the green, blue, black and white tiling scheme used later by Holden on many stations of the period and still visible at neighbouring St James's Park station. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{proposals}} for {{completion of the}} tunnel have come from New York City Councilman Lewis Fidler, who has proposed 0.33% tax for the tri-state region {{to pay for the}} construction. The tunnel was listed as one of <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> that could receive federal funds that were to have been allocated to the Access to the Region's Core tunnel, which was canceled in October 2010. State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many projects—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> cancelled, the company entered a severe {{financial}} crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set in a world where the war between good and evil has been fought with evil coming out on top, and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E

5|$|Adjacent to the harbour is Watchet station. This {{is now an}} {{intermediate}} stop on the West Somerset Railway, a largely steam-operated heritage railway that links Bishops Lydeard, near Taunton, with Minehead. The station was first opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway was opened from Norton Junction. The station was built as a terminus, {{as part of the}} commercial aim of the WSR was to provide a wider and cheaper distribution route for goods from the then major port of Watchet. On 16 July 1874 the line was extended westwards by the Minehead Railway Company, with an industrial railway siding provided at the same time into the Wansbrough Paper Mill. The GWR undertook <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> to increase the capacity of the line in the 1930s. Nationalisation in 1948 saw the GWR become the Western Region of British Railways. Freight traffic was withdrawn on 6 July 1964 and passenger trains on 4 January 1971. The station was reopened by the new West Somerset Railway on 28 August 1976.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed {{as the first}} Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It {{was the first time}} a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began <b>many</b> <b>projects</b> to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church's Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.|$|E
