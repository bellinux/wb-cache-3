40|$|Launch tube {{is widely}} used in defense sector to launch the {{missiles}} {{as well as to}} carry the missiles from one place to another. Use of fiber reinforced plastics reduces the weight of product with out any reduction in the load carrying capacity and stiffness. Because of their the material’s high elastic strain energy storage capacity and high strength-to-weight ratio compared with those of steel, fiber reinforced plastics are considered as a materials for construction of launch tubes. Fiber reinforced plastic tubes made of unidirectional carbon fibers embedded in epoxy resin are 65 to 70 percent lighter than equivalent steel tubes. Fiber reinforced plastics also exhibit excellent fatigue resistance and durability. Graphite epoxy composites are widely used in <b>manufacturing</b> <b>launch</b> tubes. Since tubes made of graphite epoxy are often failed at extreme load conditions, there is a continues search for an alternative. In this paper a launch tube is modeled and analyzed for both glass epoxy composites and graphite epoxy composites. The results are tabulated for different orientations of fibers. Both thermal and coupled analyses are carried out. And vonmises stresses are analyzed. Finally it is found that glass epoxy materials possess better properties than graphite epoxy materials and suits well for <b>manufacturing</b> <b>launch</b> tubes...|$|R
