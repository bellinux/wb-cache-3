40|$|Abstract: Micromilling {{of metal}} {{structures}} with ‘thin ’ features represents {{a major challenge}} towards broadening {{the use of this}} technology in a range of <b>microengineering</b> applications, for example in producing multi-channel microstructures, housing for mechanical microdevices, and surgical instruments. The most common thin features seen in <b>microengineering</b> products are ribs and webs. This research identifies the main factors affecting the reliability of micromilling technology when employed for the machining of microcomponents incorporating thin features. The general principles that should be followed in designing machining strategies for such features are discussed in this article. Taking these general principles into account, new strategies are proposed to reduce the negative effects of identified factors on part quality and, at the same time, to overcome some of the problems {{associated with the use of}} conventional machining strategies for micromilling of ribs and webs. To implement and verify them, initially the milling operations were programmed manually, and then a special CAM module was developed for their automatic generation. Finally, this article reports the validation of the proposed strategies for machining thin features, which was carried out on a specially designed test part...|$|E
40|$|Microstereolithography is a {{technology}} at the interface of the <b>microengineering</b> and rapid prototyping domains. It has evolved from the stereolithography technique, and is also based on a light-induced layer- stacking manufacturing, As {{the resolution of the}} microstereolithography technique is far better than the one of rapid prototyping technologies, this technique is of particular interest in the <b>microengineering</b> domain where its 3 D capability allows the production of components no other microfabrication technique can create. The first developments of the microstereolithography technique have started in 1993 and different research teams have developed machines since, using different approaches. This paper reviews the major microstereolithography processes developed until now. Microstereolithography is starting to be a commercially available manufacturing process. As the market for miniaturized products grows rapidly, there is an increasing need for high-resolution small size prototype parts. If the production of small mechanical components is the first commercial application of microstereolithography, this technology can also produce useful components for the microrobotic, microfluidic, microsystems and biomedical fields. Current research in the microstereolithography field is focused on using ceramic composites as material to manufacture complex three-dimensional parts that can be sintered to produce pure alumina microcomponents...|$|E
