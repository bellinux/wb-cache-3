40|$|Microwave {{scattering}} {{signatures of}} the ocean have been measured over a range of surface wind speeds from 3 m/s to 23. 6 m/s using the AAFE RADSCAT scatterometer in an aircraft.

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>scatterometers,</b> {{which use}} radar {{backscatter}} measurements to infer the near-surface wind vector, are unique {{in their ability}} to monitor global wind vectors at high resolutions. However, scatterometer observations which are contaminated by land proximity or rain events produce wind estimates which have increased bias and variability, making them unreliable for many applications. Fortunately, the effects of these sources of contamination can be mitigated. Land contamination of backscatter measurements occurs when land partially fills the antenna illumination area. This reduces and masks the wind-induced backscatter signal. Land contamination is mitigated by quantifying the amount of contamination in a single observation using a metric referred to as the land contribution ratio (LCR). LCR levels which give rise to inadmissible levels of error in the wind estimates are determined and used to discard land-contaminated observations. Using this method results in contamination-free wind estimates which can be made as close to the coast as 5 km, an improvement of 25 km compared to previous methods. Rain contamination of scatterometer observations results from rain-induced scattering effects which modify the wind-induced backscatter. Rain backscatter effects are modele...|$|R

However, for extreme wind events such as tropical cyclones, their performance is significantly degraded. This paper presents a novel OVW retrieval algorithm for tropical cyclones which improves the accuracy of scatterometer based ocean surface winds when compared to low-flying aircraft with in-situ and remotely sensed observations. Unlike the traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) wind vector retrieval technique, this new approach sequentially estimates scalar wind directions and wind speeds. A detailed description of the algorithm is provided along with results for ten QuikSCAT hurricane overpasses (from 2003 – 2008) to evaluate the performance of the new algorithm. Results are compared with independent surface wind analyses from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Hurricane Research Division’s H*Wind surface analyses and with the corresponding SeaWinds Project’s L 2 B- 12. 5 km OVW products. They demonstrate that the proposed algorithm extends the SeaWinds capability to retrieve wind speeds beyond the current range of approximately 35 m/s (minimal hurricane category- 1) with improved wind direction accuracy, making this new approach a potential candidate for current and future conically scanning scatterometer wind retrieval algorithms...|$|R
