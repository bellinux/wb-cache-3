25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The <b>masking</b> <b>effect</b> has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The <b>masking</b> <b>effect</b> is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E

According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now we are taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this <b>masking</b> <b>effect</b> is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
40|$|The {{configuration}} {{spaces of}} modern software systems are {{too large to}} test exhaustively. Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) approaches, such as covering arrays, systematically sample the configuration space and test only the selected configurations. The basic justification for CIT approaches {{is that they can}} cost-effectively exercise all system behaviors caused by the settings of t or fewer options. We conjecture, however, that in practice some of these behaviors are not actually tested because of unanticipated <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> - test case failures that perturb system execution so as to prevent some behaviors from being exercised. While prior research has identified this problem, most solutions require knowing the <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> a priori. In practice this is impractical, if not impossible. In this work, we reduce the harmful consequences of <b>masking</b> <b>effects.</b> First we define a novel interaction testing criterion, which aims to ensure that each test case has a fair chance to test all valid t-way combinations of option settings. We then introduce a feedback driven adaptive combinatorial testing process (FDA-CIT) to materialize this criterion in practice. At each iteration of FDA-CIT, we detect potential <b>masking</b> <b>effects,</b> heuristically isolate their likely causes (i. e., fault characterization), and then generate new samples that allow previously masked combinations to be tested in configurations that avoid the likely failure causes. The iterations end when the new interaction testing criterion has been satisfied. This paper compares two different fault characterization approaches - {{an integral part of the}} proposed approach, and empirically assesses their effectiveness and efficiency in removing <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> on two widely used open source software systems. It also compares FDA-CIT against error locating arrays, a state of the art approach for detecting and locating failures. Furthermore, the scalability of the proposed approach is evaluated by comparing it with perfect test scenarios, in which all <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> are known a priori. Our results suggest that <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> do exist in practice, and that our approach provides a promising and efficient way to work around them, without requiring that <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> be known a priori...|$|R

2500|$|Nuclear weapons emit {{large amounts}} of thermal {{radiation}} as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, to which the atmosphere is largely transparent. This is known as [...] "Flash". The chief hazards are burns and eye injuries. On clear days, these injuries can occur well beyond blast ranges, depending on weapon yield. Fires may also be started by the initial thermal radiation, but the following high winds due to the blast wave may put out almost all such fires, unless the yield is very high, where the range of thermal effects vastly out ranges blast effects, as observed from explosions in the multi-megaton range. [...] This is because {{the intensity of the}} blast effects drops off with the third power of distance from the explosion, while the intensity of radiation effects drops off with the second power of distance. This results in the range of thermal effects increasing markedly more than blast range as higher and higher device yields are detonated. Thermal radiation accounts for between 35–45% of the energy released in the explosion, depending on the yield of the device. In urban areas, the extinguishing of fires ignited by thermal radiation may matter little, as in a surprise attack fires may also be started by blast-effect-induced electrical shorts, gas pilot lights, overturned stoves, and other ignition sources, {{as was the case in}} the breakfast-time bombing of Hiroshima. Whether or not these secondary fires will in turn themselves be snuffed out as modern noncombustible brick and concrete buildings collapse in on themselves from the same blast wave is uncertain, not least of which, because of the <b>masking</b> <b>effect</b> of modern city landscapes on thermal and blast transmission are continually examined.|$|E

Problems arise from mask absorber LER as well as mask reflector or surface roughness leading to random phase variations in the reflected beam. Not only do these <b>mask</b> contributors <b>effect</b> to total measured LER in resist, but they also effect LER spatial characteristic such as the LER power spectral density and related descriptors of correlation length and roughness exponent.

Four factors that may influence the <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> of birdsong (i. e., distance of the receiver from a sound source, loudness of masker, occurrence frequencies of masker, and visibility of sound sources) were examined by listening tests. The {{results show that the}} <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> are more significant in the road traffic noise environments with lower sound levels (e. g. 19 m). Adding birdsong can indeed increase the Naturalness and Pleasantness of the traffic noise environment at different distances of the receiver from a road. Naturalness, Annoyance and Pleasantness, but not Perceived Loudness, can be altered by increasing the birdsong loudness (i. e., from 37. 5 to 52. 5 dBA in this study). The Pleasantness of traffic noise environments increases significantly from 2. 7 to 6. 7, when the occurrence of birdsong over a period of 30 s is increased from 2 to 6 times.

40|$|As {{semiconductor}} lithography {{is pushed}} to smaller dimensions, process yields tend to suffer due to subwavelength topographical imaging effects. Three dimensional or “thick <b>mask</b> ” <b>effects</b> result in {{such things as}} a pitch dependent best focus and, for alternating phase shift masks (AltPSMs), an intensity imbalance between etched and un-etched features. Corrective mask structures such as the dual trench AltPSM have been introduced to compensate for such intensity imbalances. In this work, the compensation of thick <b>mask</b> <b>effects</b> is explored using the manipulation of the pupil wavefront through the addition of spherical aberration. The wavefront has been experimentally varied through the manipulation of the lens aberration {{in a state of}} the art full field scanner. Results reveal that the influence of spherical aberration on best focus is predictable, allowing focus deviation through pitch to be tuned. Simulations further predict that aberration manipulation can provide compensation for thick <b>mask</b> <b>effects</b> by increasing the useable depth of focus for a particular set of features on both AltPSM and thicker film attenuated PSM masks. Such pupil wavefront correction has the potential to compensate for mask topography by matching thick <b>mask</b> <b>effects</b> to those of thin masks...|$|R

50|$|As {{the time}} {{difference}} between the target and the mask increases, the <b>masking</b> <b>effect</b> decreases. This is because the integration time of a target stimulus has an upper limit 200 ms, based on physiological experiments and as the separation approaches this limit, the mask is able to produce less of {{an effect on the}} target, as the target has had more time to form a full neural representation in the brain.Polat, Sterkin, and Yehezkel went into great detail in explaining the effect of temporal matching between target input and lateral propagation of the mask. Based on data from previous single-unit recordings, they concluded that the time window for any sort of efficient interaction with target processing is 210 to 310 ms after the target’s appearance. Anything outside of this window would fail to cause any sort of <b>masking</b> <b>effect.</b> This explains why there is a <b>masking</b> <b>effect</b> when the mask is presented 50 ms after the target, but not when the inter-stimulus interval between mask and target is 150 ms. In the first case, mask response would propagate to the target location and be processed with a delay of 260 to 310 ms, whereas the ISI of 150 would result in a delay of 410 to 460 ms.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Identification {{of people}} with lower (white-coat <b>effect)</b> or higher (<b>masked</b> <b>effect)</b> blood {{pressure}} at home compared to the clinic usually requires ambulatory or home monitoring. This study assessed whether changes in SBP with repeated measurement at a single clinic predict subsequent differences between clinic and home measurements. METHODS: This study used an observational cohort design and included 220 individuals aged 35 - 84 years, receiving treatment for hypertension, but whose SBP was not controlled. The characteristics of change in SBP over six clinic readings were defined as the SBP drop, the slope and the quadratic coefficient using polynomial regression modelling. The predictive abilities of these characteristics for lower or higher home SBP readings were investigated with logistic regression and repeated operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: The single clinic SBP drop was predictive of the white-coat effect with a sensitivity of 90 %, specificity of 50 %, positive predictive value of 56 % and negative predictive value of 88 %. Predictive values for the <b>masked</b> <b>effect</b> {{and those of the}} slope and quadratic coefficient were slightly lower, but when the slope and quadratic variables were combined, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the <b>masked</b> <b>effect</b> were improved to 91, 48, 24 and 97 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Characteristics obtainable from multiple SBP measurements in a single clinic in patients with treated hypertension appear to reasonably predict those unlikely to have a large white-coat or <b>masked</b> <b>effect,</b> potentially allowing better targeting of out-of-office monitoring in routine clinical practice...|$|R

In these 3 experiments we always compared the <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> of speech backgrounds (i. e., 4 -talker babble) that were produced in the same language as the target language (i. e., French) or in unknown foreign languages (i. e., Irish and Italian) to the <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> of corresponding non-speech backgrounds (i. e., speech-derived fluctuating noise). The fluctuating noise contained similar spectro-temporal information as babble but lacked linguistic information. At - 5 dB SNR, both tasks revealed significantly divergent results between the unknown languages (i. e., Irish and Italian) with Italian and French hindering French target word identification to a similar extent, whereas Irish led to significantly better performances on these tasks. By comparing the performances obtained with speech and fluctuating noise backgrounds, {{we were able to}} evaluate the effect of each language. The intelligibility task showed a significant difference between babble and fluctuating noise for French, Irish and Italian, suggesting acoustic and linguistic effects for each language. However, the lexical decision task, which reduces the effect of post-lexical interference, appeared to be more accurate, as it only revealed a linguistic effect for French. Thus, although French and Italian had equivalent <b>masking</b> <b>effects</b> on French word identification, the nature of their interference was different.
