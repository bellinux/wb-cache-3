50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} {{is derived}} from the oldest known seal of the city, dating back to 1609. The seal shows two skis and in the middle a cross, with a small star on the crosspoint. The skis are a semi-canting element (based on a misunderstanding of the meaning of the town's name) and the cross is a religious symbol. There have been several theories about the meaning of the cross, but its meaning is not clearly known. It has been suggested that it is a symbol for the main church in Skien, the Holy Cross church. The small star may be a symbol of St. Mary as the second medieval church of Skien was devoted to her. Besides the skis and cross, there are two <b>meadow</b> <b>buttercups</b> on each side.|$|R

Plantlife includes Foxgloves, Bluebells and <b>Meadow</b> <b>Buttercups.</b> Abbotsbury Road often has Hedge Sparrows and Blackbirds in the hedges, along with Garden Spiders and Great Green Bush Crickets. Serotine Bats and Pipistrelle Bats have also been seen around this area. To the south of Wyke Tunnel, the damp environment has spawned Pendulous Sedge and Heart's Tongue Ferns. Common frogs and Blackcaps are found within this area, as well as foxes and badgers. The Buxton Road Bridge region often has many species of butterfly during the summer, including Red Admiral, Comma and Holly Blue. Mice may also be spotted within the area. Between Sandsfoot and Wyke Halts, various wildlife from Common Lizards to the Common Blue Butterfly are often found. Amongst the reeds are Wasp Spiders and the rare Bithyinian Vetch and Little Robin plants.

60|$|Harbury {{itself is}} a very {{beautiful}} place. The country about {{it has all the}} charm of river scenery in a settled and ancient land, and the great castle and piled town of Wetmore, cliffs of battlemented grey wall rising above a dense cluster of red roofs, form the background to innumerable gracious prospects of great stream-fed trees, level <b>meadows</b> of <b>buttercups,</b> sweeping curves of osier and rush-rimmed river, the playing fields and the sedgy, lily-spangled levels of Avonlea. The college itself is mostly late Tudor and Stuart brickwork, very ripe and mellow now, but the great grey chapel with its glorious east window floats over the whole like a voice singing in the evening. And the evening cloudscapes of Harbury are a perpetual succession of glorious effects, now serene, now mysteriously threatening and profound, now towering to incredible heights, now revealing undreamt-of distances of luminous color. Assuredly I must have delighted in all those aspects, or why should I remember them so well? But I recall, I mean, no confessed recognition of them; no deliberate going-out of my spirit, open and unashamed, to such things.|$|R
60|$|It {{is true that}} Aru {{seemed to}} me {{exceptionally}} poor in flowers, but this is only an exaggeration of a general tropical feature; for my whole experience in the equatorial regions {{of the west and}} the east has convinced me, that in the most luxuriant parts of the tropics, flowers are less abundant, on the average less showy, and are far less effective in adding colour to the landscape than in temperate climates. I have never seen in the tropics such brilliant masses of colour as even England can show in her furze-clad commons, her heathery mountain-sides, her glades of wild hyacinths, her fields of poppies, her <b>meadows</b> of <b>buttercups</b> and orchises--carpets of yellow, purple, azure-blue, and fiery crimson, which the tropics can rarely exhibit. We, have smaller masses of colour in our hawthorn and crab trees, our holly and mountain-ash, our boom; foxgloves, primroses, and purple vetches, which clothe with gay colours the whole length and breadth of our land, These beauties are all common. They are characteristic of the country and the climate; they have not to be sought for, but they gladden the eye at every step. In the regions of the equator, on the other hand, whether it be forest or savannah, a sombre green clothes universal nature. You may journey for hours, and even for days, and meet with nothing to break the monotony. Flowers are everywhere rare, and anything at all striking is only to be met with at very distant intervals.|$|R
6000|$|In {{front of}} a long high southerly wall on which were trained peach-trees the two {{walked up and down}} in silence. Old Jolyon had planted some cupressus-trees, at intervals, between this grassy terrace and the dipping <b>meadow</b> full of <b>buttercups</b> and ox-eyed daisies; for twelve years they had flourished, till their dark spiral shapes had quite a look of Italy. Birds fluttered softly in the wet shrubbery; the {{swallows}} swooped past, with a steel-blue sheen on their swift little bodies; the grass felt springy beneath the feet, its green refreshed; butterflies chased each other. After that painful scene the quiet of Nature was wonderfully poignant. Under the sun-soaked wall ran a narrow strip of garden-bed full of mignonette and pansies, and from the bees came a low hum in which all other sounds were set--the mooing of a cow deprived of her calf, the calling of a cuckoo from an elm-tree {{at the bottom of the}} meadow. Who would have thought that behind them, within ten miles, London began--that London of the Forsytes, with its wealth, its misery; its dirt and noise; its jumbled stone isles of beauty, its grey sea of hideous brick and stucco? That London which had seen Irene's early tragedy, and Jolyon's own hard days; that web; that princely workhouse of the possessive instinct! ...|$|R
50|$|The site is an {{alluvial}} meadow {{next to the}} River Ray in the Vale of Aylesbury. It has clay soil and is liable to flooding. A regime of a hay cut followed by cattle grazing, {{without the use of}} artificial fertilisers, has resulted in a diverse grassland habitat now rare in England. Herbs include <b>meadow</b> <b>buttercup,</b> lesser knapweed and devil's bit scabious. Ditches and the riverbank provide a permanently wet habitat, encouraging wading birds such as snipe and curlew. Invertebrates include damselflies.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the last}} moment, {{when all the}} {{preparations}} were complete, Miss Starbrow determined to accompany Fan to her new home, and, after dropping her there, to pay a long-promised visit before leaving England to {{an old friend of}} her girlhood, who was now married and living at Salisbury. Eyethorne took her some distance out of her way; and at the small country station where they alighted, which was two and a half miles from the village, she found from the time-table that her interview with the Churtons {{would have to be a}} short one, as there was only one train which would take her to Salisbury so as to arrive there at a reasonably early hour in the evening. At the station they took a fly, and the drive to Eyethorne brought before Fan's eyes a succession of charming scenes-- green hills, broad <b>meadows</b> yellow with <b>buttercups,</b> deep shady lanes, and old farm-houses. The spring had been cold and backward; but since the beginning of May there had been days of warm sunshine with occasional gentle rains, and the trees, both shade and fruit, had all at once rushed into leaf and perfect bloom.

30|$|This kind of {{inference}} is {{an integral}} part of how the SP system works. In Figure 6, the word ‘w i n d s’ appears in the New pattern as ‘w i d s’, but the parsing interpolates the missing ‘n’. In an example of pattern recognition (Wolff 2013, Section 9, Figure 16), the SP system identifies an unknown plant as, probably, an example of the <b>Meadow</b> <b>Buttercup</b> (Ranunculus acris) from a few features in the New information with which it is supplied: that the stem is hairy, that the petals are yellow, that there are numerous stamens, and more. From its stored knowledge about that species, the system can infer several other things, not in the New information: that the plant photosynthesises, that it has five petals, that it is poisonous, and more.|$|E
40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is an {{important}} pathogen of many crop plants which also infects wild hosts. The population structure of this fungus was studied for different crop plants and Ranunculus acris (<b>meadow</b> <b>buttercup)</b> in the UK using eight microsatellite markers and sequenced sections of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the rRNA gene and the elongation factor 1 -alpha (EF) gene. A total of 228 microsatellite haplotypes were identified within 384 isolates from 12 S. sclerotiorum populations sampled in England and Wales. One microsatellite haplotype was generally found at high frequency in each population and was distributed widely across different hosts, locations and years. Fourteen IGS and five EF haplotypes {{were found in the}} 12 populations, with six IGS haplotypes and one EF haplotype exclusive to buttercup. Analysis of published sequences for S. sclerotiorum populations from the USA, Canada, New Zealand and Norway showed that three of the IGS haplotypes and one EF haplotype were widely distributed, while eight IGS haplotypes were only found in the UK. Although common microsatellite and IGS/EF haplotypes were found on different hosts in the UK, there was evidence of differentiation, particularly for one isolated population on buttercup. However, overall there was no consistent differentiation of S. sclerotiorum populations from buttercup and crop hosts. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum therefore has a multiclonal population structure in the UK and the wide distribution of one microsatellite haplotype suggests spatial mixing at a national scale. The related species S. subarctica was also identified in one buttercup population...|$|E
40|$|Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a necrotrophic fungal {{pathogen}} with {{a worldwide}} distribution {{and a wide}} host range, including many economically important crops. The control strategies for this pathogen and related species include using fungicides, biological control agents and cultural practices such as crop rotations. However, the genetic diversity and the long term survival structures (sclerotia) of this pathogen, combined with the recent discovery of the related species S. subarctica in England {{and the need for}} growers to implement integrated disease management strategies means that new control measures need to be sought. Biofumigation, using green manures which are macerated and ploughed into the soil, may be a useful new control approach in an integrated programme. Microcosm and in vitro experiments clearly showed that volatiles released from biofumigation crops have a direct inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth and carpogenic germination of S. sclerotiorum sclerotia. The most effective biofumigation crop for inhibiting carpogenic germination varied depending on whether the volatiles released from the biofumigant crops were in direct contact with the sclerotia when the most effective crop was Raphanus sativus ‘Terranova’, or in the vapour phase when the most effective crop was B. juncea ‘Vittasso’. Carrot root inoculations showed that the number of sclerotia produced on carrot roots was significantly affected by S. sclerotiorum isolate. However, the results also showed that the weight of individual sclerotia produced by different isolates was influenced by carrot accession, but not by S. sclerotiorum isolate. Additionally, the carrot plant and detached leaf inoculations showed significant differences in the rate of lesion progression of S. sclerotiorum on different carrot accessions, indicating differences in susceptibility to the pathogen. S. subarctica microsatellite haplotypes identified in this research were shown to be shared between Scotland and Norway, and between crop plants and <b>meadow</b> <b>buttercup.</b> However, the English population did not share any microsatellite haplotypes with any other population, and analysis indicated that this S. subarctica population in England may be isolated and inbred...|$|E
40|$|Sclerotinia {{species are}} {{important}} fungal pathogens {{of a wide}} range of crops and wild host plants. While the biology and population structure of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has been well-studied, little information is available for the related species S. subarctica. In this study, Sclerotinia isolates were collected from different crop plants and the wild host Ranuculus ficaria (<b>meadow</b> <b>buttercup)</b> in England, Scotland, and Norway to determine the incidence of Sclerotinia subarctica and examine the population structure of this pathogen for the first time. Incidence was very low in England, comprising only 4. 3 % of isolates while moderate and high incidence of S. subarctica was identified in Scotland and Norway, comprising 18. 3 and 48. 0 % of isolates respectively. Characterization with eight microsatellite markers identified 75 haplotypes within a total of 157 isolates over the three countries with a few haplotypes in Scotland and Norway sampled at a higher frequency than the rest across multiple locations and host plants. In total, eight microsatellite haplotypes were shared between Scotland and Norway while none were shared with England. Bayesian and principal component analyses revealed common ancestry and clustering of Scottish and Norwegian S. subarctica isolates while English isolates were assigned to a separate population cluster and exhibited low diversity indicative of isolation. Population structure was also examined for S. sclerotiorum isolates from England, Scotland, Norway, and Australia using microsatellite data, including some from a previous study in England. In total, 484 haplotypes were identified within 800 S. sclerotiorum isolates with just 15 shared between England and Scotland and none shared between any other countries. Bayesian and principal component analyses revealed a common ancestry and clustering of the English and Scottish isolates while Norwegian and Australian isolates were assigned to separate clusters. Furthermore, sequencing part of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of the rRNA gene resulted in 26 IGS haplotypes within 870 S. sclerotiorum isolates, nine of which had not been previously identified and two of which were also widely distributed across different countries. S. subarctica therefore has a multiclonal population structure similar to S. sclerotiorum, but has a different ancestry and distribution across England, Scotland, and Norway...|$|E
