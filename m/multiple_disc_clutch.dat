It also features three <b>multiple</b> <b>disc</b> input <b>clutches,</b> three <b>multiple</b> <b>disc</b> holding <b>clutches,</b> and a dual internal filter system (one primary filter for transmission sump, one for the fluid cooler return system). In the 45RFE applications four gears are utilized, with a different (1.50:1 rather than 1.67:1) second gear to increase versatility when downshifting. In 545RFE usage, an extra taller overdrive ratio is also used. Chrysler decided to refer to it as a [...] "multi-speed automatic".|$|R

The THS-C {{is based on}} Toyota’s Super CVT (K 110), where the conventional torque converter {{is replaced by a}} torsional damper and a newly developed motor/generator. For smooth switching between the different driving modes it makes use of wet <b>multiple</b> <b>disc</b> <b>clutches</b> and a planetary gearset arrangement. The Toyota Estima is also equipped with a motor/generator which directly drives or brakes the rear wheels for optimal vehicle dynamics and fuel economy. This feature will also be installed in the new hybrid Lexus RX 400 h, which is driven by an up-scaled version of the Prius powertrain. The powertrains in the mentioned vehicles are in fact an E-Four full hybrids with separate electric motors on front and rear axles. The first goal {{of this paper is to}} model the E-four of the Estima in ADVANCE; a coupled vehicle dynamics and powertrain simulation program developed by TNO Automotive. The second goal is to perform simulations with this software and evaluate the results. The results will be used to validate the THS-C as a technology carrier for ongoing and new research on integrated powertrain control and pulley CVTs for hybrids...|$|R
50|$|A {{wet clutch}} is {{immersed}} in a cooling lubricating fluid that also keeps surfaces clean and provides smoother performance and longer life. Wet clutches, however, tend to lose some energy to the liquid. Since the surfaces of a wet clutch can be slippery (as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil), stacking <b>multiple</b> <b>clutch</b> <b>discs</b> can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged.The Hele-Shaw clutch was a wet clutch that relied entirely on viscous effects, rather than on friction.|$|R

40|$|Construction {{equipment}} companies continuously {{upgrade their}} products to meetcustomer demands, staying competitive with market challenges as well as improving sales and profits. With increased complexities in heavy duty machines today, up-time is considered {{an important aspect of}} the construction equipment business because it reduces warranty and service cost, while increasing sales and overall customer satisfaction. Therefore, a substantial amount of research is directed towards the development of intelligent machines which are capable of automatically monitoring the health of different components in the machine. Heavy duty construction equipment is often equipped with automatic transmissions, with <b>multiple</b> <b>disc</b> wet <b>clutches,</b> transferring torque from the engine to the gearbox enabling automatic gear ratio changes. The wet clutches in Volvo Construction Equipment vehicles may be considered as a crucial component of the driveline and failure may result in costly downtime. The frictional characteristics of wet clutches are crucial for the ultimate performance because they define clutch slip time during engagement. Furthermore, a wet clutch is considered to have failed when it can no longer transmit the desired torque. The level of torque transfer in wet clutches is controlled by the generated friction. Hence, clutch slippage is the result of diminishing frictional characteristics of wet clutches. Accurately monitoring slippage in wet clutches provides an indication of the health of the clutch material. However, many of the factors that influence the frictional characteristics of the wet clutch are only possible to measure in a test rig and not in actual machines. In this thesis the gap in condition monitoring of automatic transmission clutchesin an actual machine is addressed. A methodology for monitoring the health of the clutch material on-board the machine using the available CAN-bus signals via an on-board Data Stream Management System (DSMS) has been developed. The feature extraction methods utilized in the condition monitoring are based on Moving Average Square Value Filtering (MASVF) and a measure of the fourth order statistical properties of the CAN-bus signals implemented as continuous queries over data streams. Results show that the feature extraction methods provide an indication of clutch slippage deviations. This thesis also includes an investigation of clutch slippage detection from driveline vibrations based on spectrogram and spectral Kurtosis methods.
