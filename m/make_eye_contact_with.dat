500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] She looks down into the cubicles to <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the men but {{they are unable to}} return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the cubicles are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while shaking her body.|$|E

However, hard feelings were apparently still present when they refused to refer to each other by name while talking to the media. The Lakers and the Heat faced off again on Christmas Day in 2005, with the Heat winning the second time. Unlike last year, Bryant and O'Neal did not shake hands nor <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> each other {{before and after the}} game.

2500|$|In a seeming anachronism, the {{painting}} shows sheep being shorn with blade shears {{rather than the}} machine shears which started to enter Australian shearing sheds in the late 1880s. Art historian Terry Smith's suggestion that Roberts presented a deliberately historical vision of shearing has been questioned on account of there being no evidence that electric shears had been introduced to [...] "Brocklesby" [...] {{at the time of}} {{the painting}}'s composition. The young man carrying the fleece on the left of the painting alludes to the figure of Esau in Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise at the Florence Baptistery. The model for the smiling tar-boy at the centre of the picture, the only figure to <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the viewer, was actually a girl, 9-year-old Susan Bourne, who lived until 1979. She also assisted Roberts by kicking up dust in the shed to allow him to capture some of the atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Matthew Speltz of the University of Washington School of Medicine {{states that}} the roots of {{attachment}} therapy are traceable to psychologist Robert Zaslow and his [...] "Z-process" [...] in the 1970s. Zaslow attempted to force attachment in those suffering from autism by creating rage while holding them against their will. He believed this {{would lead to a}} breakdown in their defense mechanisms, making them more receptive to others. Zaslow thought attachment arose when an infant experienced feelings of pain, fear and rage, and then made eye contact with the carer who relieved those feelings. If an infant did not experience this cycle of events by having his fear and rage relieved, the infant would not form an attachment and would not <b>make</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> other people. Zaslow believed that creating pain and rage and combining them with eye contact would cause attachment to occur, long after the normal age for such developments. Holding therapies derive from these [...] "rage-reduction" [...] techniques applied by Zaslow. The holding is not used for safety purposes but is initiated for the purpose of provoking strong negative emotions such as fear and anger. The child's release typically depends upon his or her compliance with the therapist's [...] agenda or goals. In 1971, Zaslow surrendered his California psychology license following an injury to a patient during rage-reduction therapy. Zaslow's ideas {{on the use of the}} Z-process and holding for autism have been dispelled by research on the ...|$|E

5000|$|Lelouch's Geass, {{given to}} him by C.C., grants him [...] "the power of {{absolute}} obedience," [...] allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon <b>eye</b> <b>contact,</b> similar to extreme hypnosis.

5000|$|Madcap has a {{specialized}} form of insanity-inducement that immediately affects those he <b>makes</b> <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with.</b> He wears a garish purple-and-yellow costume {{and uses a}} distracting toy soap bubble-gun, called a [...] "fun-gun", to draw the attention of others towards him, so they can meet his gaze. He {{has the ability to}} stimulate the inhibition centers in other people's brains. People affected by his power act in a euphoric, outlandish, uninhibited manner that verges on or becomes insanity and can end up killing themselves. Madcap cannot control how the person acts. The duration of the state seems to be approximately 15-30 minutes, though Madcap risks making a person [...] "pleasantly loony" [...] permanently if he <b>makes</b> additional <b>eye</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> them. This power can interact unpredictably with individuals already affected with mental instability; for example, exposure initially seemed to have no effect on Deadpool, but then resulted in his experiencing a brief period of clarity and sanity. Later, his power's effect on normal humans seems to show that he can influence their behavior to some extent.|$|R
