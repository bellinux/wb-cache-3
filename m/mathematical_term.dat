25|$|Quadrature is a {{historical}} <b>mathematical</b> <b>term</b> that means calculating area. Quadrature problems have served {{as one of the}} main sources of mathematical analysis. Mathematicians of Ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, understood calculation of area as the process of constructing geometrically a square having the same area (squaring). That is why the process was named quadrature. For example, a quadrature of the circle, Lune of Hippocrates, The Quadrature of the Parabola. This construction must be performed only by means of compass and straightedge.|$|E
25|$|Contravariant and {{covariant}} vectors are geometrically {{very different}} objects. The first {{can and should}} be thought of as arrows. A linear functional can be characterized by two objects: its kernel, which is a hyperplane passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus covariant vectors should viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The <b>mathematical</b> <b>term</b> for a covariant vector is 1-covector or 1-form (though the latter is usually reserved for covector fields).|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz {{transformation}} of the electric field of a moving charge into a non-moving observer's reference frame results in {{the appearance of a}} <b>mathematical</b> <b>term</b> commonly called the magnetic field. Conversely, the magnetic field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely electrostatic field in a comoving frame of reference. Maxwell's equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined, one speaks of electromagnetic fields. Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Hans Albert {{coined the}} term [...] "Münchhausen trilemma" [...] to {{describe}} the philosophical problem inherent in having to derive conclusions from premises; those premises have {{to be derived from}} still other premises, and so on forever, leading to an infinite regress interruptible only by circular logic or dogmatism. The problem is named after the similarly paradoxical story in which the Baron saves himself from being drowned in a swamp by pulling on his own hair. The same story also inspired the <b>mathematical</b> <b>term</b> [...] "Munchausen number", coined by Daan van Berkel in 2009 to describe numbers whose digits, when raised to their own powers, can be added together to form the number itself (for example, 3435=33+44+33+55).|$|E
500|$|The precise {{definition}} of a <b>mathematical</b> <b>term,</b> such as [...] "even" [...] meaning [...] "integer multiple of two", is ultimately a convention. Unlike [...] "even", some mathematical terms are purposefully constructed to exclude trivial or degenerate cases. Prime numbers are a famous example. Before the 20th century, definitions of primality were inconsistent, and significant mathematicians such as Goldbach, Lambert, Legendre, Cayley, and Kronecker wrote that 1 was prime. The modern {{definition of}} [...] "prime number" [...] is [...] "positive integer with exactly 2 factors", so 1 is not prime. This definition can be rationalized by observing that it more naturally suits mathematical theorems that concern the primes. For example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is easier to state when 1 is not considered prime.|$|E
