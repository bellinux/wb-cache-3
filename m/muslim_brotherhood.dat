5|$|Al-Azhar was not {{unaffected}} by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections {{in the months following}} the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood.</b> Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood,</b> liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to assess the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhoods</b> prospects to facilitate a democratic transition within Egypt. Numerous {{studies have examined the}} <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhoods</b> political ideology to objectively assess its consistency with democracy. However, to date there has been no comparative subjective study conducted to assess the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhoods</b> capacity to facilitate democracy within Egypt. This thesis will attempt to fill that gap by subjectively measuring the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhoods</b> democratic intentions as perceived by other important actors within the Egyptian polity since the 2012 Egyptian Presidential Election. The perceptions of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhoods</b> democratic capacity and intent are critically important to assessing the likelihood of Egypts transition to democracy. To that end, the major research question of this thesis paper is the following what is the current perception of the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhoods</b> commitment to democratic compromise within the Egyptian polityMajor, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

5|$|During Sa'ad Zaghloul's term as {{minister}} of education, {{before he went}} on to lead the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood,</b> founded in 1928. The school attracted students from throughout the world, including students from Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood,</b> although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, and to ensure its prominence over the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E

While most of the RCC insisted on executing the riot's two ringleaders, Nasser opposed this. Nonetheless, the sentences were carried out. The <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> supported the RCC, and after Naguib's assumption of power, demanded four ministerial portfolios in the new cabinet. Nasser turned down their demands and instead hoped to co-opt the Brotherhood by giving two of its members, {{who were willing to}} serve officially as independents, minor ministerial posts.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Jumu'ah (Friday prayers), tens of {{thousands}} of Egyptians assembled to protest; within hours the number rose to hundreds {{of thousands}}. ElBaradei arrived from Giza, where he had been leading protests, to Cairo. Ynetnews and CNN stated that ElBaradei was placed under arrest, while Al Jazeera English said that ElBaradei was unaware of his would-be house arrest. ElBaradei's detention prompted the U.S. to review its $1.5billion aid package for Egypt; he was later released. Meanwhile, the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> said that twenty members of the banned group had been detained overnight, including Essam el-Erian, its main spokesman, and Mohamed Morsi, one of its leaders.|$|E
5|$|The cost of {{clamping}} down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, {{and the emergence of}} Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of the upper classes, who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and it felt threatened by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to show that the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood's</b> rise to power in Egypt (as well as in Tunisia before it) has been {{engineered}} by the transnational elite, with the help of the local elites and the US-dependent local armies, since the previous client autocratic regimes were politically bankrupt and clearly incapable of imposing the "economic restructuring" required by neoliberal globalization without the occurrence of serious social turbulence. The <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood's</b> rise to power will secure the integration of the countries concerned into the New World Order of neoliberal globalization and representative "democracy" in a new form of more sophisticated client regime based on Islamic "democratization," whereby all the rituals and paraphernalia of "democracy" are present. The first part of this article deals with the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood’s</b> rise to power and attempts to explain why it was chosen as the main instrument of the New World Order in the Middle East. The second part puts forward the case that the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood's</b> rise to power represents a new form of "democratic" client regime in the Middle East, in place of the autocratic client regimes which had been dominant in the area since the end of the Second World War...|$|R

5|$|After the war, Nasser {{returned}} to his role as an instructor at the Royal Military Academy. He sent emissaries to forge an alliance with the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> in October 1948, but soon concluded that the religious agenda of the Brotherhood was not compatible with his nationalism. From then on, Nasser prevented the Brotherhood's influence over his cadres' activities without severing ties with the organization. Nasser was sent {{as a member of}} the Egyptian delegation to Rhodes in February 1949 to negotiate a formal armistice with Israel, and reportedly considered the terms to be humiliating, particularly because the Israelis were able to easily occupy the Eilat region while negotiating with the Arabs in March.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 he {{came into}} contact with Yasser Arafat in Gaza; al-Wazir would become Arafat's {{right-hand}} man later in his life. During his time in Gaza, al-Wazir {{became a member of the}} Egyptian <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood,</b> and was briefly imprisoned for his membership with the organization, as it was prohibited in Egypt. In 1956, a few months after his release from prison, he received military training in Cairo. He also studied architectural engineering at the University of Alexandria, but he did not graduate. Al-Wazir was detained once again in 1957 for leading raids against Israel and was exiled to Saudi Arabia, finding work as a schoolteacher. He continued to teach after moving to Kuwait in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{followed up}} on a prisoner amnesty from the previous day, releasing 1,000 more prisoners who had served three-quarters of their sentence; 840 more were released from Sinai province. The <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> continued to demand for Mubarak's resignation. The offices of state-owned Channel 5 in Alexandria were shut down and evacuated under the order of its chief amid mounting pressure by protesters. The government warned of a military crackdown amid ongoing protests. Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected US calls to repeal the emergency law and also accused the US of trying to impose its will on the Egyptian government. The newly appointed Mubarak's Culture Minister Gaber Asfour resigned after one week in office, citing health problems.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the Egyptian <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood's</b> reflection on and relations to democracy {{during the reign}} of Hosni Mubarak. The first chapter is a brief chapter on several notions of democracy, including my working definition of democracy for the coming chapters.

In the third chapter I focus on the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood's</b> position within civil society from a social/anthropological perspective. The last chapter is about the movement's reflection on notions of democracy, as well as a meta-perspective on the Brotherhood's views about democracy using works from Olivier Roy and Maurits Berger...|$|R

5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E
5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E
5|$|Following Syria's independence, the National Bloc was {{dissolved}} {{and replaced}} by the National Party. Quwatli's leadership, while supported by older politicians like Asali, Jabiri and Haffar, became increasingly challenged by emerging leaders such as Nazim al-Qudsi of the People's Party and Akram al-Hawrani of the Arab Socialist Party {{as well as the}} Baath Party, the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), the <b>Muslim</b> <b>Brotherhood</b> and the Syrian Communist Party (SCP). Antagonistic relations between Quwatli and the Hashemite kings of Iraq and Jordan, Abdullah I and Faisal II, respectively, increased with the latter two seeking to unite Syria, Iraq and Jordan under Hashemite monarchical rule, and Quwatli countering that Iraq and Jordan join a republican Syria under his leadership instead. The Hashemites found support in the People's Party, which became an influential force in Aleppo, a major city and economic hub of Syria, particularly after the 1947 death of Jabiri, Quwatli's Aleppo-based ally.|$|E
