5|$|<b>Major</b> <b>League</b> <b>Baseball</b> is {{a sports}} video game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is notable for {{being one of}} the first video games licensed by <b>Major</b> <b>League</b> <b>Baseball,</b> although it was not endorsed by the <b>Major</b> <b>League</b> <b>Baseball</b> Players Association. Without the backing of the Players Association, the game could not name the actual players, although it was able to use their numbers, thus accurately portraying the contemporary teams and their rosters. In doing so, it became the first baseball game for the Nintendo Entertainment System to carry official <b>Major</b> <b>League</b> <b>Baseball</b> licensing and lineups.|$|E
