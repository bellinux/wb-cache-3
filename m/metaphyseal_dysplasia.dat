50|$|<b>Metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> {{also known}} as Pyle's disease, Pyle's {{syndrome}}, Pyle-Cohn syndrome, and Bakwin-Krida syndrome is a rare disease in which the outer part of the shafts of long bones is thinner than normal {{and there is an}} increased chance of fractures.|$|E
40|$|Spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive skeletal dysplasia caused by {{loss of function}} mutations in acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant (ACP 5). Hypomorphic ACP 5 mutations impair endochondral bone growth and create an interferon (INF) signature, which lead to distinctive spondylar and <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasias,</b> and extraskeletal morbidity, such as neurological involvement and immune dysregulation, respectively. We report an affected boy with novel ACP 5 mutations, a splice-site mutation (736 - 2 A>C) and a nonsense mutation (R 176 X). He presented with postnatal short stature, {{which led to a}} diagnosis of partial growth hormone (GH) deficiency at 3 [*]years of age. GH therapy was beneficial in accelerating his growth velocity. At 6 [*]years of age, however, metaphyseal abnormalities of the knee attracted medical attention, and subsequent assessment ascertained the typical skeletal phenotype of SPENCD, brain calcifications, and an INF signature. This anecdotal experience indicates the potential efficacy of GH for growth failure in SPENCD...|$|R

50|$|<b>Metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> Without Hypotrichosis (MDWH) {{patients}} {{are unable to}} produce normal, new tubular structures in the metaphyses of long bones. People diagnosed with MDWH will therefore tend to experience porous and expanded long bones. The mutation occurs on the RMRP gene in MDWH; the common insertion being (-21-20 insTCTGTGAAGCTGGGGAC) on the paternal allele and a 218A→G point mutation occurring on the maternal allele. MDWH is most likely a variant of CHH. They are the same in that they both display short stature. Some of the same genes involved in the mutations in CHH are the same genes that are mutated in MDWH. These two diseases do differ in that MDWH lacks immunodeficiency and other skeletal features found in CHH patients.|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the RMRP {{gene that}} codes for an RNA subunit of the MRP RNAse complex are {{the cause of}} cartilage-hair {{hypoplasia}} (CHH; MIM 250250). We tested the hypothesis that recessive <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> without hypotrichosis (M 1 M 250460), a disorder presenting with short stature and <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> similar to CHH, but lacking hair anomalies, immunodeficiency and other extra skeletal features, might be allelic to CHH. We identified four mutation-carrying alleles segregating with the skeletal phenotype in two unrelated boys and their parents. One allele carried the common Finnish mutation + 70 A [...] &gt; G; the remaining three carried + 195 C [...] &gt; T, + 238 C [...] &gt; T, and dupAAGCTGAGGACG at - 2. Sequencing 120 alleles from a control group revealed an unusually high density of single-nucleotide polymorphisms {{in and around the}} RMRP gene: the biological significance of this finding is unclear. We conclude that recessive <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> without hypotrichosis is a variant of CHH, manifesting only as short stature and <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> Precise diagnosis of this form of <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> is not without importance because of recessive inheritance with corresponding recurrence risk, as well as because of potential complications such as anaemia, susceptibility to infections and the increased likelihood of developing cancer. The short stature and metaphyseal changes associated with cone-shaped epiphyses of the hands should raise the diagnostic possibility of a CHH-related disorder that can then be confirmed by mutation analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcromicric {{dysplasia}} (AD) is an {{autosomal dominant}} disorder characterized by short stature, short extremities, stiff joint and skeleton features including brachymetacarpia, cone-shaped epiphyses, internal notch of the femoral head, and delayed bone age. Recently, we identified fibrillin 1 (FBN 1) as the disease gene of AD. The aim {{of our study}} was to further describe the long-term follow up of AD patients {{with an emphasis on}} orthopedic management. Nine patients with FBN 1 mutations were included in the study ranging in age from 5. 5 to 64 years. For all, detailed clinical and radiological data were available. Results: Birth parameters were always normal and patients progressively developed short stature <- 3 SD. Carpal tunnel syndrome was observed in four patients. We found discrepancy between the carpal bone age and the radius and ulna epiphysis bone ages, a variable severity of hip dysplasia with acetabular <b>dysplasia,</b> epiphyseal and <b>metaphyseal</b> femoral <b>dysplasia</b> resembling Legg-Perthes-Calvé disease and variable pelvic anteversion and hyperlordosis.

40|$|Cartilage-hair {{hypoplasia}} and anauxetic dysplasia are two {{autosomal recessive}} skeletal dysplasias characterized by different degrees from <b>metaphyseal</b> to spondylo-meta-epiphyseal <b>dysplasia</b> and variable additional features including predisposition to cancer, anemia, immunodeficiency, and gastrointestinal malabsorption and Hirschsprung's disease. Both {{are caused by}} mutations in the untranslated RMRP gene, which forms the RNA subunit of the RNase MRP complex. This complex {{is involved in the}} ribosome assembly by cleavage of 5. 8 S rRNA, cell cycle control by Cyclin B 2 mRNA cleavage at the end of mitosis, processing the mitochondrial RNA, and forming a complex with hTERT suggesting a possible involvement in expression regulation by siRNA synthesis. The degree of skeletal dysplasia correlates mainly with the rRNA cleavage activity, whereas significantly diminished mRNA cleavage activity is a prerequisite for immunodeficiency. Thus, the clinical phenotype emerges in most cases of the combined effect on the respective effect on RNase MRP function...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} is {{a complex}} process that depends {{not only on the}} activities of several enzymes and transporters but also on a subtle balance between vesicular Golgi trafficking, compartmental pH, and ion homeostasis. Through a combination of autozygosity mapping and expression analysis in two siblings with an abnormal serum-transferrin isoelectric focusing test (type 2) and a peculiar skeletal phenotype with epiphyseal, <b>metaphyseal,</b> and diaphyseal <b>dysplasia,</b> we identified TMEM 165 (also named TPARL) as a gene involved in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). The affected individuals are homozygous for a deep intronic splice mutation in TMEM 165. In our cohort of unsolved CDG-II cases, we found another individual with the same mutation and two unrelated individuals with missense mutations in TMEM 165. TMEM 165 encodes a putative transmembrane 324 amino acid protein whose cellular functions are unknown.

40|$|Wave-shaped ribs were {{detected}} at prenatal ultrasound in a 20 (+ 1) week female fetus. At birth, skeletal radiographs showed marked hypomineralization and suggested hypophosphatasia.

40|$|<b>Metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> Spahr type (MDST; OMIM 250400) was {{described}} in 1961 based on the observation of four children in one family who had rickets-like metaphyseal changes but normal blood chemistry and moderate short stature. Its molecular basis and nosologic status remained unknown. We followed up on those individuals and diagnosed the disorder in an additional member of the family. We used exome sequencing to ascertain the underlying mutation and explored its consequences on three-dimensional models of the affected protein. The MDST phenotype is associated with moderate short stature and knee pain in adults, while extra-skeletal complications are not observed. The sequencing showed that MDST segregated with a c. 619 T>G single nucleotide transversion in MMP 13. The predicted non-conservative amino acid substitution, p. Trp 207 Gly, disrupts a crucial hydrogen bond in the calcium-binding region of the catalytic domain of the matrix metalloproteinase, MMP 13. The MDST phenotype is associated with recessive MMP 13 mutations, confirming {{the importance of this}} metalloproteinase in the metaphyseal growth plate. Dominant MMP 13 mutations have been associated with metaphyseal anadysplasia (OMIM 602111), while a single child homozygous for a MMP 13 mutation had been previously diagnosed as "recessive metaphyseal anadysplasia," that we conclude is the same nosologic entity as MDST. Molecular confirmation of MDST allows distinction of it from dominant conditions (e. g., <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> Schmid type; OMIM # 156500) and from more severe multi-system conditions (such as cartilage-hair hypoplasia; OMIM # 250250) and to give precise recurrence risks and prognosis. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

The spectrum of diagnoses included multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, diastrophic dysplasia, <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Stickler syndrome, Kniest dysplasia, and anauxetic dysplasia. Complex treatment, which included axial correction and juxta-articular realignment, was performed as a single-stage, or consecutive surgery. Surgical techniques included corrective osteotomies with internal fixation, guided growth technique and external fixation devices. Best results (full axial correction, normal alignment of the joint) were achieved in 8 patients, including 2 patients with <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> 2 patients with multiple epyphyseal dysplasia, 2 patients with spondyloepyphyseal dysplasia, patient with Stickler syndrome and patient with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia.

Calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase were normal, while targeted analysis of urinary organic acids repeatedly revealed excretion of 2 -hydroxy-glutaric acid. Thus, this child appears to have an unusual combination of findings described in just two other patients so far, a girl and a boy, and called 'spondyloenchondrodysplasia with D- 2 -hydroxy-glutaric aciduria'. These three cases are similar in terms of severe metaphyseal lesions, mild vertebral involvement, and presence of 2 -hydroxy-glutaric acid in the urine.

40|$|Abstract Introduction A girl {{presented}} with achondroplasia manifested as mild knee pain associated with stiffness of her back. A skeletal survey showed enchondroma-like <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> and ossification of the spinal ligaments. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the spine}} further clarified the pathological composites. Case presentation A 7 -year-old girl {{presented with}} the classical phenotypic features of achondroplasia. Radiographic documentation showed the co-existence of metaphyseal enchondromatosis and development of spinal bony ankylosis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extensive ossification of the anterior and posterior spinal ligaments. Additional features revealed by magnetic resonance imaging included calcification of the peripheral vertebral bodies associated with anterior end-plate irregularities. Conclusion Enchondromas are metabolically active and may continue to grow and evolve throughout the patient's lifetime; thus, progressive calcification {{over a period of}} years is not unusual. Ossification of the spinal ligaments has a specific site of predilection and often occurs in combination with senile ankylosing vertebral hyperostosis. Nevertheless, ossification of the spinal ligaments has been encountered in children with syndromic malformation complex. It is a multifactorial disease in which complex genetic and environmental factors interact, potentially leading to chronic pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots with subsequent development of myeloradiculopathy. Our patient presented with a combination of achondroplasia, enchondroma-like <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> and calcification of the spinal ligaments. We suggest that the development of heterotopic bone formation along the spinal ligaments had occurred through an abnormal ossified enchondral mechanism. We postulate that ossification of the spinal ligaments and metaphyseal enchondromatous changes are related to each other and represent impaired terminal differentiation of chondrocytes in this particular case. Standard radiographic examination showed spinal bony ankylosis only. The pathological composites of the vertebrae have been clarified using scanning technology. Extensive spinal ligament ossification associated with calcification of the peripheral vertebral bodies and anterior end-plate irregularities were notable. We report what may be a novel spinal and extraspinal malformation complex in a girl with achondroplasia. </p...|$|E
40|$|Vertebral and <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> {{spasticity}} with cerebral calcifications, {{and strong}} predisposition to autoimmune diseases are {{the hallmarks of}} the genetic disorder spondyloenchondrodysplasia. We mapped a locus in five consanguineous families to chromosome 19 p 13 and identified mutations in ACP 5, which encodes tartrate-resistant phosphatase (TRAP), in 14 affected individuals and showed that these mutations abolish enzyme function in the serum and cells of affected individuals. Phosphorylated osteopontin, a protein involved in bone reabsorption and in immune regulation, accumulates in serum, urine and cells cultured from TRAP-deficient individuals. Case-derived dendritic cells exhibit an altered cytokine profile and are more potent than matched control cells in stimulating allogeneic T cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions.

40|$|Linear {{growth can}} be {{disturbed}} in paediatric adrenal disease associated with endocrine hypo- or hyperfunction. Tall stature is a feature {{in some patients}} with adrenocorticotropic hormone resistance syndromes and short stature is recognized in the IMAGe (intrauterine growth retardation, <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital anomalies) association. In autoimmune Addison's disease, growth is usually normal. In congenital adrenal hyperplasia, height may be compromised by advanced skeletal maturation or by suppressed growth, particularly in the neonatal period due to excess glucocorticoid treatment. In virilizing adrenal tumours, height is increased at diagnosis, but after surgical cure final height is usually in the normal range. In Cushing's disease, height was abnormally short in 50 % of patients at presentation. After successful treatment, spontaneous catch-up growth was not seen. This led to a diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) deficiency in 80 % of patients. With GH replacement, catch-up growth and long-term benefit occurred. Disturbance of linear growth is an important feature of many patients with adrenal disorders in childhood. Assessment of its pathogenesis and careful management are necessary to ensure optimal final adult height. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Mutations in the PCNA-binding site of CDKN 1 C significantly increase CDKN 1 C protein stability and prevent cell cycle progression into the S phase. Overexpression of either wild-type or BWS-mutant CDKN 1 C inhibited cell proliferation.

40|$|IMAGe {{syndrome}} (intrauterine growth restriction, <b>metaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> adrenal hypoplasia congenita and genital anomalies) is an undergrowth developmental disorder with life-threatening consequences. An identity-by-descent {{analysis in}} a family with IMAGe syndrome identified a 17. 2 -Mb locus on chromosome 11 p 15 that segregated in the affected family members. Targeted exon array capture of the disease locus, followed by high-throughput genomic sequencing and validation by dideoxy sequencing, identified missense mutations in the imprinted gene CDKN 1 C (also known as P 57 KIP 2) in two familial and four unrelated patients. A familial analysis showed an imprinted mode of inheritance in which only maternal transmission of the mutation resulted in IMAGe syndrome. CDKN 1 C inhibits cell-cycle progression, {{and we found that}} targeted expression of IMAGe-associated CDKN 1 C mutations in Drosophila caused severe eye growth defects compared to wild-type CDKN 1 C, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism. All IMAGe-associated mutations clustered in the PCNA-binding domain of CDKN 1 C and resulted in loss of PCNA binding, distinguishing them from the mutations of CDKN 1 C that cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome. © 2012 Nature America, Inc.

We performed genome-wide SNP genotyping in five affected and four unaffected members of an extended family with MDMHB. Analysis for copy-number variations revealed that a 105 kb duplication within RUNX 2 segregated with the MDMHB phenotype in a region with maximum linkage. Real-time PCR for copy-number variation in genomic DNA in eight samples, as well as sequence analysis of fibroblast cDNA from one subject with MDMHB confirmed that affected family members were heterozygous {{for the presence of}} an intragenic duplication encompassing exons 3 to 5 of RUNX 2. These three exons code for the Q/A domain and the functionally essential DNA-binding runt domain of RUNX 2. Transfection studies with murine Runx 2 cDNA showed that cellular levels of mutated RUNX 2 were markedly higher than those of wild-type RUNX 2, suggesting that the RUNX 2 duplication found in individuals with MDMHB leads to a gain of function. Until now, only loss-of-function mutations have been detected in RUNX 2; the present report associates an apparent gain-of-function alteration of RUNX 2 function with a distinct rare disease...|$|E
