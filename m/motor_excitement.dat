2500|$|In 1959 it {{was used}} by over 2,000 {{physicians}} and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as [...] "chemically and clinically different {{from any of the}} tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available." [...] During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, rats, cats, and dogs. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to phenobarbital in its anticonvulsant properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of barbiturates. Animal tests were conducted in the Boston Zoo and the San Diego Zoo. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various psychoses and neuroses were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, anxiety, tension, and <b>motor</b> <b>excitement</b> were [...] "effectively reduced." [...] The most positive results were observed among alcoholic patients. It was reported that ulcers and dermatologic problems, both of which involving emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
40|$|Injections of 20 to 30 μg. of 48 / 80 {{into the}} {{cerebral}} ventricular spaces of mice produced {{a condition of}} <b>motor</b> <b>excitement</b> termed “delirium ambulatorium. ” This condition was aggravated by previous intraperitoneal injection of tranquillizers, atropine, and promethazine, not affected by previous injection of mepyramine and abolished by a previous injection of pentobarbitone. When an intraperitoneal injection of strychnine was followed by an intraventricular injection of 48 / 80, the strychnine convulsions became more violent, but the pattern of delirium ambulatorium was not produced...|$|E
40|$|The psychopathological {{manifestations of}} {{schizophrenia}} have been broadly divided into {{positive and negative}} symptom groups. Even {{though there is no}} definitive consensus, psychomotor agitation, <b>motor</b> <b>excitement,</b> hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder constitute positive and psychomotor retardation, amotivation, apathy and decreased emotional expression are grouped into negative symptoms. The negative symptoms have been reported to appear late {{in the course of the}} illness and resistant to treatment with neuroleptics. While these claims have not been substantiated, the current interest on negative symptoms is related to the fact that many nonfunctioning institutionalized as well as ambulatory schizophrenics manifest negative symptoms. As chronic psychiatric beds have become scarce, many patients with negative symptoms who were harbored in the chronic mental hospitals have been released to the community care and some of these patients live on the streets. Thus their visibility has challenged psychiatry to focus its efforts on the etiology and treatment of negative symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Risky {{driving is}} an {{important}} cause of motor vehicle injury, {{but there is a}} lack of good epidemiological data in this field, particularly data comparing risky driving in younger drivers to those of other age groups. We examined the relationship between risky driving habits, prior traffic convictions and motor vehicle injury using cross-sectional data amongst 21, 893 individuals in New Zealand, including 8029 who were aged 16 – 24 years. Those who reported frequently racing a <b>motor</b> vehicle for <b>excitement</b> or driving at 20 km/h or more over the speed limit, and those who had received traffic convictions over the past 12 months, were between two and four times more likely to have been injured while driving over the same time period. Driving unlicensed was a risk factor for older but not younger drivers, and driving at 20 km/h or more above the speed limits was a stronger risk factor for younger (< 25 years) than older drivers. These results confirm the need for interventions targeting risky driving and suggest that different strategies may be required for different high-risk groups. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The factor {{structure}} of the 24 item BPRS-E was examined to determine the effect of additional items on consensus scales derived primarily from the 18 item BPRS. A meta-analysis (k =  32, n =  10, 084) of previous factor analyses of the BPRS-E was conducted using both a co-occurrence similarity matrix and reproduced correlations. Components generally supporting the consensus scales were found suggesting four relatively invariant subscales: Affect (defined by the core items: anxiety, guilt, depression, suicidality), Positive Symptoms (hallucinations, unusual thought content, suspiciousness, grandiosity), Negative Symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, motor retardation) and Activation (<b>excitement,</b> <b>motor</b> hyperactivity, elevated mood, distractibility). The additional BPRS-E items primarily contribute directly to a clear Activation dimension which expands and clarifies the traditional 18 item BPRS structure. Though not statistically supported in this meta-analysis, a fifth factor describing disorganization (conceptual disorganization, disorientation, self-neglect, mannerisms-posturing) was present in some analyses and should be considered. The five factor solution including a disorganization factor has theoretical validity based on the pentagonal model of schizophrenia while also containing the same four primary dimensions that were statistically supported in this meta-analysis. A new version of the BPRS (BPRS- 26) with modified and additional items is presented. BPRS- 26 is supposed to enhance the stability and the comprehensiveness of the scale and to more closely measure this five factor model...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the effect of chlorpromazine on primary-process thinking. Ss were 40 institutionalized schizophrenics who were randomly assigned to either a drug or placebo group. Research data were obtained from pre- and postdrug Rorschach protocols, which were scored using Holt's (1959) method. The most outstanding finding was the striking improvement in mean defense effectiveness. Drug patients proved to be more capable of handling primary-process elements; the more so, the more they were rated as clinically improved. The insignificant changes in the sum of Level 1 primary process and mean defense demand suggest that the degree of thought pathology itself is not directly affected by drug treatment. The present research investigates the psychological nature of the effects of chlorpromazine on chronic schizophrenics. Numerous reports indicate that this drug has appreciable effects on the behavioral status of patients. It reduces <b>motor</b> <b>excitement,</b> agitation, noisiness, and aggression. Treated patients show more interest in self-care and become more reliable in handling privileges, work assignments, and money. Unfortunately, however, these findings have been based almost exclusively upon psychiatric observations and subjective clinical impressions as to the changes in overt symptoms. The effect of the drug on intrinsic psychotic mechanisms, such as the presence of uncontrolled primary-process thinking, 2 has not been studied intensively in psychoanalytic theory. Uncontrolled, primary-process thinking is the factor most constantly associated with extreme ego weakness (Bellak, 1958; Rapaport, 1951; Schafer, 1958). Accordingly, it was used here as the measure of basic change. Only a minority of the numerous clinical studies on chlorpromazine have employed standardized psychological tests to assess drug effects. Some of the most powerful of the projective methods have played only a mariThis paper is based upon the author's doctora...|$|E
