2500|$|As {{a result}} of the rapidly-increasing usage of the Internet, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any company that had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a [...] ".com" [...] suffix in its name, leading to a stock market bubble. During the bubble, the valuations of {{companies}} in the quaternary sector of the economy increased rapidly. Venture capitalists, eager to profit on this investment demand, moved to raise and invest capital faster and with less caution than usual. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices, <b>market</b> <b>confidence</b> that the companies would turn future profits, speculation in stocks by individuals, and widely available venture capital created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the price–earnings ratio, in favor of basing confidence on technological advancements. The low interest rates of 1998–99 helped increase the availability of funding. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top marginal capital gains tax in the United States, is also cited as a reason that people were willing to make more speculative investments.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} discover the enterpreneurs’ willingness to open up businesses {{within the range of}} small to medium-sized enterprises. The entrepreneurs’ willingness variable consists of the knowledge regarding the business, including the <b>market</b> knowledge, <b>confidence,</b> understanding of risk factors, and the capital/fund to start the business. The {{research is}} conducted in Depok: a suburban area near Jakarta, which is the capital city of Indonesia. This location is chosen because, as the capital city hinterland, Depok has a high population to serve as a great market potential that has attracted people in doing business in the area. The sample size is 100 SME entrepreneurs within the area. The research analysis method is multiple regression which makes it possible to find the significant value for each factor, both partially and simultaneously. The research results have shown that the understanding of the <b>market</b> knowledge and <b>confidence</b> influences the entrepreneurs’ willingness significantly. However, the understanding of risk factors and the capital/fund factor do not show a significant value to influence the willingness of entrepreneurs to start or do their businesses. This research has also implied that good understanding of market knowledge would establish a good confidence to strengthen the willingness of entrepreneurs to carry on the business.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the integration of}} the Australian stock market with its two leading trading partners, the US and Japan. In investigating the extent of integration, this study takes into account the interdependence between foreign exchange rates and stock prices, since exchange rates influence international competitiveness of firms, and, via interest rates, the cost of capital. The results indicate that there was a stable long-run relationship among the Australian, US and Japanese markets prior to the Asian crisis but that this relationship disappeared in the post-Asian crisis period. An analysis of the short-run dynamic linkages among markets suggests that, following the Asian crisis, the US influence on the Australian market diminished while the influence of Japan remained at a modest level. Furthermore, the impulse response analysis indicates only a contemporaneous transmission of shocks from one market to other <b>markets.</b> <b>Confidence</b> intervals for impulse responses are estimated using the bootstrap-after-bootstrap method...|$|R
40|$|Finding {{satisfactory}} {{explanations of}} deviations from uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP) {{has proved to}} be a frustrating experience for Neoclassical economists. Studies have focused on the role of risk, but thus far no one has been able to put forward a source thereof that can account for the specific pattern of deviations from UIRP. This paper offers an alternative perspective that finally resolves the mystery. Drawing on the work of Marc Lavoie and John Smithin and extending it with some basic Post Keynesian propositions regarding endogenous money, uncertainty, and nonergodicity, it is shown that one can devise a comprehensive explanation of UIRP [...] an explanation that shows that much more than risk is responsible for deviations. In particular, it is argued that Keynes's "confidence" is a vitally important and overlooked factor. This contention is supported by a regression analysis of the U. S. -German and U.

Further investigation shows that market reaction is related to factors specific to the issuer and issue by reference to the period immediately surrounding the issue.
