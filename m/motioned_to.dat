25|$|At the hearing, Alagad party-list {{representative}} Rodante Marcoleta questioned if {{the committee}} should {{wait for the}} court's decision on Gutierrez's motion for reconsideration. After the minutes of the previous meeting was approved, Nacionalista Party member Marc Douglas Cagas IV from Davao del Sur's 1st district <b>motioned</b> <b>to</b> reconsider {{the approval of the}} minutes, which was denied by vice chairperson Rodolfo Fariñas (Nacionalista, Ilocos Norte–1st) since Cagas was absent at the previous meeting. After several minutes of arguing whether to wait for a Supreme Court decision, Rodolfo Albano (Lakas-Kampi, Isabela–1st) <b>motioned</b> <b>to</b> wait for the decision; the motion was defeated 8–37. Tupas read a letter submitted by Gutierrez, and the representatives debated anew on whether to wait for the court's decision; Fariñas later bared his plan on filing impeachment cases against the justices for not reading Gutierrez's petition before issuing the status quo ante order. The committee ultimately voted that both complaints were sufficient in grounds, with the first complaint passing on a 41–12 vote, and the second complaint approved on a 42–12 decision.|$|E

The second step was to compare the modified products to the patent claims to determine if the modified product infringes.|$|E
25|$|Gandhi {{questioned}} {{the continued existence}} of a privy purse for former rulers of princely states. She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the Jana Sangh and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges. The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the Parliament in 1970. It was passed in the Lok Sabha but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a single vote. Gandhi responded by having a Presidential proclamation issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost. However, the proclamation was struck down by the Supreme Court of India. In 1971, Gandhi again <b>motioned</b> <b>to</b> abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India. Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.|$|E

25|$|After {{a couple}} more completions, the Badgers had the ball at the Sun Devil 13-yard line for 1st and 10. The Badgers were in {{possession}} of the football with 18 seconds left, hoping to kick a game-winning field goal. Upon the hike Quarterback Joel Stave knelt {{in the middle of}} the field to center the ball for their kicker. Stave then placed the ball quickly on the ground after the play was blown dead by the referee. Replays showed that Stave did get his knee down for a brief second, however Arizona State believed that it was a fumble, and ASU Anthony Jones dove on top of the ball, with the game clock running. At this point Badgers players signalled to the officials, pointing out the delay of game penalty by ASU due to Anthony being top of the football. Umpire Jack Folliard <b>motioned</b> <b>to</b> Stave acknowledging his knee, however the rest of the officiating crew allegedly did not see this signal. The umpire then spotted the ball after a significant delay, but told the Wisconsin offensive line to wait to line up, even though the clock continued to run. Finally, with approximately 2 seconds remaining, the umpire rushed behind the defensive line as Wisconsin tried to run a play to spike the ball and stop the clock but the clock reached zero before the ball was snapped and the game was over.|$|E
25|$|Roddick's first 2005 tournament {{victory was}} the SAP Open in San Jose, California, {{where he became}} the first to win the event in {{consecutive}} years since Mark Philippoussis in 1999 and 2000. The top-seeded Roddick defeated Cyril Saulnier in 50 minutes, the event's first championship shutout set since Arthur Ashe beat Guillermo Vilas in 1975. In March, he defeated world No. 7 Carlos Moyá. In April, Roddick won the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championships, reclaiming the title he won in 2001 and 2002. (He lost in 2003 to Agassi, and in 2004 to Tommy Haas.) In May, Roddick had match point against Spain's Fernando Verdasco. Verdasco was attempting to save the match point on his second serve, when the linesman erroneously called the serve out. If this call had held, Roddick would have won the match. Roddick <b>motioned</b> <b>to</b> the umpire, pointing to the clear ball mark on the clay indicating that the ball was in, and the call was consequently changed. Verdasco {{went on to win the}} match. At the French Open, Roddick lost to unseeded Argentine José Acasuso in the second round, and at Wimbledon, Roddick lost to Federer in the final for the second consecutive year. In August, he defeated world No. 3 Lleyton Hewitt at the Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati. At the US Open, Roddick was defeated by world No. 70 Gilles Müller in the first round. Roddick's most recent US Open first-round loss had been in 2000. At the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, Roddick defeated Gaël Monfils to wrap up a tournament without losing a set or getting his serve broken.|$|E

Planning permission was granted by Islington Council in May 2002, but local residents and ISCA launched a late challenge to the High Court, citing the plans were against the law.

EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system {{in order to be}} compliant with the ruling. [...] The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with [...] "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method."

50|$|In {{legislative}} bodies, the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> rescind is {{used for}} much the same purpose as the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> reconsider; many court decisions treat the two motions as one motion.

The difference between rescind and reconsider is that the <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> rescind is ordinarily applied to actions that have been taken and are already in effect.

It is not in order when the question can be reached by a <b>motion</b> <b>to</b> reconsider. Once legislation has been actually enacted, it is too late to rescind.
