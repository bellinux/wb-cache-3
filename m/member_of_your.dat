25|$|The 99th Infantry Division {{received}} its baptism of {{fire in the}} most bitterly contested battle that has been fought since the current campaign on the European continent began... Your organization gave ample proof {{of the fact that}} it is a good hard fighting division and one in which you and each and every <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> command can be justly proud...|$|E
500|$|Farrell exalted the lyricism of the song, {{stating that}} [...] "Sophie's music has never sounded so lyrically rich" [...] and her [...] "storytelling skills" [...] were visible in it. Considine named the song a [...] "welcome break from lullabies (such as 'The Deer and the Wolf') that risk monotony" [...] on the album. Conversely, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{described}} [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] as a [...] "bogged down in pretension" [...] moment in Wanderlust; Erlewine {{went on to}} criticize the song's [...] "ceaseless pomp". Kate Bennett of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Love Is a Camera" [...] was [...] "more of the same" [...] "heroine-gazing-forlornly-into-the-distance." [...] She elaborated, [...] "You'd {{have to have a}} heart of cold, igneous rock not to enjoy [...] just a little, but if you were never a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> local youth theatre company the sticky-sweetness of it all quickly becomes cloying." [...] The song peaked at number 32 on the UK Airplay Chart, while on the UK Indie chart it reached number 33.|$|E
2500|$|We {{are lucky}} {{the people who}} wrote and signed our {{constitution}} were very wise. They understood the need of Americans to worship God as they choose. A <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family {{will be able to}} talk with you about your duty to God. Remember, this achievement is part of your Cub Scout promise. [...] "I, ____, promise to do my best to do my duty to God and my country." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{head clerk}} {{took up the}} first letter of the two {{and pointed to the}} opening sentence: [...] "Sir Giles Mountjoy, I have a {{disclosure}} to make in which one <b>of</b> the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family is seriously interested." [...] Dennis emphatically repeated the words: [...] "one <b>of</b> the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family." [...] His employer regarded him with a broad stare of astonishment.|$|R

2500|$|Another {{important}} {{issue is the}} concept of [...] "insider-outsider" [...] introduced by Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran. Accordingly, in his administration outsiders have less rights compared to insiders and cannot have any administrative posts. He stated that [...] "I mean, you [...] must trust an insider as a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> clique. We must consider as insiders those persons who are sympathetic towards our revolution, our state and Islam. The outsiders {{are the ones who are}} opposed to the principle of our state." ...|$|E
2500|$|Members {{were drawn}} {{from all of the}} Protestant churches: from the Roman, Greek, Syrian and Armenian Catholic churches; from Theosophy, Christian Science and Spiritualism; and from many Oriental religions. [...] Cayce's {{philosophy}} was, if it makes you a better <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> church then it's good; if it takes you away from your church, it's bad. [...] The philosophy of the readings was that truth is one, each organization is part of this one, therefore the A.R.E. was not to function as a schism or in opposition to any religious organization. [...] The goal of the work was not something new but something ancient and universal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} choice is {{probably}} an individual right only, {{as opposed to}} also being a family right or a union right, however the rights are {{between you and the}} government and not between you and a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family. [...] In the 1995 Supreme Court case B. (R.) v. Children’s Aid Society, in which two parents attempted to block a certain treatment for their child on religious grounds, it was argued that the personal choice aspect of liberty guaranteed family privacy. [...] This argument drew from United States case law, but the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out section 7 of the Charter contains individual rights, and hence there cannot be family rights. [...] Still, mindful that there was still choices involved in the family situation, the Supreme Court split on whether liberty rights were infringed. [...] Likewise, in I.L.W.U. v. The Queen (1992), the Supreme Court stressed the individual nature of section 7 to deny unions had a right to strike as part of the members' liberty. [...] The Court also stressed that strikes were socioeconomic matters that did not involve the justice system, and section 7 was concentrated on the justice system.|$|E

6000|$|... "I knew it all before, I {{believed}} it all before," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "but I would not accept your baptism and become a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Church." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's it, exactly," [...] {{asserted}} Beth. [...] "It's like {{hearing a}} tale of an ancestor, Thursday, or of some <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family who lived before you. You cannot be responsible, in any way, for another man's wickedness." ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. Surely {{the text}} refers to our {{right and left}} hands. I am {{somewhat}} surprised to hear a <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Church quote so essentially Protestant a document as the Bible; {{but at least you}} might quote it accurately.|$|E

6000|$|... 'If so, my dear,' {{observed}} Mr. Micawber, {{with his}} usual suddenness of warmth on that subject, 'as the <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> family--whoever he, she, or it, may be--has kept us waiting for a considerable period, perhaps the Member may now wait MY convenience.' ...|$|E
