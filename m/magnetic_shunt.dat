The voltage drop of a tube is proportional to length and so the maximum voltage and length of tubing fed from a given transformer is limited.

50|$|Older NSTs {{are simply}} iron-cored transformers, usually {{embedded}} in asphalt to reduce noise. The core either has a <b>magnetic</b> <b>shunt,</b> or {{a gap in}} the iron core, both of which serve to current-limit the output, allowing them to run indefinitely in short-circuit conditions. They can also run indefinitely with no load. Iron cored varieties are quite heavy, for example a 15 kV, 60 mA device may weigh up to 20 kg (44 lb).Some newer manufactured iron cored NSTs include a large capacitor in parallel with the output for PFC (power factor correction). This serves to correct the shift in the phase of voltage and current caused by the large inductance of the transformer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Transformer {{is a vital}} link in {{the power}} system, which is {{connected}} in the network at different stages right from the generating station to the user’s premises. The T&D losses in the Indian power system ranges from 10 - 50 %, which is significantly high. In this, the contribution of transformers exceeds 6 % of the total power generated. Although the transformer is the most energy efficient equipment in the system, yet it would be expedient to make an attempt to further reduce the losses in it to improve the overall system efficiency. In this context, a case study was undertaken to analyze various components of stray losses in power transformer and assess the scope for their optimization. The load losses in the transformer consist of I 2 R & stray losses. In large rating transformer, the stray losses constitute about 20 - 25 % of the total load losses. Designers adopt various cost-effective measures to minimize the losses and make the transformer more efficient. These losses could be controlled {{to a level of}} 8 - 10 % by means of <b>magnetic</b> <b>shunts</b> judiciously placed so as to canalize the leakage flux. However optimum location of these shunts calls for accurate knowledge of 3 -D flux mapping. Some of the commercially available software programs support 3 -D field simulation studies for estimation of stray losses with fairly good accuracy. Depending on the accuracy requirement, these programs could be exploited to a varying degree to achieve the desired results. This paper presents a case study involving estimation of stray losses in a 100 MVA, 220 / 66 / 11 kV system transformer using an Integral Equation Method (IEM) and Finite Element Method (FEM) based EDMAG- 3 D software program. To present a comprehensive picture of total stray losses, the winding stray losses due to axial and radial magnetic fields are also calculated using 2 -D programs. I...|$|R

The misconvergence of colours is characterised by the distances measured between the traces of red and blue beams. The method proposed consists of two phases, namely, learning and optimisation. In the learning phase, the radial basis function neural network is trained to learn a mapping: correction shunt position changes in misconvergence. In the optimisation phase, the trained neural network is used to predict changes in misconvergence depending on a correction shunt position.

Data from MRC can be summated to produce an image much like the cholangiogram obtained by using ERCP. In addition, MRC and conventional MRI can provide information about the biliary and other anatomy above and below a biliary obstruction.

With im-provements made on High Frequency active components with new materials (SiC, GaN), HF passive components have to be upgraded also to be more efficient and more compact. Planar components are prevalent solutions for the “integration ” of magnetic devices. Indeed, these components exhibit low profile, high power density and high reproducibility compared to other types of HF magnetic components. They can obviously be found on embedded systems (automotive, avionics) for example. The leakage inductance of such component is a topic of huge interest. Indeed, due to their low profile, their leakage inductance value is usually supposed to be low while in PE converters high value and controlled ones can be required for soft-switching converters and other specific converters.

40|$|The {{rotating}} arc welding of the pipes (ROTARC) use a rotating electric arc for heating the extremities of two pipes, which turns {{due to the}} electromagnetic force created between the arc column (which is equivalent to a non-fixed wire through which an electric current passes along an axial direction) and a magnetic field having a constant intensity conducted along the radial direction. Within the “Pressure Welding Technologies ” laboratory in “Dunărea de Jos ” University- Galaţi both magnetising systems have been manufactured and tested, redesigned and experimented for several variants and original technical solutions have been found. First the work presents the principle of ROTARC welding and several original equipment developed by the team. Then, a classic longitudinal magnetising system and some results and conclusions of the experiments are presented. It is pointed out the classic displacement of the arc into {{the gap between the}} extremities; the only obvious disadvantage of this magnetising system is the pull out of the pipes into the fixing systems, which is only possible along the axial direction. The results lead to the conclusions that the transversal magnetising systems present both constructive and practical utility problems. The lateral displacement of the system against the gap is not enough due to the low value of the magnetic field.

40|$|The {{accelerator}} and {{particle physics}} communities {{are considering a}} lepton Linear Collider LC as the most appropriate machine to carry out high precision particle physics research in the TeV energy regime. The Compact Linear Collider CLIC and the International Linear Collider ILC are the two proposals for the future e+e- LC. Both designs achieve a luminosity L above 10 ^(34) cm- 2 s- 1 at the interaction point IP, satisfying the particle physics requirements. The LC consists of different systems, being the Final Focus System FFS the last one before colliding the beam at the IP. It is responsible to focus the beams at sizes {{in the range of}} nanometres by means of the Final Doublet FD. The FFS designs of the CLIC and ILC projects are based on a new local chromaticity correction scheme which has never been experimentally tested before. The Accelerator Test Facility ATF 2 at KEK (Japan) aims to experimentally verify the feasibility of the FFS based on this novel scheme. The present thesis is devoted to the design and higher order optimisation of FFS for linear colliders based on the local chromaticity correction scheme. The CLIC design luminosity L 0 is 5. 9 · 10 ^(34) cm- 2 s- 1 assuming head-on collisions. However the beams cross each other at the IP forming an angle of 20 mrad. Due to this crossing scheme the luminosity would be reduced by 90 %. Crab cavities are dedicated to tilt the bunches in order to provide head-on like collisions preserving the design L 0. In this thesis different solutions that recover the design luminosity for the CLIC FFS are proposed. The designs of a new ATF 2 Nominal and Ultra-low beta* lattices, to test the feasibility of the ILC and CLIC FFS respectively, are presented in this thesis. The expected IP vertical beam sizes sy* for these lattices are 38 and 23 nm respectively, at this beam size regime the magnetic field quality of the FFS magnets is a concern. Indeed, the evaluated sy* with the measured multipole components is 100 % for the Nominal lattice and 400 % for the Ultra-low beta* lattice. The study of the higher order aberrations performed in this thesis is crucial for identifying possible cures that minimise the observed beam size growth. Different solutions have been studied: (i) replacing the FD by better field quality magnets, (ii) swapping the ATF 2 quadrupole magnets according to their skew sextupole component and (iii) modifying the lattice optics. The new lattice designs ATF 2 Bx 2. 5 By 1. 0 and ATF 2 Ultra-low betay* are based on the prosposed solutions. The impact of the multipoles components is effectively minimsed for both new designs, achieving a sy* equal to 38 and 27 nm,respectively. The tuning study of the FFS determines its feasibility under realistic error conditions. 100 machines with different initial error configurations are used to address this problem. The tuning simulation study for the alternative CLIC FFS design takes into account BPM resolution, the effect of synchrotron radiation and the misalignment errors of the magnets, being the later a critical parameter on the tuning performance of the system. The motion of the <b>magnetic</b> centre when <b>shunting</b> the quadrupole magnet might represent a limiting factor for further improvement of its alignment. Dedicated measurements at ATF 2 have shown a motion of the magnetic centre below 1 micrometre for a shunting variation of 20 %. Under this alignment condition the tuning study of the CLIC FFS shows that 80 % of the machines reach a L equal or above than L 0. The errors included in the tuning study of the ATF 2 lattices are misalignments, tilts and miss-powering of the ATF 2 FFS magnets. The simulated tuning results show that 80 % of the machines reach a final sy* that does not exceed in more than 11 % and 35 % the design sy* for the ATF 2 Bx 2. 5 By 1. 0 and Ultra-low beta_y* lattices respectively.

40|$|Traditional cable driven {{elevators}} perform {{poorly in}} high-rise buildings because {{the weight of}} the cable limits the payload, and its elasticity degrades control performance. Further, it is not mechanically possible to include several elevator cars in the same hoistway because of the cable. However such multi-car elevator systems are desirable since they reduce passenger waiting time and reduce the space requirements of the elevator system. A promising solution is to use long armature linear motors spanning the hoistway to directly drive elevator cages. In such applications, the mover position sensing method must be explicitly addressed since most active position sensing methods require traveling cables, which are also an obstacle for multi-car elevator systems. In this paper, the linear-motor active position sensing method is formally introduced and the principle of operation, design and real-time operation methods are presented. The proposed method is used to measure the position of the mover of a long armature permanent magnet linear synchronous motor requiring no active components on the mover, thus traveling cables are eliminated.
