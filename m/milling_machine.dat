This worked with The Churchill Machine Tool Co in a joint manufacturing development project concerning precision grinders.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E
25|$|The first large {{precision}} machine tool was the cylinder boring machine used for boring the large-diameter cylinders on early steam engines. The planing machine, the <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> and the shaping machine were developed {{in the early decades}} of the 19th century. Although the <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> was invented at this time, it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|A <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a machine}} tool {{used for the}} shaping of metal and other solid materials. In {{contrast}} to drilling, where the drill is moved exclusively along its axis, the milling operation uses movement of the rotating cutter sideways as well as 'in and out'.

25|$|PCB milling uses {{a two or}} three-axis {{mechanical}} milling system to mill away the copper foil from the substrate. A PCB <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> (referred to as a 'PCB Prototyper') operates {{in a similar way}} to a plotter, receiving commands from the host software that control the position of the milling head in the x, y, and (if relevant) z axis.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} similar to that {{outlined}} for the universal <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> except a gashing angle is not used. When gashing spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction.

25|$|Hobbing is a {{machining}} process for gear cutting, cutting splines, and cutting sprockets on a hobbing machine, {{which is a}} special type of <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> The teeth or splines are progressively cut into the workpiece {{by a series of}} cuts made by a cutting tool called a hob. Compared to other gear forming processes it is relatively inexpensive but still quite accurate, thus it is used for a broad range of parts and quantities.|$|E
25|$|Single-pass bore {{finishing}} is {{not usually}} done in a <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> for several reasons. Firstly, most milling machines have only one spindle, so changing the tool more than four to six times can increase cycle times significantly. Secondly, most workpieces that require this process are made on horizontal machining centers (HMC), which reduces float-ability due to gravity. Thirdly, the lubrication may not be sufficient, {{which can lead to}} material build-up between diamonds, diminishing the tool's effectiveness. Finally, if any chips remain from previous operations they can ruin the tool.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese used {{silver in}} their {{jewellery}} more than gold. Blue kingfisher feathers were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass {{were incorporated into}} designs. However, jade was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty. The first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved. Jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries BC show evidence of having been worked with a compound <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west.|$|E
25|$|The {{tools are}} usually mounted in a {{dedicated}} bore finishing machine, however {{they can also}} be mounted in a <b>milling</b> <b>machine.</b> In either case the tool, workpiece, or both are rotated and the tool is plunged into the bore and removed. The part is then transferred to the next station or a larger tool is mounted and a larger bore machined, and the process repeated until the desired bore geometry is reached. The number of tools required to achieve the desired bore size is dependent on the workpiece material, the amount of stock to be removed and geometrical requirements, with four to six tool pieces being common. Each tool is progressively larger than the last, but in diminishing increments; as the stock removal is reduced, so is the tool's diamond grit size.|$|E
