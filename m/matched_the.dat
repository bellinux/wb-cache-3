5|$|Initially, experts {{determined}} the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked <b>matched</b> <b>the</b> time period Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics <b>matched</b> <b>the</b> poet's interests. Horse {{had written the}} manuscript without knowing any of these details. After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played Myst and 7th Guest and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory-inspired ideas. He later {{said that while the}} story of Myst did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on Drowned God in 1994.|$|E

Each series was released periodically, culminating in a complete boxed set.

5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On the open market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that <b>matched</b> <b>the</b> contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E

5|$|Combined, {{the team}} and {{individual}} players hold 30league records. The team holds seven Southern League (SL) records and sixteen in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Individual players hold six Southern League, one American Association, and two PCL records. In 1980, the franchise set the all-time Southern League season attendance record, which still stands. Many of the PCL records were set on May 5–6, 2006, when the Sounds participated in a 24-inning game against the New Orleans Zephyrs, which <b>matched</b> <b>the</b> longest game, in terms of innings played, in PCL history.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition <b>matched</b> <b>the</b> paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as well. This convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{deliberate}} break from media scrutiny, Williams released his seventh album Rudebox in October 2006 to great public anticipation.

The album, however, sold far fewer copies in the UK than his record label EMI had predicted.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{unsuccessful}} run for {{the governorship}} in 1987, Brown resumed {{his career in the}} restaurant industry. He started the Chicken Grill restaurant in Louisville and helped his wife, Phyllis, launch Chicken By George, a line of boneless, skinless chicken breast products designed for sale in supermarkets and preparation at home. In 1988, Hormel made Chicken By George one of its subsidiaries. Brown expanded several other restaurants including Miami Subs, Texas Roadhouse, and Roadhouse Grill. None of these ventures <b>matched</b> <b>the</b> success he experienced early in his career.|$|E

Singh, a newcomer, devoted all her time to the film.|$|E
5|$|Important {{elements}} of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences {{in education and}} military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, {{from all parts of}} society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never <b>matched</b> <b>the</b> development and growth of Scouting.|$|E
