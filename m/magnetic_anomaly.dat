40|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> of the South American {{continent}} {{are generally}} more positive and variable than the oceanic anomalies. There is better correlation between the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> and the major tectonic elements of the continents than between the anomalies and the main tectonic elements of the adjacent oceanic areas. Oceanic areas generally show no direct correlation to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Precambrian continental shields are mainly more magnetic than continental basins and orogenic belts. Shields differ markedly from major aulacogens which are generally characterized by negative <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> and positive gravity anomalies. The Andean orogenic belt shows rather poor correlation with the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies.</b> The <b>magnetic</b> data exhibit instead prominent east-west trends, which although consistent with some tectonic features, {{may be related to}} processing noise derived from data reduction procedures to correct for external magnetic field effects. The pattern over the Andes is sufficiently distinct from the generally north trending <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> occurring in the adjacent Pacific Ocean to separate effectively {{the leading edge of the}} South American Plate from the Nazea Plate. Eastern South America is characterized by <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> which commonly extend across the continental margin into the Atlantic Ocean...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{compared}} active tectonics and seismicity to the satellite <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> in continental China and surroundings. Our {{surveys of the}} distribution of active blocks, faults and GPS movements confirm that the surficial tectonic structures are well reflected by <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> measured at high altitudes (Figs.  1, 2, 3). In general, stable cratons and basins showed notable positive anomalies, whereas active orogens exhibited strong negative anomalies. Boundaries of active blocks (i.e. faults) and those of obvious <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> often overlap. These phenomena establish a physical foundation for the correlation between seismicity and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the last}} three years of the war, Coastal Command sank more U-boats than any other service and {{continued}} to hold the technological advantage from 1943. A brief threat, {{in the shape of the}} German Type XXI submarine emerged but was too late to alter the course of the war. Technological answers to the Type XXI were available in the form of 3-centimetre radar and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> detectors in aircraft. At midnight 4 June 1945, official wartime operations ceased. The last mission was flown by Wing Commander J. Barret DFC, commanding officer of No. 201 Squadron RAF. By that time over 2,000 decorations had been awarded. These included four Victoria Crosses, of whom only one survived the war, 17 George Medals, and 82 Distinguished Service Orders.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

30|$|We adopt a {{strategy}} {{similar to that}} of the WDMAM version 1 and complement the existing marine magnetic data by building a realistic model of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> caused by seafloor spreading. We made two significant improvements over WDMAM version 1 : we take into account past plate motions in order to model realistic remanent magnetisation vector directions, and we adjust the synthetic <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> to the observed ones.

50|$|The {{conventional}} {{view that}} marine <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> {{arose in the}} upper, extrusive layer of the oceanic crust requires a rethink because perfectly normal <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> arise at core complexes, where the crust has been stripped away.

25|$|The Nimrod was {{equipped}} with a <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Anomaly</b> Detector (MAD) tail boom.

40|$|Summary. Correlation {{of gravity}} and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> {{combined}} with other geological and geophysical data is useful for enhancing the quality of geological interpretation of potential anomaly fields. Maps produced by equivalent point source inversion are used to investigate visual-spatial corre-lations of surface free-air gravity and POGO satellite <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> and regional heat flow and tectonic data for North America and adjacent marine areas. A quantitative analysis of regional potential field anomaly correlations at satellite elevations is also considered utilizing Poisson’s theorem in a moving-window linear regression between derivatives of the anomalous gravity and magnetic fields. An inverse relationship is observed between long-wavelength gravity and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> over continental terrain. Negative gravity and positive <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> are areas characterized by relatively thick crust and high magnetization. An example is a prominent magnetic high which corresponds to a trend of gravity minima extending from the Anadarko Basin to th...|$|R
40|$|Two {{aspects of}} the {{processing}} and interpretation of satellite measurements of the geomagnetic field are described. One deals with the extraction of {{the part of the}} geomagnetic field that originates from sources in the earth's atmosphere. The other investigates the possibility of using the thermal state of the oceanic lithosphere to further constrain modelling and interpretation of <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies.</b> It is shown that some of the magnetic signal in crustal anomaly maps can be an artifact of the mathematical algorithms that have been used to separate the crustal field from the observed data. Strong <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> can be distorted but are probably real, but weak <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> can arise from leakage of power from short wavelengths, and will also appear in anomaly maps as repetitions of the strong crustal anomaly. The distortion and the ghost <b>anomalies</b> follow the <b>magnetic</b> dip lines {{in a way that is}} similar to actual MAGSAT anomaly fields. This phenomenon will also affect the lower degree spherical harmonic terms in the power spectrum of the crustal field. A model of the magnetic properties of the oceanic crust that has been derived from direct measurements of the rock magnetic properties of oceanic rocks is presented. The average intensity of magnetization in the oceanic crust is not strong enough to explain <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> observed over oceanic areas. This is the case for both near surface observations (ship and aeromagnetic data) and satellite altitude observations. It is shown that magnetic sources in the part of the upper mantle that is situated above the Curie isotherm, if sufficiently strong, can produce satellite <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> that are comparable to MAGSAT data. The method developed for the study of depth to the Curie isotherm and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> can also be used in inverse modelling of satellite <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomalies</b> when the model is to be adjusted with an annihilator...|$|R

25|$|The Albatrosses {{improved}} the sweeping capacity and introduced news technology such as sonar, radar and <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> detector.

The P-1 is also furnished with a CAE Inc.-built <b>magnetic</b> <b>anomaly</b> detector (MAD) embedded into the aircraft's tail, along with deployable Sonobouys, which is used for the detection of submerged submarines.

Following the cancellation of Lockheed Martin's Aerial Common Sensor project, Boeing proposed a signals intelligence variant of the P-8 for the Navy's requirement.

Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario.
