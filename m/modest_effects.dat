25|$|Analysis of genome wide {{association}} (GWA) and fine-resolution association mapping is {{a powerful}} method for establishing the inheritance of resistance to infections and other diseases. Two independent preliminary analyses of GWA association with severe falciparum malaria in Africans have been carried out, one by the Malariagen Consortium in a Gambian population and the other by Rolf Horstmann (Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg) and his colleagues on a Ghanaian population. In both cases the only signal of association reaching genome-wide significance was with the HBB locus encoding the β-chain of hemoglobin, which is abnormal in HbS. This {{does not imply that}} HbS is the only gene conferring innate resistance to falciparum malaria; there could be many such genes exerting more <b>modest</b> <b>effects</b> that are challenging to detect by GWA because of the low levels of linkage disequilibrium in African populations. However the same GWA association in two populations is powerful evidence that the single gene conferring strongest innate resistance to falciparum malaria is that encoding HbS.|$|E

Research by Hanushek, Kain, O'Brien, and Rivkin (2005), Kane et al.

In any case, the income effect for more productive workers with higher earnings will be smaller, as the grants will constitute a smaller part of their overall income, further tempering its aggregate impact [47].|$|R

Levodopa brought about a revolution in the management of PD.
