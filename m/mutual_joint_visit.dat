40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the outcome of}} a workshop (the <b>Mutual</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Visit</b> for Seveso Inspections) hosted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment of the Netherlands in November 2006 on ¿enforcement in Seveso II enterprises¿ in particular, a subject that has never been dealt with at EU level before. The ¿Table of Eleven¿ was used as model in order to facilitate and encourage discussion. The Table of Eleven is a model based on behavioural sciences consisting of eleven dimensions, or factors, which are decisive for the level of compliance with legislation. The use of the Table of Eleven requires the definition of and focus on ¿target groups¿ and ¿rules¿¿. Five specific target groups were selected: Mineral oil refineries, the pharmaceutical industry, fertilizer production, chemical batch processing, and LPG storage. Five specific rules were selected: 1) ¿The requirement of submitting a notification¿ (ref. Article 6 sub 1); 2) ¿Major accident scenarios¿ (ref. Article 9 and Annex II sub IVa); 3) ¿Assessment of the extent and severity of consequences¿ (ref. Article 9 and Annex II sub IVb); 4) ¿The identification of training needs¿ (ref. Article 7, 9 and Annex III sub c. i); and 5) ¿Procedures for management of change¿ (ref. Article 7, 9 and Annex III sub c. iv). The workshops discussions produced several interesting and useful conclusions concerning the enforceability of the Seveso Directive in general, and differences in compliance drivers in different sectors and across the Member States. On the basis of these conclusions, several recommendations were generated for European, national and inspectorate level regarding the improvement of enforcement strategies, tools and the results of the analyses performed in this workshop overall and by industry sector and by rule.

The paper selects three case studies, and analyses how assessment can be a tool for building dialogue and interaction among different types of expertise that can support these learning processes, knowledge management, {{and the construction of}} shared choices, thereby creating a network of relationship among technical, social and political assessments, and referring to complex values that are constitutive of conflicting and changing realities...|$|R
500|$|By 2010, Croatia and Serbia further {{improved}} their relations through {{an agreement to}} resolve remaining refugee issues, and visits of Croatian President Ivo Josipović to Belgrade, and of the Serbian President Boris Tadić to Zagreb and Vukovar. During their meeting in Vukovar, President Tadić gave a statement expressing his [...] "apology and regret", while President Josipović said [...] "that no crimes committed at the time would go unpunished."

50|$|Tekeli allowed <b>joint</b> <b>visits</b> {{and gave}} permissions {{to the former}} Cossacks to leave the besieged Sich for {{personal}} reasons. As the Host’s Starshynas were sent to Saint Petersburg, the Sich was slowly vacated. When Tekeli realized that some Cossacks ran off to the Danube where they formed the Danubian Sich, he reported that to the Empress, and received order to destroy the Sich. After ensuring it was vacated, the empty fortress was subjected to a prolonged artillery fire. For his role in quelling the Zaporozhian Cossacks without spilling a single drop of blood, Tekeli was awarded the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue was}} also {{raised by the}} Georgian {{delegation}} at the 25th meeting for incident prevention in Chuburkhindji on 22 February 2011, demanding a <b>joint</b> <b>visit</b> to the church. Viacheslav Chirikba, special envoy of the Abkhazian President, stated {{in the run-up to}} the meeting that Georgia had no authority to raise the issue, and that EUMM head Hansjörg Haber and UN special representative Antti Turunen had had the opportunity during informal visits to convince themselves that the historic character of the church had not been compromised. The church was also visited by EU special representative Pierre Morel on 18 February.|$|R
50|$|This did not daunt Mountbatten, who - {{four years}} later - {{obtained}} an invitation for himself and Lady Amanda to accompany Prince Charles on his planned 1980 tour of India. However, both fathers objected; Prince Philip complaining that the Prince of Wales would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British Viceroy and first Governor-General of India), while Lord Brabourne warned that a <b>joint</b> <b>visit</b> would rivet media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple, thereby potentially dashing the very prospect for which Lord Mountbatten hoped.|$|R
5000|$|U.S. diplomats {{supported}} the EU-led dialogue from the beginning. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint {{travel in the}} Balkans, and the two made <b>joint</b> <b>visits</b> to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues, and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives {{on the margins of}} every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was a 15-point [...] "First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} intermediate care service delivery on the role boundaries of service providers. Two intermediate care teams were selected as case studies to explore the roles of workers {{in the context of}} an admission avoidance and assisted discharge service. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 26 intermediate care staff, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, a social worker and support workers. The study found that therapists 2 ̆ 7 roles were most closely aligned with each other, whilst nurses perceived their roles as being distinct from therapists, with a more medical emphasis. Therapists and nurses delegate a range of tasks to support workers, although the nature of task delegation differed across the two teams. A number of factors were associated with the role flexibility of staff including the setting, duration and nature of care, access to alternative care providers and the ability of staff to undertake <b>joint</b> <b>visits.</b> Contrary to previous research, the practitioners were not threatened by overlapping roles, and recognized that confidence in their own roles and an understanding of the roles of other workers was necessary to avoid feeling threatened. The study concludes that intermediate care can promote role overlap across a range of workers. Role overlap can enhance clinician confidence in their own area of expertise whilst optimising patient care. Role overlap has the potential to optimise limited staff resources in an interprofessional working environment. Interprofessional working can be enhanced in the workplace through <b>joint</b> <b>visits</b> and shared working practices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative project that enabled occupational therapy and child branch nursing {{students to participate}} in an inter-professional simulation, supported by a two week problem based learning activity, which centred upon exploration of the case presented in the simulation. The simulation took place in a simulated residential flat environment and centred on the case of a child returning home following a head injury and rehabilitation. The simulation was a <b>joint</b> <b>visit</b> of the community occupational therapist and community children’s nurse, with the aim of agreeing a joint discharge care plan. The overall evaluation of the experience from students was extremely positive, with all students actively engaging in all stages of the work and making a positive contribution to the evaluation...|$|R
50|$|In October 1871, Sankey and Moody were in {{the middle}} of a revival meeting when the Great Chicago Fire broke out. The two men barely escaped the {{conflagration}} with their lives. Sankey ended up watching the city burn from a rowboat far out on Lake Michigan. On June 7, 1872, Sankey and Moody made the first of several <b>joint</b> <b>visits</b> to the UK. Sankey's hymns were promoted by London Baptist preacher, Charles Spurgeon, long afterwards. While in Edinburgh, they raised £10,000 at a fundraiser to build a new home for the Carrubbers Close Mission, and the foundation was laid during their time in Edinburgh. Today, the building remains one of the few on the Royal Mile still serving its original purpose.|$|R
40|$|AbstractQuantum Information Theory has {{witnessed}} {{a great deal}} of interest in the recent years since its potential for allowing the possibility of quantum computation through quantum mechanics concepts such as entanglement, teleportation and cryptography. In Chemistry and Physics, von Neumann entropies may provide convenient measures for studying quantum and classical correlations in atoms and molecules. Besides, entropic measures in Hilbert space constitute a very useful tool in contrast with the ones in real space representation since they can be easily calculated for large systems. In this work, we show properties of natural atomic probabilities of a first reduced density matrix that are based on information theory principles which assure rotational invariance, positivity, and N- and v-representability in the Atoms in Molecules (AIM) scheme. These (natural atomic orbital-based) probabilities allow the use of concepts such as relative, conditional, <b>mutual,</b> <b>joint</b> and non-common information entropies, to analyze physical and chemical phenomena between atoms or fragments in quantum systems with no additional computational cost. We provide with illustrative examples of the use of this type of atomic information probabilities in chemical process and systems...|$|R
