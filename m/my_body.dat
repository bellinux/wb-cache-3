5|$|I {{finally began}} my {{prescribed}} regime of hormones to continue my overdue gender transition in February. It's been such an amazing relief for <b>my</b> <b>body</b> and brain to finally come into alignment with each other. My stress and anxiety levels have tapered off quite considerably. Overall, things {{are beginning to}} move along nicely.|$|E

5|$|<b>My</b> <b>Body,</b> the Hand Grenade is {{the first}} and only {{compilation}} album to be released by Hole. The liner notes also explain that the compilation was put together to document Hole's progression from the punk-influenced Pretty on the Inside (released in 1991) to their more restrained, alternative rock-based Live Through This (released in 1994). The album was dedicated to former Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff and Kurt Cobain, both of whom died in 1994.|$|E

5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is {{in the words of the}} institution—"This is <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E

25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up <b>my</b> <b>body</b> are grounded in <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E
25|$|It is because, {{a nation}} which shared blood and history is clear, {{and just like}} <b>my</b> <b>body</b> can't be another's, the reason that a certain nation can't become another {{is the same as}} {{brothers}} living in the same house. If two gather and become one, one would be higher and the other lower, so it becomes a basic problem that one orders from above, and the other obeys from below.|$|E
25|$|But the {{position}} I call initial may be arbitrarily chosen from among all {{the position}}s <b>my</b> <b>body</b> has successively occupied. If {{a more or less}} unconscious memory of these successive positions is necessary for the genesis of the notion of space, this memory can go back more or less into the past. Hence results a certain indeterminateness in the very definition of space, and it is precisely this indeterminateness which constitutes its relativity.|$|E
