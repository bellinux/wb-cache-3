Molecular genetic technologies like marker assisted selection, PCR, DNA sequencing, tran genesis and cloning have been discussed. The paper includes the applications of Molecular biotechnologies in animal improvement like animal health, nutrition, growth and in animal breeding and <b>genetics.</b> Scope of <b>molecular</b> genetic technologies in developing countries has also been reviewed.
