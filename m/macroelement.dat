40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} micromorphic {{modeling of}} a granular material. Micromorphic modeling treats an individual particle as a microelement and the particle composition in a representative volume element as a <b>macroelement.</b> By specifying {{the volume of}} a <b>macroelement,</b> continuum volume-type quantities such as mass density, body force, body couple, kinetic energy density, internal energy density, specific heat supply, etc., are determined by taking the averages of their discrete counterparts in a <b>macroelement.</b> The discrete expressions for the divergence of surface-type quantities (fluxes) are obtained {{with the help of}} discrete–continuum analogy for the discrete balance equations. We demonstrate that the discrete formulation of stress tensor in the dynamic condition, which involves both contributions from body forces and relative particle accelerations in a <b>macroelement,</b> can be simply expressed in terms of contact forces and branch vectors. This study constructs complete discrete-type and continuum-type balance equations for a granular material in a <b>macroelement</b> and at a macroscopic point, using the discrete–continuum correspondence for these field quantities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{geotechnical}} engineering, macro-elements became recently {{very popular}} for their simplicity, efficiency and accuracy. This paper presents a new <b>macroelement</b> for single piles in sand (with pile-head {{on the ground}} surface) developed {{within the framework of}} hypoplasticity. The incremental nonlinear constitutive equations are as usual defined in terms of generalized forces, displacements and rotations. The new <b>macroelement</b> is based on the general approach proposed by Salciarini and Tamagnini (2009) and the concept of “internal displacement” introduced after Niemunis and Herle (1997), necessary for cyclic loadings. After a presentation of the 3 D failure envelope of a single pile in sand and the calibration of the <b>macroelement</b> parameters, comparisons with available centrifuge experimental results under static monotonic and cyclic loadings show the performance of this new numerical tool.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The present {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a <b>macroelement</b> model for shallow foundations. The model aims at serving as a practical tool for quick and precise non-linear dynamic analyses of structures, taking into account the soil-structure interaction non-linearities that take place at the foundation level. After a brief overview of some existing <b>macroelement</b> models we outline the principles followed in the development procedure. The <b>macroelement</b> is formulated with introduction of a non-linear constitutive law written in terms of a set of generalized force and displacement parameters. The linear part of this constitutive law is reproduced by the dynamic impedances of the foundation. The non-linear part comprises two mechanisms. The first one, of material origin, is due to the irreversible elastoplastic behavior of the soil. It is described with a bounding surface hypoplastic model, particularly adapted for the description of cyclic soil response. An original feature of the formulation with respect to previous <b>macroelement</b> models is that the bounding surface of the plasticity model is considered independently of the surface of ultimate loads of the system. The second mechanism, of geometric origin, is due to the conditions of unilateral contact at the soil-footing interface, allowing for uplift of the footing. This mechanism is perfectly reversible and non-dissipative. It can thus be described by a phenomenological non-linear elastic model. The <b>macroelement</b> is qualitatively validated by application to soil-structure interaction analyses of simple real structures...|$|E

The analyzed populations are of natural or artificial origin, and they occurred during the process of restitution. They are situated in the zone ranging from continental to moderate continental climate, at five different localities and five different types of soil. Foliar analyses of 150 individual - trees of pedunculate oak at five sites in Serbia and the respective soil analysis show that individual variability in <b>macroelements</b> among trees was not statistically significant, while the site effect was highly significant.

40|$|Successful {{verification}} of seismic safety of unreinforced mansonry buildings in Germany often necessitates application of nonlinear procedures (e. g. the deformation-based method), since the linear procedures {{provided by the}} European seismic design code do not allow for a sufficient utilization of the inherent structural reserves. However, this requires employment of numerical models {{that are capable of}} reproducing the seismic behavior of masonry buildings taking into account both the complex behavior of single shear walls and global interaction effects. Further-more, those models should allow for the quick modeling and seismic analysis of any given masonry structure. Macroelements are particularly well-suited for this purpose. In order to provide a tool for simple but integral assessment of standard German masonry buildings, two different macroelements for unreinforced masonry shear walls were developed and implemented into the finite-element program ANSYS. The macroelements follow different approaches to describe the load bearing and deformation behavior of masonry walls as well as the wall-slab interaction. The first <b>macroelement</b> is double-T-shaped and basically consists of three rigid beams. Their lengths correspond to the wall height and wall length. Thus the actual geometry of the respective wall is adopted. The <b>macroelement</b> is attached to the neighboring floor slabs via nonlinear springs with the wall-slab interaction directly affecting its load bearing behavior. The second <b>macroelement</b> is linear and consists of a series of rigid beams and nonlinear springs. It is attached to the floor slabs rigidly. The flexural behavior of the wall and the wall-slab interaction are regulated by rotational springs, the properties of which are defined through a fiber model analysis.
