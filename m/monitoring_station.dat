On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations.

5|$|The SPARS were {{assigned}} to every USCG district except Puerto Rico, and served in Hawaii and Alaska as well. Most officers held general duty billets, which included administrative and supervisory assignments. Other officers served as communication officers, supply officers, barracks, and recruiting officers. The bulk of the enlisted women performed clerical and stenographic duties. In smaller numbers, the enlisted personnel were found in practically every other billet, from baking pies to rigging parachutes and driving jeeps. A select group of SPAR officers and enlisted personnel were also assigned {{to work with the}} Long Range Aid to Navigation at monitoring stations in the Continental United States. Better known under the acronym LORAN, it was a top-secret radio navigation system developed for ships at sea and long-range aircraft. The first <b>monitoring</b> <b>station</b> staffed by SPARS was at Chatham, Massachusetts. Chatham {{is believed to have been}} (at the time) the only all female-staffed station of its kind in the world. The SPARS peak strength was approximately 11,000 officers and enlisted personnel. Commodore J. A. Hirschfield, USCG, said the SPARS volunteered for duty when their country needed them, and they did their jobs with enthusiasm, efficiency, and with a minimum of fanfare. To honor the SPARS, two USCG cutters were given their name.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) <b>monitor</b> <b>stations</b> is to measure the continuous pseudo-range of all the passing GPS satellites. The pseudo-range contains GPS and <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> clock errors as well as GPS satellite navigation errors. Currently the time at the GPS <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> is obtained from the GPS constellation and has an inherent inaccuracy as a result. Improved timing accuracy at the GPS <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> will improve GPS performance. The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is developing hardware and software for the GPS <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> upgrade program to improve the <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> clock accuracy. This upgrade will allow a method independent of the GPS satellite constellation of measuring and correcting <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> time to US Naval Observatory (USNO) time. THe hardware consists of a high performance atomic cesium frequency standard (CFS) and a computer {{which is used to}} ensemble the CFS with the two CFS's currently located at the <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> by use of a dual-mixer system. The dual-mixer system achieves phase measurements between the high-performance CFS and the existing <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> CFS's to within 400 femtoseconds. Time transfer between USNO and a given <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> is achieved via a two way satellite time transfer modem. The computer at the <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> disciplines the CFS based on a comparison of one pulse per second sent from the master site at USNO. The <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> computer is also used to perform housekeeping functions, as well as recording the health status of all three CFS's. This information is sent to the USNO through the time transfer modem. Laboratory time synchronization results in the sub nanosecond range have been observed and the ability to maintain the <b>monitor</b> <b>station</b> CFS frequency to within 3. 0 x 10 (sup minus 14) of the master site at USNO...|$|R
40|$|The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the United States Air Force (USAF/AF) {{operate a}} {{worldwide}} network of GPS <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations.</b> The NGA and USAF <b>monitor</b> <b>stations</b> utilize high-performance cesium frequency standards (CFS) and geodetic quality GPS receivers. Products {{derived from the}} NGA <b>Monitor</b> <b>Station</b> Network (MSN) include the postprocessed GPS satellite ephemerides, and GPS broadcast ephemeris and clock parameters. The NGA <b>monitor</b> <b>stations</b> are unmanned and operate in non-laboratory environments. As such, the NGA <b>stations</b> must be <b>monitored</b> frequently to ensure data integrity. The <b>Monitor</b> <b>Station</b> Network Control Center in St. Louis <b>monitors</b> all NGA <b>stations</b> on a 24 / 7 basis. The USAF operates their stations in a similar manner, with the USAF GPS Operational Control Segment (OCS) at Schriever AFB incorporating data from ten NGA <b>monitor</b> <b>stations</b> in their Kalman filter process. This paper summarizes USAF and NGA MSN clock stability for 2007 and 2008, using the Kalman filter clock estimate data computed daily at NGA St. Louis. The clock stability of six USAF and ten NGA <b>monitor</b> <b>stations</b> is presented.

40|$|The ground <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) are {{regional}} {{distribution and}} the number of these stations is small. The more global ground stations cannot be built in the short term. The ground regional <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> are difficult to observe the global Medium Earth Orbit Satellite (MEO) continuously, which leads to low precision of orbits in BDS real-time broadcast ephemeris. Based on the above problems, in view of real time satellite GNSS data of low earth orbit satellite can effectively make up the lack of regional <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> in space overlay, a method is proposed that the GNSS receivers of LEO satellites used as high dynamic space-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> combining with the data of the ground <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> to calculate and forecast the MEO satellite orbits. The numeral results show that, using the data of seven regional <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> add 1 to 3 LEO satellites, the precision of the MEO orbit determination can be increased by about 21 %, 34 % and 55 % respectively. It also shows that, the ground regional <b>monitoring</b> <b>stations</b> combined with the data of LEO satellites can effectively improve the orbit precision of MEO satellite. It is suggested that using the data combined with ground stations and LEO satellites to improve the precision of broadcast ephemeris of MEO in BDS...|$|R

25|$|But geophysicists who {{analysed}} {{the seismic}} signals {{concluded that the}} initial sound recorded was triggered by an explosion and not a collision with another vessel.

When they compared the second event with the first, they concluded that the first event was also the explosion of a torpedo.
