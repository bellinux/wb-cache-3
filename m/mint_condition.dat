5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, toggles, and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in <b>mint</b> <b>condition)</b> have also been made.|$|E

40|$|In the Civic Museum of Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara a {{collection}} of 1104 coin striking tools is stored. Among these, five steel dies representative of {{the activity of the}} Mint of Ferrara from the 2 nd decade of the 17 th to half of the 18 th century have been chosen and studied. In that period, while important innovations in the coin minting technique were introduced in Europe, Ferrara declined from the rank of ducal mint to that of peripheral minting centre of the highly centralized Papal States. This research presents technical argumentations in order to both properly place the activity of the Papal Mint of Ferrara in the international scenery and to promote greater attention to the local coinage systems, as up to now only scarce attention has been devoted to the metallurgy of coinage tools. The metallic alloys used in the dies have been characterized by metallographic and microhardness analyses. The results suggest that the minting dies have been produced by a manual smithing technique consisting in hammer hot forging, followed by punching and chiseling operations, necessary to produce the coinage type, in negative form. Proper final thermal treatments have mainly induced a martensitic microstructure on the coinage head, where high hardness values (from 918 to 1009 HV 0. 3) guarantee optimal <b>minting</b> <b>conditions,</b> and a ferritic/pearlitic microstructure in the other end, the side subjected to hammer strokes, where a good toughness is ensured in order to delay cracks and fracture...|$|R

The production got two GMC M211 military trucks, first deployed in 1952 during the Korean War as transport trucks.

Their Flyte Tyme Productions began to gain national attention, and excelled at mainstream urban contemporary music, which had often been shunned by critics.

25|$|Far {{ahead of}} the 1955 doubled die cent in rarity, the 1943 copper cent {{is one of the}} notable rarities of the Lincoln cent series. An {{estimated}} 40 examples are believed to have been struck, with 12 confirmed to exist. The error occurred when copper planchets were left in the press hopper and press machines during the changeover from copper to steel blanks. Examples were discovered after the War, with the first two in 1947, and another in 1958. An example was first sold in 1958 for $40,000; one <b>mint</b> <b>condition</b> specimen sold for over $200,000 in 2004. Many people have counterfeited the coin by either copper-plating normal 1943 cents (sometimes as novelties with no intent to defraud), or altering cents from the period, usually 1945-, 1948-, or 1949-dated coins.|$|E

25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual quantity issued remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in <b>mint</b> <b>condition,</b> which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E

50|$|Pafko {{is known}} for being card #1 in the 1952 Topps {{baseball}} card set. This card in near <b>mint</b> or better <b>condition</b> is often worth thousands of dollars because most collectors back in 1952 simply put the cards in numerical order and rubber banded the stack. This causes the top card (Pafko) to receive the most wear and tear and thus top grade copies are very rare and valuable. One of Pafko's 1952 cards sold for $84,000 in 1998.

50|$|The Bank of New York Hoard is {{the name}} given to {{identify}} {{a treasure trove of}} several thousand Fugio Cents that were discovered at the bank. Sometime in 1788, a keg of Fugio cents were acquired by the bank and stored in the basement. The coins were forgotten about until they were rediscovered in 1856, this time at the banks current location. At that time the coins were placed in cotton bags and put away until a final rediscovery of the coins was made in 1926. The coins were then given out as souvenirs and keepsakes to clients until 1948 when the American Numismatic Society examined the remaining 1,641 coins. Several of the coins were donated to the society while others were sold to collectors. All of the coins found were in <b>mint</b> state <b>condition,</b> most with brown toning.

Oftentimes the outer box {{was used as the}} store display box which explains the lack of a price on many of the price stickers that are found on a majority of surviving boxes. Due to the nature of game rentals, the cartridges were sometimes cracked or damaged physically over their rental lifespan, while the manuals often went home with the first person to rent the game and were returned damaged, destroyed, or not returned at all. Also, some Blockbuster store employees would discard the boxes and manuals when the games were put out for rental per the store manager or other policy. As with many other Nintendo 64 Blockbuster rental exclusive games, these conditions resulted in a very rare game to find in <b>mint,</b> complete <b>condition.</b> [...] These rarity ratings place a complete copy of Stunt Racer 64, including cartridge, box, and manual, {{near the top of the}} list of Rarest Nintendo 64 games.|$|R

500|$|Along with acts such as <b>Mint</b> <b>Condition</b> and R. Kelly, Tony! Toni! Toné! played live {{instruments}} that complemented their hip hop sensibilities. Their concerts featured visual {{elements such as}} incense smoke and kaleidoscopic stage lighting, the group's eccentric wardrobe, and additional instrumentalists, including another guitarist, two drummers, two keyboardists, a violinist, a trumpeter, and a saxophonist. The Charlotte Observer remarked on the group in 1994: [...] "heir use of live instruments on record and onstage makes them an anomaly in the synthesized and sampled world of modern R" [...] With the group's reliance on traditional soul and R values of songwriting and instrumentation, Sons of Soul was a precursor to the neo soul movement of the 1990s. Matt Weitz of The Dallas Morning News wrote in 1993 that the group had distinguished themselves from their New jack swing contemporaries with Sons of Soul and found them aesthetically akin to acts such as Prince and P.M.

In November 1993, the group joined singer Janet Jackson's high-profile Janet. World Tour as a supporting act. However, after a few performances, the band left in January 1994, expressing frustration over their limited time onstage and Jackson's frequent show cancellations.
