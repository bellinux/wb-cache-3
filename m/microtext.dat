To take changes over time into account, we develop a novel time series analysis approach that fi rst derives word frequency time series from sets of tweets and then performs local regression to predict time-to-event from nearest-neighbor time series. We train and test on a single type of event, Dutch premier league football matches. Our results indicate that in an 'early' stage, four days or more before the event, the time series analysis produces time-to-event predictions that are about one day off; closer to the event, local regression attains a similar accuracy.

40|$|To avoid {{a sarcastic}} message being {{understood}} in its unintended literal meaning, in <b>microtexts</b> such as messages on Twitter. com sarcasm is often explicitly {{marked with a}} hashtag such as ‘#sarcasm’. We collected a training corpus of about 406 thousand Dutch tweets with hashtag synonyms denoting sarcasm. Assuming that the human labeling is correct (annotation of a sample indicates that about 90 % of these tweets are indeed sarcastic), we train a machine learning classifier on the harvested examples, {{and apply it to}} a sample of a day’s stream of 2. 25 million Dutch tweets. Of the 353 explicitly marked tweets on this day, we detect 309 (87 %) with the hashtag removed. We annotate the top of the ranked list of tweets most likely to be sarcastic that do not have the explicit hashtag. 35 % of the top- 250 ranked tweets are indeed sarcastic. Analysis indicates that the use of hashtags reduces the further use of linguistic markers for signaling sarcasm, such as exclamations and intensifiers. We hypothesize that explicit markers such as hashtags are the digital extralinguistic equivalent of non-verbal expressions that people employ in live interaction when conveying sarcasm. Checking the consistency of our finding in a language from another language family, we observe that in French the hashtag ‘#sarcasme’ has a similar polarity switching function, be it to a lesser extent...|$|R

Compared to other short forms (proverbs, riddles), phrases are generally characterised as being shorter.

Therefore, a phrase can only exist as a set expression in a context. Conceptualising phraseologisms, however, prompts the question of the ‘obligatory’ and ‘facultative’ constituents of a phraseologism, i. e. the issue of its form and, more importantly, of its defining. While discussing the motivation of phrasal expressions, scholars often refer to their opacity vs. transparency. But what would the ideal form be for which people possess sufficient background knowledge, including phraseological competence, which is required for understanding a given expression? What is the smallest number ofwords necessary for understanding an expression? Whether and to which extent can we find help in metalanguage framing a set phrase?

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Liturgics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. In {{this study}} {{it is assumed}} from a central {{theoretical}} argument that the Bible based, scripturally true liturgical song, possesses an exceptional bonding structure. The set literary archetypes of the dramatic, epic and lyric - or the dramatical, epical and lyrical - are woven together to form the canvas for the hymnical praise of the worshipping community. The aim {{of the study is}} to dissect the relationship in which the archetypes stand to one another and to establish which trans–generical phenomena and movements can be detected in order to determine what their meaning is for liturgical songwriting. This is done on the basis of an analysis of the Book of Revelation, specifically pertaining to the hymnographical corpus in the book. To do this the most obvious meta–theory of this study is the literary theory, while the basis, principles and guidelines of the hymnographical basistheory are determined by theological biblical science. In the first main chapter (meta–theory) of the study the questions of what literature is and whether the Bible is literature, are explored and answered. The conclusion to this is that the Bible is true literature and that this religious script plays a central, unique and prominent role in the progression of the christian–western cultural world. In the process of determining the different approaches to the study of literature, note was taken of the various theoretical assumptions and theories and of the influence that each has and can have on theological biblical scientifical research. In the second main part (inter–disciplinary theoretical aspects) the investigation proceeds from the study of meta–theoretical literary terrain identification to the determining of the connection, link, sym–biosis and synergy between the literary meta–theory and the theological basistheory of this study. Shared and partly overlapping study terrains of the literary sciences and the bibilical sciences are explored. This leads to the demarcation of both an inter–disciplinary and multisubdisciplinary field of study, for which an approach and a method to further explore had to be developed. In the third main part (basistheory) the perspectives gained in the first two parts are unlocked to the advantage of the biblical scientifical study of Revelation. The last book of the Bible is analysed macro–structurally by means of a narratological reading and accompanied by a cursory–exegetic explanation, after which the meaning of the corpus of hymnical <b>microtexts</b> in their context within the macro–structure are further unlocked by means of detailed exegesis. In this way basis–theoretical hymnographical priniciples in Revelation can be identified. These are integrated in the fourth and last main part and are then concretised, using a song as example, in guidelines for hymnography. In this final main part (the outcome of the study) the investigation reaches its set aims as well as the overall goal in that it could be verified that the canvas of the liturgical song should be integrated successfully not only wordperfect, but also Wordperfect in all its facets through literary quality and biblical–principled motivation. This should allow the flame (= liturgical song) of the sacrifice of thanksgiving (= worship) to burn brightly in a time of diverse positions on church song. Doctora...|$|R
