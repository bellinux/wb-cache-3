Vessel running on LNG as an alternative fuel is today discussed extensively within the Swedish Maritime forum where emissions of NOx, sulfur and particles are less recipients than in heavy fuel oil (HFO). One of todays problems with a LNG distribution in Sweden are that the infrastructure is incomplete and outdated. This report has been built upon qualitative interviews with important actors within the Swedish maritime forum and also what impedes the development of the LNG’s infrastructure. The outcome of the interviews showed that the development has been slowed down because none within the Swedish martime forum have dared to take the first step. The ports does not want to develop terminals when there is no market demand and the shipping companies does not want to build vessel that runs on LNG when there is no market for distribution. Swedish governments involvement has been very weak, almost non-existing. There are also gaps in the Swedish regulations and restrictions of LNG cargo handling. This is aslo one of the factors that the development of LNG has been impeded. ...|$|E

In order to alleviate the sports economists ignorance about international specialisation in sports goods trade, we started to build up an entirely new dataset based on extracting data available in Comtrade (the UN word trade data basis) at the most disaggregated level (6 digits). After resolving a number of classification and statistical tricks, we have built up a country and sports goods dataset (41 countries, 36 goods), which gathers 94 - 96 % of sports goods global trade every sampled year (1994, 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2004).

40|$|The {{exhaustion}} {{doctrine in}} {{intellectual property law}} generally limits the rights of a patent, copyright or trademark owner (IP Owner) to control the disposition of an article after the article has been sold by or {{under the authority of}} the IP Owner. In theory the doctrine enables the IP Owner to receive fair reward for surrendering its right to withhold a product from the market but thereafter permits free disposition and movement of chattels, preventing IP rights from unduly disrupting distribution systems. Under a strict territorial application of the doctrine, a sale in country A under a country A patent (or copyright or trademark) would exhaust the IP Owners rights only in Country A, and the IP Owner could rely on its separate patents in other countries to enjoin sales, seek damages or possibly even require customs officials to halt infringing imports at the border. This principle would hold even though the IP rights in all the countries are essentially the same. A strict territorial exhaustion doctrine is arguably consistent with the nature of IP rights, which are granted by each individual nation as an act of sovereignty and are strictly territorial in effect; while its impact will vary with other trade conditions (relative exchange rates, for example) and across different categories of goods, a strict territorial approach can serve as a barrier to free movement of goods and cause IP rights to act as private trade barriers. Opposed to the territorial principle is the historically more widely applied principle of international exhaustion. Under this version of the doctrine a sale by or under the authority of an IP Owner anywhere exhausts its right under all counterpart IP anywhere in the world. This doctrine has always seemed difficult to reconcile with the underlying systems of national IP rights but avoids the practical problems and trade barriers of a territorial principle. Court decisions {{in the last few years}} in three <b>major</b> <b>trading</b> <b>areas</b> [...] the EU, Japan and the US have rejected a strict international application of the exhaustion doctrine for some forms of IP, with the result that sales of some products by an IP Owner outside Country or trading region A do not necessarily prevent the owner from using Country A IP rights to prevent imports or sales there. This is an issue which the <b>major</b> international <b>trade</b> treaties leave to individual signatories local law. Subject to possible limits imposed by competition laws in what will probably be relatively rare cases, IP Owners in these three <b>major</b> <b>trading</b> <b>areas</b> may, with greater or lesser effort, now restrict parallel trade and discriminate in sale of some goods between markets with different levels of pricing. These recent decisions, while suggesting some degree of convergence among the three <b>trading</b> <b>areas,</b> do not necessarily correlate closely with the notion suggested by Guzman* (in connection with competition laws) that such legal regimes should be supported by net exporting nations, not net importers. It is possible that as the implications of these decisions become clearer and their possible effects more evident, they will eventually lead to further consideration and possibly further international trade negotiations on the subject of parallel imports. ...|$|R

Among the stated objectives of this plan is the desire for a clearer and more coherent city centre. A main strategy of the plan is a waterfront promenade that will extend along the entire city centre and over to Svinøya {{where much of the}} old fishing village history is preserved, and {{all the way out to}} the pier and Fiskarkona wishing fishermen luck on their journey and welcoming them home. The importance of a coherent urban structure is particularly evident in a small town like Svolvær when looking closely at how features are moved and changed over the past three decades. The development from a dense city centre with one main street with small shops along it to a divided city with <b>major</b> <b>trading</b> <b>areas</b> in the west and mainly dining and cultural activities in the east have gone relatively quickly, and there is now a desire to stop this process. The aim of this thesis exercise is to arrive at a strategy, which is based on the planned waterfront promenade and responds to the objectives of linking the city centre closer together while safeguarding the existing qualities. Through the analysis section I’ve uncovered a number of qualities, opportunities and challenges. These are important to pay attention to, strengthen and find solutions for in the further urban development. Among the city’s qualities, we find the great location within the landscape and the good connections to the rest of the region. The challenges include major structural changes, lack of connections and a high degree of division of functions in the city centre. A discussion of how the city’s constructional elements are represented in Svolvær is followed by an evaluation of different strategic approaches to the waterfront promenade. Finally, the threads are gathered in a proposal for an overall strategy that will contribute to achieving the goals of a united and clear city centre. Vågan kommuneM-L...|$|R

In order to alleviate the sports economics ignorance in this area, an entirely new dataset is built up by extracting Comtrade data at the most disaggregated level (6 digits). The dataset covers 41 countries, 36 different sports goods, and 94 - 96 % of global sports goods trade (1994 - 2004). The country sample is divided into five regional areas: North American Free <b>Trade</b> <b>Area</b> (NAFTA), EU + Switzerland, Eastern Europe, Asia and other emerging countries. A detailed snapshot of global trade in sports goods and its distribution by major areas, countries and products provides first empirical evidence about how much industrialisation in emerging countries and de-industrialisation in developed market economies have affected international specialisation, and indirectly tests multinational companies outsourcing and production relocation strategies in low unit cost countries in the sports goods industry. Then, studying export/import ratios and country's position in the global market, it appears that <b>major</b> <b>trading</b> <b>areas</b> are Asia, Europe and NAFTA. Major exporters are China, Hong Kong, the USA and France, and major importers are the USA, Japan, Germany, France, the UK and Italy. The biggest market shares are in sportswear, anoraks and gymnastic equipment trade. Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries have an excess balance in sports goods trade, whereas NAFTA and Europe are in deficit. Three indexes assess a country's comparative advantages and disadvantages and competitiveness, and describe international specialisation. NAFTA and Europe are specialised in equipment-intensive sports goods, while Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries are specialised in trite sports goods and some less equipment-intensive sports goods. NAFTA is not competitive in any sport good, Europe is competitive in skis, emerging countries and Eastern Europe in sportswear and anoraks, and Asia in sportswear, anoraks, rackets, balls, skates and gymnastic equipment. Such an international specialisation pattern fits with both assumptions of industrialisation/de-industrialisation and firms outsourcing strategies. A principal component analysis with hierarchical ascendant classification groups trite sports goods as opposed to intensive-equipment sports goods in global trade and shows that production relocation influences international <b>trade</b> specialisation. <b>Major</b> policy implications are that developed economies and multinational companies should continue investing in R&D in order to keep their comparative advantages in equipment-intensive sports goods, while Asian and emerging countries should more tightly supervise working conditions and child labour in their subcontracting producers that work for foreign multinational companies...|$|R

These firms may constitute both business models that reduce the cost of operating a business and effective community development models that forge cooperation among local government and communities. However, limited information is available about how these non-agricultural cooperatives operate, how they were formed, or what are their problems or difficulties as non-traditional cooperatives. This study of 162 randomly selected non-agricultural cooperatives across the United States attempts to answer these questions and finds that even this small sample of non-agricultural cooperatives played an important role in various sectors of the nation's economy (e. g., retail), serving slightly less than half a million members in 1996. Most of these non-agricultural cooperatives had been in business for over 30 years, showing their tenacity in today's highly competitive world. Most of these cooperatives were professionally managed. While raising equity was the most difficult problem during their formation stage, competition in their <b>major</b> market (<b>trade)</b> <b>area</b> was the most difficult current problem. The problem of balancing the interests of cooperative members was a major problem for these non-agricultural cooperatives.

40|$|One issue {{dominating}} recent {{discussions on}} free <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> and other minilateral associations (preferential trade arrangements) is whether such arrangements will detract from further multilateral trade liberalization on a most-favored-nation basis. But {{for much of}} this debate empirical information has been lacking on: the global importance of minilateral arrangements that have been, or are being, concluded; the relative size of other <b>major</b> bilateral <b>trade</b> flows not affected by minilateral arrangements, and their suitability for such arrangements; the global importance of Europe in this process; the possibility that other sorts of arrangements - such as managed trade initiatives (arrangements specifying quantitative trade targets) - are a more likely threat as far as trade flows not presently covered by free <b>trade</b> <b>area</b> arrangements are concerned. The authors argue that this lack of relevant data has led to several misconceptions about the movement toward minilateralism. In particular, their statistics suggest that fears about how the further spread of free <b>trade</b> <b>areas</b> will affect world trade volumes may be exaggerated - while the dangers of these blocks becoming hostile to each other may have been underestimated. Using data recently compiled by the United Nations, the authors show that the global importance of minilateral arrangements is now far greater than is often recognized. Almost half of world trade is affected by these arrangements. But <b>major</b> <b>trade</b> flows not covered by minilateral arrangements are dominated by important country-specific problems. In particular, problems relating to high-technology trade between Asian newly industrialized countries (NICs), Japan, and the United States, as well as between Asian NICs, Japan, and Western Europe, are sufficiently important to hinder the formation of additional free <b>trade</b> <b>areas.</b> This suggests that fears about the spread of such arrangements may have been exaggerated. The authors'tabulations and analysis of the discriminatory trade barriers applied to these flows indicate that managed trade is a far more likely outcome.
