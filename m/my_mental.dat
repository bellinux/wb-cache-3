By the end of the decade, he forgot his own name at times and, when anyone asked how he felt, he responded, [...] "Quite well; I have lost <b>my</b> <b>mental</b> faculties, but am perfectly well".|$|E

[...] (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, Saharon Shelah wrote that he does [...] "not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. <b>My</b> <b>mental</b> picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC."

2500|$|During his internment, Zerai {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} prove his mental sanity, but he failed to convince the Italian doctors. He also wrote letters to his family: on December 3, 1938, Zerai stated he was in good health and asked his brother Tesfazien Deres to reject the honorary title that Tesfazien had received from the Italian government. He wrote, [...] "I'm fine. Always have been, and still am, in full possession of <b>my</b> <b>mental</b> faculties. I am in the Asylum only on account of government policy."

40|$|Self-consciousness is {{the source}} or set of {{information}} about our own present <b>mental</b> states. <b>My</b> self-knowledge is the set of all my information about myself, not only about <b>my</b> present <b>mental</b> states, but also <b>my</b> past <b>mental</b> states, <b>my</b> personality, my body or even my unconsciousness. Many philosophers thought that self-consciousness data are certain knowledge (Brentano, Husserl, Ingarden) but many contemporary philosophers claim that the first-person knowledge does not exist (Wittgenstein, Ryle, Dennett). Davidson refutes both behaviorism and subjectivity myth and takes some moderate position: first-person knowledge is dependent on third-person knowledge but third-person knowledge is dependent on first-person knowledge. There are some problems to reduce consciousness to physical states and to know about it. So, first-person knowledge is not certain and autonomous but it does exist and play important role. The two interdependent kinds of knowledge are two pillars of human knowledge. According to Davidson {{there is also some}} third pillar and it is the second-person knowledge...|$|R

2500|$|La Mousmé {{also known}} as La Mousmé, Sitting in a Cane Chair, Half-Figure (with a branch of oleander) was painted Van Gogh in 1888 while living in Arles, which Van Gogh dubbed [...] "the Japan of the south". [...] Retreating from the city, he hoped that his time in Arles would evoke in his work the simple, yet {{dramatic}} expression of Japanese art. [...] Inspired by Pierre Loti's novel Madame Chrysanthème and Japanese artwork, Vincent painted La [...] Mousmé, a well-dressed Japanese girl. [...] He {{wrote in a letter}} to his brother: [...] "It took me a whole week...but I had to reserve <b>my</b> <b>mental</b> energy to do the mousmé well.

Vasily Avseenko, describing Pisemsky's visit to Saint Petersburg in 1869 after the publication of People of the Forties, recalled how old and tired he looked. [...] "I am beginning to feel like a victim of my own spleen," [...] Pisemsky confessed in an August 1875 letter to Annenkov. [...] "I am all right physically, but cannot say the same of <b>my</b> <b>mental</b> and moral state; hypochondria torments me. I am unable to write and any mental effort makes me feel sick. Thank God the religious feeling, which is now blossoming in me, gives some respite to my suffering soul," [...] Pisemsky wrote to Turgenev in the early 1870s.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to [...] "Facing Facts About Race", the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates accused Hanson {{of racism and}} stupidity. Referring to Hanson's [...] "Talk", Coates wrote: [...] "Let us be direct—in any other context we would automatically recognize this [...] "talk" [...] as stupid advice. If I were {{to tell you that}} I only employ Asian-Americans to do my taxes because [...] "Asian-Americans do better on the Math SAT," [...] you would not simply question my sensitivity, but <b>my</b> <b>mental</b> faculties. That is because you would understand that in making an individual decision, employing an ancestral class of millions is not very intelligent. Moreover, were I to tell you I wanted my son to marry a Jewish woman because [...] "Jews are really successful," [...] you would understand that statement for the stupidity which it is...There is no difference between my argument above and the notion that black boys should be avoided because they are overrepresented in the violent crime stats. But one of the effects of racism is its tendency to justify stupidity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Benaderet befriended Paul Henning, a {{scriptwriter}} {{on the radio}} production of Burns & Allen. She appeared on nineteen episodes of the show that he had written between 1947 and 1951, {{and became one of}} his regular television players with the first two seasons of Burns & Allen, a two-episode guest appearance as Blanche Morton on The Bob Cummings Show in 1956-57, and then her involvement in three of the most successful sitcoms of the 1960s. After reading the 1961 first script for The Beverly Hillbillies, Benaderet wanted to audition for the role of Granny. Despite considering her to be too buxom for his vision of the character as a small and wiry woman, Henning allowed her to test anyway. Irene Ryan would win the part; according to Henning, [...] "Bea {{took one look at the}} way Irene did the part and said to me, 'There's your Granny!'" [...] He additionally took Benaderet's suggestion of casting Harriet MacGibbon as Granny's rival Margaret Drysdale. Henning created for Benaderet the supporting character of Cousin Pearl Bodine, the middle-aged widowed mother of Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) and cousin of main character Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), whom she convinces to move from his humble home in the Ozarks after he strikes oil on his property and becomes a millionaire. Prior to shooting the pilot, Benaderet enlisted a dialect coach to help her learn a hillbilly accent. Impressed with her performance while screening the pilot to potential sponsors, Henning made Cousin Pearl a recurring character in the 1962-63 first season as she moved into the Clampetts' Beverly Hills mansion, feuded with Granny, and pursued oil tycoon Mr. Brewster (Frank Wilcox) as a love interest. Bluegrass duo Flatt & Scruggs, who performed the show's opening theme, recorded a comedic serenade in 1963 titled [...] "Pearl Pearl Pearl", and Benaderet was pictured with the duo on the single's cover. Benaderet described Pearl's curly hair as [...] "just <b>my</b> <b>mental</b> image of the character. ... Pearl played the piano for the silent movies and she saw such high fashion and ridiculous hairdos. She could read and write, and the curled hair seemed to Pearl the height of smartness." [...] Her performance as Pearl was well received; author Stephen Cox wrote in his 1993 book The Beverly Hillbillies: From the Small Screen to the Big Screen: [...] "When The Beverly Hillbillies first aired, it started to become 'The Bea Benaderet Show.' Every scene that had Cousin Pearl in it was just about stolen by the actress." ...|$|E

40|$|Many {{people around}} the world -even if they are not {{healthcare}} professionals - know of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and her work, On Death and Dying. The five stages of dealing with death that she identified, namely, denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, are especially well known. Working as a nurse, I often had doubts and encountered dilemmas in dealing with patients and their families. As a result, I began to read and reread the works of Kubler-Ross, which later became the major basis for the theory on the five stages of death. I have gained a variety of insights from the conversations she had with patients, and the ways her patients experienced those stages. I have learned many lessons by incorporating her views into my nursing experiences and by reflecting on <b>my</b> own <b>mental</b> tendencies, words and actions. In this paper, I will share four case studies and describe <b>my</b> own <b>mental</b> transformations in order to exemplify some of the lessons I have learned from the insights of Kubler-Ross. I will then show how a healthcare professional's sincere dialogue with books can become an important opportunity to reflect on one's own perspectives and values...|$|R
