30|$|NERC’s {{real-time}} tools best practices task force (RTBPTF) and NASPI’s PARTF impose requirements to ensure synchrophasor data quality [42, 109]. Data quality can be contextualized in different ways, {{depending on the}} needs of the concerned domain. For instance, data quality requirements of a smart <b>meter</b> <b>recording</b> energy consumption might differ from those of a net meter at a solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant. NASPI contextualizes synchrophasor data quality to determine “fitness of use” in terms of accuracy and lineage for static data points; lineage, completeness and logical consistency for static datasets; and availability, timeliness and origination for streams of data points [42].|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{small-scale}} {{study was}} to measure, analyse and compare levels of acoustic noise, in a nine-bedded general intensive care unit (ICU). Measurements were undertaken using the Norsonic 116 sound level <b>meter</b> <b>recording</b> noise levels in the internationally agreed ‘A’ weighted scale. Noise level data were obtained and recorded at 5 min over 3 consecutive days. Results of noise level analysis indicated that mean noise levels within this clinical area was 56 · 42 dB(A), with acute spikes reaching 80 dB(A). The quietest noise level attained was that of 50 dB(A) during sporadic intervals throughout the 24 -h period. Parametric testing using analysis of variance found a positive relationship (p ≤ 0 · 001) between the nursing shifts and {{the day of the}} week. However, Scheffe multiple range testing showed significant differences between the morning shift, and the afternoon and night shifts combined (p ≤ 0 · 05). There was no statistical difference between the afternoon and night shifts (p ≥ 0 · 05). While {{the results of this study}} may seem self-evident in many respects, what it has highlighted is that the problem of excessive noise exposure within the ICU continues to go unabated. More concerning is that the prolonged effects of excessive noise exposure on patients and staff alike can have deleterious effect on the health and well-being of these individuals. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{information}} about the intrinsic frequency of internal inertial gravity waves, together with their vector wavenumber and their steepness spectrum, may be derived using data from a <b>meter</b> <b>recording</b> current and temperature just above a uniform sloping boundary. The analysis assumes that, over the periods of time in which estimates are made, the local mean buoyancy frequency, N, and temperature gradient are uniform, and the bottom slope, ?, is constant over {{the scale of the}} observed waves and is known. It is further assumed that, during short periods of analysis, the internal wave field is dominated by waves having a single wavenumber vector at each frequency. Measurements of the temperature and up-slope current spectra can be used to determine the intrinsic frequency and the along-slope wavenumber, l, of the waves provided the mean along-slope current, V, is non-zero. If the internal wave field near the sloping boundary is composed of perfectly reflecting wave rays, it is found that the ratio, R, of the potential energy density of the waves of given frequency to that of their kinetic energy depends on ? and on the ratio, l/k, of waves in the reflecting wave field, where k is the up-slope wavenumber. Since l is already determined if V ? 0, k may be estimated from the measured R. The third component of wavenumber, m, normal to the slope is found from the dispersion relation. The estimated values may be used to test assumptions of small wave steepness and the uniformity of buoyancy frequency over the vertical scale of the waves. Problems of application are revealed by using the analysis on data collected from a mooring located within the hyperlimnion on the sloping side of Lake Geneva. Whilst the along-slope wavenumbers and corresponding intrinsic frequencies can be found, it proves impossible to derive estimates of wave directions for waves in the subcritical frequency range of group velocities having angles to the horizontal, ?, less than ?, and supercritical waves (? > ?) have inferred wavelength which violate assumptions of the vertical uniformity of N. It is inferred that in the lake the wave propagation is dominated by waves with a modal structure rather than rays, even near the buoyancy frequency. The methodology should however be applicable in the deep ocean, subject to the various assumptions which are made. Fundamental questions are raised about the directional characteristics and persistence of internal waves near sloping boundaries which deserve further investigation in view of their possible relation to mixing...|$|E
