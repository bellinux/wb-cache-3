40|$|Welding {{thin sheet}} metal with high power diode lasers closes the feed rate gap between {{conventional}} techniques like TIG-or plasma-welding and CO(sub 2) -or Nd:YAG-laser welding. Because {{of its size}} a high power diode laser can be integrated in common <b>mobile</b> linear <b>welding</b> devices. The weld seams are narrower comparing to TIG-welding, even with filler wire. Deep penetration welding with filler wire is performed with a lower heat input if a high power diode laser is used. That minimizes distortion and refinishing. Some applications for mobile use of high power diode lasers are presented. Heat treatment of conventional or laser beam welded carbon steel or TRIP-steel sheets is used to avoid cracking. High power diode lasers are well suited for that task. Surface temperature controlled post heat treatment of crack sensitive welds {{is presented in the}} paper...|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{remaining}} track was still in place, but in very poor condition, and some sections had been removed, particularly at Kilbagie and near Blackgrange level crossing, so track laying was accomplished by conventional construction machinery such as bulldozers and excavators, rather than the rail-based equipment normally used for routine track replacement. Rail arrived by road in 60 foot lengths, was dragged from the nearest access point to its final position, and was then joined into continuous lengths by a <b>mobile</b> flash butt <b>welding</b> machine. This is a slow process compared to normal track renewal.|$|R
40|$|Automated {{equipment}} {{is used for}} the ship fabrication process to obtain its higher productivity. However, in the final assembly stage of ship structures, automatic welding system has some constraints on application because of angled and curved surfaces. In order to overcome these constraints, wall climbing mechanism which has mobility and strong adhesion force is necessary. This paper presents an autonomous mobile platform designed for climbing on ferrous 3 -D surfaces with welding head. The switchable permanent magnets are used for adhesion, which are capable of adjusting a maximum adhesion force if a variation in the magnetic field strength is required. The mechanism of mobile platform has identical twin bodies, link, flexible rail and sensing devices.

40|$|A three-linked {{manipulator}} {{mounted on}} a two-wheeled mobile platform is used to weld a long curved welding path. A welding torch mounted {{at the end of}} a manipulator of the <b>welding</b> <b>mobile</b> manipulator (WMM) must be controlled for tracking a welding path with constant velocity and constant welding angle of torch. In this paper, a decentralized control method is applied to control the WMM considered as two separate subsystems such as a mobile platform and a manipulator. Two decentralized motion controllers are designed to control two subsystems of WMM, respectively. Firstly, based on a tracking error vector of the manipulator and a feedback motion of the mobile platform, a kinematic controller is designed for manipulator. Secondly, based on an another tracking error vector of the mobile platform and a feedback angular velocities of revolution joints of three-link, a sliding mode controller is designed for the mobile platform. These controllers are obtained based on the Lyapunov's function and its stability condition to ensure for the tracking error vectors to be asymptotically stable. Furthermore, simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the control}} of a mobile {{manipulator}} for tracking smooth 3 D-curved welding trajectory is discussed. This case {{can be found in}} any metal processing factories such as ship building factories and pre-fabricated metal structure factories. The mobile manipulator is made up of a multilink manipulator and a two-wheeled mobile platform. The kinematic modeling and the constraints for both the platform and the manipulator are discussed. Based on these modeling, an adaptive control algorithm for the <b>welding</b> <b>mobile</b> manipulator is proposed. A candidate Lyapunov function is also introduced for proving the stability of system upon the adaptive algorithm. For increasing the flexibility of system, {{the control of}} system with unknown parameter such as the arc length of the torch is considered, and an update control law based on the adaptive back-stepping method is proposed. In this paper, the numerical simulation results are shown to illustrate the validity of the proposed algorithm. The experiments are also performed for getting the good values of parameters and proving the feasibility that a mobile manipulator is applied to a 3 D smooth curve welding task...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The ongoing need {{to reduce}} the weight of {{products}} while increasing strength has resulted in new generation steel manufacturing using special heat treatments to produce High Strength Steels (HSS) and Ultra High Strength Steels (UHSS) with up to 1700 MPa tensile strength. The high strength level of these steels {{makes it possible to}} produce structures with a considerable weight and cost reduction, and such steels have been adopted in the automotive industry and for <b>mobile</b> heavy equipment. <b>Welding</b> of UHSS is, however, not without its complications and welding processes for these steels need careful attention. For instance, their high susceptibility to cracking and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) softening are risks that need to be borne in mind when choosing welding parameters. This research work discusses the difficulties and challenges of successful welding of UHSS. Common welding methods used in welding of UHSS are briefly reviewed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the effects of different welding parameters and methods. The paper finds that UHSS can be satisfactorily welded with laser welding, electron beam welding, resistance welding, and conventional arc welding methods, but the quality of the weld is dependent on appropriate control of several parameters and variables of the welding processes...|$|R
