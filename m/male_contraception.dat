40|$|Background: Many {{young men}} {{continue}} {{to disregard the}} importance of contraception and family planning in South Africa. The fact that even university students also do not take contraception and family planning seriously poses {{a serious threat to}} their own health and well-being. Aim: This paper aims at investigating the attitudes of <b>male</b> students towards <b>contraception</b> and the promotion of female students’ sexual health rights and well-being at the University of Venda. Methods: Quantitative research method is used to determine how attitudes of 60 <b>male</b> students towards <b>contraception</b> can jeopardise {{the health and well-being of}} both male and female students. Results: This study reveals that the majority of 60 male students at the University of Venda have a negative attitude towards contraceptives. As a result, male students at the University of Venda are not keen on using contraceptives. Male students’ negative attitude and lack of interest in contraceptives and family planning also limit progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals on primary health care, especially with regard to sexual and reproductive health and well-being of female students at the University of Venda. Conclusion: The fact that more than half of the male students interviewed did not take contraception and family planning seriously poses a serious threat to health and well-being of students, including violation of female students’ sexual and reproductive health rights in South Africa. This calls for radical health promotion and sexual and reproductive rights programmes which should specifically target male students at the University of Venda. </p...|$|R
40|$|Acyline {{is a novel}} GnRH {{antagonist}} {{found in}} animal studies to be a potent suppressor of circulating gonadotropin and testosterone (T) levels. We conducted the first study of acyline administration to humans. Eight healthy, eugonadal young men were administered a series of acyline injections (0, 2. 5, 7. 5, 25, and 75 microg/kg), each injection separated by at least 10 d. Serum FSH, LH, and T levels were measured for 7 d after injections. Acyline suppressed FSH, LH, and T levels in a dose-dependent fashion. Maximal suppression occurred after injection of 75 microg/kg acyline, which suppressed FSH to 46. 9 +/- 2. 5 %, LH to 12. 4 +/- 2. 2 %, and T to 13. 4 +/- 1. 4 % of baseline levels, maintaining suppression for over 48 h. Serum acyline levels peaked at 1 h at 18. 9 +/- 0. 9 ng/ml, remained significantly elevated above background 7 d after injection, and returned to background levels by 14 - 17 d after injection. Side-effects {{at the site of}} injection were limited to infrequent blush and pruritus that resolved within 90 min of injection. Higher doses of acyline might be effective as depot injections for long-lasting gonadotropin suppression in hormone-dependent diseases and for use in <b>male</b> hormonal <b>contraception</b> regimens. ...|$|R
40|$|Brian T Nguyen Section of Family Planning and Contraceptive Research, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA Abstract: In the US, {{the primary}} {{providers}} of vasectomy are specialists who seldom introduce {{the idea of}} vasectomy to patients. Patients often come to the decision to have a vasectomy {{on their own or}} at the referral of their primary care provider (PCP). As patients rely on their PCPs for accurate information and referrals for treatment, the ability of PCPs to counsel their patients on the most appropriate methods of permanent contraception is essential. PCPs should know that vasectomy is simpler, faster, safer, cheaper, and at least equally effective as female sterilization. However, barriers to acceptability still exist, and male patients may have concerns and biases that PCPs need to be ready to address, ranging from anxieties about pain and sexual function post-procedure to the potential for regret and the development of certain cancers. This article provides an up-to-date review of the evidence on those aspects of vasectomy and may serve as a resource for providers to address patient concerns, and thus increase patient knowledge and uptake.

This report describes a study of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and testosterone undecanoate (TU) injected at 8 -wk intervals for suppression of spermatogenesis in healthy Chinese men. After screening, 30 healthy volunteers were enrolled and {{randomly assigned to one}} of three dose groups (n = 10 /group) : 1000 mg TU (group A); 1000 mg TU plus 150 mg DMPA (group B); 1000 mg TU plus 300 mg DMPA (group C). All doses were given as im injections at 8 -wk intervals. The study consisted of an 8 -wk control (baseline) period, a 24 -wk treatment period, and a 24 -wk recovery period. Consistent azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia was achieved and maintained in all volunteers during the treatment period, except for two men in the TU-alone group who experienced a rebound in sperm concentrations. An 8 -wk regimen of TU plus DMPA at both tested combination doses effectively suppressed spermatogenesis to azoospermia in Chinese men. All volunteers tolerated the injections; no serious adverse effects were reported. The lower-dose combination is recommended for further testing in an expanded clinical trial or contraceptive efficacy study. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on men and family planning in Bangladesh. A variety of topics are covered: male fertility preferences, male KAP, opinions about <b>male</b> methods of <b>contraception,</b> family planning decision-making, and recent efforts to involve Bangladeshi men in family planning programs. Men's desired family size in Bangladesh is small; only one-third of respondents {{in the most recent}} national survey, the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 1993 - 94, wanted more than two children (Mitra et al., 1994). The same survey revealed that knowledge of at least one modern method of family planning is practically universal and that attitudes towards contraception are overwhelmingly favorable, even in the country's most conservative district, Chittagong. Religious opposition to family planning among men seems to be less common than usually thought (Bernhart and Uddin, 1990; Mazumder, 1993). The use of vasectomy remains insignificant in Bangladesh.

50|$|Smart RISUG is a newer {{version of}} the <b>male</b> <b>contraception</b> that was {{published}} in 2009. This polymer adds iron oxide and copper particles to the original compound, giving it magnetic properties and the name “Smart” RISUG. After injection {{the exact location of}} the polymer inside the vas deferens can be measured and visualized by X-ray and magnetic imaging. The polymer location can also be externally controlled using a pulsed magnetic field. With this magnetic field, the polymer can change location inside the body to maximize sterility or can be removed to restore fertility. The polymer has magnetoelastic behavior that allow it to stretch and elongate to better line the vas deferens. The iron oxide component is necessary to prevent agglomeration. With the original RISUG polymer, the SMA can possibly clump as a reaction to neighboring proteins. With the presence of iron particles, the polymer has lower protein binding and therefore prevents agglomeration. This makes Smart RISUG safer for the user as it will not accidentally block the vas deferens. The copper particles in the compound allow the polymer to conduct heat. When an external microwave applies heat to the polymer, is can liquify the polymer again to be excreted to restore fertility. Smart RISUG is therefore better choice for men who want to use RISUG as temporary birth control, since it does not require a second surgery to restore fertility. The addition of metal ions also increases the effectiveness of the spermicide. The low frequency electromagnetic field disintegrates the sperm cell membrane in the head region. This in turn causes both acrosin and hyaluronidase enzymes to leak out of the sperm, making the sperm infertile. The safety of Smart RISUG is still being investigated. With literature research, the spermicidal properties of the compound should not have negative effects on the lining of the vas deferens. The albino rats used to develop the new polymer have not had any adverse symptoms.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the hormonal regulation of spermatogenesis {{is required for the}} informed assessment and management of male fertility and, conversely, for the development of safe and reversible <b>male</b> hormonal <b>contraception.</b> An approach to the study of these issues is outlined based on the use of well-defined in vivo models of gonadotropin/androgen deprivation and replacement, the quantitative assessment of germ cell number using stereological techniques, and the directed study of specific steps in spermatogenesis shown to be hormone dependent. Drawing together data from rat, monkey, and human models, we identify differences between species and formulate an overview of the hormonal regulation of spermatogenesis. There is good evidence for both separate and synergistic roles for both testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in achieving quantitatively normal spermatogenesis. Based on relatively selective withdrawal and replacement studies, FSH has key roles in the progression of type A to B spermatogonia and, in synergy with testosterone, in regulating germ cell viability. Testosterone is an absolute requirement for spermatogenesis. In rats, it has been shown to promote the adhesion of round spermatids to Sertoli cells, without which they are sloughed from the epithelium and spermatid elongation fails. The release of mature elongated spermatids from the testis (spermiation) is also under FSH/testosterone control in rats. Data from monkeys and men treated with steroidal contraceptives indicate that impairment of spermiation is a key to achieving azoospermia. The contribution of 5 �-reduced androgens in the testis to the regulation of spermatogenesis is also relevant, as 5 �-reduced androgens are maintained during gonadotropin suppression and may act to maintain low levels of germ cell development. These concepts are also discussed in the context of male hormonal contraceptive development. I...|$|R
40|$|Social {{constructions of}} men towards the {{availability}} of a male hormonal contraceptive, the ‘male pill’, were explored. A qualitative approach applying semi-structured interviews and scenarios with 22 men (mean age 35 years) from the North East of England revealed two core constructs and six sub-constructs using a Thematic- Construct Analysis in line with the method of Toerien and Wilkinson and Clarke and Kitzinger. Verbal accounts were inductively used to balance the deductively created two core constructs ‘Constructing the male pill norm: dominant system of sensemaking’ and ‘Living by the male pill norm’ to represent a normative framework within a changing ideology of shared responsibility in contraceptive choice. Constructing the male pill norm was divided into two sub-constructs: ‘Male pill: we are going to join the women and become responsible – too!’ and ‘Male pill: you look so girly – {{what are they going to}} think of me?’ The ‘Living by the male pill norm’ was further divided into four sub-constructs ‘Male pill – thank you for giving me promises not to have to become a dad as yet!’; ‘Male pill: thank you for the idea of fun – sorry about my morals!’; ‘Male pill: in stable relations – yes, I would have you now – sorry, I am too late!’ and ‘Male pill, we love you – but we are too anxious – we are not ready as yet!’ From this male discourse, it is clear that discussions over the male pill follow the line of a vicious circle.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>male</b> hormonal <b>contraception</b> {{is based on}} the decrease in the sperm concentration and it does notaffect libido and sexual potency. The combination of depot medroxy progesterone acetate (DMPA) + extract ofJavanese long pepper (JLP) with dosages of 0. 94 mg and 1. 88 mg decreases the concentration of spermatozoa. However, it remains unknown whether the combination influences body weight, hematology, and blood biochemistry. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of DMPA + JLP extracts on the body weight, hematology, and bloodbiochemistry of male rats (Rattus norvegicus L.) strains of Sprague-Dawley. The research uses a completelyrandomized design (CRD); one group control and two treatment groups. In the first group, the castration rats were givenoral administration extracts of JLP (CJ) with doses of 0, 0. 94, 1. 88, 2. 82, and 3. 76 mg. In the second group, the ratswere injected with 1. 25 mg DMPA and given an oral administration extract of JLP. Injection was given in week- 0 and 12. Administration was conducted every day from week 7 - 18. Analysis of the normality and homogeneity of data isdone before the test ANOVA. Data that is abnormal and not homogeneous are tested with non-parametric statisticalKruskal-Wallis. This study shows that the combination of minimal doses of DMPA and administration various doses ofextracts of JLP does not affect body weight and hematology (erythrocyte, hemoglobin, hematocrite), and the bloodbiochemistry of rats, such as the values of SGPT, SGOT, HDL, and triglycerides (p < 0. 05), but rather the totalcholesterol and LDL (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, it is concluded that the combination of the minimal dosage of DMPA andweaned various dosages of JLP extracts affect the total value and LDL cholesterol but do not influence body weight,nor hematology and blood biochemistry. Such combination can be drawn on for a male contraceptive model that is safeby taking into account the value of the total cholesterol and LDL during its use...|$|R
