25|$|Of all aldehydes, {{formaldehyde}} {{is produced}} on the largest scale, about 6,000,000 tons per year. It is mainly {{used in the}} production of resins when combined with urea, melamine, and phenol (e.g., Bakelite). It is a precursor to <b>methylene</b> <b>diphenyl</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> ("MDI"), a precursor to polyurethanes.

Acetaldehyde once was a dominating product, but production levels have declined to less than 1,000,000 tons per year because it mainly served as a precursor to acetic acid, which is now prepared by carbonylation of methanol. Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called oxo alcohols, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are famously used as ingredients in flavours and perfumes such as N°5 from CHANEL.

Global and local minima structures were found and confirmed by vibrational analysis. The energy barriers related to rotation of the aromatic rings were estimated by DFTcalculations. The stability of global and local minima was verified by Car-Parrinello (MD) runs at finite temperature. The presence of weak C–H⋯π hydrogen bonds was confirmed by atoms in molecules analysis and found to be responsible for the low energy barriers.
