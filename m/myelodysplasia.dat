25|$|Although {{some risk}} exists for {{developing}} acute myelogenous leukemia, about 50% of deaths {{occur as a}} result of bleeding or infection. However, leukemia that occurs {{as a result of}} <b>myelodysplasia</b> is notoriously resistant to treatment.|$|E
25|$|After {{suffering}} from <b>myelodysplasia</b> for two years, and receiving three bone marrow transplants from his sister Cari, Sagan died of pneumonia {{at the age}} of 62, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, in the early morning of December 20, 1996.|$|E
40|$|The CBFA 2 (AML 1) gene encodes a DNA-binding subunit of the heterodimeric core-binding factor. The CBFA 2 gene is {{disrupted}} by the (8; 21), (3; 21), and (12; 21) chromosomal translocations associated with leukemias and <b>myelodysplasias</b> in humans. Mice lacking a CBF alpha 2 protein capable of binding DNA die between embryonic days 11. 5 and 12. 5 due to hemorrhaging {{in the central}} nervous system (CNS), at the nerve/CNS interfaces of cranial and spinal nerves, and in somitic/intersomitic regions along the presumptive spinal cord. Hemorrhaging is preceded by symmetric, bilateral necrosis in these regions. Definitive erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis do not occur in Cbfa 2 -deficient embryos, and disruption of one copy of the Cbfa 2 gene significantly reduces the number of progenitors for erythroid and myeloid cells...|$|R
40|$|In <b>myelodysplasias</b> {{and acute}} myeloid leukemias, {{abnormalities}} in erythroid development often parallel abnormalities in megakaryocytic development. Erythroleukemic cells {{in particular have}} been shown to possess the potential to undergo megakaryocytic differentiation in response to a variety of stimuli. Whether or not such lineage plasticity occurs {{as a consequence of the}} leukemic phenotype has not previously been addressed. In this study, highly purified primary human erythroid progenitors were subjected to stimuli known to induce megakaryocytic differentiation in erythroleukemic cells. Remarkably, the primary erythroid progenitors rapidly responded with morphological and immunophenotypic evidence of megakaryocytic differentiation, equivalent to that seen in erythroleukemic cells. Even erythroblasts expressing high levels of hemoglobin manifested partial megakaryocytic differentiation. These results indicate that the lineage plasticity observed in erythroleukemic cells reflects an intrinsic property of cells in the erythroid lineage rather than an epiphenomenon of leukemic transformation...|$|R
40|$|The MYB related loci, AMYB and BMYB, were {{localized}} {{to specific}} human chromosome regions by Southern blot {{analysis of their}} segregation patterns in a panel of rodent-human hybrid DNAs using radiolabeled AMYB and BMYB probes. The AMYB locus was present in hybrids retaining the chromosome region 8 cen [...] 8 q 22 and was absent in hybrids which had lost this chromosome region. The presence of the BMYB locus in rodent-human hybrids correlated with, and only with, chromosome region Xq 13. Chromosomal in situ hybridization refined the localization of AMYB to region 8 q 22 - 23 and confirmed the localization of BMYB to region Xq 13. Chromosome region 8 q 22 is involved in recurrent translocations in malignant lymphoma and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M 2); therefore AMYB {{is a candidate for}} involvement in such translocations. A region on Xq 13 is also involved in chromosomal abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia and <b>myelodysplasias...</b>|$|R
25|$|Erythropoietins {{available}} for use as therapeutic agents are produced by recombinant DNA technology in cell culture, and include Epogen/Procrit (epoetin alfa) and Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa); they are used in treating anemia resulting from chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy induced anemia in patients with cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and <b>myelodysplasia</b> from the treatment of cancer (chemotherapy and radiation). The package inserts include boxed warnings of increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and tumor recurrence, particularly when used to increase the hemoglobin levels to more than 11 to 12 g/dl.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGene {{transfer}} of drug resistance (CTX-R) genes {{can be used}} to protect the hematopoietic system from the toxicity of anticancer chemotherapy and this concept recently has been proven by overexpression of a mutant O 6 -methylguaninemethyltransferase in the hematopoietic system of glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide. Given its protection capacity against such relevant drugs as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), gemcitabine, decitabine, or azacytidine and the highly hematopoiesis-specific toxicity profile of several of these agents, cytidine deaminase (CDD) represents another interesting candidate CTX-R gene and our group recently has established the myeloprotective capacity of CDD gene transfer in a number of murine transplant studies. Clinically, CDD overexpression appears particularly suited to optimize treatment strategies for acute leukemias and <b>myelodysplasias</b> given the efficacy of ara-C (and to a lesser degree decitabine and azacytidine) in these disease entities. This article will review {{the current state of the}} art with regard to CDD gene transfer and point out potential scenarios for a clinical application of this strategy. In addition, risks and potential side effects associated with this approach as well as strategies to overcome these problems will be highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis is {{necessary}} for maintaing the integrity of all alive multicellular organisms and therefore needs to be precisely regulated. Very important regulators of apoptosis are pleiotropic cytokines from TFGβ superfamily (e. g. TGFβ, BMP, aktivins), whose signals are transduced by SMAD proteins. Patients with secondary <b>myelodysplasias</b> and acute myeloid leukemias (MDS/AML) frequently exhibit interstitial deletions of the chromosome- 5 q resulting in hemizygous loss of the transcription transactivator SMAD 5. SMAD 5 {{is a member of}} the signal transducer family conveying the pleiotropic TGFβ/BMP cytokine signals with roles in development, cell growth control, and tumor progression. Consistent Smad 5 gene expression in these cell types and the gradual increase in its mRNA and protein levels in a model of induced erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells suggest a role of the gene in hematopoiesis. We show that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4) directs Smad 5 activation in human hematopoietic cells, as monitored at the levels of protein phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and specific transcription response. In vitro induction of normal human CD 34 + cells by BMP 4 results in significantly increased proliferation of erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) and formation of glycophorin- A+ cells, whereas [...] .

40|$|Of 1614 Nordic {{children}} with ALL that were treated {{according to the}} NOPHO ALL 92 protocol, 20 developed an SMN (cumulative risk at 12 years: 1. 6 %). Sixteen of the twenty SMNs were acute myeloid leukemias or <b>myelodysplasias,</b> and 9 of these had either monosomy 7 (n= 7) or 7 q deletions (n= 2). In Cox multivariate analysis longer duration of oral MTX/ 6 MP maintenance therapy (p= 0. 02; being longest for standard risk patients) and presence of high-hyperdiploidy (p= 0. 07) were related to {{an increased risk of}} SMN. In 524 patients we determined the erythrocyte activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which methylates 6 MP and its metabolites, and thus reduces cellular levels of cytotoxic 6 -thioguanine nucleotides. The TPMT activity was significantly lower in those that did compared to those that did not develop an SMN (Median: 12. 1 vs 18. 1 IU/ml; p= 0. 02). Among 427 TPMT wild type patients, those who developed SMN received higher 6 MP doses than the remaining (69. 7 vs 60. 4 mg/m 2, p= 0. 03), which may reflect increased levels of methylated metabolites that inhibit purine de novo synthesis and thus enhance incorporation of 6 -thioguanine nucleotides into DNA. In conclusion, the duration and intensity of 6 MP/MTX maintenance therapy of childhood ALL may influence the risk of SMN...|$|R
500|$|In December 1993, Warner Bros. hired George Miller {{to direct}} and Contact {{commenced}} pre-production. Miller cast Jodie Foster {{in the lead}} role, approached Ralph Fiennes to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting Linda Hunt as the President of the United States. In addition to having aliens put on a laser lighting display around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth {{to the center of}} the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite Contact in an attempt to portray the Pope as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller's direction pre-production lasted longer than expected. [...] The studio [...] fired the director, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller's insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting. Robert Zemeckis, who previously turned down the director's position, decided to accept the offer. Warner Bros. granted Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege. The director cast Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss; McConaughey dropped out of the lead role in The Jackal to take the role in Contact. Despite being diagnosed with <b>myelodysplasia</b> in 1994, Sagan continued to be involved in the production of the film. For the cast and main crew members, he conducted an academic conference that depicted a detailed history of astronomy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to verify the 5 -year results of the MOPPEBVCAD {{chemotherapy}} regimen with limited radiotherapy {{in relation to the}} promising preliminary data. Mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, epidoxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, lomustine, melphalan, and vindesine were delivered according to a schedule derived through hybridization, intensification, and shortening of the corresponding alternating CAD/MOPP/ABV regimen. Radiotherapy was restricted to sites of bulky involvement or to areas that responded incompletely to chemotherapy. This multicenter, controlled, nonrandomized trial involved 145 eligible patients. Radiotherapy was administered to 47 patients, 46 of whom were in complete remission after chemotherapy. Remissions were complete in 137 patients (94 %), partial in 4 (3 %), and null in the remaining 4. Tumor-specific, overall, relapse-free, and failure-free survival at 5 years were 0. 89, 0. 86, 0. 82, and 0. 78, respectively. Hematologic toxicity was considerable, whereas nonhematologic side effects were fully acceptable. Most of the unfavorable prognostic factors lost their clinical weight. Only age and lymphocyte depletion histologic type were statistically correlated with major follow up endpoints; performance status and bone marrow involvement were subordinate to age. Seven patients developed a second cancer (including 3 <b>myelodysplasias).</b> MOPPEBVCAD with selected radiotherapy is a highly effective regimen in advanced Hodgkin´s disease. Early and late toxicity are no more severe than what would be expected with other alternating or hybrid regimens.

40|$|High-dose {{chemotherapy}} (HD-CT) {{has a role}} in {{the potentially}} curative treatment of several tumours. The relative efficacies of the different regimens have not been studied in comparative trials, {{but it is clear that}} toxicities differ significantly between them. We analysed the immediate and long-term toxicity in the first 100 consecutive patients treated with the CTC regimen (cyclophosphamide 6000 mg m(- 2), carboplatin 1600 mg m(- 2) (or 20 mg ml(- 1) min under the curve (AUC)) both as daily 1 h infusion, thiotepa 480 mg m(- 2) as twice daily 30 min infusion, all divided over 4 consecutive days) followed by peripheral blood progenitor cell reinfusion (PBPC-Tx). Most patients had high-risk (n= 86) or metastatic (n= 4) breast cancer, or a germ cell tumour (n= 8). Two patients (with a medulloblastoma and an aesthesioneuroblastoma, respectively) received CTC as off-protocol salvage regimen. The main toxicity was bone marrow suppression. Most patients had PBPC-Tx with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and the median time to neutrophil count 500 x 10 (6) l(- 1) and platelet count > 20 x 10 (9) l(- 1) without transfusion independence was 10 (range 8 - 25) and 13 (8 - 60) days, respectively. The toxic death rate was 1 %. Other frequent toxicities were neutropenic fever requiring antibiotics (n= 65), central catheter-related infection (n= 12) or a bleeding episode (n= 48), mostly epistaxis (n= 26). Reversible cardiac toxicity was seen in six patients and pulmonary events occurred in seven patients (infection (n= 6), embolism (n= 1)). Grade 3 - 4 gastrointestinal toxicity was frequent: nausea and vomiting 55 %, diarrhoea 28 % and mild liver toxicity (transaminase elevations) 9 %. One patient pretreated with cisplatin had a kidney transplantation 8 years after HD-CT. Late complications included reversible radiation pneumonitis (n= 12) and chronic heart failure (n= 2). We found five second solid malignancies and two <b>myelodysplasias.</b> In conclusion, the CTC regimen is associated with a moderate, mainly reversible, toxicity. Future studies need to compare the efficacy and toxicity of the different HD-CT regimen...|$|R
