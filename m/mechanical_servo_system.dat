40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{a robust}} {{adaptive}} tracking control scheme is proposed for compensation of the stick-slip friction in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>servo</b> <b>system.</b> The control scheme has a sliding control input to compensate friction forces. The gain of the sliding control input is adjusted adaptively {{to estimate the}} linear bound of the stick-slip friction. By introducing the sliding control input, the global stability and the tracking error asymptotic convergence to the predetermined boundary are established via Lyapunov's stability theorem. The proposed scheme is shown to be robust to variations of the system and/or friction characteristics, and a bounded external disturbance. Computer simulations and exper-iments on an X- Y table verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed scheme. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years there has been {{considerable}} interest in the kinetic effects of certain species, such as Mylaxim and THA (g-amino- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroaminoacridine) (1)) which act as inhibitors in t,he acetylcholinesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylcholine. Both com-pounds are essentially associated (completely inhibit enzyme activity) with t. he enzyme in less than a few minutes (2 to 4 min). As available assay methods are incapable of following the rates of such rapid reac-tions, it was of considerable interest to develop a simple rapid technique for these studies. The kinetic-based method for measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity for inhibition studies is essentially a problem in prod-ucts analyses, which, under normal conditions, arc acetic acid and choline. As a sensitive analytical method for the alcoholic OH group of the choline molecule is not available, previous methods for following the hydrolysis rates have monitored the rate of production of t,he protons generated in the reaction. All of these methods are unsuit. able for follow-ing fast reactions, however. The Warburg manometrie method (2)) while being the standard method of determining the enzyme activity, is in-herently slow in response and limits the choice of medium to a bicar-bonate buffer. Titrimetric methods, employing a pH-Stat, such as the methods of Wilson (3) and Main and Dauterman (41, require t. he use of unbuffered media and are extremely slow because of the very long response time of the glass electrode and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>servo</b> <b>system</b> controlling the addition of NaOH (specially designed pH stats, however, are available which have response times of less than 10 set).

40|$|Abstract—Friction and {{nonlinearities}} {{result in}} large residual errors and deteriorate {{the performance of}} head positioning of hard disk drive (HDD) <b>servo</b> <b>systems</b> and other <b>mechanical</b> <b>servo</b> <b>systems.</b> Thus, it is highly desirable to characterize the behaviors of nonlinearities and friction in the <b>servo</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper presents a fairly comprehensive modeling and compensation of friction and nonlinearities of a typical voice-coil-motor (VCM) actuator used in commercial HDDs, and the design of an HDD <b>servo</b> <b>system</b> using an enhanced nonlinear control technique. Our contributions are two-fold: We will first obtain a complete model of the VCM actuator including friction and nonlinear characteristics through a careful examination of the configuration {{and structure of the}} actual system and through a thorough analysis of its physical effects together with its time-domain and frequency-domain responses. We will then proceed to design a <b>servo</b> <b>system</b> for the hard drive using an enhanced composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control technique with a simple friction and nonlinearity compensation scheme. The enhanced CNF technique has a feature of removing the uncompensated portion of friction and nonlinearities without sacrificing the overall tracking performance. Simulation and experimental results for both the modeling and the servo design show that our approach is very effective and successful. In particular, our experimental results show that the enhanced CNF control has outperformed the conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control in settling time by 76 %. We believe that this approach can be adopted to solve other servomechanism problems.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of producing a low cost, 6 axis, Industrial Robot. The formulation of a design specification based on market trends is shown, and used {{as a starting point}} for formal design analysis. A robot conceptual design based on two, series coupled, triangular link mechanisms was devised, following a detailed analysis of various kinematic mechanisms. The purpose of the mechanisms analysis was to find a low cost, inherently stiff, means of driving the robot main axes; in particular, the shoulder and elbow joints. By adopting the novel concept of a hand and wrist mechanism, a "true 3 axes" wrist was devised. A unique feature of this is that the roll, pitch and yaw axes form an orthogonal set with the origin at the wrist point. Although emphasis is placed on the robot <b>mechanical</b> design, a <b>Servo</b> amplifier <b>system,</b> suitable for driving all 6 axes of the robot is presented, and recommendations for a position control system are given. Finally, costs relating to the robot <b>mechanical</b> <b>system,</b> <b>Servo</b> amplifier <b>system</b> and Position control system were investigated. The variation in cost with robot volume is shown for each of the 3 systems. This indicates that a manufacturing cost of E 9000 per robot can be achieved providing at least 150 robots are produced.

40|$|With the {{continuous}} improvement of {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) system processing speed and machining accuracy, traditional low step mathematic model can not express the high speed movement character any more.
