We show that, for any network and any shock, the flow of losses generated with the mark-to-market rule is larger than the one generated by accounting at historical cost.

40|$|In liquid markets the {{frequency}} or timing of settlement (<b>marking-to-market)</b> {{may not be}} expected to impact prices. However during illiquid periods with leveraged trading, settlement can {{have a significant impact on}} forced liquidations and price volatility. This paper presents an agent-based model of real time settlement in a leveraged market with zero-intelligent traders in an open-outcry double auction, stylized after a futures market. Initial simulations produce the emergent market phenomenon of volatility clustering in returns and serial correlation in prices, which is related to the degree of leverage among traders. These results suggest that mark-to-market real time settlement promotes overshooting in prices, as price changes lead to a cascade of deleveraging among market participants in an illiquid market. ...|$|E

These results generalize previous works on discounting for fully collateralized derivatives and on funding value adjustment for partially collateralized or uncollateralized derivatives. ...|$|E

Around 31 % of all German banks hold no sovereign bonds at all. Second, the sensitivity of banks to macroeconomic factors increased significantly in the post-Lehman period. Banks hold more bonds from euro area countries, from low-inflation countries, and from countries with high sovereign bond yields. Third, there has been no marked impact of sovereign bond holdings on bank risk.

40|$|Derivative {{longevity}} risk solutions, such as bespoke and indexed longevity swaps, allow pension schemes and annuity providers to swap out {{longevity risk}}, but introduce counterparty credit risk, {{which can be}} mitigated if not fully eliminated by collateralization. We {{examine the impact of}} bilateral default risk and collateral rules on the marking to market of longevity swaps, and show how longevity swap rates must be determined endogenously from the collateral flows associated with the <b>marking-to-market</b> procedure. For typical interest rate and mortality parameters, we find that the impact of collateralization is modest in the presence of symmetric default risk, but more pronounced when default risk and/or collateral rules are asymmetric. Our results suggest that the overall cost of collateralization is comparable with, and often much smaller than, that found in the interest-rate swaps market (as a result of the offsetting effects of interest rate and longevity risks), which may then provide the appropriate reference framework for the credit enhancement of both indemnity-based and indexed longevity risk solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|Fair value {{accounting}} forces {{institutions to}} revalue inventory whenever a transaction occurs. An institution that faces a balance sheet constraint may have incentives to suspend trading in Level 3 assets (traded on opaque over-the-counter markets) {{in order to}} avoid such <b>marking-to-market.</b> This keeps the book valuation artificially high, relaxing the balance sheet constraint. But, the institution loses direct control of the risk of its position. Solving this "real options" problem, the institution will report profits as they occur but delay reporting losses. A regulator trying to control risk imposes fines for balance sheet manipulation and capital requirements. Both these tools can increase risk-taking and balance sheet manipulation. Audits in comparision generally decrease risk-taking but may be costly to the regulator. The model provides predictions on the distribution of a bank's trading gains in illiquid markets.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal {{design of a}} futures hedge program by a com-petitive firm under output price uncertainty. Due to a capital constraint and the <b>marking-to-market</b> procedure of futures contracts, the firm faces endoge-nous liquidity risk.

Otherwise, we show that the capital constraint becomes binding in that the firm optimally puts aside all of its capital stock for the futures hedge program. In the case of non-binding capital constraint, we show that the firm’s optimal futures position is likely to be an over-hedge for reasonable preferences. In the case of binding capital constraint, the firm’s optimal futures position is an under-hedge or an over-hedge, depending on whether the autocorrelation co-efficient of the futures price dynamics is below or above a critical positive value, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of valuation by <b>marking-to-market</b> with current trading prices is seriously flawed. Under leverage {{the problem is}} particularly dra-matic: due to the concave form of market impact, selling always initially causes the expected leverage to increase. There is a critical leverage above which {{it is impossible to}} exit a portfolio without leverage going to infinity and bankruptcy becoming likely. Standard risk-management methods give no warning of this problem, which easily occurs for aggressively leveraged positions in illiquid markets. We propose an alternative accounting pro-cedure based on the estimated market impact of liquidation that removes the illusion of profit. This should curb the leverage cycle and contribute to an enhanced stability of financial markets. Another issue brought to the fore by the crisis is the need to better understand the determinants of liquidity in financial markets.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{predicted}} electricity spot prices from a statistical model, along with consensus forecasts issued by the Australian Financial Market Association (AFMA), provide unbiased price estimates of a forward contract price over a specified time to expiration. The statistical model is a regime switching time series model which is based on the dynamics of the market mechanism. To evaluate a price estimate, two criteria are utilized in order to conclude appropriateness for use in the <b>marking-to-market</b> process. First is the requirement that the predicted prices converge to the spot price at expiration of a hedging contract. The second criterion refers to the mis-pricing due to the price estimates over {{the days leading up to}} the contract expiration. Over the data period under consideration, the ranking of alternatives for generating price predictions is clear. On both criteria the Stevenson (2001) model is preferred. Of significance is the lack of support for the consensus (market) prices. They do not converge to the spot price at equilibrium and, further, they generate a considerable overvaluation of the risk management portfolio. ...|$|E
