40|$|A high {{temperature}} polyimide composition prepared by reacting 4, 4 '-isophthaloyldiphthalic anhydride with <b>metaphenylenediamine</b> is employed to prepare matrix resins, adhesives, films, coatings, moldings, and laminates, especially those showing enhanced flow with retention of mechanical and adhesive properties. It {{can be used}} in the aerospace industry, for example, in joining metals to metals or metals to composite structures. One area of application is in the manufacture of lighter and stronger aircraft and spacecraft structures...|$|E
40|$|Article {{is devoted}} to {{receiving}} and research of compositions {{on the basis of}} industrially made polyamide 6 modified by N,N '-bis-maleamidoacid of <b>metaphenylenediamine.</b> Existence in macromolecules of polyamides reactive carboxyl, amide and amino groups, capable to interact with multifunctional monomeric and oligomeric modifiers, gives the chance of receiving the materials possessing properties of sewed polymers. As a result the use of bis-amidoacid as a modifying additive in the system of aliphatic polyamide- 6 provides the improvement of strength properties and thermal characteristics of a polymeric material...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{was done to}} determine if a wipedfilm evaporator could be successfully used to reduce the volume of five nitro-organic still bottoms streams. The 3. 8 million pounds per year of waste are currently incinerated. The wiped-film evaporator was successfully employed in the recovery of n-ethylmetatoluidine, <b>metaphenylenediamine,</b> n,n-diethylmetatoluidine, aniline, n,n-diethylanilhe, and n-ethylaniline. A production WFE would reduce the amount of material currently wasted by 41 % to 2. 2 million pounds a year. The recovered products represent an annual net increase of 1. 6 million dollars. A byproduct discovered in the waste, o-aminophenol, represents an additional $ 617, 000 annual increase in revenue...|$|E
