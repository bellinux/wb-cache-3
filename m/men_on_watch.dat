60|$|He then {{ordered the}} under officer to place two <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> on the rocks, {{and two men}} on deck, two men to stand as {{sentinels}} over the prisoners, and the rest to lie down. He directed {{that he should be}} roused at the earliest streak of daylight.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{think if}} I {{had not been}} {{confident}} that the first mate was not the man to take alarm easily, I should have had difficulty in keeping my eyes open, for the night was sultry and not a breath of air was moving. I went forward to the two <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> {{and told them that}} they must keep a sharp look-out, for that it was likely enough we might be attacked before morning. Then I lit my pipe and paced up and down the deck, stopping occasionally to listen intently. It was nearly eight bells when I thought I heard a grating sound on shore. I walked forward and found, as I expected, that the two <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> were half-asleep. ‘Wake up, you fools!’ I said; ‘there is something moving.’ Again I heard the low grating sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are friends!" [...] {{the boys}} shouted as they ran, and a cheer from the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> greeted them. A few shots flew after {{them from the}} other side of the river, but these were fired at random, and in another minute the party had {{scrambled}} over the earthwork and were among friends.|$|E

60|$|Flora Schuyler and Grant {{were not}} far from the door now, the girl walking close to her companion. In another moment they would have passed out of sight into the shadow, but while Hetty felt her fingers trembling, the <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch,</b> perhaps hearing their footsteps, turned round.|$|R
60|$|It {{was getting}} light when the <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> called Kit, {{who went to}} the gap in the wall. Thin mist drifted about the trees and trailed across the road. There was some open ground in front of the building, but behind this the forest loomed in a blurred, shadowy mass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you talk}} like a fool! How may we escape with these three <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch,</b> {{all of whom}} are willing to shoot us at the first chance we give them. I'm not minded to have a bullet put through my body; but would rather trust to the king's troops, in the hope that after a time we may be set free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hurrah!' {{the boys}} both shouted {{as they started}} at a canter up the rise. As they {{caught sight of the}} Indians, {{everything}} was quiet as before; but in another moment they saw the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> throw themselves on to their horses' backs, figures leapt up from the grass and ran towards their horses, and in little over a minute the whole were in motion.|$|E
60|$|It {{was still}} {{two hours before}} dawn when they {{approached}} the house. Save a few <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch,</b> the great Danish host, which the messengers calculated to amount to ten thousand men, were asleep. Cautiously making their way {{so as to avoid}} stumbling over the Danes, who lay scattered in groups round the house, the Saxons crept forward quietly until close to the entrance, when a sleepy watchman started up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{although}} it may be possible they will be foolish enough to come back. We'll leave two <b>men</b> here <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> for a few days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, sir; then I {{will tell}} you where {{they are to be}} found. I can't take you there, your honor, but I can tell you whereabout it is. There is a {{footpath}} turns oft from the road {{at the end of the}} village, and goes straight down to the top of them big rocks that come out of the sea. Well, sir, a few hundred yards to the right of that there is a sort of break in the rocks, and there is a track goes down there. You won't see it onless you look close for it, and it gets lost a little way down, becase the rocks are all broken about and heaped on each other. It's down there they go. There's always a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> not far from the top; and there is generally a gossoon from their friends here somewhere at the edge of the bog behind, who would run forward and tell the <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> if he saw any soldiers coming from here. So you will have to be mighty careful; but they are down there, sure enough, somewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "So far so good, ladies," [...] the Major said cheerily, as the garrison, {{leaving one}} <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch,</b> {{descended from the}} roof. [...] "We have had no casualties, and I think we must have inflicted a good many, and the mutineers {{are not likely to}} try that game on again, for they must see that they are wasting ammunition, and are doing us no harm. Now I hope the {{servants}} have got tiffin ready for us, for I am sure we have all excellent appetites." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent!" [...] Francis Vere said. [...] "This will relieve us of {{the work}} of countermining, which is always {{tiresome}} and dangerous, and would be specially so here, where we should have to dive under that deep moat outside your walls. Now we shall only have to keep a few <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> in these cellars. They would hear the sound of the Spanish approaching, and we shall be ready to give them a warm reception by the time they break in. Are there communications between these cellars?" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the castle}} {{everything}} was quiet, {{and all those}} not on duty were already asleep. Along the wall watchers stood at short intervals peering into the darkness, but the main body there were also stretched on the wall with their arms by their side until required to be up and doing. Now that Sir Eustace was himself at the gate his esquire went round the walls at short intervals {{to be sure that}} the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> were vigilant. Presently a loud cry was heard from the corner of the moat away to the right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am much {{obliged to}} you for telling me of this," [...] Captain Vere said. [...] "Williams and Morgan will be glad enough to hear {{that there is no}} fear of their being blown {{suddenly}} into the air while defending the walls, and they will see the importance of keeping a few trusty <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> in the cellars nearest to the Spaniards. I shall report the matter to them at once. The difficulty," [...] he added smiling, [...] "will be to keep the men wakeful, for {{it seems to me that}} the very air is heavy with the fumes of wine." ...|$|E
60|$|Marguerite's aching heart stood still. She felt, {{more than}} she heard, the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> the <b>watch</b> {{preparing}} for the fight. Her senses told her that each, with sword in hand, was crouching, ready for the spring.|$|R
6000|$|The voyagers moved cautiously: 'Landed {{at night}} and made a fire to cook their evening meal; then {{extinguished}} it, embarked again, paddled some way farther, and anchored in the stream, keeping a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> the <b>watch</b> till morning.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nat had {{received}} no further orders, and sailed that afternoon; {{two days later}} he was off {{the entrance of the}} great bay. He coasted along the shore as near as he could venture, always keeping a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> for signals made by anyone anxious to be taken off. When it became dark the anchor was dropped, so that no part of the shore could be passed without the ship being observed. It was on the seventh day after sailing that he arrived at Port-au-Prince. Half an hour after he had anchored, Monsieur Pickard came off in a boat.|$|R
6000|$|The two lads {{walked slowly}} down the hill together. Harry had heard no more than Charlie had done, {{of what was going}} on. The {{messenger}} from his father was a young fellow, of seventeen or eighteen, with a gipsy face and appearance. How he had managed to elude the vigilance of the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch,</b> Harry did not know. He, himself, had only learnt his presence when, as he passed some bushes in the garden, a sharp whisper made him stop, and a moment later a hand was thrust through the foliage. He took the little note held out, and caught sight of the lad's face, through the leaves, as he leant forward and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I had no {{inclination}} for sleep. The fellows {{have been}} reinforced. Of course I don't know to what extent, but I should say pretty strongly. They have lit a big fire {{some distance from}} the ravine. They would not have dared to light one if they had not felt themselves strong enough to fight us. No doubt they have half a dozen <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> where we first saw them, and these would give notice if we were coming. I think we may as well fire a couple of shots, it will show them that we are here and on guard. They will suppose we thought we heard someone coming down to reconnoitre our position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next day}} passed slowly. The sun was hot; but toward evening the {{lieutenant}} gave permission {{for the men}} to bathe; but warned us that no man must go far from the boats, because there might be sharks about. However, we didn't see none, and we enjoyed the dip, and were in better humor still when we found that a light breeze was springing up. It might have been about midnight when the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> made out a light to seaward, and we weren't long in getting up our grapnels and sitting our oars. In half an hour we were on board, and were soon sailing away from the island again.|$|E
60|$|It {{is true that}} Henry had {{stationed}} an outpost {{upon the}} summit of the hill in advance of Lewes, but so lax was discipline in his army that the soldiers, growing tired of the duty, had abandoned the post toward morning, and returned to town, leaving but a single <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch.</b> He, left alone, had promptly fallen asleep, and thus De Montfort's men found and captured him within sight of the bell-tower of the Priory of Lewes, where the King and his royal allies lay peacefully asleep, after their night of wine and dancing and song.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{entered the}} wood again, I found a <b>man</b> <b>on</b> the <b>watch.</b> He touched his hat, and said: [...] "I'm the clerk, sir. Your {{gamekeeper}} is wanted {{for his own}} duties to-night; he will relieve me in the morning." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stretched}} {{out her hand}} with a little imperious gesture, {{and laid it on}} his arm, drawing herself up to her full height as she stood between him and the light. They moved forward together, and Hetty closed her hand as she watched them pass into the hall. The end was dim and shadowy, for the one big lamp that was lighted stood some distance away by the stove, where the <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> was talking to the maid. Hetty realized that the girl was playing her part well as she saw her make a swift step backwards, and heard the man's low laugh.|$|R
60|$|The Elsinore {{is never}} totally asleep. Day and night, always, {{there are the}} <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch,</b> the {{look-out}} on the forecastle head, {{the man at the}} wheel, and the officer of the deck. I lie reading in my bunk, which is on the weather side, and continually over my head during the long night hours impact the footsteps of one mate or the other, pacing up and down, and, as I well know, the man himself is for ever peering for'ard from the break of the poop, or glancing into the binnacle, or feeling and gauging the weight and direction of wind on his cheek, or watching the cloud-stuff in the sky adrift and a-scud across the stars and the moon. Always, always, there are wakeful eyes on the Elsinore.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{this seemed}} to be fairly satisfactory. I told him that we {{suspected}} that a stolen child was kept in Nibson's house, and asked him whether one of his men off duty would, at any time, go with me in a boat and point out the house. He said {{that there would be}} no difficulty about that. My idea, Miss Covington, was that it would be by far the best plan for us to go down with a pretty strong party--that is to say, two or three men--and to go from Gravesend in a boat, arriving at Hole Haven at eleven or twelve o'clock at night. I should write beforehand to the coastguard officer, asking him to have a man in readiness to guide us, and then row up to the house. In that way we should avoid all chance of a warning being sent on ahead from Pitsea, or from any other place where they might have <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} it would be so," [...] Fatma said sorrowfully. [...] "What can we do? At other times, the {{protection}} of the harem would cover even one who had slain a chief; but now that the Baggara are half starving, and mad with anger and disappointment, even that no longer avails. If they would brave the anger of the son of the Khalifa, they would not regard the sanctity of the harem. I wish now that I had advised you to try and escape when we left Shendy, or even when we first came here. It would have been difficult, but not impossible; but now I can see no chance. There is the thorn hedge round the wood, with few openings, and with <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> all round to prevent desertion. Several tried to escape last night--all were caught and killed this morning. Even if it were possible to pass through, there are bands of horsemen everywhere out on the plain, keeping watch alike against the approach of the enemy and the desertion of cowards.|$|E
500|$|Four {{struck the}} Shinano, {{at an average}} depth of [...] The first hit towards the stern, {{flooding}} refrigerated storage compartments {{and one of the}} empty aviation gasoline storage tanks, and killing many of the sleeping engineering personnel in the compartments above. The second hit the compartment where the starboard outboard propeller shaft entered the hull and flooded the outboard engine room. The third hit further forward, flooding the No. 3 boiler room and killing every <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch.</b> Structural failures caused the two adjacent boiler rooms to flood as well. The fourth flooded the starboard air compressor room, adjacent anti-aircraft gun magazines, and the No. 2 damage-control station, and ruptured the adjacent oil tank.|$|R
60|$|They {{retired to}} rest apparently, but {{we noticed that}} two <b>men</b> {{remained}} <b>on</b> the <b>watch</b> just inside the entrance, whilst the two others curled up in the straw.|$|R
60|$|During the {{afternoon}} a heavy mist swept over {{the gulf and}} {{the speed of the}} Mascotte had to be slackened. Two <b>men</b> were placed <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> besides the pilot, but they could see little.|$|R
60|$|The cortège left Saragossa, {{by one of}} the {{southern}} gates, early in the morning of a glorious autumnal day. There was the usual escort of lances, for this the troubled state of the country demanded; bearded nobles well mailed--for few, who offered an inducement to the plunderer, ventured on the highway without this precaution; a long train of sumpter mules, and a host of those who, by their guise, were half menials and half soldiers. The gallant display drew crowds after the horses' heels, and, together with some prayers for success, a vast deal of crude and shallow conjecture, as is still the practice with the uninstructed and gossiping, was lavished on the probable objects and results of the journey. But curiosity has its limits, and even the gossip occasionally grows weary; {{and by the time the}} sun was setting, most of the multitude had already forgotten to think and speak of the parade of the morning. As the night drew on, however, the late pageant was still the subject of discourse between two soldiers, who belonged to the guard of the western gate, or that which opened on the road to the province of Burgos. These worthies were loitering away the hours, in the listless manner common to <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch,</b> and the spirit of discussion and of critical censure had survived the thoughts and bustle of the day.|$|E

5000|$|At 0145 on 22 October, the <b>men</b> <b>on</b> <b>watch</b> on Anglers bridge were {{startled by}} voices calling {{out of the}} darkness.

[...] the water literally covered with wreckage and dead Japanese, most clad in Army uniforms. Aircraft in the vicinity made it too risky to stop and investigate a lifeboat, but Angler returned at sunset. At 1806, she brought this boat alongside and counted 26 surviving men, both soldiers and naval ratings. Determining who was the senior officer of the group, the submarine retained three men for questioning, and after giving the men remaining in the boat some food, water, and a course to land, 80 nmi km away, released the lifeboat. The three prisoners retained on board — Second Lieutenant Seigi Shimazu, Sergeant Sei Fuji, and Sergeant Toyonaga Nishikawa — had willingly agreed {{to go along with the}} Americans.|$|E
