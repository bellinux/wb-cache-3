40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Eleven small Mesozoic plutons crop {{out within}} a 76 -squaremile {{area of the}} {{southern}} Seven Devils Mountains in west-central Idaho. The plutons are divided into a mafic suite, an older granitic suite, and a younger granitic suite {{on the basis of}} age, lithology, and degree of metamorphism. The six plutons of the mafic suite are Late Triassic-Middle Jurassic (?) in age. Maximum dimensions are slightly over 3 miles in length and about 4, 000 feet in width. Rock types, which may vary within individual plutons, are quartz-bearing hornblende metagabbro, hornblende metanorite, metadiorite, and metamorphosed quartz diorite. Chemically, the rocks are dioritic. The elongation of plutons suggests that emplacement was guided by the northeasttrending zone of weakness exemplified by the mylonite of the Oxbow- Cuprum shear zone. Forceful emplacement is indicated by local deflection of mylonite around plutons. Amphibolitization of pyroxene implies an increase in water pressure during the late stages of crystallization. The mafic plutons were subjected to greenschist facies regional metamorphism. The three plutons of the older granitic suite are Late Jurassic (?) in age. Maximum dimensions are 2 1 / 2 miles long and 4, 200 feet wide. Rock types include quartz diorite and granodiorite; the Crystal Lake pluton shows a faint compositional zonation. The elongation of plutons indicates that emplacement was guided by the northeast trend of the country rocks, including the Oxbow-Cuprum shear zone. Forceful emplacement is shown by the deformation of mylonite around the Crystal Lake pluton. The three intrusions show slight effects of greenschist facies regional metamorphism. The two plutons of the younger granitic suite, Deep Creek and Echols <b>Mountain</b> <b>stocks,</b> are Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (?) in age. The Deep Creek stock, largest intrusive mass in the thesis area, covers 9 1 / 2 square miles and has a thermal aureole as much as 5, 000 feet in width. Twelve tabular marble xenoliths, the largest about half a mile in length, were probably derived from the Martin Bridge limestone at depth. Platy flow structure, defined by the orientation of hornblende, biotite, and schliern, forms a concentric funnel-shaped closure in {{the main body of the}} stock and a glacierlike pattern in part of the eastern prong. The flow structure is thought to have originated, (1) by rotational alignment of platy minerals into parallelism with contacts early in the emplacement history of the stock, and (2) by orientation of platy minerals normal to the direction of greatest magmatic pressure during the later stages of intrusion. Marginal fissures, which form the only consistent joint pattern in the main body of the stock, indicate late stage adjustment of the consolidated shell to pressures from the interior. The main body of the quartz diorite pluton is compositionally zoned. Potassium feldspar and quartz increase inward; whereas color index decreases inward. Chemically, the stock exhibits a calc-alkaline trend of differentiation. The Echols <b>Mountain</b> <b>stock,</b> about four square miles in area, is similar in petrography to the Deep Creek stock. Flow structure outlines a dome, however, rather than a funnel. Neither the Deep Creek nor the Echols <b>Mountain</b> <b>stock</b> is metamorphosed. The eleven plutons of the map area represent three episodes of Mesozoic plutonism that in part straddle the time interval between emplacement of the Late Permian-Middle Triassic Canyon Mountain complex (Thayer and Brown, 1964) and the Middle Cretaceous-Early Tertiary Idaho batholith...|$|R

40|$|Detailed oxygen, {{hydrogen}} and carbon isotope {{studies have been}} carried out on igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Stony Mountain complex, Colorado, and the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in order to better understand the problems of hydrothermal meteoric water-rock interaction. The Tertiary Stony <b>Mountain</b> <b>stock</b> (1. 3 km in diameter), is composed of an outer diorite, a main mass of biotite gabbro, and an inner diorite. The entire complex and most of the surrounding country rocks have experienced various degrees of 18 O depletion (up to 10 per mil) due to interaction with heated meteoric waters. The inner diorite apparently formed from a low- 18 O magma with δ 18 O ≃ + 2. 5, but most of the isotopic effects are a result of exchange between H 2 O and solidified igneous rocks. The low- 18 O inner diorite magma was probably produced by massive assimilation and/or melting of hydrothermally altered country rocks. The δ 18 O values of the rocks generally increase with increasing grain size, except that quartz typically has δ 18 O = + 6 to + 8, and is more resistant to hydrothermal exchange than any other mineral studied.

40|$|The Elk and Sawatch Mountains {{of eastern}} Gunnison County, Colorado, contain felsic igneous rocks that were emplaced episodically during three {{intervals}} of time. The intervals were between 75 to 55 Ma, 42 to 26 Ma, and 25 to 0 Ma. This study reports {{the changes in}} magmatic style and source region that have occurred through this period of time. ^ Four groups with distinctive geochemical signatures were identified. Group I includes the Laramide Dustin Gulch and Fossil Ridge stock, and the middle Tertiary Gold Hill intrusive. These stocks are metaluminous and have Ta decoupled from Nb. The group also possesses a normative mineralogy that is high in anorthite and pyroxene, and low in quartz and orthoclase. They formed from an oxidized, mafic source. The group is similar to rocks that contain Laramide Cu-porphyry mineralization, but the stocks {{in this study are}} barren of mineralization. ^ Group II includes the Hillerton, Pitkin, Seeton Mine, Buck Gulch, and South Matchless <b>Mountain</b> <b>stocks.</b> They are non-mineralized and middle Tertiary in age. They are mildly- to strongly-peraluminous, have normative mineralogy high in quartz and corundum, and are low in pyroxene. Tantalum is decoupled from Nb, the concentrations Y and the heavy rare earth elements are variable and depleted. This suggests that garnet was an important mineral phase in the magmatic source. The Group II source was oxidized and meta-sedimentary. ^ Group III is associated with precious- and base-metal mineralization and includes the middle Tertiary Crested Butte laccolith and the quartz monzonite phases of the Italian Mountain and Mount Princeton intrusive centers and the Late Tertiary Round Mountain. This group is metaluminous, has normative mineralogy high in quartz and orthoclase, but is low in anorthite and corundum. They are different from the stocks of Group I and II in that both Ta and Nb have low concentrations. These rocks formed from a less oxidized felsic meta-igneous (or gneissic) source. ^ Group IV is limited to the Late Tertiary Boston Peak topaz rhyolite. It is highly fractionated, possesses a strong negative Eu anomaly, is light rare earth element depleted and heavy rare earth element enriched compared to Groups I, II or III. It has characteristics typical of the igneous rocks associated with stockwork Mo deposits (Climax-type) and formed from a F-enriched crustal source. ^ The groups (and stocks) reflect the geochemical characteristics associated with the change from subduction to extensional tectonics. Laramide subduction-related magmas occurred between 76 to 71 Ma. The source for these magmas was mafic and produced the stocks of Group I. During the second magmatic pulse, between 41 to 37 Ma, magma was produced from mafic, meta-sedimentary, and meta-igneous sources (Groups I, II, and III, respectively). At about 30 Ma North America overrode the Pacific spreading center and subduction ceased. Between 33 to 29 Ma the only sources to produce magmas were from Groups II and III. Afterward, the magmatic style changed to the bimodal magmatism typical for the extensional tectonics of the Rio Grande rift. Between 14 to 10 Ma magmas were produced in this area only from meta-igneous (Group III) and F-enriched crustal (Group IV) sources. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mountain</b> soils <b>stock</b> large {{quantities}} of carbon as particulate organic matter that may be highly vulnerable to climate change. To explore potential shifts in soil organic matter (SOM) form and stability under climate change (warming and reduced precipitations), we studied the dynamics of SOM pools of a mountain grassland in the Swiss Jura {{as part of a}} climate manipulation experiment. The climate manipulation (elevational soil transplantation) was set up in October 2009 and simulated two realistic climate change scenarios. After 4 years of manipulation, we performed SOM physical fractionation to extract SOM fractions corresponding to specific turnover rates, in winter and in summer. Soil organic matter fraction chemistry was studied with ultraviolet, 3 D fluorescence, and mid-infrared spectroscopies. The most labile SOM fractions showed high intra-annual dynamics (amounts and chemistry) mediated via the seasonal changes of fresh plant debris inputs and confirming their high contribution to the microbial loop. Our climate change manipulation modified the chemical differences between free and intra-aggregate organic matter, suggesting a modification of soil macro-aggregates dynamics. Interestingly, the 4 -year climate manipulation affected directly the SOM dynamics, with a decrease in organic C bulk soil content, resulting from significant C-losses in the mineral-associated SOM fraction (MAOM), the most stable form of SOM. This SOC decrease was associated with a decrease in clay content, above- and belowground plants biomass, soil microbial biomass and activity. The combination of these climate changes effects on the plant–soil system could have led to increase C-losses from the MAOM fraction through clay-SOM washing out and DOC leaching in this subalpine grassland...|$|R

I evaluated the relative performance of triploid versus diploid brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) <b>stocked</b> in high <b>mountain</b> Uinta lakes in response to food availability and lake morphology. I chose a set of 9 lakes that included a range of elevation and lake morphology. I observed no difference in CPUE or relative weight (Wr) of both types of trout in all lakes. Food availability (e. g., zooplankton and macroinvertebrates) varied substantially among lakes; however I observed no discernible difference between diploid and triploid diets, diet preference, or isotopic trophic signatures. Physical lake characteristics (e. g., dissolved oxygen [DO, mg/L] and temperature [°C]) were within or near optimal brook trout conditions (metabolically beneficial range) during the summer, but over-winter DO reached near lethal levels under the ice. In sum, between the two strains, I did not observe any significant differences in relative performance measured across a number of indices; however the size distribution of diploid fish was marginally (20 mm) skewed towards larger fish (a difference likely not great enough to be detectable by the average angler). In contrast to the similarity in performance between strains, I did observe considerable variability in performance of brook trout across lakes {{as a function of}} lake productivity, food availability, and most importantly fish density. Fish performance was greater in lakes with a lower density of stocked fish. Overall, the results from this study indicate triploid brook trout offer a viable and risk-averse alternative to stocking diploid fish in Uinta <b>mountain</b> lakes. <b>Stocking</b> triploid fish should decrease the threat of uncontrolled expansion into adjacent water bodies, while still allowing managers to maintain a popular non-native sport fishery...|$|R
