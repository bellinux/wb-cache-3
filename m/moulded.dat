5|$|A mould {{is usually}} {{designed}} so that the <b>moulded</b> part reliably remains on the ejector (B) side of the mould when it opens, and draws the runner and the sprue out of the (A) side along with the parts. The part then falls freely when ejected from the (B) side. Tunnel gates, also known as submarine or mould gates, are located below the parting line or mould surface. An opening is machined into {{the surface of the}} mould on the parting line. The <b>moulded</b> part is cut (by the mould) from the runner system on ejection from the mould. Ejector pins, also known as knockout pins, are circular pins placed in either half of the mould (usually the ejector half), which push the finished <b>moulded</b> product, or runner system out of a mould.The ejection of the article using pins, sleeves, strippers, etc., may cause undesirable impressions or distortion, so care must be taken when designing the mould.|$|E
5|$|Some moulds allow {{previously}} <b>moulded</b> {{parts to}} be reinserted {{to allow a}} new plastic layer to form around the first part. This {{is often referred to}} as overmoulding. This system can allow for production of one-piece tires and wheels.|$|E
40|$|When hybrid <b>moulds</b> {{are used}} for the {{production}} of injection <b>moulds,</b> mostly the <b>mould</b> designer and/or plastic processor ignore the implementation of multiple <b>mould</b> materials and its effect on the polymer processing and material characteristics. This effect of <b>mould</b> material selection for injection <b>moulds</b> is underestimated. When one selects a <b>mould</b> material with poor or good thermal behaviour, it results in slower or faster cooling down of the polymer with positive or negative influence on the rheology of the injected polymer. To analyse the effect of <b>mould</b> material on the rheology of polymers, a hybrid micro injection <b>mould</b> of a spiral flow part was designed in which the flow length has been analysed for several injection <b>moulding</b> parameters and <b>mould</b> materials. Both <b>mould</b> and polymer analyses resulted in {{a better understanding of the}} rheology during the injection <b>moulding</b> process of hybrid <b>moulds.</b> It also resulted in a better understanding of the needed <b>mould</b> design strategy for multiple material <b>moulds</b> related to rheology, specially for micro injection <b>moulding.</b> Conventionally, micro <b>moulds</b> use techniques such as inductive heating to optimise the rheology. The research has proven that appropriate <b>mould</b> material selection can eliminate the need of <b>mould</b> heating during the injection process...|$|R

50|$|In {{injection}} <b>moulding,</b> hand <b>moulds</b> {{refer to}} simple <b>moulds</b> {{that have no}} provision for heat, cooling, or ejection. This means when a hand <b>mould</b> is cycled universal heating plates are required to warm the <b>moulds</b> and the <b>moulds</b> must be removed after each cycle to remove the mouldings. This drastically increases the cycle time, which limits it to short runs, but to offset this is the low cost of the <b>mould.</b> They are usually single cavity <b>moulds,</b> but may be multi-cavity if the <b>moulding</b> is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of {{the simplicity of the}} parts. If only a short run is required then the <b>moulds</b> may be made from aluminum or brass, but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional steels.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the time}} to market for metal casting {{products}} is becoming shorter, thus the lead time available for making the wax injection <b>mould</b> is decreasing.

40|$|<b>Moulding</b> is {{a process}} in which by pouring a molten metal into a <b>mould</b> cavity which is created by keeping the {{required}} shape of pattern on the molding sand and allowing the molten metal to solidify by cooling slowly.

If we want more number of same design but not identical parts then it is not possible from a single <b>mould,</b> this drawback can be overcome by family <b>moulding.</b> This paper tells how can be able to get more number of same design but not identical parts. In another words we can say that two different parts can be produced from a single <b>mould.</b> This <b>mould</b> is called family <b>mould.</b> Family <b>mould</b> design consists of a complete <b>mould</b> with a few or many different cavity inserts that runs as a multiple part.

5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be {{inserted into the}} cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them.

40|$|Three-dimensional finite-element thermal-stress {{models have}} been {{developed}} to predict temperature, distortion and residual stress in the <b>mould</b> of thin slab continuous casters. Geometrically, {{there are two kinds of}} <b>mould</b> to achieve high-speed casting: funnel-shaped and parallel <b>mould.</b> The <b>mould</b> shape and high casting speed leads to higher <b>mould</b> temperatures and shorter <b>mould</b> life than in conventional slab casters. The purpose of this study is to investigate the heat flux and the effects of <b>mould</b> shape on distortion of the <b>mould</b> in a thin slab caster. <b>Mould</b> wall temperature measured in the plant was analyzed to determine corresponding the heat-flux profiles in thin slab <b>moulds</b> using an Inverse Heat Conduction model, and this data was then used in an elastic-visco-plastic analysis to investigate the deformation of the <b>moulds</b> in service for different the <b>mould</b> shapes. The model predictions of temperature and distortion during operation match plant observations. During operation, the hot face temperature reaches 430 oC and the copper plates bend toward the steel, with a maximum outward distortion of about 0. 3 mm. This occurs just above the center of the wide faces, and is smaller than the distortion of a conventional slab <b>mould...</b>|$|R
