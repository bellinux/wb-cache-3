The role of laser operational parameters, laser beam scan speed, pulse frequency, {{the number of times}} that the machined area is fully scanned (number of repetition), and the scanning strategy, was investigated, allowing to identify the most suitable processing window in terms of surface quality and <b>machined</b> <b>depth.</b> Too low and too high scan speed leads to a darkening of the machined surface. Furthermore, the <b>machined</b> <b>depth</b> increases as the scan speed decreases. Between the strategies adopted, the best result, in terms of <b>machined</b> <b>depth</b> and surface quality, is given by the CROSS strategy.

40|$|Ultra-thin films (e. g., graphene, MoS 2, {{and black}} phosphorus) have shown amazing {{performance}} {{in a variety of}} applications. The tailoring or machining of these ultra-thin films is often the preliminary step to manufacturing them into functional devices. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a flexible, high-efficiency and low-cost tailoring or machining tool with the advantages of high resolution and precision. However, the current AFM-based tailoring methods are often set up as an open loop regarding the <b>machined</b> <b>depth</b> and state. Thus, {{because of a lack of}} real-time feedback, an inappropriate applied force leads to over-cutting or under-cutting, which limits the performance of the manufactured devices. In this study, we propose a real-time tailoring and sensing method based on an ultrasonic vibration-assisted (USV-assisted) AFM system to solve the above problems. With the proposed method, the <b>machined</b> <b>depth</b> and state can be sensed in real time by detecting the phase value of the vibrating cantilever. To characterize and gain insight into the phase responses of the cantilever to the <b>machined</b> <b>depth</b> and sample material, a theoretical dynamic model of a cantilever-film vibrating system is introduced to model the machining process, and a sensing theory of <b>machined</b> <b>depth</b> and state is developed based on a USV-assisted AFM system.

However, debris effects during mechanical lithography often lead to an unstable machining process and inaccurate results, which limits further applications of AFM-based lithography. There {{is a lack of}} a real-time debris detection approach, which is the prerequisite to eventually eliminating the influence of the debris, and of a method that can solve the above problems well. The ultrasonic vibration (USV) -assisted AFM has the ability to sense the <b>machining</b> <b>depth</b> in real time by detecting the phase shifting of cantilever. However, whether the pile-up of debris affect the phase response of cantilever is still lack of investigation. Therefore, we analyzed the mechanism of the debris effect on force control mode and investigated the relationship between phase shifting and pile-up of debris. Theoretical analysis and experimental results reveal that the pile-up of debris have negligible effect on phase shifting of cantilever. Therefore, the phase shifting-based method can detect the debris effect on <b>machining</b> <b>depth</b> in force control mode of AFM machining...|$|E

The demand for incorporating in-situ diagnostics technology into the micromachining environment is driven by the increasing need for producing micro-parts of high quality and accuracy. Laser interferometry can be used as an on-line monitoring tool and it is the aim of this work to enhance the understanding and application of Michelson interferometry principle for the in-situ diagnostics of the <b>machining</b> <b>depth</b> on the sub-micron and micron scales. micromachining is done on two different materials and a comprehensive investigation is done to control the width and depth of the machined feature. To control the width of the feature, laser micromachining is done on copper and a detailed analysis is performed. The objective of this experiment is to make a precision mask for sputtering with an array of holes on it using an Nd:YAG laser of 532 nm wavelength. The diameter of the hole is 50 {micro}m and the spacing between holes (the distance between the centers) is 100 {micro}m. Michelson interferometer is integrated with a laser machining system to control the depth of machining. An excimer laser of 308 nm wavelength is used for micromachining. A He-Ne laser of 632. 8 nm wavelength is used as the light source for the interferometer. Interference patterns are created due to the change in the path length between the two interferometer arms. The machined depth information is obtained from the interference patterns on an oscilloscope detected by a photodiode. To compare the predicted depth by the interferometer with the true <b>machining</b> <b>depth,</b> a surface profilometer is used to measure the actual <b>machining</b> <b>depth</b> on the silicon.

Separate pits can be generated with scratching velocities larger than the critical value of 100  μm/s. The total number of fabricated pits can reach nearly 4800 – 5800 in 1  s, when the scratching velocity is a constant value ranging from 200 to 900  μm/s. According to the stress relaxation modulus theory, the polymer surface is in the condition of a glass state when applying a high-frequency load. The energy applied on the sample surface is not large enough to break PMMA molecular chains during one penetration of the AFM tip. To form one pit, 65 to 80 penetrations are required. For the initial stage of penetration, elastic deformation is the dominant material removal mechanism. When the number of penetrations reaches 40 times, the polymer chains start to break and plastic deformation occurs. With increasing penetration depth, {{the height of the}} material accumulated beside the machined pit becomes larger, which will lead to an increase in the tangential force applied on the tip apex. This is the possible reason for the AFM tip sliding over the pile-up, after which one pit is created. Finally, pit arrays with dimensions of 5  μm, spacing distance of 70  nm, and <b>machined</b> <b>depth</b> of 2.5  nm are achieved successfully. FFT images are used to reveal the relationship between the density of pits and the scratching velocity.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDebris {{distribution}} and dielectric fluid flow within the machining gap in {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) are important factors related to stable and precision machining. Hence understanding of the debris removal process is essential in improving EDM process. In this research, electrode jump motion with different jump heights and speeds was investigated to comprehend {{its effect on the}} fluid flow and debris-fluid interaction. A simplified fluid dynamics model characterizing the motion of the square shape electrode was established to study theoretically the effect of electrode jump speed on the debris-fluid flow. A setup to realize the electrode motion was designed. The Z-axis equipped with a linear motor was used to provide high speed jump function. The flow images were recorded by a high-speed camera, and the flow of the debris inside the hole was captured for analysis. Analytical results show that the fluid pressure at the bottom region of the electrode would reduce with the increase of electrode jump speed. Bubbles are generated once this pressure falls below the vapor pressure of the fluid. For the square shape electrode, it is found from the experiment that bubbles are prone to occur when the <b>machining</b> <b>depth</b> is increased. The result also shows that debris can be excluded easier when the electrode jump height is larger than 1 / 4 <b>machining</b> <b>depth.</b> Furthermore, using a large jump height incorporated with an electrode jump speed near the critical speed of bubble generation results in the most effective debris removal. On the other hand, the flow field of a high aspect ratio thin and flat electrode is {{different from that of the}} square electrode. There is no bubble generated during high-speed jump motion.
