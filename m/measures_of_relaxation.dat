40|$|BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors {{increase}} myocardial contractility {{and decrease}} left ventricular (LV) afterload. We studied whether these effects altered LV {{response to an}} increase in cardiac load and affected length-dependent regulation of myocardial function. METHODS: Before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, a high-fidelity pressure catheter was positioned in the left ventricle and the left atrium in 10 coronary surgery patients. LV response to an increased cardiac load, caused by leg elevation, was assessed during baseline conditions and after administration of milrinone at a dose of 20 micrograms kg- 1 over 15 min. Effects on contraction were measured by changes in maximal rate of pressure development (dP/dtmax). Effects on relaxation were assessed by analysis of changes in maximum rate of pressure decrease and by analysis of the load dependency of myocardial relaxation (R = slope of the relation between the time constant of isovolumic relaxation and end systolic pressure). RESULTS: Milrinone increased dP/dtmax but <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxation</b> were unaltered. Leg elevation had more effect on measures of contraction and relaxation after milrinone than at baseline. The relationship between R and changes in dP/dtmax shifted downwards and to the right with milrinone, whereas the relationship between R and changes in end diastolic pressure (EDP) shifted downwards and to the left. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that milrinone improved contraction, reduced the load dependency of LV pressure decrease, and reduced the change in EDP after leg elevatio...|$|E

Was also analyzed his cognitive, socio-emotional and psychomotor performance, in addition to the interaction between family and school. This case-study was characterized as qualitative and ethnographic in which was used the technique of participant observation. The active family participation in the student educational process, along with the interaction promoted by the school in its activities, made him reach a satisfactory level of development. The student showed good memory, could read both words in cursive as with capital letters and solve addition and subtraction when used concrete materials.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of drastic labour market changes in the late 1990 s, many employees experienced more stress in the workplace. Prolonged exposure to stress can lead to {{physical and mental health}} problems, and rehabilitation takes a long time. The lack of established rehabilitation programmes for patients with stress-related mental disorders has opened up for the use of garden/nature in a multimodal rehabilitation context (Nature- Based Therapy, NBT). The aim of Study I was to explore how participants in an Nature-Based Rehabilitation (NBR) experienced their rehabilitation. Study II aimed to explore effects on burnout, work ability, stress-related health symptoms, and sick leave from participation in a nature-based stress management course (NBSC) and to investigate how the nature/garden content was experienced. Study III aimed to explore the effects of NBR in individuals with long sick leave due to stress-related mental disorders and to explore the development of sick leave and health care utilization. Study IV aimed to examine potential environmental effects on directed attention and physiological <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxation</b> in nature and indoors. Validated self-assessment instruments, data from regional and national registers and semi-structured interviews were used. Education about nature opened up for new perspectives on life; thus, nature triggered existential reflection, which enhanced the recovery process. Nature and garden were experienced as supportive environments. Results for participants in the NBSC showed decreased burnout-scores and long-term sick leaves, and increased work ability; furthermore less stress-related symptoms were reported. The same pattern was seen for the NBR participants concerning burnout and also for depression, anxiety and wellbeing, reduced health care utilization, and a movement from ordinary sickness benefit to rehabilitation benefit was seen. Improved directed attention after relaxation in nature was seen. No environmental effects were seen for blood pressure or heart rate. The results indicate that the NBT in this thesis was successful in both prevention and rehabilitation, and in restarting a stalled rehabilitation process. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite major {{advances}} {{in care of}} premature infants, survivors exhibit mild cognitive deficits in around 40 %. Beside severe intraventricular haemorrhages (IVH) and cystic periventricular leucomalacia (PVL), more subtle patterns such as grade I and II IVH, punctuate WM lesions and diffuse PVL might {{be linked to the}} cognitive deficits. Grey matter disease is also recognized to contribute to long-term cognitive impairment. ¦OBJECTIVE: We intend to use novel MR techniques to study more precisely the different injury patterns. In particular MP 2 RAGE (magnetization prepared dual rapid echo gradient) produces high-resolution quantitative T 1 relaxation maps. This contrast is known to reflect tissue anomalies such as white matter injury in general and dysmyelination in particular. We also used diffusion tensor imaging, a quantitative technique known to reflect white matter maturation and disease. ¦DESIGN/METHODS: All preterm infants born under 30 weeks of GA were included. Serial 3 T MR-imaging using a neonatal head-coil at DOL 3, 10 and at term equivalent age (TEA), using DTI and MP 2 RAGE sequences was performed. MP 2 RAGE generates a T 1 map and allows calculating the relaxation time T 1. Multiple measurements were performed for each exam in 12 defined white and grey matter ROIs. ¦RESULTS: 16 patients were recruited: mean GA 27 2 / 7 w (191, 2 d SD± 10, 8), mean BW 999 g (SD± 265). 39 MRIs were realized (12 early: mean 4, 83 d± 1, 75, 13 late: mean 18, 77 d± 8, 05 and 14 at TEA: 88, 91 d± 8, 96). <b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>relaxation</b> time T 1 show a gradual and significant decrease over time (for ROI PLIC mean±SD in ms: 2100. 53 ± 102, 75, 2116, 5 ± 41, 55 and 1726, 42 ± 51, 31 and for ROI central WM: 2302, 25 ± 79, 02, 2315, 02 ± 115, 02 and 1992, 7 ± 96, 37 for early, late and TEA MR respectively). These trends are also observed in grey matter area, especially in thalamus. Measurements of ADC values show similar monotonous decrease over time. ¦CONCLUSIONS: From these preliminary results, we conclude that quantitative MR imaging in very preterm infants is feasible. On the successive MP 2 RAGE and DTI sequences, we observe a gradual decrease over time in the described ROIs, representing the progressive maturation of the WM micro-structure and interestingly the same evolution is observed in the grey matter. We speculate that our study will provide normative values for T 1 map and ADC and might be a predictive factor for favourable or less favourable outcome...|$|E

Microrheometrical measurements are usually carried out in microfluidic devices made of Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Although PDMS is a very cheap material, it is also very easy to deform.

A summary of the various different methods <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>relaxation</b> rate is also provided. The rates of twitch contraction and relaxation were measured in 30 symptom-free subjects following bilateral direct electrical stimulation of the masseter muscles. The resulting twitch force was recorded via a force transducer placed between the anterior teeth. The transducer was held between the teeth with as little force as possible while four single stimuli were delivered at 5 -s intervals. The stimulating electrodes were then removed and replaced and the experiment was repeated. The force records of the resulting twitches were averaged and the half-contraction time, twitch amplitude and half-relaxation time were measured. There was a significant difference in half-relaxation time between males and females, being faster in females (P= 0 · 0045, independent t-test).

This sufficient condition {{is related to the}} existence of a solution to a Riccati equation involving the path acceleration. Comment: 34 pages, comments welcom...|$|R
