5|$|Some {{biologists}} {{were concerned}} about the mutant fungi being a major <b>microbiological</b> hazard for humans, and reaching Earth in the splashdown, after having been in an isolated environment for 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} <b>microbiological</b> laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Thom was the U.S. Delegate to the 1905 International Dairy Congress held in Paris, France. He helped {{establish}} a graduate education {{program at the}} USDA. In 1907, he became a charter member of the Dairy Association of America, and in 1918, was appointed President of the Bacteriological Association of Washington. He attended the 1935 International Soil Congress in Oxford, England and was Vice President of the 1939 International <b>Microbiological</b> Congress in New York. He {{was a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences, a charter member of the Mycological Society of America, and president of the Society of American Bacteriologists in 1940 and the Society of Industrial Microbiology in 1950. Thom was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science degree by Lake Forest College in 1936. For his work on penicillin, he and his research group received the Lasker Group Award in 1946, and the USDA Distinguished Service Award in 1947. The same year, he received a gold medal from the Spanish National Research Council for his contributions to microbiology and medicine.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, he was {{assigned}} to an important work-deputy chief of the Head Office of <b>microbiological</b> industry in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|<b>Microbiological</b> {{parameters}} include Coliform bacteria, E. coli, {{and specific}} pathogenic species of bacteria (such as cholera-causing Vibrio cholerae), viruses, and protozoan parasites.|$|E
25|$|Direct <b>microbiological</b> {{techniques}} {{are the ultimate}} measurement of pathogen contamination, but these are costly and time-consuming (24–48 hours), which means that products are able to spoil by the time pasteurization is verified.|$|E
25|$|A {{drainage}} system removes leachate. Otherwise, excess moisture can cause anaerobic conditions and impede decomposition. Urine diversion can improve compost quality, since urine contains {{large amounts of}} ammonia that inhibits <b>microbiological</b> activity.|$|E
25|$|The Centre for {{epidemic}} and <b>microbiological</b> {{research and}} treatment {{was constructed in}} the Guinean Kindia province. The Centre was designed and created by RUSAL specialists {{with the assistance of}} Rospotrebnadzor scientists (RUSAL has invested $10m).|$|E
25|$|According to {{a survey}} {{on behalf of the}} Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources {{published}} in 2012, 88% of the functional water supply schemes in Pakistan provide water that is unsafe for drinking because of <b>microbiological</b> contamination.|$|E
25|$|Also, in 1989 in the USSR, {{the public}} {{environmental}} concerns made the government decide {{to close down}} (or convert to different technologies) all 8 paraffin-fed-yeast plants that the Soviet Ministry of <b>Microbiological</b> Industry had by that time.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the town}} has on its {{territory}} a sewage treatment plant and a waste processing plant for incineration and recycling. It has also set up waste sorting and heads the Joint Association of Granville Coastal Areas for coastal protection against <b>microbiological</b> hazards.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} water from the public mains is usually quite high and {{compliant}} with EU drinking water standards. However 2011 reports noted poor <b>microbiological</b> quality in some rural private group water schemes and groundwater and challenged the authorities then responsible for drinking water.|$|E
25|$|The southeastern State of São Paulo, with a {{monitoring}} system considered very good, registered in its latest study high <b>microbiological</b> indexes indicative of pollution from domestic sewage both {{upstream and downstream}} in the Bairro da Serra River and even higher rated from two its main tributary streams.|$|E
25|$|At its 2002 meeting, the Committee on the Taxonomy of Leptospira of the International Union of <b>Microbiological</b> Societies {{approved}} the following nomenclature for serovars of Leptospira. Genus and species must of course be italicized, with the serovar name not italicized {{and with an}} upper case first letter.|$|E
25|$|On 14 November 2002, {{authorities}} in Ireland were {{cited by the}} European Court of Justice over the <b>microbiological</b> contamination of hundreds {{of public and private}} water supplies. The EU's Drinking Water Directive requires an absence of E. coli in drinking water supplies to protect human health.|$|E
25|$|Of most {{importance}} {{is that the}} ingredient meets the agreed specification on all major parameters. This {{is not only the}} functional parameter (in other words, the level of the major constituent), but the level of impurities, the <b>microbiological</b> status, and physical parameters such as color, particle size, etc.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the {{movement}} of groundwater has been studied separately from surface water, climatology, and even the chemical and <b>microbiological</b> aspects of hydrogeology (the processes are uncoupled). As the field of hydrogeology matures, the strong interactions between groundwater, surface water, water chemistry, soil moisture and even climate are becoming more clear.|$|E
25|$|If the {{effusion}} {{is caused}} by infection, <b>microbiological</b> culture may yield the infectious organism responsible for the infection, sometimes before other cultures (e.g. blood cultures and sputum cultures) become positive. A Gram stain may give a rough indication of the causative organism. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain may identify tuberculosis or other mycobacterial diseases.|$|E
25|$|In {{environmental}} science {{and particularly in}} chemistry and microbiology, a parameter is used to describe a discrete chemical or <b>microbiological</b> entity that can be assigned a value: commonly a concentration, but {{may also be a}} logical entity (present or absent), a statistical result such as a 95%ile value or in some cases a subjective value.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} gained a greater understanding of microbiology and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, Chaim Weizmann first used a pure <b>microbiological</b> culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing corn starch using Clostridium acetobutylicum, to produce acetone, which the United Kingdom desperately needed to manufacture explosives during World War I.|$|E
25|$|A {{biosafety}} cabinet (BSC)—also {{called a}} biological safety cabinet or <b>microbiological</b> safety cabinet—is an enclosed, ventilated laboratory workspace for safely working with materials contaminated with (or potentially contaminated with) pathogens requiring a defined biosafety level. Several {{different types of}} BSC exist, differentiated by the degree of biocontainment required. BSCs first became commercially available in 1950.|$|E
25|$|Shelf life {{depends on}} the {{degradation}} mechanism of the specific product. Most can be influenced by several factors: exposure to light, heat, moisture, transmission of gases, mechanical stresses, and contamination by things such as micro-organisms. Product quality is often mathematically modelled around a parameter (concentration of a chemical compound, a <b>microbiological</b> index, or moisture content).|$|E
25|$|A second {{indicator}} of quality is the compliance with <b>microbiological</b> water norms. WHO/UNESCO has recently developed a Rapid Assessment of Drinking-Water Quality (RADWQ) survey method. On average, in developing countries, {{compliance with the}} who norms is close to 90% for piped water, and between 40% and 70% for other improved sources. No national or regional data have been published yet.|$|E
25|$|Agar {{has been}} used as an {{ingredient}} in desserts throughout Asia, and also as a solid substrate to contain culture media for <b>microbiological</b> work. Agar {{can be used as a}} laxative, an appetite suppressant, a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, a thickener for soups, in fruit preserves, ice cream, and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in brewing, and for sizing paper and fabrics.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} {{publication of the}} International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICSP) and of the International Union of <b>Microbiological</b> Societies (Bacteriology and Applied Microbiology Division), the journal is the single official international forum for the publication of new species names for prokaryotes. In addition to research papers, the journal also publishes the minutes of meetings of the ICSP and its various subcommittees.|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{scientists}} have developed methods for producing a {{human growth hormone}} and interferon, a group of proteins effective against viral infections. Copaxone, a medicine effective {{in the treatment of}} multiple sclerosis, was developed in Israel from basic research to industrial production. Genetic engineering has resulted {{in a wide range of}} diagnostic kits based on monoclonal antibodies, with other <b>microbiological</b> products.|$|E
25|$|The {{dental plaque}} biofilm {{can result in}} the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) <b>microbiological</b> populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic <b>microbiological</b> population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion. By preventing the dental plaque biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E
25|$|The {{guidance}} {{issued by}} the UK government's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) now recommends that <b>microbiological</b> monitoring for wet cooling systems, using a dipslide, should be performed weekly. The guidance now also recommends that routine testing for legionella bacteria in wet cooling systems be carried out at least quarterly, and more frequently when a system is being commissioned, or if the bacteria have been identified on a previous occasion.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the unsuitability of <b>microbiological</b> techniques, milk {{pasteurization}} efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which is denatured by pasteurization. B. tuberculosis, the bacterium that requires the highest temperature to be killed of all milk pathogens is killed at ranges of temperature and time similar to those that denature alkaline phosphatase. For this reason, presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Routine {{complete}} {{blood count}} (CBC), basic metabolic profile, liver enzymes, and coagulation should be performed. Most experts recommend a diagnostic paracentesis be performed if the ascites is new or if the patient with ascites is being admitted to the hospital. The fluid is then reviewed for its gross appearance, protein level, albumin, and cell counts (red and white). Additional tests will be performed if indicated such as <b>microbiological</b> culture, Gram stain and cytopathology.|$|E
25|$|The Spectronic 20 can be {{used for}} turbidimetric measurements. In <b>microbiological</b> work, the {{turbidity}} of a liquid culture of bacterial cells relates to the cell count, and OD600 measurements can be conducted for this purpose using the Spectronic 20. Likewise the turbidity of water suspensions of clays and other particles of size suitable for light scattering can be quantitatively determined by means of a Spectronic 20. In the past, the Spectronic 20 was used for clinical diagnostic purposes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to biological barriers, the conference advocated {{the use of}} additional safety factors. One such safety factor was physical containment, exemplified {{by the use of}} hoods or where applicable, limited access or negative pressure laboratories. Another factor was the strict adherence to good <b>microbiological</b> practices, which would limit the escape of organisms from the experimental situation. Additionally, the education and training of all personnel involved in the experiments would be essential to effective containment measures.|$|E
25|$|Hazardous moulds {{which can}} foul {{air and water}} filters may develop aboard space stations. They can produce acids which degrade metal, glass, and rubber. They can also be harmful for the crew's health. <b>Microbiological</b> hazards {{have led to a}} {{development}} of the LOCAD-PTS that can identify common bacteria and moulds faster than standard methods of culturing, which may require a sample to be sent back to Earth. , 76 types of unregulated micro-organisms have been detected on the ISS.|$|E
25|$|Impedance {{microbiology}} is a rapid <b>microbiological</b> {{technique used}} to measure the microbial concentration (mainly bacteria but also yeasts) of a sample by monitoring the electrical parameters of the growth medium. It is {{based on the fact that}} bacteria metabolism transforms uncharged (or weakly charged) compounds into highly charged compounds thus changing the growth medium electrical properties. The microbial concentration is estimated on the time required for the monitored electrical parameters to deviate from the initial baseline value.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, at the 5th International Congress for Microbiology, {{a journal}} was {{established}} to disseminate the committee's conclusions to the <b>microbiological</b> community. It first appeared the following year under the title of International Bulletin of Bacteriological Nomenclature and Taxonomy. In 1980, the ICSP published an exhaustive list of all existing bacterial species considered valid in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names. Thereafter, the committee's Code required all new names to be either published or indexed in its journal to be deemed valid.|$|E
25|$|MALDI/TOF spectra {{are used}} for the {{identification}} of micro-organisms such as bacteria or fungi. A portion of a colony of the microbe in question is placed onto the sample target and overlaid with matrix. The mass spectra generated are analyzed by dedicated software and compared with stored profiles. Species diagnosis by this procedure is much faster, more accurate and cheaper than other procedures based on immunological or biochemical tests. MALDI/TOF is becoming a standard method for species identification in medical <b>microbiological</b> laboratories.|$|E
