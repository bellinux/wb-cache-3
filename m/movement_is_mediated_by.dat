50|$|N. gonorrhoeae possess many dynamic {{polymeric}} protein filaments called type IV pili, {{which allow}} the bacteria to adhere and move along surfaces. The bacterial <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> twitching motility {{powered by the}} extension and retraction of the type IV pilus. Pili extend and attach to a substrate that signals the pilus to retract, dragging the cell forward. N. gonorrhoeae is able to pull 100,000 times its own weight, {{and it has been}} claimed that the pili used to do so are the strongest biological motor known to date, exerting one nanonewton. The pulling of type IV pilus is powered by a set of ATPases proteins: Pil F (extension) and Pil T (retraction). The type IV pilus in N. gonorrhoeae adhesive properties also play a role in microcolony aggregation and biofilm formation.|$|E
50|$|Microtubule <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> {{a family}} of motor {{proteins}} known as kinesins, such as Kar3 in yeast. Accessory proteins, such as Spc72 in yeast, act as a glue, connecting the motor protein, spindle pole body and microtubule in a structure known as the half-bridge. Other proteins, such as Kar9 and Bim1 in yeast, attach to the plus end of the microtubules. They are activated by pheromone signals to attach to the shmoo tip. A shmoo is a projection of the cellular membrane which {{is the site of}} initial cell fusion in plasmogamy. After plasmogamy, the microtubule plus ends continue to grow towards the opposite pronucleus. It is thought that the growing plus end of the microtubule attaches directly to the motor protein of the opposite pronucleus, triggering a reorganization of the proteins at the half-bridge. The force necessary for migration occurs directly in response to this interaction.|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} Na+-stimulated ATPase {{activity in}} a mutant of Streptococcus faecalis defective {{in the generation}} of proton motive force. The activity in membrane vesicles was 62. 1 +/- 5. 9 nmol of phosphate produced per min per mg of protein when cells were grown on medium containing 0. 12 M Na+. Activity decreased as the concentration of Na+ in the growth medium decreased. The decrease in enzyme activity corresponded to the decrease in transport activity for Na+ in both whole cells and membrane vesicles. The effects of pH on both activities were identical. Thus, {{it is suggested that}} Na+ <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> this enzyme. Sodium extrusion and ATPase activity in the wild-type strain were markedly lower than those observed in the mutant strain. Elevated activities of both Na+ extrusion and Na+-stimulated ATPase could be detected in the wild-type strain when cells were grown in the absence of proton motive force. Thus, we propose that the level of ATPase is increased by dissipation of the proton motive force...|$|E

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that intracellular phagosome movement requires microtubules. Here we {{provide evidence that}} within cells phagosomes display two different kinds of microtubule-based movements in approximately equal proportions. The first type occurs predominantly in the cell periphery, often shortly after the phagosome is formed, and at speeds below 0. 1 μm/second. The second is faster (0. 2 - 1. 5 μm/second) and occurs mainly after phagosomes have reached the cell interior. Treating cells with nanomolar concentrations of taxol or nocodazole alters microtubule dynamics without affecting either total polymer mass or microtubule organisation. Such treatments slow the accumulation of phagosomes in the perinuclear region and {{reduce the number of}} slow movements by up to 50 % without affecting the frequency of fast movements. This suggests that a proportion of slow <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> microtubule dynamics whil...|$|R
40|$|Meiotic telomeres {{attach to}} the nuclear {{envelope}} (NE) and drive the chromosome movement required for the pairing of homologous chromosomes. The meiosis-specific telomere proteins TERB 1, TERB 2, and MAJIN are required to regulate these events, but their assembly processes are largely unknown. Here, we developed a germ-cell-specific knockout mouse of the canonical telomere-binding protein TRF 1 and revealed an essential role for TRF 1 in directing the assembly of TERB 1 -TERB 2 -MAJIN. Further, we identified a TERB 2 binding (T 2 B) domain in TERB 1 that is dispensable for the TRF 1 -TERB 1 interaction but {{is essential for the}} subsequent TERB 1 -TERB 2 interaction and therefore for telomere attachment to the NE. Meanwhile, cohesin recruitment at telomeres, which is required for efficient telomere <b>movement,</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> the MYB-like domain of TERB 1, but not by TERB 2 -MAJIN. Our results reveal distinct protein interactions through various domains of TERB 1, which enable the sequential assembly of the meiotic telomere complex for their movements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCell <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> the {{protrusion}} of cytoplasm in {{the form}} of sheet- and rod-like extensions, termed lamellipodia and filopodia. Protrusion is driven by actin polymerization, a process that is regulated by signaling complexes that are, as yet, poorly defined. Since actin assembly is controlled at the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia [1], these juxtamembrane sites are likely to harbor the protein complexes that control actin polymerization dynamics underlying cell motility. An understanding of the regulation of protrusion therefore requires the characterization of the molecular components recruited to these sites. The Abl interactor (Abi) proteins, targets of Abl tyrosine kinases [2 – 4], have been implicated in Rac-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization in response to growth factor stimulation [5]. Here, we describe the unique localization of Abi proteins in living, motile cells. We show that Abi- 1 and Abi- 2 b fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) are recruited to the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia. We identify the targeting domain as the homologous N terminus of these two proteins. Our findings are the first to suggest a direct involvement of members of the Abi protein family in the control of actin polymerization in protrusion events, and establish the Abi proteins as potential regulators of motility...|$|E
40|$|Epidermal cells {{adhere to}} the {{basement}} membrane zone through cell–matrix junctions termed hemidesmosomes. During wound healing, hemidesmosomes are disassembled to allow keratinocytes to move over wound sites. Such <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> both hemidesmosome protein complexes (HPCs) and focal contacts (FCs). In this study, we analyzed the interaction between HPCs and FCs in live HaCat cells expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) -tagged β 4 integrin and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) -tagged α-actinin as markers of HPCs and FCs, respectively. In HaCat cells migrating to repopulate wounds, FC proteins cluster rapidly {{in the direction of}} the wound. HPC assembly then follows and the newly formed HPCs occupy sites vacated by the disassembled FCs. HPC dynamics are dramatically reduced, and HaCat cells cease migration upon treatment with reagents that affect FC integrity/function. Upon treatment with reagents that destabilize HPCs, the dynamics of FCs in HaCat cells at the edges of wounds are enhanced, although FC assembly is irregular and the migration of the cells is aberrant. We also show that the complex interaction between hemidesmosomes and FCs in keratinocytes is myosin dependent and requires energy. In summary, we suggest that HPCs and FCs dynamics are tightly co-regulated in keratinocytes undergoing migration during wound healing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the impact of duration-varying response effects on the generation and execution of duration-varying responses. Participants performed short or long keypresses which produced auditory effects of corresponding duration (short response->short tone, long response->long tone) or of noncorresponding duration (short response->long tone, long response->short tone). Experiment 1 revealed faster responding with a corresponding than with a noncorresponding Response-Effect (R-E) mapping; that is, a temporal R-E compatibility effect. Additionally, increasing effect du-ration increased response latencies, whereas it decreased keypress duration. Experiment 2 showed that the influ-ence of temporal R-E compatibility persists even when responses are cued in advance, suggesting that {{at least part of}} it originates from response generation processes occurring later than a traditional response selection stage. These findings corroborate and complement ef-fect-based theories of action control which assume that the selection, initiation, and execution of <b>movements</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> anticipation of their sensory effects...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} syntax for Mandarin even/all constructions. We show that “focus movement” under ‘even’ is not deeply {{connected}} to semantic focus or stress, since the same movement {{occurs in the}} absence of focus or prosodic triggers. Rather, these <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> a feature shared across ‘even’ and ‘all’ constructions, which we propose is the maximality feature on a potentially covert operator. This result, when placed alongside findings by Horvath (2007) and Cable (2007), supports the hypothesis that A-bar “focus movement” is always operator-driven. The syntactic similarities between ‘even’ and ‘all’ in Mandarin suggest a semantics where ‘even’ is built compositionally from a non-focus-sensitive ‘all’ (dou) plus a scalar focus operator (lian). We present a preliminary semantics of this kind, and discuss some challenges it faces. Finally, we address “partial focus movement” data that are initially unexpected on our account, and show how they can be incorporated under a framework that allows copy movement and PF deletion...|$|R

Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium, enters host cells by induced phagocytosis, escapes to the cytosol, and then replicates in the cytosol. ECV 304 cells infected with O. tsutsugamushi revealed the colocalization of the MT organizing center (MTOC) and cytosolic orientiae by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Using immunofluorescence microscopy in the presence and absence of MT-depolymerizing agents (colchicine and nocodazole), it was shown that the cytosolic oriential <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> MTs. By transfection study (overexpression of dynamitin [also called p 50], which is known to associate with dynein-dependent movement), the movement of O. tsutsugamushi to the MTOC <b>was</b> also <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> dynein, the minus-end-directed MT-related motor.

40|$|The nucleus is a {{definitive}} feature of eukaryotic cells, comprising twin bilamellar membranes, {{the inner and}} outer nuclear membranes, which separate the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic compartments. Nuclear pores, complex macromolecular assemblies that connect the two membranes, mediate communication between these compartments. To explore the morphology, topology, and dynamics of nuclei within living plant cells, we have developed a novel method of confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy under time-lapse conditions. This is used for the examination of the transgenic expression in Arabidopsis thaliana of a chimeric protein, comprising the GFP (Green-Fluorescent Protein of Aequorea victoria) translationally fused to an effective nuclear localization signal (NLS) and to β-glucuronidase (GUS) from E. coli. This large protein is targeted to the nucleus and accumulates exclusively within the nucleoplasm.  This article provides online access to movies that illustrate the remarkable and unusual properties displayed by the nuclei, including polymorphic shape changes and rapid, long-distance, intracellular movement. <b>Movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> actin but not by tubulin; it therefore appears distinct from mechanisms of nuclear positioning and migration that have been reported for eukaryotes.

40|$|Summary-A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} constructed to describe bacterial growth and movement in the rhizosphere. In the model, bacteria are introduced into the soil on inoculated seeds and growth occurs, after seed germination, on material produced as root exudates. Movement of substrates away from the rhizosphere into the bulk soil is by diffusion and microbial <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> carriage on the root surface. The relationship between specific growth rate and substrate concentration is described by Monod kinetics and death occurs at a constant specific rate. An {{important component of the}} model is treatment of the effects of matric potential on the distribution and activity of bacteria in different microhabitats, Simulation of the model quantifies the distribution of both bacteria and substrate with depth and time in the rhizosphere and demonstrates significant differences between substrate concentrations at high and low matric potentials. Sensitivity analysis of model predictions indicates the parameters which govern microbial growth to be more important determinants of microbial movement than plant-associated parameters, Predictions of the model compared well with experimental data on microbial movement in the rhizosphere of wheat plants grown in microcosms, and inoculated with luminescence-marked Pseudomonasjuorescens. and provide the basis for quantitative risk assessment following environmental release of genetically-engineered microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNeisseria gonorrheae {{bacteria}} are the causative {{agent of the}} second most common sexually transmitted infection in the world. The bacteria move on a surface by means of twitching motility. Their <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> multiple long and flexible filaments, called type IV pili, that extend from the cell body, attach to the surface, and retract, thus generating a pulling force. Moving cells also use pili to aggregate and form microcolonies. However, the mechanism by which the pili surrounding the cell body work together to propel bacteria remains unclear. Understanding this process will help describe the motility of N.  gonorrheae bacteria, and thus the dissemination of the disease which they cause. In this article we track individual twitching cells and observe that their trajectories consist of alternating moving and pausing intervals, while the cell body is preferably oriented with its wide side toward the direction of motion. Based on these data, we propose a model for the collective pili operation of N.  gonorrheae bacteria that explains the experimentally observed behavior. Individual pili function independently but can lead to coordinated motion or pausing via the force balance. The geometry of the cell defines its orientation during motion. We show that by changing pili substrate interactions, the motility pattern can be altered in a predictable way. Although the model proposed is tangibly simple, it still has sufficient robustness to incorporate further advanced pili features and various cell geometries to describe other bacteria that employ pili to move on surfaces...|$|E
50|$|Nyctinastic <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} with diurnal {{light and temperature}} changes and controlled by the circadian clock and the light receptor phytochrome. Plants use phytochrome to detect red and far red light. Depending on which kind of light is absorbed, the protein can switch between a Pr state that absorbs red light and a Pfr state that absorbs far red light. Red light converts Pr to Pfr and far red light converts Pfr to Pr. Many plants use phytochrome to establish circadian cycles which influence the opening and closing of leaves {{associated with}} nyctastic movements. Anatomically, the <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> pulvini. Pulvinus cells are located at the base or apex of the petiole and the flux {{of water from the}} dorsal to ventral motor cells regulates leaf closure. This flux is in response to movement of potassium ions between pulvinus and surrounding tissue. Movement of potassium ions is connected to the concentration of Pfr or Pr. In Albizzoa julibrissin longer darker periods, leading to low Pfr leads to a faster leaf opening. In the SLEEPLESS mutation of Lotus japonicus, the pulvini are changed into petiole-like structures, rendering the plant incapable of closing its leaflets at night.|$|R

Here, we report an unexpected role of EE motility in distributing the translation machinery in a fungal model system. We visualize ribosomal subunit proteins {{and show that}} the large subunits diffused slowly throughout the cytoplasm (Dc, 60 S = 0. 311 µm(2) /s), whereas entire polysomes underwent long-range motility along microtubules. This <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> "hitchhiking" on kinesin- 3 and dynein-driven EEs, where the polysomes appeared to translate EE-associated mRNA into proteins. Modeling indicates that this motor-driven transport is required for even cellular distribution of newly formed ribosomes. Indeed, impaired EE motility in motor mutants, or their inability to bind EEs in mutants lacking the RNA-binding protein Rrm 4, reduced ribosome transport and induced ribosome aggregation near the nucleus. As a consequence, cell growth was severely restricted. Collectively, our results indicate that polysomes associate with moving EEs and that "off- and reloading" distributes the protein translation machinery.

To study the photoreceptors for chloroplast movement in P. patens, four phototropin genes (PHOTA 1, PHOTA 2, PHOTB 1, and PHOTB 2) were isolated by screening cDNA libraries. These genes were classified into two groups (PHOTA and PHOTB) {{on the basis of}} their deduced amino acid sequences. Then phototropin disruptants were generated by homologous recombination and used for analysis of chloroplast movement.

40|$|GabR from Bacillus subtilis is a {{transcriptional}} regulator {{belonging to}} the MocR subfamily of the GntR regulators. The structure of the MocR regulators {{is characterized by the}} presence of two domains: i) a N-terminal domain, about 60 residue long, possessing the winged-Helix-Turn-Helix (wHTH) architecture with DNA recognition and binding capability; ii) a C-terminal domain (about 350 residue) folded as the pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate (PLP) dependent aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) with dimerization and effector binding functions. The two domains are linked to each other by a peptide bridge. Although structural and functional characterization of MocRs is proceeding at a fast pace, virtually nothing is know about the molecular changes induced by the effector binding and on how these modifications influence the properties of the regulator. An extensive molecular dynamics simulation on the crystallographic structure of the homodimeric B. subtilis GabR has been undertaken with the aim to envisage the role and the importance of conformational flexibility in the action of GabR. Molecular dynamics has been calculated for the apo (without PLP) and holo (with PLP bound) forms of the GabR. A comparison between the molecular dynamics trajectories calculated for the two GabR forms suggested that one of the wHTH domain detaches from the AAT-like domain in the GabR PLP-bound form. The most evident conformational change in the holo PLP-bound form is represented by the rotation and the subsequent detachment from the subunit surface of one of the wHTH domains. The <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> a rearrangement of the linker connecting the AAT domain possibly triggered by the presence of the negative charge of the PLP cofactor.

40|$|AIM: Orthodontic tooth <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> bone remodelling. Sufficient bone is {{essential}} for the success and effectiveness of orthodontic treatment. It has previously been found that salvia miltiorrhiza extract (SM), a commonly used Chinese herb in cardiac disease to enhance blood perfusion, could increase bone formation in vivo. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of SM on bone cells in vitro, to obtain a better understanding on how SM can promote bone remodelling. MATERIALS AND METHOD: MC 3 T 3 -E 1, an osteoblastic cell line, was cultured with SM for different time intervals (24, 48 and 72 hours), whereas the control group consisted of cells cultured without any intervention. The mRNA expressions of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa β ligand (RANKL) were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The expression of ALP showed an early increase at 24 and 48 hours by 50 and 13 per cent, respectively (P < 0. 001). OCN was decreased by 22 per cent at 24 hours (P < 0. 001) but increased by 50 and 88 per cent at 48 and 72 hours, respectively (P < 0. 001). OPG was up-regulated by 10 per cent at 48 hours (P < 0. 01) and 68 per cent at 72 hours (P < 0. 001), while RANKL showed an early increase at 24 and 48 hours by 45 (P < 0. 001) and 36 (P < 0. 01) per cent, respectively. OPG/ RANKL was first down-regulated and then up-regulated. CONCLUSION: SM enhances bone remodelling by regulating the gene expressions of ALP, OCN, OPG and RANKL.

40|$|Research {{findings}} have supported {{a relationship between}} psychological characteristics and optimal performance states, indicating that elite and successful sports participants are more motivated, committed, self-confident, focused and able to peak under pressure compared to non-elite and less successful participants. The {{reason for this is}} that a human being’s biomechanical and physiological harmonisation of <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> various aspects of psychological involvement. The psychological components of physical-skills execution in sport can be enhanced by the corrective application of mental-skills training. Personalised mental-skills training enables participants to understand their cognitions in order to allow a degree of flow in the coordination and execution of task-related skills through the various mood states of participation. A participant’s ability to control the mental and emotional aspects associated with competition not only facilitates task performance but also serves as a psychological keystone of self-belief and wellbeing. Sports psychology has recently directed its focus to identifying psychological skills relevant to different types of individual and team sports for the purpose of providing on-the-field psychological support. Investigations in South Africa, addressing the psychological constructs conducive to performance in cricket are limited, at both the professional and the amateur levels of competition. At this stage, there are no documented findings available in which the relationship between mental skills and skilled performance in cricket is addressed. Therefore, research questions for this study are formulated as: “Are there significant differences in the psychological background information on cricket players from different levels of cricket competition?” “Is there a significant relationship between mental skills and the level of cricket player participation?” “Is there a significant relationship between mental skills and the specialised roles played in cricket?” “Is there is a significant relationship between mental skills and batting order in cricket?” The study was approached from a quantitative (descriptive) perspective since it was the perceptions and mental skills relative to cricket players’ levels of participation that were assessed. A questionnaire assessing the general perspectives on psychology of respondents, and three other standardised psychometric measures (Competitive Anxiety Inventory- 2 [Martens et al., 1990]; The Athletic Coping Skills Inventory- 28 [Smith et al., 1995], and Bull’s Mental Skills Questionnaire [Bull et al., 1996]) with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient ranging between 0. 79 and 0. 90, were used as research instruments. These Likert-type scale questionnaires were administered to 127 cricket players (30. 7 % Junior Academy; 53. 6 % Premier League/Senior Academy and 15. 7 % Senior Provincial players) to explore their general psychological background information and the mental skills differences between three progressive levels of cricket participation established and recognised by the Northerns Cricket Union (NCU) in the Pretoria Gauteng region of South Africa. Other aims were to investigate the relationship between mental skills and the different tasks (e. g. batting, bowling, wicket keeping) performed in cricket and as well as to investigate the relationship between mental skills and batting order. Overall results obtained from the respondents’ general psychological background information revealed that cricket players, regardless of level of participation, have insufficient exposure to, training in and knowledge of the psychological aspects associated with cricket performance. It is evident from the results that cricket players spent limited time on psychological-skills training and that they exercise only the physiological and skills-related aspects of the game. One-way analysis of variance (one-way Anova) indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the three levels of participating respondents in terms of their performance in the various mental-skills and coping-skills subscales. Analysis of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 subscales indicated no statistically significant differences in the cognitive and somatic anxiety scores between the three levels of participation. However, a statistically significant difference was found in terms of self-confidence in the senior provincial players whose scores were higher on this construct than those of the other two levels of cricket participants. A comparison of the performance of the various specialised roles in cricket on the mental skills questionnaire indicated that the all-rounders had significantly higher imagery ability and motivation scores than batsmen and bowlers. The various specialised roles showed a very similar outcome on the cognitive, somatic and state self-confidence levels. A significant difference in batting order was revealed in top-order batsmen scoring the highest on motivation and lower-order batsmen scoring the highest on coachability. No other mental-skills difference existed between the different groups of batting order. The conclusion was that, in essence, there are no mental-skills differences between cricket players from various levels of participation in the one-day cricket format. A definite psychological-skills profile did come to the fore, indicating that successful cricket participants, regardless of what level of competition they compete in, express high proficiencies in motivation, self-confidence, coachability, imagery ability, concentration ability and peaking under pressure. The study concludes with recommendations for expanding knowledge on the direction and intensity of mental skills in contributing to cricket performance. A more holistic view on the psychological differences between successful and less successful cricket participants at the same level of participation is recommended as well as a comparison between the mental skills of one-day and multiple-day cricket players. Sports psychologists and cricket coaches are also encouraged to collate their experience and expertise in developing and implementing individualised psychological-skills-training (PST) programmes to satisfy the players’ psychological needs when dealing with the performance demands of the game. Implications for further investigations are listed since there were several aspects that did not fall within the aims of this investigation.

40|$|In {{order to}} answer the {{questions}} if and how various factors can alter compensatory eye movements and how the cerebellum contributes to these changes, we investigated the eye movements of a laboratory mouse.

We can conclude that various factors influence cerebellar plasticity and cerebellar motor learning and that measuring compensatory eye <b>movements</b> <b>is</b> a powerful technique to investigate these factors. Compensatory eye movements rely on a multisensory integration system that induces execution of accurate eye movements in time and space. This multisensory integration system has also the capacity to compensate for certain deficits.

Here, we show that a patient with a complete right homonymous hemianopia after a V 1 lesion remains sensitive to the width of objects presented in her blind field but only when reaching out to grasp them in ‘real-time’. A subsequent fMRI experiment revealed spared extra-geniculostriate pathways, which may mediate her preserved abilities. Taken together, the results support the view that visually guided <b>movements</b> can <b>be</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> pathways that do not support visual consciousness...|$|R

40|$|Linaclotide {{is a novel}} {{receptor}} guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) agonist {{approved for}} treatment of abdominal pain and constipation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Linaclotide effects on bowel <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> the intracellular cGMP that is produced upon activation of GC-C. It is hypothesized {{that the effects of}} linaclotide on abdominal pain <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> extracellular cGMP, which was shown to decrease the activity of pain-sensing nerves [1]. Here we used an ex vivo Ussing chamber assay to measure the secretion of cGMP from the mouse colonic mucosa in response to linaclotide treatment. Ion transport and epithelial barrier function were monitored by measuring short-circuit current (Isc) and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Stimulation with linaclotide (1 µM) elicited a robust short-circuit current across mouse colonic epithe-lium. Isc reached a maximum within ten minutes following stimulation with linaclotide and remained steady during the duration of the study (60 min). Treatment of colonic mucosa with linaclotide induced release of cGMP from the apical, as well as, the basolateral side of the epithelium. The time course of cGMP accumulation in the basolateral bath of the Ussing chamber was linear with an estimated cGMP secretion rate equal to 23 fmol/min×cm 2. The trans-epithelial electrical resistance of the colonic mucosa remained high {{over the course of the}} study indicating that the barrier to diffusion of cGMP between apical and baso-lateral sides remained intact throughout the study. In sum-mary, these data demonstrate that linaclotide-stimulated mouse colonic epithelium secretes cGMP from both the apical and basolateral sides and that cGMP is available in the submucosal interstitial space to inhibit colonic nociceptors...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{stopping}} {{of specific}} parts of <b>movements</b> <b>is</b> frequently required in daily life. Yet, whether selective inhibitory control of <b>movements</b> <b>is</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> a specific neural pathway {{or by the}} combination between a global stopping of all ongoing motor activity followed by the re-initiation of task-relevant movements remains unclear. To address this question, we applied time-wise statistical analyses of the topography, global field power and electrical sources of the event-related potentials to the global vs selective inhibition stimuli presented during a Go/NoGo task. Participants (n = 18) had to respond {{as fast as possible}} with their two hands to Go stimuli and to withhold the response from the two hands (global inhibition condition, GNG) or from only one hand (selective inhibition condition, SNG) when specific NoGo stimuli were presented. Behaviorally, we replicated previous evidence for slower response times in the SNG than in the Go condition. Electrophysiologically, there were two distinct phases of event-related potentials modulations between the GNG and the SNG conditions. At 110 – 150 ms post-stimulus onset, there was a difference in the strength of the electric field without concomitant topographic modulation, indicating the differential engagement of statistically indistinguishable configurations of neural generators for selective and global inhibitory control. At 150 – 200 ms, there was topographic modulation, indicating the engagement of distinct brain networks. Source estimations localized these effects within bilateral temporo-parieto-occipital and within parieto-central networks, respectively. Our results suggest that while both types of motor inhibitory control depend on global stopping mechanisms, selective and global inhibition still differ quantitatively at early attention-related processing phases...|$|R

40|$|Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) is a {{double-stranded}} DNA (dsDNA) pararetrovirus {{capable of}} cell-to-cell movement presumably through intercellular connections, the plasmodesmata, of the infected plant.

The binding is highly cooperative, and the affinity of the gene I protein for RNA is 10 -fold higher than for ssDNA. CaMV replicates by reverse transcription of a 358 RNA that is homologous to the entire genome.

40|$|Coupled K and Cl <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> several isoforms of the K-Cl cotransporter (COT) encoded by the KCC genes. The {{ubiquitous}} KCC 1 isoform, {{important for}} cell volume and ion homeostasis, has 12 transmembrane domains (Tmds), and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains (Ntd and Ctd). This study investigates the cellular localization of KCC 1 by confocal microscopy, activation of K-Cl COT by various non-osmotic and osmotic interventions with net unidirectional K and Rb fluxes at 37 (degrees) C, {{and the effect}} of Ctd deletion on K-Cl COT regulation. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were transfected with full-length (fl) rabbit (rb) KCC 1 and - CtdKCC 1 cDNAs obtained after truncation at nucleotide 2011. Normal cells exposed to polyclonal anti-Ctd antibodies against Ctd epitopes within a 77 amino acid sequence (a. a. 943 - 1020) revealed granular membrane and cytoplasmic immunostaining, presumably endogenous KCC 1. Additional diffuse membrane and cytoplasmic immunofluorescence in flKCC 1 -transfected cells was absent in -CtdKCC 1 -transfected cells. Monoclonal antibodies against a c-myc epitope at the protein Ntd showed both membrane and cytosolic fluorescence. Basal and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) -stimulated Rb influxes through K-Cl COT, calculated as Cl-dependent Rb fluxes, were 2 - 3 -fold higher in flKCC 1 -transfected than in normal cells. NEM stimulation of K-Cl COT was highest in flKCC 1 -transfected cells, significantly lower in stably and abrogated in transiently -CtdKCC 1 -transfected cells. Furosemide, calyculin and genistein inhibited basal and NEM-stimulated K-Cl COT in normal and transfected cells. Staurosporine and hydroxylamine were ineffective stimulators. No effect of pH(0) changes (6. 3 - 8. 4) was observed in basal or NEM-stimulated K-Cl COT, in both normal and transfected cells. However, inhibition by NEM occurred at pH(0) 8. 4. Furthermore, in a Cl-independent manner, NEM lowered cell K content by 3 ̆e 30...|$|R
40|$|The {{volume of}} {{individual}} cells in intact frog urinary bladders {{was determined by}} quantitative microscopy and changes in volume were used to monitor the movement of solute across the basolateral membrane. When exposed to a serosal hyposmotic solution, the cells swell as expected for an osmometer, but then regulate their volume back to near control {{in a process that}} involves the loss of KCl. We show here that volume regulation is abolished by Ba++, which suggests that KCl <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> <b>mediated</b> <b>by</b> conductive channels for both ions. Volume regulation is also inhibited by removing Ca++ from the serosal perfusate, which suggests that the channels are activated by this cation. Previously, amiloride was observed to inhibit volume regulation: in this study, amiloride-inhibited, hyposmotically swollen cells lost volume when the Ca++ ionophore A 23187 was added to Ca++-replete media. We attempted to effect volume changes under isosmotic conditions by suddenly inhibiting Na+ entry across the apical membrane with amiloride, or Na+ exit across the basolateral membrane with ouabain. Neither of these Na+ transport inhibitors produced the expected results. Amiloride, instead of causing a decrease in cell volume, had no effect, and ouabain, instead of causing cell swelling, caused cell shrinkage. However, increasing cell Ca++ with A 23187, in both the absence and presence of amiloride, caused cells to lose volume, and Ca++-free Ringer's solution (serosal perfusate only) caused ouabain-blocked cells to swell. Finally, again under isosmotic conditions, removal of Na+ from the serosal perfusate caused a loss of volume from cells exposed to amiloride. These results strongly suggest that intracellular Ca++ mediates cell volume regulation by exerting a negative control on apical membrane Na+ permeability and a positive control on basolateral membrane K+ permeability. They also are compatible with the existence of a basolateral Na+/Ca++ exchanger...|$|R
2500|$|When {{just one}} {{microtubule}} is anchored to one kinetochore, it starts a rapid {{movement of the}} associated chromosome towards the pole generating that microtubule.

The movement towards the pole is slowed down as far as kinetochores acquire kMTs (MTs anchored to kinetochores) and the movement becomes directed by changes in kMTs length. Dynein is released from kinetochores as they acquire kMTs and, in cultured mammalian cells, it {{is required for the}} spindle checkpoint inactivation, but not for chromosome congression in the spindle equator, kMTs acquisition or anaphase A during chromosome segregation.
