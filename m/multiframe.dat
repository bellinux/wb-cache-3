5000|$|The CRC-4 <b>multiframe</b> {{alignment}} word {{only takes}} up {{six of the}} first eight bits of the TS0 without FAS. There are two bits in every second block or submultiframe, whose task is to indicate block errors in {{the far end of}} the communication. The mechanismis as follows: Both bits (called E-bits) have [...] "1" [...] as their default value. When {{the far end of the}} communication receives a 2 Mbit/s frame and detects an erroneous block, it puts a [...] "0" [...] in the E-bit that corresponds to the block in the frame being sent along the return path to the transmitter. This way, the near end of the communication is informed that an erroneous block has been detected, and both ends have the same information: one from the CRC-4 procedure and the other from the E bits. If we number the frames in the <b>multiframe</b> from 0 to 15, the E-bit of frame 13 refers to the submultiframe I (block I) received at the far end, and the E-bit of frame 15 refers to the submultiframe II (block II).|$|E

The three-dimensional emission profile of the laser-heated plasma was reconstructed from the x-ray images by use of computed tomography and was compared with the laser illumination profiles. The areal density of the imploded core was measured by the neutron activation of a silicon tracer, the secondary reaction method, and the knock-on proton method. Although the measured density and areal density were consistent with those from 1 -D hydrodynamic simulation, experimental neutron yields were significantly lower than those predicted by the simulation for convergence ratios larger than 20.

To obtain a high energy deposition in the target, the ion beam is focused by the plasma lens [1] to diameters smaller than 1 mm in the focus. The generated plasmas have densities close to the solid state density, volumes of several mm 3 and temperatures up to 1 eV. The characterization of the matter under such extreme temperatures and pressures is of relevance for equation of state (EOS) studies, in astrophysics for understanding the formation of heavy elements in supernovae, for designs of future heavy ion driven Inertial Fusion Experiments (IFE) and others.

30|$|We {{implement}} a simulation model using the ns {{to evaluate the}} performance of Bypass-AODV. Free Space propagation model is used to predict the signal power strength at the receiver side. The signal strength is used {{to determine if the}} frame is received successfully. ns mainly uses three thresholds to determine whether a frame is received correctly by the receiver. If the signal strength of the frame is less than the carrier sensing threshold (CSThresh), the frame is discarded in the PHY module and will not be visible to the MAC layer. If the signal strength of the received frame is stronger than the reception threshold (RxThresh), the frame is received correctly. Otherwise, the frame is tagged as corrupted and the MAC layer will discard it. When <b>multiframes</b> are received simultaneously by one mobile node, it calculates the ratio of the strongest frame's signal strength to the sum of other frames' signal strengths. If it is larger than the capturing threshold (CPThresh), the frame will be received correctly and other frames are ignored. Otherwise, all frames are collided and discarded. In our simulation, we choose TCP instead of UDP to evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol against large data packets and excessive overhead. The IEEE 802.11 MAC standard [15] and the TCP New-Reno are used at the MAC and TCP layers, respectively. The transmission rate is assumed to be constant at 1 [*]Mbps.|$|R
