40|$|The Friend helper {{murine leukemia}} virus (F-MuLV) induces in mice a high {{percentage}} of <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> <b>Myeloblastic</b> transformation is also observed after in vitro infection of long-term bone marrow cultures. To investigate the molecular events leading to the generation of <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> we first screened a panel of leukemic cells for rearrangement or amplification of known oncogenes or previously described specific integration sites. No modification of these genes was observed. Therefore, we searched for common integration sites by constructing a genomic library from a myeloblastic cell line harboring only five integrated proviruses. This library was screened with a virus-specific probe, and virus-host cellular junction fragments were subcloned. Two flanking cellular sequences corresponding to two different integrated proviruses were used to analyze additional <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> The first probe detected rearrangements in 2 of 42 <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> and the second probe detected rearrangements in 6 of 42. We demonstrated that, in each case, the rearrangement was the result of F-MuLV integration, with all proviruses in the same orientation and clustering in a region less than 3 kilobases long. The two regions, named fim- 1 and fim- 2, were different from 15 oncogenes tested. Rearrangements of these two regions were found in F-MuLV-induced <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemias</b> but not in 20 lymphoid or erythroid leukemias induced by the same virus...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} problem with {{malfunctioning}} myeloblasts is acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia.</b> The main clinical features {{are caused by}} failure of the hemopoiesis with anemia, hemorrhage and infection as result. There is a progressive accumulation of leukemic cells, because some blast progenitor cells renew themselves and willhave a limited differentiated division. Sometimes acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia</b> can be initiated by earlier hematologic disorder, like myelodysplastic syndrome, pancytopenia, or hypoplasia of the bone marrow.|$|R

40|$|Treatment {{of adults}} with acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia</b> has changed {{substantially}} {{over the past}} two decades. Currently available estimates of survival do not reflect results from present state-of-the-art treatment due to a lag between the availability of new treatments and data concerning their effect on survival on the population level when traditional cohort analysis is used. We estimated trends in age-specific 5 - and 10 -year relative survival of acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia</b> patients aged over 15 years old for 5 -year calendar periods from 1980 - 1984 through 2000 - 2004 using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Period analysis was employed to reveal recent developments in prognosis. Five and 10 -year relative survival improved greathy between 1980 - 1984 and 2000 - 2004 for all patients except those aged over 75 years old. Improvements were greatest for patients aged 15 - 34, with increases in 5 - and 10 -year relative survival of greater than 30 % points in this group. Five and 10 -year relative survival reached 52. 3 % and 47. 9 %, respectively, in this group in 2000 - 2004. Less pronounced but still substantial improvements in relative survival were seen in the 35 - 54 and 55 - 64 age groups. Survival was unchanged, at less than 5 %, for patients aged over 75 years old. Our period analysis reveals major improvement on the population level in long-term prognosis of younger patients with acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> most likely explained by multiple incremental improvements in care including better and more specific diagnosis, improvements in and extension of the use of stem cell transplantation and high dose therapy, and improved supportive care.

40|$|Normal adult hemopoiesis orginates in {{pluripotent}} stem cells; {{among the}} early differentiated descendents of such cells are progenitors {{committed to the}} erythropoietic, granulopoietic, or megakaryocytic pathways of myeloid differentiation. These may be detected in cell culture by developmental techniques, in which progenitors form colonies in viscid or semisolid media in response to appropriate stimulation. Certain diseases of hemopoiesis also originate in pluripotent stem cells; these include chronic <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> polycythemia vera, and idiopathic myelofibrosis—the clonal hemopathies. The hypothesis is advanced that the distribution of cell classes among patients with clonal hemopathies is determined both by the differentiation potential of each pluripotent stem cell maintaining an abnormal clone and by random events occurring during clonal expansion. The latter process {{may account for the}} large variations observed between patients when committed progenitors are assayed in cultures of marrow from patients with acute <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (AML). This variation may also be used to estimate lineage relationships in the clonal hemopathies. When applied to myelopoiesis in AML, obvious differences from the normal are not detected. The analysis is consistent with the view that the blast cell population in AML is distinct from the leukemic myelopoiesis occurring within an abnormal clone. A new assay procedure is described for progenitor cells related to blast cell proliferation. Finally, these concepts are used to develop a model for the pathogenesis and cellular characteristics of AML...|$|R

In a few metaphases, incomplete condensa-tion of single chromosomes involved chieAy chromosomes that were affected by secondary constrictions. In anaphase preparations the uncoiled material failed to move {{in step with the}} divided chromosomes and was easily detected. Autoradiography with tritiated thymidine revealed DNA synthesis of in-completely condensed material during the G 2 period; this indicated a disturbed DNA replication paHern of the involved chromosomes. The implications of these ~ndings are discussed. -J Nat Cancer Inst 38 : 683 - 696, 1967. THIS REPORT DEALS with cytogenetic findings in cell lines derived from the peripheral blood of leukemic patients.
