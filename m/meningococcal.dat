5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by <b>meningococcal</b> bacteria may {{be accompanied by a}} characteristic rash.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, <b>meningococcal</b> disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E

25|$|As N. gonorrhoeae {{is closely}} related to N. meningitidis and they have 80–90% {{homology}} in their genetic sequences some cross-protection by <b>meningococcal</b> vaccines is plausible. A study published in 2017 showed that MeNZB group B <b>meningococcal</b> vaccine provided a partial protection against gonorrhea. The vaccine efficiency was calculated to be 31%.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{instances}} of a purpura-like rash {{are due to}} <b>meningococcal</b> septicaemia; other possible causes, such as Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; a platelet disorder) and Henoch–Schönlein purpura, also need prompt investigation.|$|E
25|$|Eculizumab is {{controversial}} {{due to its}} high cost, as it {{is among the most}} expensive pharmaceuticals in the world, with a price of US$440,000 per person per year. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts as a terminal complement inhibitor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black-box warning for eculizumab whose recipients have a 1,000 to 2,000-fold greater risk of invasive <b>meningococcal</b> disease compared to the general U.S. population. Patients for whom eculizumab is prescribed are strongly advised by the FDA to receive <b>meningococcal</b> vaccination at least two weeks prior to starting therapy and to consider antimicrobial prophylaxis for the duration of treatment with eculizumab.|$|E
25|$|The appearance: e.g., purpuric (typical of {{vasculitis}} and <b>meningococcal</b> disease), {{fine and}} like sandpaper (typical of scarlet fever); circular lesions {{with a central}} depression are typical of molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are typical of psoriasis.|$|E

25|$|It {{initially}} produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, and {{headache and}} can rapidly progress to neck stiffness, coma {{and death in}} 10% of cases. Symptoms of <b>meningococcal</b> meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom {{is that if a}} case of <b>meningococcal</b> meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital. This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is {{based on the idea that}} the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death.|$|E
25|$|On January 5, 2015, {{the company}} {{announced}} it would acquire a controlling interest in Redvax for an undisclosed sum. This deal expanded the company's vaccine portfolio targeting human cytomegalovirus. In March 2015, {{the company announced}} it would restart its collaboration with Eli Lilly surrounding the phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200million. In June 2015, the company acquired two meningitis drugs from GlaxoSmithKline—Nimenrix and Mencevax—for around $130million, expanding the company's <b>meningococcal</b> disease portfolio of drugs.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{function}} of retinal as a visual chromophore, {{one of the earliest}} and specific manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision, particularly in reduced light – night blindness. Persistent deficiency gives rise to a series of changes, the most devastating of which occur in the eyes. Some other ocular changes are referred to as xerophthalmia. First there is dryness of the conjunctiva (xerosis) as the normal lacrimal and mucus-secreting epithelium is replaced by a keratinized epithelium. This is followed by the build-up of keratin debris in small opaque plaques (Bitot's spots) and, eventually, erosion of the roughened corneal surface with softening and destruction of the cornea (keratomalacia) and leading to total blindness. Other changes include impaired immunity (increased risk of ear infections, urinary tract infections, <b>Meningococcal</b> disease), hyperkeratosis (white lumps at hair follicles), keratosis pilaris and squamous metaplasia of the epithelium lining the upper respiratory passages and urinary bladder to a keratinized epithelium. In relation to dentistry, a deficiency in vitamin A may lead to enamel hypoplasia.|$|E
500|$|Mayberry studied health {{sciences}} at Griffith University, and {{medicine at the}} University of Sydney. He went into medicine partly because of his illness during high school.

Mayberry lost both legs after contracting <b>meningococcal</b> disease when he was sixteen years old. This experiences led him to study medicine, and he attended Griffith University and the University of Sydney where Mayberry pursued health science courses. Beyond the classroom, he has written a paper on <b>Meningococcal</b> disease, worked part-time on research about the disease, and talked about his experiences at a conference. [...] While at a music festival, he met his future wife whom he married in June 2010.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{high school}} ski trip {{when he was in}} year 11, Mayberry {{contracted}} <b>meningococcal</b> disease at the age of 16, and this resulted in double below the knee amputations.

2500|$|Septicaemia {{caused by}} Neisseria meningitidis has {{received}} much less public attention than <b>meningococcal</b> meningitis even though septicaemia {{has been linked}} to infant deaths. [...] <b>Meningococcal</b> septicaemia typically causes a purpuric rash, that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass ("non-blanching") and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis. This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset.|$|E
2500|$|When appropriate, {{the choice}} of {{antibiotic}} varies, differing based on the cause (if known) or the likely cause of the conjunctivitis. Fluoroquinolones, sodium sulfacetamide, or trimethoprim/polymyxin may be used, typically for 7–10 days. [...] Cases of <b>meningococcal</b> conjunctivitis can also be treated with systemic penicillin, {{as long as the}} strain is sensitive to penicillin.|$|E

[...] Among the 13 identified capsular types of N. meningitidis, six (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) account for most disease cases worldwide. Type A {{has been the most}} prevalent in Africa and Asia, but is rare/practically absent in North America. [...] In the United States, serogroup B is the predominant cause of disease and mortality, followed by serogroup C.

2500|$|During the Vietnam War, {{vaccination}} {{was necessary}} for soldiers to fight overseas. Because disease follows soldiers, they had to receive vaccines preventing cholera, influenza, measles, <b>meningococcal,</b> plague, poliovirus, smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria, typhoid, typhus, and yellow fever. However, the diseases mainly prevalent in Vietnam at this time were measles and polio. After arriving in Vietnam, the United States Military conducted the [...] "Military Public Health Assistance Project". This public health program was a joint United States Military and Government of Vietnam concept to create or expand public medical facilities throughout South Vietnam. Local villages in Vietnam were inoculated. The United States military screened patients, dispensed medication, distributed clothing and food, and even passed out propaganda such as comic books.|$|E
2500|$|Neisseria meningitidis, often {{referred}} to as meningococcus, is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of <b>meningococcal</b> disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx. As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic [...] and endemic form.|$|E
2500|$|A Federal Trade Commission {{report issued}} in 1958 {{attempted}} {{to quantify the}} effect of antibiotic development on American public health. The report found that over the period 1946-1955, there was a 42% drop {{in the incidence of}} diseases for which antibiotics were effective and only a 20% drop in those for which antibiotics were not effective. The report concluded that [...] "it appears that the use of antibiotics, early diagnosis, and other factors have limited the epidemic spread and thus the number of these diseases which have occurred". The study further examined mortality rates for eight common diseases for which antibiotics offered effective therapy (syphilis, tuberculosis, dysentery, scarlet fever, whooping cough, <b>meningococcal</b> infections, and pneumonia), and found a 56% decline over the same period. Notable among these was a 75% decline in deaths due to tuberculosis.|$|E

Cholera, dysentery, and other diarrheal diseases also are major killers in the region, particularly among children, refugees, and internally displaced populations. Forty percent of all childhood deaths from diarrheal diseases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. The region also has {{a high rate of}} hepatitis B and C infections and is the only region with a perennial <b>meningococcal</b> meningitis problem in a [...] "meningitis belt" [...] stretching from west to east. Sub-Saharan Africa also suffers from yellow fever, while trypanosomiasis or [...] "sleeping sickness" [...] is making a comeback in the DROC and Sudan, and the Marburg virus also appeared in DRC {{for the first time in}} 1998.

2500|$|In {{order to}} provide the best protection, {{children}} are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional [...] "booster" [...] shots often required to achieve [...] "full immunity". This has {{led to the development of}} complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, <b>meningococcal</b> disease and pneumonia. A large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.|$|E
50|$|Eculizumab {{inhibits}} terminal complement activation {{and therefore}} makes people vulnerable to infection with encapsulated organisms. Life-threatening and fatal <b>meningococcal</b> infections {{have occurred in}} people who received eculizumab. People receiving eculizumab have up to 2,000 times greater risk of developing invasive <b>meningococcal</b> disease. Due to the increased risk of <b>meningococcal</b> infections, <b>meningococcal</b> vaccination is recommended at least 2 weeks prior to receiving eculizumab, unless the risks of delaying eculizumab therapy outweigh {{the risk of developing}} a <b>meningococcal</b> infection, in which case the <b>meningococcal</b> vaccine should be administered as soon as possible. Both a serogroup A, C, W, Y conjugate <b>meningococcal</b> vaccine and a serogroup B <b>meningococcal</b> vaccine are recommended for people receiving eculizumab. Receiving the recommended vaccinations may not prevent all <b>meningococcal</b> infections, especially from nongroupable N. meningiditis. In 2017, it became clear that eculizumab has caused invasive <b>meningococcal</b> disease despite vaccination, because it interferes with the ability of antimeningococcal antibodies to protect against invasive disease.|$|E
