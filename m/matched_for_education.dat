50|$|Schizophrenic {{patients}} have intellectual, social and language impairments. Schizophrenic's executive functions were examined on planning, inhibition, and abstraction of logical rules using the Tower of London, Hayling, and Brixton tests. Patients were significantly worse {{on all three}} tasks compared to control individuals <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> level, age, and gender. These results indicate that schizophrenic patients either have specific impairments {{for each of these}} tasks separately, or there is a general dysfunction that influences all three tasks. The parsimony, as well as complementary findings from other studies would indicate a general deficit in the SAS.|$|E
50|$|The {{finding that}} {{bilingualism}} contributes to cognitive reserve {{has also been}} replicated by several other studies For example, Abutalebi et al. (2015) tested 19 bilinguals (8 Cantonese-Mandarin and 11 Cantonese-English, age range 55-75) and 19 monolinguals (Italian speakers, age range 49-75) who had been <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> level, performance on the Flanker Task (a cognitive response test,) and socioeconomic status. It {{is important to remember}} that this is a relatively small sample size; however, the results did confirm previous studies. According to the research, the bilinguals outperformed the monolinguals on all experimental tasks, and the researchers found that monolinguals' neural imaging showed higher signs of age-related effects on performance of tasks and decreased gray matter density. Meanwhile, the bilinguals' neural imaging showed higher levels of gray matter along the anterior cingulate cortex. Because of these results, the investigators concluded that bilingualism aids in protection against cognitive decline.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ethnicity is {{associated}} with differences in clinical course and outcomes of cardiac disease, often in association with a poorer socioeconomic position. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the mortality after coronary angiography (CAG) of Roma and non-Roma patients <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> and adjusted for gender and age. METHODS: In total, 816 patients were included in the study (167 Roma and 649 non-Roma). Data on socio-demographic background, disease history, use of drugs, coronary findings and type of treatment were obtained from medical records. Mortality was assessed up to seven years after CAG. Kaplan-Meier curves of mortality were plotted, and differences between the Roma and non-Roma patients were assessed using log-rank tests, <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> and adjusted for gender and age. RESULTS: Mortality after CAG was significantly higher among Roma than non-Roma (log-rank test χ(2) = 7. 59, P < 0. 01) and remained so after matching for education and adjustment for gender, age, history of previous myocardial infarction and abnormal CAG (hazard ratio: 2. 07, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 13 - 3. 82). CONCLUSION: Mortality after CAG is higher among Roma, and this is not due to differences in age, gender or education. These results warrant further reconsideration of the management of Roma cardiac patients...|$|E

40|$|Background: Virtual reality (VR) {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the influence of divided attention (simple versus complex) on driving performance (speed control). Design: Three individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and three healthy controls (HC), <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> age, <b>education,</b> and gender, were examined.

40|$|Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a {{syndrome}} primarily characterised by chronic, widespread musculo-skeletal pain. In the aetiology of this syndrome {{a crucial}} role is played by complex interac-tions among biological, genetic, psychological, and socio-cultural factors.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} psychomotor function in chronic, daily cannabis smokers during 3 weeks continuously monitored abstinence on a secure research unit. We hypothesized that psychomotor performance would improve during abstinence of chronic, daily cannabis smokers. Performance {{on the critical}} tracking (CTT) and divided attention (DAT) tasks was assessed in 19 male chronic, daily cannabis smokers at baseline and after 8, 14 - 16 and 21 - 23 days of continuously monitored abstinence. Psychomotor performance was compared to a control group of non-intoxicated occasional drug users. Critical frequency (λ(c)) of the CTT and tracking error and control losses of the DAT were the primary outcome measures. Results showed that chronic cannabis smokers' performance on the CTT (p< 0. 001) and the DAT (p< 0. 001) was impaired during baseline relative to the comparison group. Psychomotor performance in the chronic cannabis smokers improved over 3 weeks of abstinence, but did not recover to equivalent control group performance.

40|$|Background: The {{findings}} of the few studies that have to date investigated {{the way in which}} individuals with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) navigate their social environment are somewhat contradictory. We undertook this study to shed new light on the social-cognitive profile of patients with AN, analysing Theory of Mind and emotional functioning. Starting from previous evidence {{on the role of the}} amygdala in the neurobiology of AN and in the social cognition, we hypothesise preserved Theory of Mind and impaired emotional functioning in patients with AN. Methodology: Thirty women diagnosed with AN and thirty-two women <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> and age were involved in the study. Theory of Mind and emotional functioning were assessed with a set of validated experimental tasks. A measure of perceived social support was also used to test the correlations between this dimension and the social-cognitive profile of AN patients. Principal Findings: The performance of patients with AN is significantly worse than that of healthy controls on tasks assessing emotional functioning, whereas patients ’ performance is comparable to that of healthy controls on the Theory of Mind task. Correlation analyses showed no relationship between scores on any of the social-cognition tasks and either age of onset or duration of illness. A correlation between social support and emotional functioning was found. This latter result seems to suggest a potential role of social support in the treatment and recovery of AN...|$|E

40|$|Rationale Reflection impulsivity-a {{failure to}} gather and {{evaluate}} information before making a decision-is {{a critical component of}} risk-taking and substance use behaviours, which are highly prevalent during adolescence. Objectives and methods The Information Sampling Test was used to assess reflection impulsivity in 175 adolescents (mean age 18. 3, range 16. 5 - 20; 55 % female) - 48 cannabis users (2. 3 years use, 10. 8 days/month), 65 alcohol users, and 62 non-substance-using controls-recruited from a longitudinal cohort and from the general community and <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> and IQ. Cannabis and alcohol users were matched on levels of alcohol consumption. Results Cannabis users sampled to the lowest degree of certainty before making a decision on the task. Group differences remained significant after controlling for relevant substance use and clinical confounds (e. g., anxiety, depressive symptoms, alcohol, and ecstasy use). Poor performance on multiple IST indices was associated with an earlier age of onset of regular cannabis use and greater duration of exposure to cannabis, after controlling for recent use. Alcohol users did not differ from controls on any IST measure. Conclusions Exposure to cannabis during adolescence is associated with increased risky and impulsive decision making, with users adopting strategies with higher levels of uncertainty and inefficient utilisation of information. The young cannabis users did show sensitivity to losses, suggesting that greater impulsivity early in their drug using career is more evident when {{there is a lack of}} negative consequences. This provides a window of opportunity for intervention before the onset of cannabis dependence...|$|E
40|$|Background It is {{proposed}} {{that changes in}} reward processing in the brain {{are involved in the}} pathophysiology of pain based on experimental studies. The first aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if reward drive and/or reward responsiveness was altered in patients with chronic pain (PCP) compared to controls <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education,</b> age and sex. The second aim was to investigate the relationship between reward processing and nucleus accumbens volume in PCP and controls. Nucleus accumbens is central in reward processing and its structure has been shown to be affected by chronic pain conditions in previous studies. Methods Reward drive and responsiveness were assessed with the Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Activation Scale, and nucleus accumbens volumes obtained from T 1 -weighted brain MRIs obtained at 3 T in 19 PCP of heterogeneous aetiologies and 20 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls. Anhedonia was assessed with Beck's Depression Inventory II. Results The PCP group had significantly reduced scores on the reward responsiveness, but not reward drive. There was a trend towards smaller nucleus accumbens volume in the PCP compared to control group. There was a significant positive partial correlation between reward responsiveness and nucleus accumbens volume in the PCP group adjusted for anhedonia, which was significantly different from the same relationship in the control group. Conclusions Reward responsiveness is reduced in chronic pain patients of heterogeneous aetiology, and this reduction was associated with nucleus accumbens volume. Reduced reward responsiveness could be a marker of chronic pain vulnerability, and may indicate reduced opioid function...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease {{dementia}} is {{a challenge}} in clinical settings. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is time-consuming and expensive; brief instruments for cognitive evaluation must be easier to administer and provide a reliable classification. Objective: To study {{the validity of the}} Brazilian version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) for the cognitive assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with heterogeneous educational level. Methods: Patients were evaluated according to the diagnostic procedures recommended by the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) as the gold standard for the diagnosis of dementia in PD. Results: We studied 70 idiopathic PD patients, with a mean (SD) age of 64. 1 (9. 3) years and mean disease duration of 7. 7 (5. 3) years and educational level of 5. 9 years, <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> and age to controls. Twenty-seven patients fulfilled MDS clinical criteria for PD dementia. Mean scores on the ACE-R were 54. 7 (12. 8) points for patients with PD dementia, 76 (9. 9) for PD patients without dementia and 79. 7 (1. 8) points for healthy controls. The area under the receiver operating curve, taking the MDS diagnostic procedures as a reference, was 0. 93 [95 % CI, 0. 87 - 0. 98; p< 0. 001] for ACE-R. The optimal cut-off value for ACE-R was &# 8804; 72 points [sensitivity 90 %; specificity 85 %; Kappa concordance (K) 0. 79]. Conclusion: ACE-R appears to be a valid tool for dementia evaluation in PD patients with heterogeneous educational level, displaying good correlation with clinical criteria and diagnostic procedures of the MDS...|$|E

The women were also administered the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS- 11). The BN patients displayed significant impairments on all inhibition measures, and posited significantly higher impulsivity scores than the controls. Moreover, controlling for impulsivity reduced the group differences in Stroop colour naming and excluded letter fluency to non-significance, indicating that poor inhibitory control in BN is at least partly attributable to an impulsive disposition...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of visuoperceptual function to complex visuomotor responding in Parkinson's disease, 14 patients with idiopathic PD and 12 normal controls <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> age, <b>education</b> and general intellectual function were administered a visual tracing task. No difference {{was found between the}} groups on two visuoperceptual tests, the Benton Line Orientation test and a test of trajectory judgement. However, patients were significantly impaired in tracing a sawtooth design when two consecutive angles of the sawtooth were occluded. This impairment occurred in reproducing the basic form of the stimulus and not with accuracy of fine detail. These results suggest higher-order perceptual motor dysfunction independent of any breakdown in basic visuoperceptual processing or loss of fine motor control. It is concluded that Parkinsonian patients are unable to use sensory information accurately to plan and execute complex or new movements...|$|R
40|$|Nearly {{half of all}} HIV-positive {{individuals}} {{present with}} some form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). The experiments described in this thesis examined the structural changes {{that occur in the}} brain as a result of HIV infection. While previous work has established that HIV targets the basal ganglia and fronto-striatal systems and impacts cortical and white matter pathways, it was unknown whether these changes occur in the absence of HAND. The studies described here focused on cognitively asymptomatic HIV+ individuals (CAHIV+) without HAND as determined by widely accepted neuropsychological performance guidelines. Experiment 1 utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine HIV-associated alterations in white matter (WM) fractional anisotropy (FA) in the absence of HAND in 23 HIV+ individuals and 17 control participants (HIV-) <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> age, <b>education,</b> and verbal IQ. The hypothesis was that CAHIV+ participants would show lower FA values than HIV- in the corpus callosum, frontotemporal, and parietal regions of interest (ROIs). CAHIV+ individuals demonstrated higher FA in the frontotemporal region and posterior corpus callosum, but lower FA in parietal WM relative to HIV- individuals. Experiment 2 utilized structural MRI to compare cortical thickness in 22 CAHIV+ individuals and 19 control participants (HIV-) <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> age, <b>education,</b> and verbal IQ. The hypothesis was that CAHIV+ participants would have thinner frontal, temporal, and parietal regions than HIV- participants. Reduced cortical thickness measures were identified in the cingulate and superior temporal gyri, with increased cortical thickness measures in the inferior occipital gyrus, for HIV+ participants compared to HIV-. Experiment 3 examined the relationship between the structural alterations identified in Experiments 1 and 2, neuropsychological performance on tests sensitive to HAND identification, and immunological characteristics in 30 HIV+ participants and 28 HIV- control participants. As hypothesized, regional FA values, cortical thickness, and viral load were related to neuropsychological composite scores for CAHIV+, but not HIV-. Together, results from these three studies suggest that regional FA and cortical alterations identified in CAHIV+ patients may contribute to the cognitive deficits often seen in later stages of HIV disease...|$|R
40|$|Fluency tasks {{have been}} widely used to tap the {{voluntary}} generation of responses. The anatomical correlates of fluency tasks and their sensitivity and specificity have been hotly debated. However, investigation of the cognitive processes involved in voluntary generation of responses and whether generation is supported by a common, general process (e. g. fluid intelligence) or specific cognitive processes underpinned by particular frontal regions has rarely been addressed. This study investigates a range of verbal and non-verbal fluency tasks in patients with unselected focal frontal (n = 47) and posterior (n = 20) lesions. Patients and controls (n = 35) <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education,</b> age and sex were administered fluency tasks including word (phonemic/semantic), design, gesture and ideational fluency as well as background cognitive tests. Lesions were analysed by standard anterior/ posterior and left/right frontal subdivisions as well as a finer-grained frontal localization method. Thus, patients with right and left lateral lesions were compared to patients with superior medial lesions. The results show that all eight fluency tasks are sensitive to frontal lobe damage although only the phonemic word and design fluency tasks were specific to the frontal region. Superior medial patients were the only group to be impaired on all eight fluency tasks, relative to controls, consistent with an energization deficit. The most marked fluency deficits for lateral patients were along material specific lines (i. e. left - phonemic and right - design). Phonemic word fluency that requires greater selection was most severely impaired following left inferior frontal damage. Overall, our results support the notion that frontal functions comprise a set of specialized cognitive processes, supported by distinct frontal regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} age differences in selective attention and the modulatory effect that {{variables such as}} verbal and spatial intelligence have on its decline. We used a Stroop colour test with no feature repetitions between subsequent trials to avoid priming effects. Sixteen healthy older (65 - 79 years, 8 females, MMSE= 28 - 30 / 30) and sixteen younger (18 - 34 years, 8 females) volunteers participated in the study. The two age-groups were <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> years and for four WAIS-R subtests (Wechsler, 1981) : Block Design, Arithmetic, Vocabulary and Similarities. Error percentage was similar {{in the two groups}} [< 4 %, F(1, 30) =. 04, p=. 84]. A classical Stroop effect was instead present in both younger [t(15) =- 5. 34, p<. 001] and older adults [t(15) =- 12. 45, p<. 001]. Older adults were 250 ms slower than younger controls, even after the data were logarithmically transformed to partially correct for general slowing [F(1, 30) = 58. 89, p<. 001]. The older group suffered from the word-colour Stroop interference more than younger adults as shown by the interaction between age and congruency [F(1, 30) = 20. 44, p<. 01]. This finding confirms that older adults have difficulty in ignoring non-target features (colour word) with respect to a target feature (word colour). However, a negative correlation between Similarities test scores and Stroop effect in the older group (r= -. 58, p<. 05) was obtained, indicating that those older adults with higher verbal similarities scores are those who cope better with Stroop interference. This finding suggests that there is a specific type of cognitive reserve, probably related to verbal intelligence, which preserves selective attention in normal aging...|$|E

Here we present the first study investigating a large set of social-cognitive abilities, and the possible relationships between these abilities and the performance on executive-function tasks, in a homogenous sample of patients with FM. METHODOLOGY: Forty women with FM and forty-one healthy women <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> and age {{were involved in the}} study. Social cognition was assessed with a set of validated experimental tasks. Measures of executive function were used to test the correlations between this dimension and the social-cognitive profile of patients with FM.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients with FM have impairments both in the regulation of their own affect and in the recognition of other's emotions, as well as in representing other people's mental states. No significant correlations were found between social cognition tasks and the subcomponents of the executive function that were analysed. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the presence of several impairments in social cognition skills in patients with FM, which are largely independent of both executive function deficits and symptoms of psychological distress. The impairments reported highlight the importance of adequately assessing ToM and emotional functioning in clinical practice...|$|E

We {{found no significant}} difference in performance between mid-aged and young-old groups, but the old-old group was significantly slower than the other two groups. The differences between the old-old group and the other groups combined were independently mediated by useful field of view (UFOV), contrast sensitivity, and simple reaction time measures. Given that hazard perception latency has been linked with increased crash risk, these results are consistent with the idea that increased crash risk in older adults could be a function of poorer hazard perception, though this decline does not appear to manifest until age 75 + in healthy drivers...|$|R

40|$|See Hornberger for a {{scientific}} commentary on this article (doi: 10. 1093 /brain/awv 027). Verbal initiation, suppression and strategy generation/use are cognitive processes widely {{held to be}} supported by the frontal cortex. The Hayling Test was designed to tap these cognitive processes within the same sentence completion task. There are few studies specifically investigating the neural correlates of the Hayling Test {{but it has been}} primarily used to detect frontal lobe damage. This study investigates the components of the Hayling Test in a large sample of patients with unselected focal frontal (n = 60) and posterior (n = 30) lesions. Patients and controls (n = 40) <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education,</b> age and sex were administered the Hayling Test as well as background cognitive tests. The standard Hayling Test clinical measures (initiation response time, suppression response time, suppression errors and overall score), composite errors scores and strategy-based responses were calculated. Lesions were analysed by classical frontal/posterior subdivisions as well as a finer-grained frontal localization method and a specific contrast method that is somewhat analogous to voxel-based lesion mapping methods. Thus, patients with right lateral, left lateral and superior medial lesions were compared to controls and patients with right lateral lesions were compared to all other patients. The results show that all four standard Hayling Test clinical measures are sensitive to frontal lobe damage although only the sup-pression error and overall scores were specific to the frontal region. Although all frontal patients produced blatant suppression errors, a specific right lateral frontal effect was revealed for producing errors that were subtly wrong. In addition, frontal patients overall produced fewer correct responses indicative of developing an appropriate strategy but only the right lateral group showed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Exposure to {{indoor air}} of private or public {{buildings}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) has raised health concerns in long-term users. This exploratory neuropsychological group {{study investigated the}} potential adverse effects of chronic low-dose exposure to specific air-borne low chlorinated PCBs on well-being and behavioral measures in adult humans. Methods Thirty employees exposed to indoor air contaminated with PCBs from elastic sealants in a school building were compared to 30 non-exposed controls <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education</b> and age, controlling for gender (age range 37 – 61 years). PCB exposure was verified by external exposure data and biological monitoring (PCB 28, 101, 138, 153, 180). Subjective complaints, learning and memory, executive function, and visual-spatial function was assessed by standardized neuropsychological testing. Since exposure status depended {{on the use of}} contaminated rooms, an objectively exposed subgroup (N = 16; PCB 28 = 0. 20 μg/l; weighted exposure duration 17. 9 ± 7 years) was identified and compared with 16 paired controls. Results Blood analyses indicated a moderate exposure effect size (d) relative to expected background exposure for total PCB (4. 45 ± 2. 44 μg/l; d = 0. 4). A significant exposure effect was found for the low chlorinated PCBs 28 (0. 28 ± 0. 25 μg/l; d = 1. 5) and 101 (0. 07 ± 0. 09 μg/l; d = 0. 7). Although no neuropsychological effects exceeded the adjusted significance level, estimation statistics showed elevated effect sizes for several variables. The objectively exposed subgroup showed a trend towards increased subjective attentional and emotional complaints (tiredness and slowing of practical activities, emotional state) as well as attenuated attentional performance (response shifting and alertness in a cued reaction task). Conclusion Chronic inhalation of low chlorinated PCBs that involved elevated blood levels was associated with a subtle attenuation of emotional well-being and attentional function. Extended research is needed to replicate the potential long-term low PCB effects in a larger sample. </p...|$|E
40|$|Verbal initiation, {{suppression}} {{and strategy}} generation/use are cognitive processes widely {{held to be}} supported by the frontal cortex. The Hayling Test was designed to tap these cognitive processes within the same sentence completion task. There are few studies specifically investigating the neural correlates of the Hayling Test {{but it has been}} primarily used to detect frontal lobe damage. This study investigates the components of the Hayling Test in a large sample of patients with unselected focal frontal (n = 60) and posterior (n = 30) lesions. Patients and controls (n = 40) <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> <b>education,</b> age and sex were administered the Hayling Test as well as background cognitive tests. The standard Hayling Test clinical measures (initiation response time, suppression response time, suppression errors and overall score), composite errors scores and strategy-based responses were calculated. Lesions were analysed by classical frontal/posterior subdivisions as well as a finer-grained frontal localization method and a specific contrast method that is somewhat analogous to voxel-based lesion mapping methods. Thus, patients with right lateral, left lateral and superior medial lesions were compared to controls and patients with right lateral lesions were compared to all other patients. The results show that all four standard Hayling Test clinical measures are sensitive to frontal lobe damage although only the suppression error and overall scores were specific to the frontal region. Although all frontal patients produced blatant suppression errors, a specific right lateral frontal effect was revealed for producing errors that were subtly wrong. In addition, frontal patients overall produced fewer correct responses indicative of developing an appropriate strategy but only the right lateral group showed a significant deficit. This problem in strategy attainment and implementation could explain, at least in part, the suppression error impairment. Contrary to previous studies there was no specific frontal effect for verbal initiation. Overall, our results support a role for the right lateral frontal region in verbal suppression and, for the first time, in strategy generation/use...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of brief cognitive tests in differentiating vascular dementia (VaD) from Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: Fifteen patients with mild VaD, 15 patients with mild probable AD and 30 healthy controls, <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> age, <b>education</b> and dementia severity, were {{submitted to the}} following cognitive tests: clock drawing (free drawing and copy), category and letter fluency, delayed recall test of figures and the EXIT 25 battery. RESULTS: VaD patients performed worse than AD patients in category fluency (p= 0. 014), letter fluency (p= 0. 043) and CLOX 2 (p= 0. 023), while AD cases performed worse than VaD patients in delayed recall (p= 0. 013). However, ROC curves for these tests displayed low sensitivity and specificity for the differential diagnosis between VaD and AD. CONCLUSION: Although the performance of VaD and AD patients was significantly different in some cognitive tests, the value of such instruments in differentiating VaD from AD proved to be very limited...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Time-space synesthesia is {{a variant}} of sequence– space synesthesia and {{involves}} the involuntary association of {{months of the year}} with 2 D and 3 D spatial forms, such as arcs, circles, and ellipses. Previous studies have revealed conflict-ing results regarding the association between time-space synesthesia and enhanced spatial processing ability. Here, we tested 15 time-space synesthetes, and 15 non-synesthetic controls <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> age, <b>education,</b> and gender on standard tests of mental rotation ability, spatial working memory, and verbal working memory. Synesthetes performed better than controls on our test of mental rotation, but similarly to controls on tests of spatial and verbal working memory. Results sup-port a dissociation between visuo-spatial imagery and spatial working memory capacity, and suggest time-space synesthe-sia is associated only with enhanced visuo-spatial imagery. These data are consistent with the time-space connectivity thesis that time-space synesthesia results from enhanced connectivity in the parietal lobe between regions supporting the representation of temporal sequences and those underlying visuo-spatial imagery...|$|R
40|$|Selected {{aspects of}} verbal memory and {{executive}} function were compared in 11 demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 11 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with equally severe dementia, with 11 healthy controls <b>matched</b> <b>for</b> age and <b>education.</b> Semantic and episodic memory were impared in all patients compared with controls, {{but to a}} relatively greater degree in AD patients than in those with PD. In contrast, demented PD patients were relatively more compromised on executive tasks. These findings, taken {{in the context of}} the neuropathological and neurochemical overlap between demented PD and AD patients, suggest that differences in neurobehavioural patterns in patients with these diseases are relative, rather than absolute...|$|R
