Through a method of representation where as John Slyce describes Wearing representation as [...] "frameing herself as she frames the other" [...] Her photo and video works at first appear like any other journalistic <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> that is seen in television and documentaries, but after further examination it becomes apparent {{that they do not}} conform to mass-media conventions. Wearing’s work reveals the fact that the camera does not take a neutral stance, but a powerful mass-media organ that breaks down the public and the private. In the early 1990s, Wearing started putting together photography exhibitions where she works with strangers. There is a reoccurring pattern in her work where she plays and mocks the idea of the artist as anthropologist and that her anthropological activities do not focus on discovering a foreign culture but instead Wearing challenges what we thought we already knew. Wearing sees that Anthropology ‘attempts to compress human subjectivity into scientific objectifity’ [...] As John Slyce puts it: “Gillian Wearing does not suffer the indignity of speaking for others.”.” How Wearing approaches her subjects then is by inviting the individual to include their own articulation of thought into the picture within the space that she has provided, rather than an objective documentation. [...] In an interview with Donna De Salvo, Wearing states: ...|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis is to investigate methods in which deficiencies in construction documents {{can be addressed}} {{through the application of}} digital technology. These deficiencies take two forms. The first form relates specifically to the limitations of a paper based documentation system with regard to accessing information. This is becoming increasingly prevalent due to the increasing amount of documentation required for complex building projects. The second set of deficiencies {{is directly related to the}} time consuming nature of the construction document production process, recognizing that the majority of time is spent reformatting and redrawing previous details and specifications. The concepts of object-oriented programming and levels of abstraction are used as organizational structures to address these deficiencies. While current <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> utilize more traditionally based organizational system, this thesis explored the use of structures inherent to computational media. Additionally, database structures were explored as a key component to information reuse in the documentation process. Two prototype systems are developed to propose alternative <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> using computational media. The Building Interface is an interactive system for information access that utilizes varying densities of information and multiple modes of representation. The Drawing Assembler is a graphic search engine for construction details that links a building component database with a construction detail database through the intersection of dissimilar objects. by Michael James Kilkelly.

5000|$|In {{the fields}} of {{cardiology}} and medical imaging, Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (STE) is an echocardiographic imaging technique that analyzes the motion of tissues in the heart by using the naturally occurring speckle pattern in the myocardium or blood when imaged by ultrasonic. This novel <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>documentation</b> <b>of</b> myocardial motion represents a noninvasive <b>method</b> <b>of</b> definition of vectors and velocity. When compared to other technologies seeking noninvasive definition of ischemia, speckle tracking seems a valuable endeavor. This speckle pattern {{is a mixture of}} interference patterns and natural acoustic reflections. These reflections are also described as ‘‘speckles’’ or ‘‘markers’’. The pattern being random, each region of the myocardium has a unique speckle pattern (also called ‘‘patterns’’, ‘‘features’’, or ‘‘fingerprints’’) that allows the region to be traced from one frame to the next, and this speckle pattern is relatively stable, at least from one frame to the next. In post processing this can be tracked consecutively frame to frame and ultimately resolved into angle-independent two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional strain-based sequences (3D) [...] These sequences provide both quantitative and qualitative information regarding tissue deformation and motion.|$|R
