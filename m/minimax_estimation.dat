The aim of the dissertation {{is to develop a}} generalized Kalman Duality concept applicable for linear unbounded non-invertible operators and introduce the <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> theory and algorithms for linear differential-algebraic equations. In particular, the dissertation pursues the following goals: - develop generalized duality concept for the <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> theory for DAEs with unknown but bounded model error and random observation noise with unknown but bounded correlation operator; - derive the <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> theory for linear DAEs with unknown but bounded model error and random observation noise with unknown but bounded correlation operator; - describe how the DAE model propagates uncertain parameters; - estimate the worst-case error; - construct fast estimation algorithms in the form of filters; - develop a tool for model validation, that is to assess how good the model describes observed phenomena. The dissertation contains the following new results: - generalized version of the Kalman duality principle is proposed allowing to handle unbounded linear model operators with non-trivial null-space; - new definitions of the minimax estimates for DAEs based on the generalized Kalman duality principle are proposed; - theorems of existence for minimax estimates are proved; - new <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> algorithms (in the form of filter and in the variational form) for DAE are proposed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> approach for linear Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE) with uncertain parameters. The approach addresses continuous-time DAE with non-stationary rectangular matrices and uncertain bounded deterministic input. An observation’s noise {{is supposed to}} be random with zero mean and unknown bounded correlation function. Main results are a Generalized Kalman Duality (GKD) principle and sub-optimal <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> algorithm. GKD is derived by means of Young-Fenhel duality theorem. GKD proves that the minimax estimate coincides with a solution to a Dual Control Problem (DCP) with DAE constraints.

40|$|Abstract: A reduced <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> {{approach}} is proposed for highdimensional models. It {{is based on}} the reduction of the ordinary differential equation with high state space dimension to the low-dimensional Differential-Algebraic Equation (DAE) and on the subsequent application of the <b>minimax</b> state <b>estimation</b> to the resulting DAE. The DAE is composed of a reduced state equation and of a linear algebraic constraint. The later allows to bound linear combinations of the reduced state’s components in order to prevent possible instabilities, originating from the model reduction. The method is robust as it can handle model and observational errors in any shape, provided they are bounded. We derive a minimax algorithm adapted to computations in highdimension.
