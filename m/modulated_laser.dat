The achieved dis-persion-length product for a-factor greater than 9. 4 dB (bit-error rate less than 10 15) was about 750 ps/nm. The fiber that enabled such long transmission distance with high dispersion tol-erance is a nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber that has negative dis-persion {{in the entire}} usable bandwidth (1280 – 1620 nm) and is op-timized for operation with directly <b>modulated</b> <b>lasers.</b> The excellent single-channel transmission performance that we achieved can be expected also from wavelength-division-multiplexed systems with channels across the erbium-doped fiber amplifier bands.

50|$|In tapping mode, the {{cantilever}} {{is driven}} to oscillate {{up and down}} at or near its resonance frequency. This oscillation is commonly achieved with a small piezo element in the cantilever holder, but other possibilities include an AC magnetic field (with magnetic cantilevers), piezoelectric cantilevers, or periodic heating with a <b>modulated</b> <b>laser</b> beam. The amplitude of this oscillation usually varies from several nm to 200 nm. In tapping mode, the frequency and amplitude of the driving signal are kept constant, leading to a constant amplitude of the cantilever oscillation {{as long as there}} is no drift or interaction with the surface. The interaction of forces acting on the cantilever when the tip comes close to the surface, Van der Waals forces, dipole-dipole interactions, electrostatic forces, etc. cause the amplitude of the cantilever's oscillation to change (usually decrease) as the tip gets closer to the sample. This amplitude is used as the parameter that goes into the electronic servo that controls the height of the cantilever above the sample. The servo adjusts the height to maintain a set cantilever oscillation amplitude as the cantilever is scanned over the sample. A tapping AFM image is therefore produced by imaging the force of the intermittent contacts of the tip with the sample surface.|$|E
