5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brown</b> drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brown</b> is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E
5|$|How Brown Saw the Baseball Game, {{also known}} as How Jones Saw the Baseball Game, is an American short silent comedy film {{produced}} in 1907 and distributed by the Lubin Manufacturing Company. The film follows a baseball fan, named <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brown,</b> who drinks large quantities of alcohol before a baseball game and becomes so intoxicated that the game appears to him in reverse motion. During production, trick photography was used to achieve this effect.|$|E
5|$|Larry Wilmore, {{who plays}} the {{sensitivity}} trainer <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brown,</b> is {{a writer for the}} show. At the table-read for this episode, they had not cast the part yet and Daniels had Wilmore read for the role to fill in. After the read, producer Greg Daniels thought he was perfect for the role. However, because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild, producers still had to have Wilmore formally audition with other actors for the role. Daniels was also not sure where to use Mindy Kaling on screen in the series until the point came in this episode's script when Michael needed to be slapped by a minority. Her character in this episode, however, is far from the bubbly, chatty character that Kelly later becomes.|$|E

60|$|But, {{several years}} ago, an eminent writer, whom I need not name, {{published}} in a newspaper another version. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Browning</b> had told him, he said, that, sitting with Home and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Browning</b> (apparently alone, these three) in a darkened room, he saw a white object rise above the table. This Home represented as the phantasm of a child of <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Browning,</b> which died in infancy. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Browning</b> seized the phantasm, which was Home's naked foot.|$|R
60|$|In 1855, Home met <b>Mr.</b> and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Browning</b> at {{the house}} of a Mr. Rymer, at Ealing, the first of only two meetings.[19] On this occasion, says Home, a wreath of {{clematis}} rose from the table and floated towards <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Browning,</b> behind whom her husband went and stood. The wreath settled on the lady's head, not on that of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Browning,</b> who, Home thought, was jealous of the favour. This is manifestly absurd. Soon after, all but Mr. Rymer were invited to leave the room. Two days later, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Browning</b> asked to be allowed to bring a friend for another séance, but the arrangements of the Rymers, with whom Home was staying, made this impossible. Later, Home, with Mrs. Rymer, called on the Brownings in town, and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Browning</b> declined to notice Home; there was a scene, and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Browning</b> (who was later a three-quarters believer in 'spirits') was distressed. In 1864, after Mrs. Browning's death, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Browning</b> published <b>Mr.</b> Sludge, the Medium, which had the air of a personal attack on Home as a detected and confessing American impostor. Such is Home's account. It was published in 1872, and was open to contradiction. I am not aware that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Browning</b> took any public notice of it.|$|R

25|$|The {{station was}} named 'The Lavender Line' with a {{historical}} connection in mind: A.E. Lavender and Sons were the local coal merchants who had operated {{from the station}} yard. Two engines were purchased for use at the station: 'Annie', a Barclay 0-4-0 saddle tank previously in service at Bury Transport Museum, and 'Ugly', RSH 0-6-0 saddle tank number 64, purchased while on loan at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. A third engine was purchased, a 2-10-0 built by the North British Locomotive Company, {{which had to be}} shipped from Greece to the United Kingdom. The engine was christened 'Dame Vera Lynn' by Dame Vera Lynn herself at the station on 6 August 1986. This engine proved too large for the tracks, however, and was sold to Clifford Brown, a British-born American businessman living in Virginia, USA. <b>Mr</b> <b>Brown</b> sent the engine to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it now resides.|$|E

60|$|Why does <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Brown</b> {{leave her}} husband and children, to run off with the New Doctor?

500|$|... "Diversity Day" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Office to feature {{original}} writing, as the [...] "Pilot" [...] contained many jokes from the British series pilot. The episode guest starred Larry Wilmore, who plays the sensitivity trainer <b>Mr.</b> <b>Brown.</b> Wilmore, {{a writer for the}} show, had to formally audition with other actors because of stipulations with the Screen Actors Guild.
