25|$|The daily {{driving time}} shall not exceed 9 hours. The daily driving {{time may be}} {{extended}} to at most 10 hours not more than twice during the week. The weekly driving time may not exceed 56 hours. In addition to this, a driver cannot exceed 90 hours driving in a fortnight. Within each period of 24 hours {{after the end of}} the previous daily rest period or weekly rest period a driver must take a new daily rest period. An 11-hour (or more) daily rest is called a regular daily rest period. Alternatively, a driver can split a regular daily rest period into two periods. The first period must be at least 3 hours of uninterrupted rest and can be taken at any time during the day. The second must be at least 9 hours of uninterrupted rest, giving a total <b>minimum</b> <b>rest</b> of 12 hours. A driver may reduce his daily rest period to no less than 9 continuous hours, but this can be done no more than three times between any two weekly rest periods; no compensation for the reduction is required. A daily rest that is less than 11 hours but at least 9 hours long is called a reduced daily rest period. When a daily rest is taken, this may be taken in a vehicle, as long as it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|E

Acceptance of a PAR or ASR by a pilot does not waive the prescribed weather minimums for the airport or for the particular aircraft operator concerned.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} different regulatory policies directed towards high-frequency trading (HFT) through an agent-based model of a limit order book able to generate flash crashes {{as the result of}} the interactions between low- and high-frequency (HF) traders. We analyze the impact of the imposition of <b>minimum</b> <b>resting</b> times, of circuit breakers (both ex-post and ex-ante types), of cancellation fees and of transaction taxes on asset price volatility and on the occurrence and duration of ash crashes. In the model, low- frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. In contrast, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. In addition, high-frequency traders employ low-latency directional strategies that exploit market information and they can cancel their orders depending on expected profits. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that reducing HF order cancellation, via <b>minimum</b> <b>resting</b> times or cancellation fees, or discouraging HFT via financial transaction taxes, reduces market volatility and the frequency of ash crashes. However, these policies also imply a longer duration of flash crashes. Furthermore, the introduction of an ex-ante circuit breaker markedly reduces price volatility and removes ash crashes. In contrast, ex-post circuit breakers do not affect market volatility and they increase the duration of flash crashes. Our results show that HFT-targeted policies face a trade-o between market stability and resilience. Policies that reduce volatility and the incidence of flash crashes also imply a reduced ability of the market to quickly recover from a crash. The dual role of HFT, as both a cause of the flash crash and a fundamental actor in the post-crash recovery underlies the above trade-off...|$|R

We find that the latter is the most effective in restoring the liquidity of the book and recovery of the price level.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the quantitative relation existing between action potential and resting potential of the lobster giant axon. Resting potential changes were induced by either increasing the external potassium concentration or by reducing the external calcium concentration. For either treatment the action potential amplitude {{is proportional to the}} logarithm of the resting potential minus a constant. This constant is equivalent to the <b>minimum</b> <b>resting</b> potential at which a propagated spike is possible, and is larger for depolarization in low calcium than in high potassium. Thus the change in action potential per unit change in resting potential is greater in low external calcium than in high external potassium. Analog computer solutions to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for squid axon membrane potentials show that, if the initial conditions are properly specified, the action potential is proportional to the logarithm of the potassium potential minus a constant. The experimental results and the analog computations suggest that reducing external calcium produces changes in the invertebrate axon that cannot b...|$|R

50|$|The European Court of Justice {{held that}} all {{time he was}} {{required}} {{to be at the}} hospital, even when sleeping, was to be regarded as working time. The Directive, after the SIMAP case could not be taken to treat inactive on call time as a rest period. Dr Jaeger, by being required to stay at work was subject to greater constraints than a doctor at home, because he was kept apart from his family and social environment. The 1994 Act breached the Directive by letter Dr Jaegerâ€™s collective agreement proide for offsetting of only active on call time. Under Art 17, a derogation to allow for a reduction of the daily <b>minimum</b> <b>rest</b> of 8 hours could only be granted if a period of rest followed immediately, and a reduction could not allow the maximum weekly working time to be exceeded.|$|E

The EU directive also limits night work involving [...] "special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain" [...] to an average of eight hours in any 24-hour period. The EU directive allows for limited derogations from the regulation, and special provisions allow longer working hours for transportation and offshore workers, fishing vessel workers, and doctors in training (see also medical resident work hours).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{systematic}} {{review of the}} empirical literature on the implications of tick size changes for exchanges. Our focus is twofold: first, we {{are concerned with the}} market quality implications of a change in the minimum tick size. Second, we are interested in the implications of changes in the minimum tick size on market structure. We show that there is a large body of empirical literature that documents a decrease in transaction costs following a decrease in the minimum tick size. However, even though market liquidity increases, the incentive to provide market making activities decreases. We document a strong link between the minimum tick size regulations and the recent increase in high frequency trading activity. A smaller tick enhances the price discovery process. However, the question of how multiple tick size regimes affect market liquidity in a fragmented market remains to be answered. Finally, we identify topics for future research; we discuss the empirical literature on the minimum trade unit and the recent calls for a <b>minimum</b> <b>resting</b> time for quotes...|$|R
