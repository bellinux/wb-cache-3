A 7. 5 -MHz linear transducer {{was used to}} determine the inner diameter of the veins and blood flow velocities and volumes on the left side in standing, non-sedated animals. Cows were weighed and milk yield measured at all examination times. The <b>milk</b> <b>vein</b> appeared as a vessel with an inner diameter of 2. 01 - 2. 30 cm immediately beneath the skin. The maximum blood flow velocity ranged from 23. 84 to 35. 76 cm/s before parturition, increased markedly on the day of calving (day 0), peaked at 61. 14 cm/s on day 1 and slowly decreased to 23. 84 cm/s by day 300. The profiles of the minimum and mean maximum flow velocities and flow volume were similar. The musculophrenic vein had an inner diameter of 0. 76 - 1. 07 cm and its distance {{from the surface of the}} skin was 1. 15 - 1. 31 cm.

40|$|Introduction and Aims One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes for maternal death in developing countries is the third stage bleeding. The main aim {{of this study is to}} compare the effect of milking umbilical cord with diluted oxytocin and normal saline injections in the umbilical cord vein, on labor third stage duration and bleeding. Materials and Methods The randomized control trial was done on 168 parturient mothers in Ahvaz hospitals. In the first group (N = 56) the umbilical cord blood was milked toward the placenta, the mothers in second group (N = 44) and third group (N = 32) were received 20 IU oxytocin and 30 ml saline normal in umbilical cord vein, respectively. Finally the forth or control group (N = 36) were received infusion of 20 IU oxytocin in 1000 ml serum ringer as the routine postpartum care. Then collected data was analyzed in SPSS v. 16 by statistical tests, paired t-test, and ANOVA (CI = 95 %). Results Mean duration of third stage of labor was significantly different between groups (P = 0. 02), but all three manipulated groups did not have any significantly difference whereas, the difference was between control and manipulated groups. The effect of <b>milking</b> the umbilical <b>vein</b> toward placenta, is similar to the other manipulations in third stage duration. Mean hemoglobin concentration was not importantly different between the groups. Conclusion Milking the umbilical cord blood toward placenta could reduce the duration of labor third stage the same as the others (diluted oxytocin and saline normal in umbilical vein). While this new method is easier and more available. * Corresponding Author: Ahvaz Islamic Azad University. E-mail: Ehsani 81 @yahoo. co...|$|R
40|$|The Ottoman Empire {{carried out}} {{some changes in}} local {{administration}} in 1864 and began to apply provincial system (vilayetsistemi) instead of principality system (eyalet sistemi). The Danubian Province which {{came to the fore}} during the governorship ofMithad Paşa is an important province especially in respect to the printing house and the newspaper called Tuna. The importanceof the province is also because of the geographical position of the province. The great part of the province is situated next to theRiver Danube. The Danube which was ascribed great importance to itself was used from the ancient times on for the purposes oftrading, transporting, travelling etc. Even during the military expeditions made to the regions near by the Danube the OttomanState took the advantage of the river in maximal level. During {{the second half of the}} XIXth century with special reference to 1873, the Danubian Province had 6 sanjaks (Ruse, Vidin, Varna, Sofia, Tirnovo and Tulcea), 41 districts and 18 townships. Thecapital city of the Province was Ruse (Rusçuk). The main source of this study is the Tuna Newspaper. This newspaper has two pages and four columns in each page. It waspublished in Ruse two times a week, Sunday and Wednesday. The newspaper has four main titles, Special Subjects, General Subjects,News from Abroad and Advertisements. Under these titles one can find especially political, economic, socio-cultural news. On theother hand, sometimes news about health can also be found. Cholera which is the main topic of this study is a kind of mortal epidemic disease emerging in India in 1768. In the pastbecause of this epidemic disease lots of people died. Cholera epidemic also showed its mortal effects in the first half of the XIXthcentury. During the second half of the XIXth century, especialy in 1965 and 1973 we can see the fatal effects of cholera epidemicagain. Cholera epidemic in the Danubian Province appeared first in Vidin in May 7, 1873. During the year in the sanjaks, districts,townships and villages of the Province about 1171 people died and 2000 people became ill because of the disease. The mostaffected districts and towns of the Danubian Province from cholera were Ruse, Tulcea, Tirnovo, Hezargrad, Pleven, Shumen,Berkofca, Orhaniye, Hirsova and Pravadi. It is estimated also for he world that because of chlora epidemic 183. 549 people died, 247. 718 people returned to health and 2. 028 people continued treatment till December, 1873. It is well known that the most important measure for cholera disease is the application of quarantine and admission tocordon. When a cholera epidemic appeared in a place, the state officials took that place under cordon and quarantine. The mainquarantine stations in the Danubian Province were in Ruse and Isakci. The people coming from the west and from the regions ofWallachia and Moldavia were taken under control in these stations. The people going to Istanbul were also taken under control inthe quarantine buildings in Varna and in the Bosphorus. There were also six hospitals in the Sanjak of Ruse, four hospitals in theSanjak of Vidin, two hospitals in the Sanjak of Tulcea, one hospital in the Sanjak of Sofia and one hospital in the Sanjak of Varna. All these hospitals and quarantine buildings remained sometimes insuffient to supply health services therefore some peoplecomplained quarantine applications. Of course health service was also very important during cholera epidemic. When an epidemic event emerged in a place,doctors, pharmacists, drugs and medical materials were sent there as soon as possible. Sometimes new cottages were built for the patients in the places which have fresh air. Authorized persons strained to be able to create a healty atmosphere for the patientsand also took care of the hygiene of the foodstuffs. We know that in the XIXth century scientists from Germany and Italy were studying on cholera disease and producing somedrugs. These scientists sent a few bottles of drugs to İstanbul as samples. In addition, some scientists studied on the ways ofkeeping from cholera epidemic and one of them sent his two books about chlora to the Ottoman Sultan and Prime-minister. Dr. Huder from Canada also tried to inject <b>milk</b> into <b>vein</b> as a method of treatment to be saved from cholera. It can be said that hebecame partially successful in some of his applications but in general scientists did not support this kind of treatment. Cholera epidemic resulted in a lot of family drama. Lots of people died during the mortal disease and lots of children becameorphans. Because of the epidemic some people died, some people left their lands and went other places. This resulted also indemografic changes in some places. We know that fairs were very important instruments for economic activities. Howevercholera epidemic also affected these fairs negatively. Lots of people could not go to the fairs because of the disease. It can be said that in order to give an end to cholera epidemic the Ottoman State tried to take all measures however it was toodifficult to avoid spreading of the disease. The state built new quarantine buildings and took the diseased places under cordon. Health services were extremely tried to be applied and to the end of the year 1873 cholera epidemic ended. To be able to set forth the cholera epidemic in 1873 in Danubian Province we utilized the Tuna Newspaper as the main sourceof the study. It gives detailed information about the epidemic in the Province. We also used some documents from the OttomanArchive in Istanbul. Lastly we supported the study with related sources. Using all these documents we tried to analyze the choleraepidemic in respect to causes, spread and consequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This study {{investigated}} the effect of milk yield on blood flow variables in the <b>milk</b> <b>vein</b> and musculophrenic vein in dairy cows. Methods Five healthy dry cows, five cows with a daily milk yield of 10 kg and five others with a daily milk yield of 20 kg underwent B-mode and colour Doppler sonographic examination. The diameter of the veins, blood flow velocities and blood flow volumes were measured on both sides in standing, non-sedated cows using a 7. 5 MHz linear transducer. Results Lactating cows had significantly higher blood flow velocities in the <b>milk</b> <b>vein</b> than dry cows; the maximum blood flow velocity of dry cows and those with a daily milk yield of 10 and 20 kg were 14. 04, 38. 77 and 39. 49 cm/s, respectively, the minimum velocities were 0. 63, 3. 02 and 2. 64 cm/s, respectively, and the mean maximum velocities were 8. 21, 26. 67 und 28. 22 cm/s, respectively. Cows producing 20 kg of milk a day had a blood flow volume of 3. 09 l/min, which {{was significantly higher than}} 0. 79 l/min recorded in dry cows. Lactating cows had significantly higher mean maximum blood flow velocities in the musculophrenic vein than dry cows. Blood flow variables of both veins did not differ significantly between the left and right side. Conclusion This study showed that milk yield has a profound effect on blood flow variables in the <b>milk</b> <b>vein</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} the musculophrenic vein. This must be taken into consideration in future Doppler sonographic studies of these veins and possibly other vessels. Furthermore, measurements on one side are representative of both sides. </p...|$|E

Treatment of these injuries can be diffi cult because {{of the characteristics of}} the veins. Five cows aged 6. 5 to 12 years were referred to the Animal Hospitale Zurich, because of intermittent haemorrhage from a ventral abdominal vein. Four of the cows were near term and one had calved two weeks before referral. Intermittent bleeding was seen from the highly convoluted and dilated subcutaneous tributaries to the cranial superfi cial epigastric vein (<b>milk</b> <b>vein).</b> The haematocrit of 2 cows was markedly lower than normal. Emergency slaughter of one of the cows was carried out because of advanced age. The other 4 cows were sedated and after application of local anaesthetic, the wounds were debrided and sutured. Two of the cows required a blood transfusion before being operated. There were no postoperative complications. This type of injury seems to occur predominantly in pluriparous dairy cows close to term, in which the tributaries to the <b>milk</b> <b>vein</b> have undergone varicose changes.

Mastitis (25. 5 %) was most common disease followed by udder skin diseases (15. 0 %) and teat diseases (12. 6 %). Prevalence of injuries and other lesions was higher in the skin of fore left udder quarter (22. 7 %) and teat (17. 7 %) and rear left teat end (4. 5 %). Mastitis {{was found to be}} associated with Sahiwal and Sindhi cross cow, poor body condition, bottle shaped teat, teat with round end, injuries and other lesions to the udder and teat skin and teat diseases. Udder skin diseases were strongly associated with indigenous cows, cow aged 5 - 10 years, small <b>milk</b> <b>vein,</b> larger front udder, and bottle shaped teats and flat end teats.

40|$|A {{total of}} 22 dairy {{dromedary}} camels under intensive conditions in late lactation (275 ± 24 days) {{were used to}} study the relationship between external and internal udder morphology and machine milking performances. Measurements of udder and teat morphology were obtained immediately before milking and in duplicate. Individual milk yield, lag time and total milking time were recorded during milking, and milk samples were collected and analyzed for milk composition thereafter. Cisternal and alveolar milk volumes and composition were evaluated at 9 h milking interval. Results revealed that dairy camels had well developed udders and milk veins, with medium sized teats. On average, milk yield as well as milk fat and protein contents were 4. 80 ± 0. 50 L d- 1, 2. 61 ± 0. 16 % and 3. 08 ± 0. 05 %, respectively. The low fat values observed indicated incomplete milk letdown during machine milking. Lag time, and total milking time were 3. 0 ± 0. 3, and 120. 0 ± 8. 9 s, on average, respectively. Positive correlations (p < 0. 05) were observed between milk yield and udder depth (r = 0. 37), distance between teats (r = 0. 57) and <b>milk</b> <b>vein</b> diameter (r = 0. 28), while a negative correlation was found with udder height (r = - 0. 25, p < 0. 05). Cisternal milk accounted for 11 % of the total udder milk. Positive correlations were observed between total milk yield and volume of alveolar milk (r = 0. 98; p < 0. 001) {{as well as with}} volume of cisternal milk (r = 0. 63, p < 0. 05). Despite the low udder milk storage capacity observed in dairy camels, our study concluded that the evaluated dromedary sample had adequate udder morphology for machine milking.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{modifications}} of the mammary utilization of nutrients circulating in blood plasma when milk yield is strongly decreased by once-daily milking. A trial was carried out to describe the mammary nutritional adjustments linked to the downregulation of milk synthesis as milk accumulated over an extended milking interval in the bovine udder. Three Holstein dairy cows yielding 34. 0 kg/d of milk were fitted with an ultrasound flow probe around the left external pudic artery and with catheters inserted into the left carotid and <b>milk</b> <b>vein</b> to estimate mammary blood flow (MBF) and mammary uptake of acetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, O(2), and CO(2) release. The trial was carried out over 2 consecutive weeks, with wk 2 repeating wk 1. Cows were milked twice daily at 12 -h milking intervals. On d 3, cows were milked at 0630 h and were not milked for 36 h until d 4 at 1830 h. Over the following days, twice-daily milking was resumed using 12 -h milking intervals. Each half-udder was milked separately. Secretion rates of milk and milk proteins decreased 67 % during the 12 -to- 36 -h interval of milk accumulation, whereas that of milk fat fell 30 %. Timing of changes in MBF and lactose levels in blood plasma was concomitant and significant after 19. 5 and 21. 5 h of milk accumulation in the udder, respectively. The MBF decreased, most likely because the usual increases in MBF no longer occurred when the udder was full of milk. After 24 h of milk accumulation, MBF did not increase further when cows lay down, and did not increase as usual 3 h after a meal, suggesting a possible physical effect of milk accumulated in the udder on MBF, complementing metabolic regulation. Mammary uptake or release of nutrients was lowered before 24 h for glucose, acetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate and after 24 h for total glycerol, O(2), and CO(2), mostly associated with the impaired MBF. However, these decreases ranged from 12 to 17 %, and cannot entirely explain the - 45 and - 20 % decreases in milk secretion rates observed during the entire 36 h of milk accumulation, thus confirming the primary role of intramammary metabolic regulation in the downregulation of milk secretion. The larger amount of nutrients {{taken up by the}} udder could explain the enhanced milk fat levels, involving a strongly modified metabolic fate of nutrients...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In this study, five {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to examine in vitro and in vivo degradation, excretion and absorption parameters of melamine (MEL) in dairy cows {{that have not been}} studied before or where limited information is available. The first two trials were in vitro studies conducted {{to determine the extent of}} MEL degradation in rumen liquor and the effects of MEL on ruminal ammonia (NH 3) and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations. For both trials, rumen liquor was collected from ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows. For the first and second trial, rumen liquor was collected from three and two cows, respectively. For both trials, Erlenmeyer flasks contained 1 g substrate and 100 mL incubation medium consisting of 20 mL rumen liquor and 80 mL reduced buffer solution. In the first trial, each flask contained 100 mg of MEL, resulting in an initial MEL concentration of 1000 mg/L. The flasks were incubated at 39 ° C for 0 (Control), 6, 24 or 48 hours under strictly anaerobic conditions. In all the trials, MEL concentrations were determined by LC/MSMS. MEL degradation was low after 6 and 24 h of incubation (3. 2 and 5. 5 %, respectively) and increased to 13. 6 % after 48 h of incubation. In the second trial where VFA and NH 3 concentrations were determined, the flasks contained either 0 (Control), 0. 2 (T 1) or 0. 4 mg (T 2) of MEL. The flasks were incubated for 6, 24 or 48 h. Treatment had no effect on individual or total VFA concentrations or NH 3 concentrations at 6 and 48 h. At 24 h, T 2 resulted in an inexplicable higher NH 3 concentration. This study showed that the addition of melamine would not result increased rumen NH 3 concentrations in vitro. Melamine would also not affect the production of different VFA’s. Therefore, it was concluded that the rumen micro-organisms present in rumen liquor would be unable to utilize MEL as a source of nitrogen and that the microbial production of VFA’s remains unaffected by the presence of MEL. In the third trial, MEL excretion in lactating cows was determined. Five cows were randomly allocated to treatments according to a 5 x 5 Latin square design. Cows received the treatment diets for 7 d followed by 8 d of MEL withdrawal during each of the five periods. The experimental treatments were formulated to provide a daily MEL intake of 0 (M 0), 500 (M 1), 1000 (M 2), 5000 (M 3) or 10000 mg (M 4) via 15 kg of dairy concentrate pellets. Calculations based on the work of Newton & Utley (1978) suggested that a melamine intake of 0. 16 g/kg of live weight would not result in detrimental health effects of ruminant animals. Therefore, a 600 kg lactating dairy cow should not be at risk when consuming 100 g of melamine. In this trial, the highest melamine treatment (M 4 = 10 g/d) included a 10 -fold safety factor from the suggested safe amount from the work of Newton & Utley (1978) and should not pose a health risk to the cows. Treatments had no effect on DMI, milk yield or milk composition. MEL was detected in the milk 8 h after initial MEL ingestion, increased rapidly and peaked on d 3 and was undetectable after 8 d. Treatments had no effect on MEL excretion efficiencies which ranged from 1. 5 to 2. 1 %. The mean apparent digestibility of MEL was 78 %. Mean faecal and urinary MEL excretions were 22 and 54 % of ingested MEL, respectively. Higher milk, urine and faecal MEL concentrations were observed with higher levels of dietary MEL. It was concluded that MEL appeared in the milk soon after first ingestion and a withdrawal period of 8 d was required for all milk, faecal and urine samples to reach undetectable levels of MEL. Urine and faeces were the primary routes for MEL excretion. The fourth trial was conducted to determine MEL absorption by the mammary gland in lactating dairy cows through arterio-venous (A-V) difference. Five cows received 10 g of MEL/d for three consecutive days. Day 3 of the trial was selected for commencement of blood sampling as previous studies (Cruywagen et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011) reported the milk melamine concentration to reach a peak on d 3 of continuous melamine consumption by dairy cows. Early on d 3, catheters were inserted into the caudal superficial epigastric vein (<b>milk</b> <b>vein)</b> and caudal auricular artery. The blood sampling period commenced after residual milk removal from the udder following oxytocin administration. Blood from both locations were collected hourly for 9 hours. Following the final blood collection, oxytocin was administered again, catheters were carefully removed and cows were milked immediately thereafter. All blood samples were centrifuged and the decanted plasma was analysed for MEL, as well as for amino acid contents to calculate mammary blood flow. The positive MEL flux (calculated from A-V difference) confirmed net absorption of MEL into the mammary gland with an efficiency of absorption of 0. 29 %. Melamine excretion into milk was 5. 63 mg/h. The mean plasma and milk MEL concentrations were 5. 2 and 3. 9 mg/kg, respectively. Melamine excretion efficiency to milk, expressed as percentage of the ingested amount, was 1. 47 %. It was concluded that melamine ingested by cows will result in net MEL absorption by the mammary gland, but that the absorption efficiency is low. The final trial of the study aimed to determine the effects that fermentation processes during the manufacturing of cheese, yoghurt and kefir would have on their MEL content if these products were made from MEL contaminated milk. Another objective was to determine if MEL in cheese would be degraded during the curing process. Cheese, yoghurt and kefir were made from milk with a MEL content of 6. 77 mg/kg. The cheese was then cured for 2 wk at 6 ° C. The MEL contents of the yoghurt and kefir were 6. 76 and 6. 78 mg/kg, respectively, indicating that the different fermentation processes used in yoghurt and kefir production had no effect on their MEL content and that MEL was not degraded during the short fermentation periods. The percentage of milk MEL partitioned to whey and cheese were 97. 4 and 6. 5 %, respectively. It was concluded that the different fermentation processes involved during the manufacturing of yoghurt and kefir from MEL tainted milk did not decrease the MEL concentration. The milk MEL was predominantly partitioned to whey, with little MEL transferred to cheese. It was also concluded that MEL was not degraded in cheese during a 2 -wk curing period. It was finally concluded that dietary MEL is readily absorbed by dairy cows and mainly excreted via the urine. The mammary gland has a low affinity for MEL absorption and approximately 2 % of ingested MEL is excreted in the milk. When cheese is made from MEL tainted milk, the majority of MEL will concentrate in the whey fraction and only 6. 5 % will be present in the cheese. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Vyf proewe is gedoen om in vitro- en in vivo-degradering, uitskeiding en absorpsie parameters van melamien (MEL) na te gaan waaroor daar min of geen inligting bekend was nie. Die eerste twee proewe was in vitro-studies, uitgevoer om die mate van MEL degradeerbaarheid in rumenvloeistof na te gaan, asook die invloed van MEL op rumen-NH 3 en vlugtige vetsuur (VVS) -konsentrasies. Vir beide proewe is rumenvloeistof van lakterende, rumengekannuleerde Holsteinkoeie verkry. Vir die eerste en tweede in vitro-studies, was rumenvloeistof verkry vanaf drie en twee koeie, onderskeidelik. In albei proewe is 1 g substraat in Erlen-meyerflessies afgeweeg en 100 mL inkubasiemedium bygevoeg wat uit 20 mL rumenvloeistof en 80 mL van ‘n buffermedium bestaan het. In die eerste proef is 100 mg MEL by die substraat gevoeg, sodat die aanvanklike MEL konsentrasie in die flessies 1000 mg/L was. Die flessies is by 39 ° C geïnkubeer vir 0 (Kontrole), 6, 24 of 48 ure, onder streng anaerobiese kondisies. Met die beïndiging van die inkubasieperiode is 100 mL van ‘n 0. 2 M perchloorsuuroplossing bygevoeg om enige melamien wat nie gedegradeer was nie, op te los. In al die proewe is melamienbepalings by wyse van LC/MSMS gedoen. Melamiendegradering was laag na 6 en 24 h inkubasie (3. 2 en 5. 5 %, respektiewelik) en teen 48 h inkubasie het dit toegeneem tot 13. 6 %. In die tweede proef het die flessies 0 (Kontrole), 0. 2 (T 1) of 0. 4 mg (T 2) melamien bevat. Behandeling het geen invloed op individuele of totale VVS-konsentrasies by enige van die inkubasietye gehad nie en ook nie op NH 3 -konsentrasies by 6 en 48 h nie. Om een of ander onverklaarbare rede het die T 2 -behandeling gelei tot hoër NH 3 -konsentrasies by 24 h. Die gevolgtrekking is gemaak dat die byvoeging van MEL geen effek op rumen NH 3 -konsentrasies het nie en dat die mikroorganismes in die rumen nie daartoe in staat sal wees om MEL as ‘n stikstof-bron sal kan benut nie. In die derde proef is die uitskeiding van MEL in melkkoeie ondersoek. Vyf lakterende Holsteinkoeie is ewekansig aan vyf behandelings toegeken in ‘n 5 x 5 Latynsevierkantontwerp. Gedurende elke periode het koeie die behandelings vir 7 d ontvang, gevolg deur ‘n 8 d MEL-onttrekkingsperiode. Die eksperimentele diëte is geformuleer om ‘n daaglikse MEL-inname van 0 (M 0), 500 (M 1), 1000 (M 2), 5000 (M 3) of 10000 mg (M 4) per koei/dag te verseker, toegedien via 15 kg/d van ‘n suiwelkonsentraat in pilvorm. Berekeninge gebasseer op die werk van Newton & Utley (1978) stel voor dat ‘n MEL inname van 0. 16 g/kg lewende massa, geen negatiewe effek op herkouers se gesondheid sal hê nie. Dus, ‘n koei wat 600 kg weeg, sal geen skade lei deur die inname van 100 g MEL nie. In hierdie proef was die hoogste MEL behandeling (M 4 = 10 g/d) tien keer laer as die voorgestelde veiligheidsvlak van Newton & Utley (1978). Behandeling het geen invloed op DMI, melkopbrengs of melksamestelling gehad nie. Melamien is so gou as 8 h na eerste inname in die melk waargeneem, waarna die konsentrasie vinnig toegeneem het en ‘n piek na 3 d bereik het. Behandeling het geen invloed op die uitskeidingsdoeltreffendheid van melamien in melk gehad nie en waardes het gewissel van 1. 5 tot 2. 1 %. Die gemiddelde skynbare verteerbaarheid van MEL was 78 %. Die gemiddelde mis- en uriene-MEL-konsentrasies was 22 en 54 %, onderskeidelik. Hoër melk-, mis- en uriene-MEL-konsentrasies is waargeneem namate die MEL-inhoud van die diëte gestyg het. Die gevolgtrekking is gemaak dat MEL spoedig na eerste inname in die melk verskyn en dat ‘n onttrekkingsperiode van 8 d benodig word voordat melk-, mis- en uriene-MEL onwaarneembare vlakke bereik. Uriene en mis is die primêre uitskeidingsroetes van ingenome MEL. Die vierde proef is onderneem om MEL-absorpsie in die melkklier met behulp van arterio-veneuse (A-V) verskille te ondersoek. Vyf koeie het elk 10 g MEL/d vir drie agtereen-volgende dae ontvang. Dag 3 van die proef is gekies vir bloedkolleksies aangesien vorige studies (Cruywagen et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011) gewys het dat melk MEL op dag 3 van MEL inname, piek konsentrasies beryk. Vroeg gedurende die oggend van d 3 is kateters in die kaudale oppervlakkige epigastriese aar (melkaar) en die kaudale aurikulêre slagaar geplaas. Die bloedtrekkingsperiode het ‘n aanvang geneem direk nadat die koeie volledig uitgemelk is na toediening van oksitosien om te verseker dat soveel as moontlik residuele melk verwyder word. Monsters van veneuse-, sowel as arteriële bloed, is 9 -uurliks geneem. Na die finale bloedtrekking is oksitosien weer toegedien, die kateters is versigtig verwyder en die koeie is direk daarna weer gemelk. Al die bloedmonsters is gesentrifugeer en plasmamonsters is ontleed vir MEL, asook vir aminosuursamestelling ten einde bloedtoevoer na die uier te bereken. Die positiewe fluks (bereken van A-V verskil) het bevestig dat netto MEL absorpsie in die melkklier plaasvind, met ‘n doeltreffendheid van 0. 29 %. Melamienuitskeiding in die melk was teen ‘n tempo van 5. 63 mg/h. Die gemiddelde plasma- en melk-MEL konsentrasies was 5. 2 en 3. 9 mg/kg, onderskeidelik. Die uitskeidingsdoeltreffendheid van MEL na melk, uitgedruk as persentasie van ingenome MEL, was 1. 47 %. Die gevolgtrekking is gemaak dat MEL wat deur koeie ingeneem word, tot netto MEL-absorpsie in die melkklier sal lei, maar dat die absorpsiedoeltreffendheid baie laag is. In die finale proef is daar gepoog om die invloed van fermentasieprosesse gedurende die vervaardiging van kaas, joghurt en kefir op die produkte se melamieninhoud na te gaan indien die produkte van melamienbevattende melk gemaak sou word. ‘n Tweede doel van hierdie proef was om te bepaal of MEL in kaas gedegradeer kan word tydens rypwording. Kaas, joghurt en kefir is gemaak van melk wat ‘n MEL-inhoud van 6. 77 mg/kg gehad het. Die kaas is vervolgens vir twee weke by 6 ° C rypgemaak. Die MEL-inhoud van die joghurt en kefir was 6. 76 en 6. 78 mg/kg, onderskeidelik, wat daarop dui dat die onderskeie fermentasieprosesse wat tydens die bereiding van joghurt en kefir plaasvind, geen invloed op hul MEL-inhoud gehad het nie en dat MEL nie gedurende hierdie kort fermentasieperiodes gedegradeer is nie. Die persentasie MEL na wei en kaas versprei was 97. 4 en 6. 5 %, onderskeidelik. Die gevolgtrekking is gemaak dat die verskillende fermentasieprosesse betrokke tydens die vervaardiging van joghurt en kefir wat van melamienbesmette melk gemaak word, nie die MEL-konsentrasie verlaag het nie. Tydens die vervaardiging van kaas, word die MEL hoofsaaklik na die weikomponent versprei en baie min na kaas. Melamien word ook nie in kaas afgebreek gedurende ‘n verouderingsproses van twee weke nie. Die finale gevolgtrekkings is gemaak dat MEL maklik deur melkkoeie geabsorbeer word en dat die hoof uitskeidingsroete via urine is. Die uier het ‘n lae affiniteit vir MEL absorpsie en ongeveer 2 % van ingenome MEL is in die melk uitgeskei. Wanneer kaas van MEL besmette melk gemaak word, sal die meerderheid van die MEL in die weifraksie konsentreer, met slegs 6. 5 % teenwoordig in die kaas.
