This hymn must be the Magna Carta of all ecclesial service; it sums up all the {{reflections on}} love which I have offered throughout this Encyclical Letter. Practical activity will always be insufficient, unless it visibly expresses a love for man, a love nourished by an encounter with Christ. (§34) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 29 January 2008, Tait {{announced}} that he would take an indefinite break from cricket, citing being physically and emotionally exhausted. He stated, [...] "A break from professional cricket will hopefully give me a clear mind and a chance for <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> rest and recover." [...] In March 2008 Tait claimed he was [...] "feeling normal again" [...] and was aiming for a comeback {{at the start of the}} 2008–09 season. The chances of Tait's comeback became even more probable after he was named on the Cricket Australia contract list for the 2008–09 season. Tait had planned to prepare for his return to Australian cricket by playing Domestic Twenty20 cricket in England in the 2008 season.|$|E

She had her nose thinned while still at college; her next procedure, an eye lift, was performed in 1965 (when {{she was in her}} thirties) as an attempt to further her career. When promoting her book, Men Are Stupid ... And They Like Big Boobs: A Woman's Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery, described by The New York Times Magazine as [...] "a detailed and mostly serious guide to eye lifts, tummy tucks and other forms of plastic surgery", she quipped: [...] "I've had so much plastic surgery, when I die they will donate <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> Tupperware." ...|$|E

The Russian cleared her opening height of 4.60m at the championships in Doha, but she faltered at 4.75m and she ended up in fourth place {{and outside of the}} medals for a second consecutive time. Following another disappointment at a major championships, she decided to take time out from the sport to recuperate, saying: [...] "A break from competing is absolutely necessary for me. After more than eight years of very hard training and competing at the highest levels both indoors and outdoors each year I need to step back in order for <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> properly recover".|$|E
2500|$|The Manchester {{performance}} was widely bootlegged (and mistakenly {{placed at the}} Royal Albert Hall). The recording of this gig {{became one of the}} most famous of Dylan's career. In a 1971 review for Creem magazine, critic Dave Marsh wrote, [...] "My response is that crystallization of everything that is rock'n'roll music, at its finest, was to allow my jaw to drop, <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> move, to leap out of the chair ... It is an experience that one desires simply to share, to play over and over again for those he knows thirst for such pleasure. If I speak in an almost worshipful sense about this music, it is not because I have lost perspective, it is precisely because I have found it, within music, yes, that was made five years ago. But it is there and unignorable." [...] When it finally saw [...] in 1998, critic Richie Unterberger declared the record [...] "an important document of rock history." ...|$|E
2500|$|A third {{recurring}} {{image is}} that of the lion. This is introduced by Rutland in Act 1, Scene 3; [...] "So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch" [...] (l.174). Later, Richard, speaking of York, says [...] "Methought he bore him in the thickest troop/As doth a lion in a herd of neat" [...] (2.1.13–14). As Clifford chastises Henry for disinheriting Prince Edward, he asks [...] "To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?/Not to the beast that would usurp the den" [...] (2.2.11–12). Lions are then mentioned in conjunction with lambs during the Battle of Tewkesbury; [...] "While lions roar and battle for their dens/Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity" [...] (2.5.74–75). Lions and lambs are again combined when, just before his second capture, Henry is wondering why the people prefer Edward to him; [...] "And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,/The lamb will never cease to follow him" [...] (4.8.49–50). Warwick later combines lions and birds during his death speech, [...] "I must yield <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> the earth/And by my fall, the conquest to my foe./Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,/Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,/Under whose shade the ramping lion slept" [...] (5.2.9–13).|$|E

2500|$|Edward Abbey died on March 14, 1989, {{at the age}} of 62, in {{his home}} in Tucson, Arizona. His death was due to {{complications}} from surgery; he suffered four days of esophageal hemorrhaging, due to esophageal varices, which is a recurrent problem with one group of veins. Showing his sense of humor, he left a message for anyone who asked about his final words: [...] "No comment." [...] Abbey also left instructions on what to do with his remains: Abbey wanted his body transported in the bed of a pickup truck, and wished to be buried as soon as possible. He {{did not want to be}} embalmed or placed in a coffin. Instead, he preferred to be placed inside of an old sleeping bag, and requested that his friends disregard all state laws concerning burial. [...] "I want <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> help fertilize the growth of a cactus or cliff rose or sagebrush or tree." [...] said the message. For his funeral, Abbey stated [...] "No formal speeches desired, though the deceased will not interfere if someone feels the urge. But keep it all simple and brief." [...] He requested gunfire and bagpipe music, a cheerful and raucous wake, [...] "nd a flood of beer and booze! Lots of singing, dancing, talking, hollering, laughing, and lovemaking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under Zhu Tao's {{subsequent}} suggestion—that {{going to}} Chang'an himself will show great faithfulness to the emperor—Zhu Ci himself offered {{to command the}} Lulong troops in fall defense in 774. [...] Emperor Daizong agreed, and further built a large mansion for Zhu Ci in anticipation of his arrival. [...] In fall 774, Zhu Ci, leaving Zhu Tao in acting command of Lulong, left Lulong and headed for Chang'an. [...] When he got to Wei Prefecture (蔚州, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), he grew ill. [...] His subordinates requested that he return to Lulong and wait until his illness got better. [...] Zhu Ci refused, stating, [...] "Even if I die, continue on and carry <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> Chang'an." [...] The subordinates did not dare to urge him otherwise any further. [...] When he arrived at Chang'an, as {{he was the first}} military governor who had ever visited Chang'an from An Lushan's old territory since the Anshi Rebellion, the officials and people were lined up to welcome him, in such a massive display that it was said that they looked like long walls. [...] Emperor Daizong invited Zhu Ci and his subordinates to a feast at Yanying Hall (延英殿), and it was said that Emperor Daizong gave him unprecedented rewards. [...] For that fall, the fall defense troops were divided into four commands, between Zhu Ci and three other prominent generals, Guo Ziyi, Li Baoyu, and Ma Lin (馬璘).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike much other feminist art, Schneemann's {{revolves}} around sexual expression and liberation, rather than referring to victimization or repression of women. [...] According to artist and lecturer Johannes Birringer, Schneemann's work resists the political correctness enforced by some branches of feminism {{as well as}} ideologies that some feminists claim are misogynist, such as psychoanalysis. [...] He also asserts that Schneemann's work is difficult to classify and analyze as it combines constructivist and painterly concepts with her physical body and energy. [...] In her 1976 book Cézanne, She Was A Great Painter, Schneemann wrote that she used nudity in her artwork to break taboos associated with the kinetic human body and to show that [...] "the life {{of the body is}} more variously expressive than a sex-negative society can admit." [...] She also stated, [...] "In some sense I made a gift of <b>my</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> other women; giving our bodies back to ourselves." [...] According to Kristine Stiles, Scheeman read several written works exploring the body’s relationship with “sexuality, culture, and freedom,” such as The Theater and Its Double by Antonin Araud, The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir, and The Sexual Revolution by Wilhelm Reich. These written works may have influenced her belief that women must represent themselves through writing about their experiences if they wished to gain equality. She preferred her term [...] "art istorical" [...] (without the h), so as to reject the [...] "his" [...] in history.|$|E
