40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{mandatory}} portfolio disclosure of mutual funds on the liquidity of disclosed stocks and on fund performance. We consider a theoretical model of informed trading with different mandatory disclosure frequencies. Using a regulation change in May 2004 that increased the frequency of mandatory disclosure, we find evidence consistent with the model’s predictions. First, stocks with higher fund ownership experience a larger increase in liquidity as compared to other stocks subsequent to the <b>mandatory</b> <b>increase</b> in disclosure frequency, especially for stocks disclosed by more informed funds or subject to greater information asymmetry. Second, better performing funds experience a greater drop in their abnormal performance following the regulation change, particularly when they hold stocks with greater information asymmetry or when they take longer to complete their trades. Taken together, our evidence suggests that mandatory portfolio disclosure improves market quality by increasing stock liquidity but imposes costs on informed investors...|$|E

Enactment of the Earning or Learning education reform of 2006, with a <b>mandatory</b> <b>increase</b> in minimum school leaving age, is used to identify a causal impact of schooling on male youth crime. The richness of the matched (across agency) individual level panel data enables the analysis to shed significant light {{on the extent to}} which the causal impact reflects incapacitation, or whether more schooling acts to reduce crime after youths have left compulsory schooling. The empirical analysis uncovers a significant incapacitation effect, as remaining in school for longer reduces crime whilst in school, but also a sizeable crime reducing impact of education for young men in their late teens and early twenties. We also carry out analysis by major crime type and differentiate between single and multiple offending behaviour. Crime reduction effects are concentrated in property crime and single crime incidence, rather than altering the behaviour of the recalcitrant persistent offende...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{addressed the}} current state of orthotic and prosthetic education. The purpose of the project was to assess the need for increased standards of education within the field of orthotics and prosthetics. Surveys were sent to resident and certified orthotists and prosthetist in the Unite States and Puerto Rico. Results showed certified practitioners were more likely to support a <b>mandatory</b> <b>increase</b> in education for new graduates if they themselves had advanced degrees; however, practitioners with increased years of experience were less likely to support this requirement for new graduates. Hiring authorities valued advanced education in their applicant pool and the results indicate a willingness to pay a premium for that increased education. Residents perceived they were inadequately prepared and desired greater education prior to residency. These findings support the development of higher levels of educational programming, and the passage of statutes that would require such education prior to obtaining a license. This suggests that if orthotists and prosthetists are licensed, states would have in place the regulatory authority to enforce the standard of clinical and administrative practice necessary to protect this patient population...|$|E

40|$|Passive millimeter-wave (PMMW) imaging is a {{technique}} that allows the detection of inherent millimeter-wave radiation emitted by bodies. Since different bodies with varying properties emit unequal power intensities, a contrast can be established to detect their presence. The advantage of this imaging scheme over other techniques, such as optical and infrared imaging, {{is its ability to}} operate under all weather conditions. This is because the relatively long wavelengths of millimeter-waves, as compared to visible light, penetrate through clouds, fog, and sandstorms. The core of a PMMW camera is an antenna, which receives the electromagnetic radiation from a scene. Because PMMW systems require high gains to operate, large antenna arrays are typically employed. This <b>mandatory</b> <b>increase</b> of antenna elements is associated with a large feeding network. Therefore, PMMW cameras usually have a big profile. In this work, two enabling technologies, namely, Substrate integrated Waveguide (SIW) and Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC), are coupled with an innovative design to miniaturize the passive front-end. The two technologies synergize very well with the shielded characteristics of SIW and the high density multilayer integration of LTCC. The proposed design involves a novel multilayer power divider, which is incorporated in a folded feed network structure by moving between layers. The end result is an efficient feeding network, which footprint is least affected by an increase in array size. This is because the addition of more elements is accommodated by a vertical expansion rather than a lateral one. To characterize the feed network, an antenna array has been designed and integrated through efficient transitions. The complete structure has been simulated and fabricated. The results demonstrate an excellent performance, manifesting in a gain of 20 dBi and a bandwidth of more than 11. 4 % at 35 GHz. These values satisfy the general requirements of a PMMW system...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the most}} basic {{questions}} about the organization and functioning of society involve issues raised by the existence of public goods. With respect to environmental public goods, how should funds used to support environmental improvement be collected and used? In particular, are collective, mandatory payments superior to voluntary, charitable payments due to the possibility of free riding? And to what degree should the government be involved in spending these funds: should the government directly fund environmental improvement projects or should the private sector be used to collect funds and determine funding priorities? This report explores these questions from the perspective of renewable energy: wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, and solar. In particular, this report analyzes the payment preferences of U. S. households through the implementation of a large-scale contingent valuation (CV) survey of willingness to pay (WTP) for renewable energy. Renewable energy can be supported through a mandatory ''tax'' on electric bills or through voluntary payments via green power marketing; the government {{may or may not be}} heavily involved in the collection and expenditure of such funds. The question of how households prefer to pay for renewable energy is therefore highly relevant. The primary objective of this study is to explore variations in stated WTP for renewable energy under the following four payment and provision contexts: (1) A <b>mandatory</b> <b>increase</b> in the electricity bills of all customers, the funds from which are collected and spent by the government on renewable energy projects. (2) A voluntary increase in the electricity bills of those customers who choose to pay, the funds from which are collected and spent by the government on renewable energy projects. (3) A voluntary increase in the electricity bills of those customers who choose to pay, the funds from which are collected and spent by electricity suppliers on renewable energy projects. (4) A <b>mandatory</b> <b>increase</b> in the electricity bills of all customers, the funds from which are collected and spent by electricity suppliers on renewable energy projects. These payment and provision scenarios are consistent with contemporary forms of support for renewable energy. The first scenario [...] mandatory payments and government provision [...] is consistent with a system-benefits charge policy, a policy that has been adopted in 15 U. S. states. The third scenario [...] voluntary payments to an electricity supplier [...] is consistent with competitive green power marketing. The fourth scenario [...] mandatory payments through electricity suppliers [...] is consistent with a renewables portfolio standard, a policy adopted in thirteen U. S. states as of mid 2003. The second scenario [...] voluntary payments and government provision [...] has only been used in a limited fashion in the United States. In addition to having contemporary policy relevance, these four contingent valuation scenarios allow one to distinguish differences in stated WTP based on: (1) the payment method [...] is WTP affected by whether payments are to be made collectively or voluntarily? and (2) the provision arrangement [...] does the manner in which a good is provided, in this case through the government or the private sector, affect stated WTP? A split-sample, dichotomous choice contingent valuation survey of 1, 574 U. S. residents was developed and implemented to test the sensitivity of stated WTP to these variables at three different payment levels, or bid points. Three secondary objectives also influenced research design, and are discussed in this report. First, this study indirectly and tentatively evaluates the importance of ''participation expectations'' in contingent valuation surveys: specifically, are individuals who state a WTP for renewable energy more likely to think that others will also contribute? Such relationships are commonly discussed in the sociology, social psychology, and marketing literatures, and are also frequently referenced in the collective action literature, but have yet to be tested thoroughly in a contingent valuation context. Second, this report assesses the effects of socioeconomic, demographic, and attitudinal variables on willingness to pay for renewable energy through regression analysis. This analysis helps test the construct validity of the contingent valuation method, and informs our understanding of who is and is not willing to pay for renewable energy under different payment and provision contexts. Finally, through the implementation of a concurrent opinion survey with 202 respondents, this study compares the results of the CV surveys to a more direct approach of eliciting individuals' payment preferences. Responses to the opinion survey also allow a deeper exploration of other issues related to payment preferences...|$|E
30|$|Changes in {{educational}} participation influence {{the size of}} the youth labour market and, therefore, youth unemployment rates. Thus, voluntary or <b>mandatory</b> <b>increases</b> {{in educational}} participation could potentially increase the youth unemployment rate without any {{increase in the number of}} young people seeking work. On the other hand, increased educational participation might have no effect on the youth unemployment rate. This is because many students, particularly part-timers, actively participate in the labour market. In addition, the youth unemployment rate does not capture those young people who neither participate in the labour market, nor in education. The so-called NEETs (young people not in education, employment or training) are drawn from both the unemployed and the inactive youth.|$|R

40|$|Since a {{substantial}} increase in lawsuits, settlements, jury trial awards, and insurance premiums involving nursing facilities began in the mid 1990 s, addressing litigation has been a growing concern for the industry, consumers and their families, insurance carriers, and state and national elected officials.

40|$|The 2008 U. S. {{financial}} crisis {{raised questions about}} the quality of derivative disclosure by banks. I investigate banks that sell credit derivatives and the impact of recent disclosure mandated for these banks. Using measures of information asymmetry, I find banks that sell credit derivatives are more opaque than those that do not. Furthermore, difference-in-difference tests indicate improved bank transparency following <b>mandatory</b> <b>increases</b> in credit derivative seller disclosure. Because credit derivative sellers act as market makers in the credit default swap (CDS) market, I extend my analysis to investigate the effect of disclosure on liquidity in the CDS market. Results from these tests are consistent with a decrease in CDS market liquidity following mandatory disclosure. This finding comports with recent analytical studies of markets where liquidity providers have an information advantage. In these markets, information asymmetry spurs competition among market makers which, in turn, drives market liquidity. Taken together, my results suggest that mandated disclosure for sellers of credit derivatives provided transparency for investors in the equity market at the cost of decreased liquidity in the CDS market...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{criminal}} deterrence {{in the presence}} of specific psychic costs of punishments. We consider a dynamic model with three players, analyzing the choices of a representative lawmaker, potential criminal and judge. In our setting the lawmaker decides whether to introduce a fixed punishment enhancement above a chosen threshold of crime level, depending on its popularity among the voters. In reaction, the judge, who is influenced by her own preferences as well as the opinion of her peer group, might change the probability of punishment, through affecting the standard of reasonable doubt. Our results suggest that large discontinuous and <b>mandatory</b> <b>increases</b> in punishment can have unintended effects that are contrary to the stated goal of such punishment enhancements. In equilibrium, when either the judge or her peer group is "anti-punishment" enough, the level of criminal activity might increase in response to the punishment enhancement. This perverse effect is less likely to occur if there is a higher number of peer groups within the "elite", so that a greater extent of self-selection by judges can occur. Our results have relevance for a number of areas outside the traditional criminal justice system as well, such as special courts (such as ecclesiastical or military courts), or the strictness and enforcement of regulations...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether a literature-based guideline, powered by educational meetings and individual feedback, improves manual hyperinflation (MH) performance by intensive care unit (ICU) nurses. Background: MH is frequently applied in intubated and mechanically ventilated ICU patients. MH is a complex intervention, and large variation in its performance has been found. Materials and methods: First, a literature-based guideline on MH was developed. The intervention consisted of education of this guideline and individual feedback. Before and 3 months after the intervention, ICU nurses performed MH maneuvers in a skills laboratory. Data collected included applied volumes, peak inspiratory flows (PIF) and peak expiratory flows (PEF), {{and the use of}} inspiratory holds. Results: Eighty nurses participated. Decrease of PIF was not statistically significant. PEF increased from 52 +/- 7 to 83 +/- 23 L/min (P < 0. 01). PIF to PEF ratio decreased from 1. 4 [1. 1 - 1. 7] to 0. 8 [0. 6 - 1. 1] (P < 0. 01). Peak inspiratory pressures decreased from 40 +/- 14 to 19 +/- 6 cm H 2 O (P < 0. 01). The proportion of nurses applying inspiratory holds increased from 14 % to 58 %; use of rapid release of the resuscitation bag, considered <b>mandatory,</b> <b>increased</b> from 4 % to 61 %.
