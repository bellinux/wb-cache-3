Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role [...] "everything that I intended, and <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never dreamed of". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois [...] "tipped me over into madness".|$|E

[...] On 30 June, Del Piero wrote an open letter to the Juventus fans thanking them for almost two decades of support, stating, [...] "Above all what remains is the fans, you who are Juventus. That jersey that I loved and will always love, that I desired and respected... From {{tomorrow}} I will no longer be a Juventus player, but I will always be one of you. Now a new adventure begins and I am as fired up as I was 19 summers ago." ...|$|E

500|$|Beach Thomas's war work led {{to state}} recognition, {{as it did}} for many of the correspondents and {{newspaper}} owners; France appointed him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE award, which he too received: [...] "I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency." [...] This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.|$|E
500|$|The North American {{album cover}} artwork {{originates}} {{from a medical}} journal Cox discovered in a thrift store. A painting in the journal depicts a doctor treating an ill boy, [...] "while his mom looks on, concerned", as described by Cox. In photographing the painting, {{the face of the}} boy was obscured by the flash of the camera. While it [...] "kind of took away from the photo" [...] according to him, the picture became [...] "somehow…romantic, the idea that there was so much emotion in the face that it got whited out." [...] Cox described the boy as being [...] "the saddest boy…lovesick and emaciated", adding, [...] "I related to that boy so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> literally, in the thrift store, almost started crying." [...] The European album artwork was created by v23, a group that designs cover art for label 4AD.|$|E

At {{the suggestion of}} Ono's live-in companion at the time, [...] interior decorator Sam Havadtoy, she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. [...] "I realized that for something to move me so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way - solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change[...] [...] [...] I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified." ...|$|E

500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One sat in my hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E
500|$|The {{last three}} decades of Moore's life {{continued}} in a similar vein; several major retrospectives took place around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition {{in the summer of}} 1972 in the grounds of the Forte di Belvedere overlooking Florence. Following the pioneering documentary 'Henry Moore', produced by John Read in 1951, he appeared in many films. In 1964, for instance, Moore was featured in the documentary [...] "5 British Sculptors (Work and Talk)" [...] by American filmmaker Warren Forma. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work. The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed Knife Edge Two Piece in 1962 for College Green near the Houses of Parliament in London. According to Moore, [...] "When I was offered the site near the House of Lords... I liked the place so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't bother to go and see an alternative site in Hyde Park—one lonely sculpture can be lost in a large park. The House of Lords site is quite different. It is next to a path where people walk and it has a few seats where they can sit and contemplate it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} John Barry, William Arnold was {{banished from}} Hingham {{for reasons that}} were not religious, {{but he does not}} give the actual reason, nor does he cite any sources. [...] Years later, Arnold's son Benedict recorded in the family record: [...] "Memm. [...] We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636. [...] per me Bennedict Arnold." [...] He was using the name Providence loosely, since Providence Plantation had not yet been founded. The Arnolds initially settled with Roger Williams at Seekonk near the western edge of Plymouth Colony where Rehoboth is today. [...] William Arnold stated in 1659: [...] "for as <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was one that the very first day entred [...] with some others upon the land of providence, and so laid out my money to buy and helpe pay for it". [...] The settlers could not remain in Seekonk because, if they did, Plymouth would be harangued by Massachusetts for harboring its fugitives. [...] Plymouth governor Edward Winslow gently urged Williams to move with his fellow settlers across the Seekonk River into the lands of the Narragansetts. [...] Most historians agree that it was about June 1636 when the small group of settlers moved across the river and settled {{on the bank of the}} Moshassuck River at a place which Williams named Providence Plantation.|$|E

500|$|In his 1908 autobiography, Barrington repeats a {{line from}} a first night review of his {{performance}} as Dr Daly in The Sorcerer: [...] "Mr Barrington is wonderful. [...] He always manages to sing one-sixteenth of a tone flat; it's so like a vicar." [...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E

Codd refused and hung up. When Seedman called back {{he was told that}} Codd was out to lunch. That failure to support officers in the field had been the real reason for his retirement.

[...] The stock of 1,250 copies was oversubscribed, and Darwin, still at Ilkley spa town, began corrections for a second edition. The novelist Charles Kingsley, a Christian socialist country rector, sent him a letter of praise: [...] "It awes me...if you be right I must give up <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have believed", it was [...] "just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which he himself had made."
