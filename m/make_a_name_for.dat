5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little {{to protect him from}} players wanting to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while he was lying on the ice.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People's Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager Lilian Baylis. Hordern enjoyed his time there, despite the tiresome commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 {{he had left his}} sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved into a small flat at Marble Arch and became one of the many jobbing actors eager to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> themselves on the London stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} offered Jovanović {{the opportunity}} to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> himself as a serious history painter, given that {{the subject of the}} work was an event of international significance and the painting was to be displayed in a foreign capital. To ensure Migration of the Serbs was historically accurate, Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons, costumes and other objects, later incorporating them into the composition. He also studied medieval histories, collected ethnographical evidence and consulted historians. Notably, the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest Ilarion Ruvarac to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of Fruška Gora, where the young artist examined a number of contemporary sources and objects from the time.|$|E

5|$|The son of {{a leading}} Australian rules footballer of {{the early twentieth century}} who had also played cricket against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club in 1921, Nash was a star sportsman as a boy. Following the family's {{relocation}} from Victoria to Tasmania, he began to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> himself as both a footballer and a cricketer, and became both one of the earliest professional club cricketers in Australia {{and one of the first}} fully professional Australian rules footballers. Nash made his Test cricket debut in 1932, against South Africa and his Victorian Football League (VFL) debut in 1933.|$|E
5|$|These dismal {{business}} efforts—and his misadventures in Sardinia—provided {{an appropriate}} milieu {{in which to}} set the two-volume Illusions perdues (Lost Illusions, 1843). The novel concerns Lucien de Rubempré, a young poet trying to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> himself, who becomes trapped in the morass of society's darkest contradictions. Lucien's journalistic work is informed by Balzac's own failed ventures in the field. Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes (The Harlot High and Low, 1847) continues Lucien's story. He is trapped by the Abbé Herrera (Vautrin) in a convoluted and disastrous plan to regain social status. The book undergoes a massive temporal rift; the first part (of four) covers a span of six years, while the final two sections focus on just three days.|$|E
5|$|Paris {{was in its}} artistic prime in the 19th {{century and}} early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists {{established}} {{in the city and}} in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. The French Revolution and political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the capital. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Gericault. Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris. In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> themselves. Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Montmartre, painted his famous La Famille de Saltimbanques and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon between 1905 and 1907. Montmartre and Montparnasse became centres for artistic production.|$|E

5|$|The two scientists' {{attention}} {{turned to}} the Dakota Territory in the mid-1870s, where the discovery of gold in the Black Hills increased Native American tensions with the United States. Marsh, desiring the fossils found in that region, became embroiled in Army-Indian politics. In order to gain the support of Chief Red Cloud of the Sioux to prospect, Marsh promised Red Cloud payment for fossils collected {{and that he would}} return to Washington, D.C. and lobby on their behalf about their improper treatment. In the end, Marsh slipped out of camp and according to his own (possibly romanticized) accounts, amassed cartloads of fossils and retreated just before a hostile Miniconjou party arrived. Marsh, for his part, did lobby the Interior Department and President Ulysses S. Grant on behalf of Red Cloud, but his motives might have been to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> himself against the unpopular Grant administration. By 1875, both Cope and Marsh paused in their collecting, feeling financial strain and needing to catalogue their backlogged finds, but new discoveries would return them to the West before decade's end.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{was born}} in Leeds and, from an early age, wished to play cricket for Yorkshire. After {{establishing}} a good reputation in local cricket, he signed a contract as a professional cricketer playing in the Lancashire League. His first season was not a success but, after moving clubs, he began to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> <b>for</b> himself. Initially a medium-paced bowler, he switched to bowling spin {{in an attempt to}} secure a place in the Yorkshire team. When Wilfred Rhodes, the incumbent Yorkshire left-arm spinner, announced his retirement, Verity had a successful trial in the team in 1930, and led the national bowling averages. In 1931, his first full season, he achieved the rare feat of taking all 10 wickets in an innings, against Warwickshire County Cricket Club; the following year, he again took all 10 wickets, against Nottinghamshire, while conceding just 10 runs. The latter bowling figures remain a record in first-class cricket for the fewest runs conceded while taking all 10 wickets. He established himself as part of a strong bowling unit, which assisted Yorkshire to the County Championship seven times in his ten seasons with the club. In that time, Verity was never lower than fifth in the bowling averages and took over 150wickets in every year except his first.|$|E

There is often disagreement about the riding routes between Grimur (Kjartan Ragnarsson) and Egill (Helgi Björnsson); Grimur generally prefers the classic routes on horseback, whereas Egill prefers riding through rough terrain on his tractor. Jóhanna (Sigríður María Egilsdóttir), on the other hand, has nothing to say concerning her mare Raudka. One day, she encounters an injured old man.
