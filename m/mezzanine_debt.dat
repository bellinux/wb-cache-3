40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} use of public <b>debt</b> <b>mezzanine</b> instruments, which include {{participating}} bonds, subordinated bonds, convertible bonds and bonds with warrants, by non-financial corporations and financial corporations in the Czech Republic. It aims to analyse and evaluate use of mezzanine financing instruments {{in the form of}} public <b>debt</b> <b>mezzanine</b> by selected economic entities in the Czech Republic in 2006 – 2012, and identify factors affecting the scope of their utilization. The performed research implies that public <b>debt</b> <b>mezzanine</b> instruments are used in the Czech Republic marginally only. Within the monitored period, these instruments were issued in the total volume of CZK 13. 43 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 49 bn), where subordinated bonds got a share of CZK 13. 26 bn (i. e. about EUR 0. 48 bn). The share of newly issued public <b>debt</b> <b>mezzanine</b> instruments in the total financial sources of non-financial corporations and financial corporations within the monitored period was on the top in 2009, when it amounted to 0. 08 %. Wider utilization of public <b>debt</b> <b>mezzanine</b> instruments is particularly prevented by the fact that potential issuers are afraid of high costs relating to the process of issuance, but also to the life cycle of such an issue, and they are also afraid of lack of interest of investors (in the case of subordinated bonds and participating bonds), the owners’ fear of extension of control (in the case of convertible bonds and bonds with warrants), or {{the fact that it is}} difficult to estimate the cost of capital (in the case of participating bonds) ...|$|R

40|$|Investments such as venture capital, buyouts, {{distressed debt}} or assimilated, have the {{peculiarity}} of being difficult to value {{due to their}} illiquid nature on the market. The lack of transparency {{is determined by the}} market value being either determined infrequently or estimated through an "appraisal" process. Both methods of evaluation lead to the "smoothing" of returns, implying that the reported performance metrics are biased: in particular, the estimated volatility is lower than the true volatility of the investment. We propose and test two multi-index methods to evaluate performance of <b>mezzanine,</b> distressed <b>debt</b> and hedge funds, aiming at overcoming the existing gaps in the current traditional portfolio analysis. The proposed models are able to capture non-linear market effects - asset class exposure and style factor model - with the advantage of remaining in the simple framework of the linear regression analysis. We discuss the results obtained and compare them with the outcomes of a traditional regression analysis. The paper is organized as follows: section 1 provides additional arguments to support the current methodology; section 2 presents the two types of methods used in the analysis and introduces the extensions to these models to incorporate market-lagged effects; section 3 describes the data used for the analysis, namely series of returns for three funds: <b>mezzanine,</b> distressed <b>debt,</b> and hedge fund; section 4 provides interpretation and comparisons of the results obtained when using different specifications of the first method based on the asset class exposure models whereas section 5 discusses the results obtained from different specifications of the style factor model. Finally, section 6 summarizes the main achievements. ...|$|R
2500|$|Mezzanine capital {{refers to}} subordinated debt or {{preferred}} equity securities that often represent the most junior {{portion of a}} company's capital structure that is senior to the company's common equity. [...] This form of financing is often used by private equity investors {{to reduce the amount}} of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion. [...] Mezzanine capital, which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market, allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional lenders are willing to provide through bank loans. [...] In compensation for the increased risk, <b>mezzanine</b> <b>debt</b> holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders.

40|$|Abstract: Present {{days the}} firms {{have to face}} the {{increasing}} competition, difficult economic conditions and an increasing need for major investments. In these circumstances, even the well managed and highly profitable businesses have limited options for financing growth or strengthening their equity resources. In these conditions, alternative forms of financing such as mezzanine finance {{are becoming more and more}} a supplement to the traditional forms of corporate financing. Mezzanine is a type of financing that combines elements of debt and equity financing, a hybrid construct that makes use of various longstanding instruments. The most important mezzanine financing instruments include: subordinated loans, participating loans, profit participation rights, convertible bonds and bonds with warrants. A common feature of the various instruments is that they can be structured flexibly in many different forms in order to provide solutions for the specific financing requirements of private and listed companies.
