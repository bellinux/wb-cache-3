25|$|Near Spotsylvania Court House, {{fighting}} {{occurred on}} and off from May 8 through May 21, as Grant tried various schemes to break the Confederate line. On May 8, Union Maj. Gens. Gouverneur K. Warren and John Sedgwick unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge the Confederates under Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson from Laurel Hill, a position that was blocking them from Spotsylvania Court House. On May 10, Grant ordered attacks across the Confederate line of earthworks, which by now extended over 4 miles (6.5km), including a prominent salient known as the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> Although the Union troops failed again at Laurel Hill, an innovative assault attempt by Col. Emory Upton against the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> showed promise.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mules</b> are <b>shoes</b> that slide {{onto the}} foot, {{and do not}} cover the heel or {{the back of the}} foot at all. These aren't {{considered}} dress shoes unless they have a heel.|$|R
60|$|Leaving {{the direct}} line, he wound {{in and out}} through narrow streets, the <b>mule's</b> <b>shoes</b> clanging on the hot stones. He passed one or two dimly lighted cafés where men, roused by the clatter, looked up, their figures showing indistinct about the small tables between the pillars. Farther on, shadowy groups were sitting close {{together}} on the pavement, and though their voices were quiet they had somehow an air of excitement. Men appeared and vanished in the gloom, moving softly and quickly, as if afraid of loitering. There was a mysterious hint of tension about all that Walthew saw, and he felt his heart beat as he rode on.|$|R
25|$|While Hancock {{was in the}} Po sector, Warren {{requested}} {{permission from}} Meade to attack Laurel Hill at 4 p.m., uncoordinated {{with the rest of}} Grant's attack. Again the Laurel Hill line repulsed the Union troops with heavy losses. Grant was forced to postpone his 5 p.m. coordinated assault until Warren could get his troops reformed. Not informed of the delay, Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott of the II Corps moved his division forward at 5 p.m. toward the tip of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> When his men reached the open field, Confederate artillery ripped them to shreds, and they retreated. At around 6 p.m., Col. Emory Upton led a group of 12 hand-picked regiments, about 5,000 men in four battle lines, against an identified weak point {{on the west side of}} the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> The plan was for Upton's men to rush across the open field without pausing to fire and reload, reaching the earthworks before the Confederates could fire more than a couple of shots. The plan worked well initially, but Generals Lee and Ewell were quick to organize a vigorous counterattack with brigades from all sectors of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> No Union supporting units arrived. Upton's men were driven out of the Confederate works, and he reluctantly ordered them to retreat.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the afternoon, Confederate {{engineers}} {{scrambled to}} create a new defensive line 500 yards further south {{at the base of the}} <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> while fighting at the Bloody Angle continued day and night with neither side achieving an advantage. At 4 a.m. on May 13, the exhausted Confederate infantrymen were notified that the new line was ready, and they withdrew from the original earthworks unit by unit. The combat they had endured for almost 24 hours was characterized by an intensity of firepower never previously seen in Civil War battles, as the entire landscape was flattened, all the foliage destroyed. May 12 was the most intensive day of fighting during the battle, with Union casualties of about 9,000, Confederate 8,000; the Confederate loss includes about 3,000 prisoners captured in the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the Confederate side, Lee {{received}} some intelligence reports {{that made him}} believe Grant was planning to withdraw toward Fredericksburg. If this came to pass, he wanted to follow up with an immediate attack. Concerned about the mobility of his artillery to support the potential attack, he ordered that the guns be withdrawn from Allegheny Johnson's division in the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> {{to be ready for}} a movement to the right. He was completely unaware, of course, that this was exactly the place Grant intended to attack.|$|E
50|$|On February 26, he ambushed an American convoy between San Juan and Bacnotan, {{together}} with their supplies of food, medicine, <b>shoes,</b> <b>mules,</b> etc.|$|R
25|$|Accessories {{for women}} in the 1980s were mostly late 1970s carryovers. This {{included}} thin belts, knee-high boots with thick kitten heels, sneakers, jelly shoes (a new trend at the time), <b>mules,</b> round-toed <b>shoes</b> and boots, jelly bracelets (inspired by Madonna in 1983), shoes with thick heels, small, thin necklaces (with a variety of materials, such as gold and pearls), and small watches.|$|R
25|$|The weather finally cleared on May 17. Grant made an {{assumption}} {{that led him to}} his next attack plan: since Lee had observed Grant's buildup along the Fredericksburg Road, it was likely that he had countered the Union moves by shifting his forces away from the former <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> positions. He ordered the II Corps and the VI Corps to attack there at sunrise, May 18. They retraced their steps to the vicinity of the Landrum house the night of May 17. Hancock's II Corps would make the primary assault with support from Wright on their right and Burnside on their left.|$|E
25|$|Hancock's assault {{started at}} 4:35a.m. on May 12 and easily crashed through the Confederate works. Despite the initial success at obliterating {{much of the}} <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> salient, there was a flaw in the Union plan—no one had {{considered}} how {{to capitalize on the}} breakthrough. The 15,000 infantrymen of Hancock's II Corps had crowded into a narrow front about a half mile wide and soon lost all unit cohesion, becoming little more than an armed mob. Following the initial shock, the Confederate leadership at all levels began to react well to the Union onslaught and reinforcements were rushed in to stem the tide.|$|E
25|$|Hancock's {{men began}} {{assembling}} near the Brown farm that evening, about 1200 yards {{north of the}} <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> in a torrential rainstorm. The men and junior officers were poorly prepared for the assault, lacking basic information {{about the nature of}} the ground to be covered, the obstacles to expect, or how the Confederate line was configured. Confederates could hear their preparations through the storm, but could not decide whether an attack was imminent or the Union Army was preparing to withdraw. Allegheny Johnson became suspicious and requested to Ewell that his artillery be returned. Ewell agreed, but somehow the order did not reach the artillery units until 3:30a.m. on May 12, 30 minutes before Hancock's assault was planned to start.|$|E
25|$|Despite his reverses on May 10, Grant {{had reason}} for {{optimism}} {{because of the}} partial success of Upton's innovative assault. He planned {{to use the same}} tactics with Hancock's entire corps. On the Confederate side, Lee received some intelligence reports that made him believe Grant was planning to withdraw toward Fredericksburg. If this happened, he wanted to follow up with an immediate attack. Concerned about the mobility of his artillery to support the potential attack, he ordered that the guns be withdrawn from Allegheny Johnson's division in the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> to be ready for a movement to the right. He was completely unaware, of course, that this was exactly the place Grant intended to attack. Johnson requested to Ewell that his artillery be returned, but somehow the order did not reach the artillery units until 3:30a.m. on May 12, 30 minutes before Hancock's assault was planned to start.|$|E
25|$|Ambrose Burnside {{was also}} part of the grand assault, {{advancing}} against the eastern leg of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> before dawn. The attack by his division under Brig. Gen. Robert B. Potter against the sector just below Steuart's Brigade materially aided Hancock's breakthrough. The North Carolina brigade of Brig. Gen. James H. Lane fought back, reinforced by a Georgia brigade under Brig. Gen. Edward L. Thomas and the North Carolina brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales. The two sides became stalemated. At 2 p.m., Grant and Lee coincidentally ordered simultaneous attacks. Grant considered this sector to be lightly defended and hoped for a new breakthrough while Lee wanted to take out an artillery position that the IX Corps was using to harass his line. The advance by Union Brig. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox's division against a minor salient in the line was stopped as Lane's brigade moved forward and hit them in the flank.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} part of the Battle of Spotsylvania, the 1st Brigade {{occupied}} the extreme right of the Union line. After being detached for a brief reconnaissance to Todd’s Tavern, the 140th rejoined the brigade in its slide to the east, closer to the left end of the Union line. There, early on the morning of May 12 they took part in the massive assault on the part of the Confederate line known as the “Mule Shoe.” The men had to pick their way through trees felled to form an abatis before making their way up to the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> where they managed to dislodge the Rebels from their first line, but were unable to proceed further, having to settle into the works just captured. On May 15 the 1st Division was ordered to the rear and occupied this position until the 21st, when they joined Grant’s next flank movement to the east toward North Anna River. The movement to and actions at Spotsylvania cost the regiment 41 men killed, 125 officers and men wounded, and 10 men missing, for a total of 176.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{significant}} casualties of May 12, Grant was undeterred. He planned to reorient his lines and shift {{the center of}} potential action {{to the east of}} Spotsylvania, where he could renew the battle. He ordered the V and VI Corps to move behind the II Corps and take positions past the left flank of the IX Corps. On the night of May 13–14, the corps began a difficult march in heavy rain. Grant notified Washington that, having endured five days of almost continuous rain, his army could not resume offensive operations until they had 24 hours of dry weather. The weather finally cleared on May 17. Grant ordered the II Corps and the VI Corps to attack against the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> area again at sunrise, May 18. Unfortunately for the Union plan, the former Confederate works were still occupied by Ewell's Second Corps and they had used the intervening time to improve the earthworks and the obstacles laid out in front of them. Unlike on May 12, they were not caught by surprise. As Hancock's men advanced, they were caught up in abatis and subjected to artillery fire so devastating that infantry rifle fire was not necessary to repulse the attack. Wright and Burnside had no better luck in supporting attacks.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Overland Campaign, the corps started with a {{strength}} of over 22,000 men. The Third corps fought on the Confederate right wing during {{the first day of the}} Battle of the Wilderness, engaged with the II Corps. By the end of the day, Hill's line was jumbled; both Heth and Wilcox requested permission to straighten their lines during the night but Hill refused, believing that Longstreet would arrive before dawn and relieve his corps. On the second day, the Union army attacked at dawn and quickly drove Hill's troops back in confusion. Longstreet's corps arrived near mid-morning and halted the Union attack. Following Longstreet's wounding, Anderson was transferred to command the First Corps, with William Mahone taking command of Anderson's division. During the march to Spotsylvania Court House on May 8th, Hill fell ill and was replaced by Jubal Early from the Second Corps. Early arrived at Spotsylvania near dawn on May 9th and covered the Confederate right wing. The corps held against the attacks of the IX Corps during May 12th but was only able to send two brigades to help with the Confederate counterattacks in the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> salient. On May 21st, Hill reported that he was well enough to resume command of his corps.|$|E
500|$|Hancock {{suffered}} {{from the effects of}} his Gettysburg wound {{for the rest of the}} war. After recuperating in Norristown, he performed recruiting services over the winter and returned in the spring to field command of the II Corps for Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign, but he never regained full mobility and his former youthful energy. Nevertheless, he performed well at the Battle of the Wilderness and commanded a critical breakthrough assault of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> at the [...] "Bloody Angle" [...] in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 12, shattering the Confederate defenders in his front, including the Stonewall Brigade. His corps suffered enormous losses during a futile assault Grant ordered at Cold Harbor.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House (May 8–21, 1864), Steuart {{was himself}} captured, along {{with much of}} his brigade, during the brutal {{fighting}} for the [...] "Mule Shoe" [...] salient. The <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> salient formed a bulge in the Confederate lines, a strategic portion of vital high ground but one which was vulnerable to attack on three sides. During the night of May 11, Confederate commanders withdrew most of the artillery pieces from the salient, convinced that Grant's next attack would fall elsewhere. Steuart, to his credit, was alert to enemy preparations and {{sent a message to}} Johnson advising him of an imminent enemy attack and requesting the return of the artillery.|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{shortly before}} dawn on May 12, Union forces {{comprising}} three full divisions (Major General Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps) attacked the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> through heavy fog, taking the Confederate forces by surprise. Exhaustion, inadequate food, lack of artillery support, and wet powder from the night's rain {{contributed to the}} collapse of the Confederate position as the Union forces swarmed out of the mist, overwhelming Steuart's men and effectively putting an end to the Virginia Brigade. Confederate muskets would not fire due to damp powder, and apart from two remaining artillery pieces, the Southerners were effectively without firearms. During the thick of the fierce hand-to-hand fighting that followed, Steuart was forced to surrender to Colonel James A. Beaver of the 148th Pennsylvania Infantry. Beaver asked Steuart [...] "Where is your sword, sir?", to which the general replied, with considerable sarcasm, [...] "Well, suh, you all waked us up so early this mawnin' that I didn't have time to get it on." [...] Steuart was brought to General Hancock, who had seen Steuart's wife Maria in Washington before the battle and wished to give her news of her husband. He extended his hand, asking [...] "how are you, Steuart?" [...] But Steuart refused to shake Hancock's hand; although the two men had been friends before the war, they were now enemies. Steuart said: [...] "Considering the circumstance, General, I refuse to take your hand", to which Hancock is said to have replied, [...] "And under any other circumstance, General, I would have refused to offer it." [...] After this episode, an offended Hancock then left Steuart to march to the Union rear with the other prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Grant used Upton's assault {{technique}} on a {{much larger}} scale on May 12 when he ordered the 15,000 men of Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock's corps to assault the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> Hancock was initially successful, but the Confederate leadership rallied and repulsed his incursion. Attacks by Maj. Gen. Horatio Wright on {{the western edge of}} the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> which became known as the [...] "Bloody Angle", involved almost 24 hours of desperate hand-to-hand fighting, some of the most intense of the Civil War. Supporting attacks by Warren and by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside were unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|Hancock's {{assault was}} {{scheduled}} to commence at 4 a.m., {{but it was still}} pitch black and he delayed until 4:35, when the rain stopped and was replaced by a thick mist. The attack crashed through the Confederate works, virtually destroying Jones's Brigade, now commanded by Col. William Witcher. As Barlow's division swung around to the eastern tip of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> it overran the brigade commanded by Brig. Gen. George [...] "Maryland" [...] Steuart, capturing both Steuart and his division commander, Allegheny Johnson. On Barlow's right, Brig. Gen. David B. Birney's division met stronger resistance from the brigades of Col. William Monaghan and Brig. Gen. James A. Walker (the Stonewall Brigade). The recent rain had ruined much of the Confederates' gunpowder, but they fought fiercely hand to hand. The Union troops continued to spread south along {{the western edge of the}} <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> Despite the initial success at obliterating much of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> salient, there was a flaw in the Union plan—no one had considered how to capitalize on the breakthrough.

Supporting attacks by Warren and by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside were unsuccessful. In the end, the battle was tactically inconclusive, but with almost 32,000 casualties on both sides, it was the costliest battle of the campaign. Grant planned to end the stalemate by once again shifting around Lee's right flank to the southeast, toward Richmond.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1864 Overland Campaign, Upton led his brigade in the Wilderness, but his {{greatest}} contribution was at Spotsylvania Court House, where {{he developed a}} new tactic to attack the Confederate breastworks, one that would foreshadow tactics used in the trench warfare of World War I. Upton devised a tactic wherein columns of massed infantry would swiftly assault {{a small part of}} the enemy line, without pausing to trade fire, and in doing so attempt to overwhelm the defenders and achieve a breakthrough. The standard infantry assault employed a wide battle line advancing more slowly, firing at the enemy as it moved forward. On May 10, 1864, Upton led twelve regiments in such an assault against the Confederate's <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> salient. His tactics worked and his command penetrated to the center of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> but they were left unsupported and forced to withdraw in the face of enemy artillery and mounting reinforcements. Upton was wounded but not severely in the attack, but was promoted to brigadier general to rank from May 12. On that same day, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock adapted Upton's columnar assault tactic to the entire II Corps to break through the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> [...] On June 1 Upton's 2nd Brigade was engaged in the Battle of Cold Harbor where his units suffered some heavy losses. [...] In late June 1864 he participated in the early stages of the Siege of Petersburg.|$|E
2500|$|As Hancock bogged down, Grant sent in reinforcements, {{ordering}} both Wright and Warren to move forward. The VI Corps {{division of}} Brig. Gen. Thomas H. Neill {{headed for the}} western leg of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> {{at the point where}} it turned to the south. This sector of the line, where the heaviest fighting of the day would occur, became known as the [...] "Bloody Angle." [...] Heavy rain began to fall, and both sides fought on the earthworks slippery with both water and blood. Warren's attack at Laurel Hill began on a small scale around 8:15a.m. For some of his men, this was their fourth or fifth attack against the same objective and few fought with enthusiasm. They were repulsed again. Burnside advanced against the eastern leg of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> before dawn, materially aiding Hancock's breakthrough. At 2 p.m., Grant and Lee coincidentally ordered simultaneous attacks in this stalemated sector. The advance by Union Brig. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox's division was stopped as Brig. Gen. James H. Lane's brigade moved forward and hit them in the flank.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the afternoon, Confederate {{engineers}} {{scrambled to}} create a new defensive line 500 yards further south {{at the base of the}} <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> while fighting at the Bloody Angle continued day and night with neither side achieving an advantage, until around 12:00 AM on May 13, the fighting finally stopped. At 4 A.M., the exhausted Confederate infantrymen were notified that the new line was ready and they withdrew from the original earthworks unit by unit. The combat they had endured for almost 24 hours was characterized by an intensity of firepower never previously seen in Civil War battles, as the entire landscape was flattened, all the foliage destroyed. An example of this can be found in the Smithsonian Museum of American History: a 22-inch stump of an oak tree at the Bloody Angle that was completely severed by rifle fire. There was a frenzy to the carnage on both sides. Fighting back and forth over the same corpse-strewn trenches for hours on end, using single shot muskets, the contending troops were periodically reduced to hand-to-hand combat reminiscent of battles fought during ancient times. Bodies piled up four and five high, and soldiers were forced to pause from time to time and throw corpses over the parapet since they formed an obstacle in the way of the fighting. Dead and wounded men were shot so many times that many of them simply fell apart into unrecognizable heaps of flesh. Surviving participants attempted to describe in letters, diaries, and memoirs the hellish intensity of that day, many noting that it was beyond words. Or, as one put it: [...] "Nothing can describe the confusion, the savage, blood-curdling yells, the murderous faces, the awful curses, and the grisly horror of the melee." [...] Some men claimed to have fired as many as 400 rounds that day. May 12 was the most intensive day of fighting during the battle, with Union casualties of about 9,000, Confederate 8,000; the Confederate loss includes about 3,000 prisoners captured in the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At around 6 p.m., the VI Corps {{began its}} attack {{with an unusual}} formation. Col. Emory Upton led a group of 12 {{hand-picked}} regiments, about 5,000 men in four battle lines, against an identified weak point {{on the west side}} of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> called Doles's Salient (named after Brig. Gen. George P. Doles's Georgian troops who were manning that sector of the line). The plan was for Upton's men to rush across the open field without pausing to fire and reload, reaching the earthworks before the Confederates could fire more than a couple of shots. Once an initial breakthrough was made by the leading element, the following lines would widen the breach and spread out on each side. Gershom Mott's division was designated to support the breakthrough as well. However, Mott's division (4th Division, II Corps) was the weakest in the army. Once Joe Hooker's command, it had been transferred from the defunct III Corps two months earlier. The morale of the enlisted men suffered from this, and several of its regiments' enlistment terms were about to expire in a few weeks, making the men extremely gun-shy. They had been badly shot up and routed in the Wilderness, and as they headed towards the Confederate entrenchments, a burst of artillery fire caused the men to panic and flee from the field, never getting closer than a quarter of a mile to the enemy position. Three days later, Mott's division was dissolved and Mott himself demoted to command of a brigade comprising most of the remaining troops from the division. Upton's men encountered stiff Confederate resistance, but nonetheless drove all the way to the parapets, where after some brief, fierce hand-to-hand action, their superior numbers carried the day and soon the Confederate defenders were driven from their trenches. However, Generals Lee and Ewell were quick to organize a vigorous counterattack with brigades from all sectors of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe.</b> And no Union supporting units arrived. Mott had already been repulsed, unbeknownst to Upton, and units from Warren's V Corps were too spent from their earlier attacks on Laurel Hill to help. Upton's men were driven out of the Confederate works and he reluctantly ordered them to retreat. British military historian Charles Francis Atkinson wrote in 1908 that Upton's charge was [...] "one of the classic infantry attacks of military history." [...] Grant promoted Upton to brigadier general for his performance.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the initial}} shock, the Confederate {{leadership}} {{at all levels}} began to react well to the Union onslaught. John B. Gordon sent Brig. Gen. Robert D. Johnston's brigade of North Carolinians racing toward the gap where Steuart's men had collapsed. Although Johnston was wounded, his brigade halted the breakthrough in that sector. Gordon then sent forward the brigade of Col. John S. Hoffman and three regiments from Col. Clement A. Evans's brigade. General Lee was at the scene to witness these men moving forward and, similar to his action at the Widow Tapp farm in the Battle of the Wilderness, he attempted {{to move forward with}} the men, only to be stopped by Gordon and chants from the men, [...] "Lee to the rear!" [...] These brigades were able to secure most of the eastern leg of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe</b> after about 30 minutes of fierce fighting. On the western leg, Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes coordinated the defense and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Stephen D. Ramseur suffered heavy casualties as they fought their way to regain the entrenchments lost by the Stonewall Brigade.|$|E
2500|$|Grant sent in {{reinforcements}} {{at about}} 6:30a.m., ordering both Wright and Warren to move forward. The VI Corps division of Brig. Gen. Thomas H. Neill {{headed for the}} western leg of the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> {{at the point where}} it turned to the south. This sector of the line, where the heaviest fighting of the day would occur, became known as the [...] "Bloody Angle." [...] As Union brigade after brigade slammed into the line, William Mahone brought two of his brigades—under Brig. Gens. Abner M. Perrin and Nathaniel H. Harris—hurrying back from the extreme left flank to come to Ramseur's aid. Perrin was killed. By 8 a.m, heavy rain began to fall and both sides fought on the earthworks slippery with both water and blood. The South Carolinians of Brig. Gen. Samuel McGowan's brigade joined the defense at the critical point. At 9:30a.m., the VI Corps division under Brig. Gen. David A. Russell joined the attack. A section of Union artillery was able to advance close to the Confederate lines and cause numerous casualties. But Confederate artillery also had a severe effect on the advance of Russell's men.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his reverses on May 10, Grant {{had reason}} for optimism. The one bright {{spot in the}} day had been the partial success of Emory Upton's {{innovative}} assault. He recognized the failure stemming {{from the lack of}} support and reasoned that using the same tactics with an entire corps might be successful. Grant was then visited by General Wright, the new commander of the VI Corps, who suggested that the May 10 assaults had failed due to poor support, particularly from Mott's division. Wright told General Meade, [...] "General, I don't want Mott's troops on my left; they are not a support. I would rather have no troops there." [...] He assigned Hancock's II Corps to the assault on the <b>Mule</b> <b>Shoe,</b> while Burnside's IX Corps attacked the eastern end of the salient and Warren's V Corps and Wright's VI Corps applied pressure to Laurel Hill. On the morning of May 11, Grant sent a famous message to the Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton: [...] "The result to this time is much in our favor. Our losses have been heavy {{as well as those of}} the enemy. ... I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer." ...|$|E
