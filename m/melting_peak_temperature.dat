30|$|DSC {{studies of}} all the EVA {{copolymers}} and their nanocomposites have been carried out. On loading the nanofillers, there is marginal change in the enthalpy of melting (ΔHm) values with {{no change in the}} <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature.</b> The percentage crystallinity {{of all the}} samples lies in the range 0.3 – 0.4 %, thus confirming that all the nanocomposites are basically amorphous materials. It has been reported earlier that loading of carbon nanotubes reduces the crystallinity of EVA having 27 % VA content (much lower than those used in the present investigation) due to the reduction in the orientation of polymer chains as a result of polymer–filler interaction [30]. However, there is no such indication from the DSC traces for these amorphous polymers, as the ΔHm values are very low.|$|E
40|$|Changes of {{tightly and}} loosely bound water {{relative}} content in bread were studied using {{differential scanning calorimetry}} method. Combination of chitosan with ascorbic acid changes water redistribution between starch and gluten and {{in such a way}} can be related to bread quality and sensory properties. The decrease of the water vaporization temperatures, melting temperatures and enthalpies in fresh bread containing chitosan were detected when ascorbic acid was added in combination with chitosan. The decrease of <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> has been attributed to the increase of interaction of loosely bound water and the decrease of vaporization peak temperature has been attributed to the decrease of interaction of tightly bound water with bread components as a result of ascorbic acid addition.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the crystallization temperature, Tc, the crystal thickness, dc and the <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature,</b> Tm of poly(ε-caprolactone) have been determined by carrying out time- and temperature-dependent small angle x-ray scattering experiments. A two-step melting has been suggested, resulting in the occurrence of two well defined independent boundary lines, indicating the transformation from melt into the partially crystalline state. For crystallization temperatures lower than 40 °C, during heating, more pronounced peak shifts are observed with the final melting of the crystallites having the same thickness of dc ≈ 7 nm. In this region, {{it is evident that}} crystals have relatively good stabilities, since they have fairly uniform thickness. At higher temperatures, above 40 °C, Tm increases with Tc, together with the thickness. The transformation of the melt into the partially crystalline state depicts a two-step process, beginning with the formation of a well defined initial structure with lower order, which is subsequently stabilized.

40|$|In the United States, the {{production}} of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is an important mechanism of carbap-enem resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. Infections with KPC-producing organisms are associated with increased morbid-ity andmortality; therefore, the rapid detection of KPC-producing pathogens is critical in patient care and infection control. We developed a real-time PCR assay complemented with traditional high-resolutionmelting (HRM) analysis, as well as statistically based genotyping, using the Rotor-Gene ScreenClust HRM software to both detect the presence of blaKPC and differentiate be-tween KPC- 2 -like and KPC- 3 -like alleles. A total of 166 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanniiwith various -lactamase susceptibility patterns were tested in the validation of this assay; 66 of these organisms were known to produce the KPC -lactamase. The real-time PCR assay was able to detect the presence of blaKPC in all 66 of these clinical isolates (100 % sensitivity and specificity). HRM analysis demonstrated that 26 had KPC- 2 -like <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures,</b> while 40 had KPC- 3 -like <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Sequencing of 21 amplified products confirmed the <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> results, with 9 isolates carrying blaKPC- 2 and 12 isolates carrying blaKPC- 3. This PCR/HRM assay can identify KPC-produc-ing Gram-negative pathogens in as little as 3 h after isolation of pure colonies and does not require post-PCR sample manipula-tion for HRM analysis, and ScreenClust analysis easily distinguishes blaKPC- 2 -like and blaKPC- 3 -like alleles. Therefore, this assay is a rapid method to identify the presence of blaKPC enzymes in Gram-negative pathogens that can be easily integrated into busy clin-ical microbiology laboratories...|$|R

40|$|The {{crystallization}} {{behavior and}} the melt flow properties of two batches of 1500 series LaRC-TPI polymers have been investigated.

On the other hand, a purely amorphous structure is realized in samples annealed at temperatures above 330 C.

Added hydrocolloids were carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and high methoxyl pectin (HM pectin) at a 3 % level (w/w) and/or the emulsifiers diacetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides (DATEM), lecithin (LC), and monoglycerides (MG) at a 0. 3 % level (w/w). After 4 days of storage, composite breads with MG had comparatively lower crumb moisture while crumb density was similar in all breads. The reference bread crumb firmness was 33. 4 N, which was reduced with an addition of DATEM (23. 0 N), MG (29. 8 N), CMC (24. 6 N) or HM pectin (22. 4 N). However, the CMC/DATEM, CMC/LC, and HM pectin/DATEM combinations further reduced crumb firmness to < 20. 0 N. The <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> was increased from 52 degrees C to between 53. 0 degrees C and 57. 0 degrees C with added hydrocolloids and/or emulsifiers. The melting enthalpy of the retrograded amylopectin was lower in composite bread with hydrocolloids and emulsifiers, 6. 7 - 11. 0 J/g compared to 20. 0 J/g for the reference bread. These results show that emulsifiers in combination with-hydrocolloids can improve the quality and extend the shelf-life of composite cassava-maize-wheat breads...|$|E

The assay identifies enteropathogenic campylobacters to the species level {{on the basis of}} their degree of hybridization to three 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) biprobes. First-round symmetric PCR is performed with genus-specific primers which selectively target and amplify a portion of the 16 S rRNA gene common to all Campylobacter species. Second-round asymmetric PCR is performed in a LightCycler in the presence of one of three biprobes; the identity of an amplified DNA-biprobe duplex is established after determination of the species-specific <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature.</b> The biprobe specificities were determined by testing 37 reference strains of Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Arcobacter spp. and 59 Penner serotype reference strains of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli. From the combination of melting peak profiles for each probe, an identification scheme was devised which accurately detected the five taxa pathogenic for humans (C. jejuni/C. coli, C. lari, C. upsaliensis, C. hyointestinalis, and C. fetus), as well as C. helveticus and C. lanienae. The assay was evaluated with 110 blind-tested field isolates; when the code was broken their previous phenotypic species identification was confirmed in every case. The PCR-biprobe assay also identified campylobacters directly from fecal DNA.

40|$|The role of spherical nano-CaCO 3 {{particles}} {{treated with}} 2 wt% and 6 wt% stearic acid (SA), respectively, on {{the motion of}} macromolecular chains and segments of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) was studied through the dynamic mechanical analysis and nonisothermal crystallization. Higher nucleation activity of the particles and more nucleating sites were achieved in the 6 wt% SA treated particle nanocomposites {{with respect to the}} 2 wt% SA counterpart. The increased nucleation efficiency caused high inhomogeneity and thus large mobility of the amorphous phase of iPP, which favored a low glass transition temperature (Tg) in the nanocomposites. However, the spherical nanoparicles also spatially restrained the motion of macromolecular chains and segments, and the better the nanoparticles dispersed, the stronger the restriction was. Thus the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the nanocomposites decreased with increasing filler loading but recovered at a certain particle concentration. At this filler content, the maximal -transition temperature (T) and the main <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> (Tm 1) as well as the lowest degree of crystallinity (XPP) also occurred. This critical filler loading appeared at lower value (20 wt%) in 6 wt% SA treated nano-CaCO 3 composites with respect to 2 wt% SA counterpart (25 %) due to the better dispersion of particles in the former. It was concluded that the mobility of the macromolecular chains and segments of iPP was dominated by the competition of the spatial confinement and nucleation effect of nano-CaCO 3 particles in the matrix...|$|E

To ascertain that entanglements are the cause for the observed difference, experiments are performed in the presence of reduced graphene oxide (rGON) : the melting response of disentangled UHMWPE crystallized from its heterogeneous melt state remains nearly independent of the annealing time in melt.

40|$|Carrageenans are sulfated marine polysaccharides {{used in a}} {{wide variety}} of food {{applications}} such as bodying, gelling, thickening and emulsion stabilization in water- and milk-based systems. They also find promising pharmaceutical usage due to antiinflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-coagulant activities, to name a few. Among them, kappa-carrageenan is favored owing to its desirable properties such as high gel strength and stability. Though the significance of cations on the structure-function relationships is well-documented, the role of anions is still elusive. This investigation aims at providing the pertinent details, especially in the presence of halide ions such as Cl-, Br- and I-. In this regard, sodium salts as well as sodium kappa-carrageenan have been chosen as the model systems. In addition, the effect of chaotropic salts urea and guanidinium chloride has been studied to understand their influence. ^ Dynamic rheological measurements and melting properties were obtained for 1. 5 % and 2 % w/w solutions in the presence of 0, 50, and 100 mM salts. X-ray diffraction has been carried out on oriented fibers to assess the extent of association among the carrageenan chains towards network formation. The addition of sodium chloride, sodium bromide or guanidinium chloride appears to promote aggregation among the carrageenan chains leading to increased elastic moduli, whereas urea has marginal effect. However, sodium iodide promotes soft gelling solutions as well as well-oriented and crystalline fibers. Furthermore, <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> and associated enthalpies are higher with sodium iodide than with the other salts, suggesting the important role of iodide ions in preventing the carrageenan chain aggregation leading to ordered networks.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{detailed study of}} the simultaneous biaxial stretching of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) films in the partly molten state. Four commercial grades of isotactic PP (PP 1 [...] PP 4) were investigated. The first three resins differed principally in isotacticity levels, which were 94. 8 %, 98. 6 %, and 99. 5 %, and the fourth resin had molecular weight and isotacticity levels {{similar to those of}} PP 2, but differed in crystallization behavior. The four iPP resins were extruded and cast under similar conditions. The severity of the cooling was varied for PP 4. The cast films were stretched on the laboratory film stretcher, that simulates closely the stretching conditions encountered in the industrial tenter-frame stretching process. The morphology of the cast films and the final stretched films was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The reflection technique was used for the X-ray measurements. Finally, the mechanical and optical properties of the films were determined, and the results were correlated with the film morphology and orientation. The effects of drawing temperature, stretching ratio, strain rate, initial morphology, and chain tacticity on deformation behavior, stretched film morphology, and end-film properties were studied, and correlations were sought. Simultaneous equibiaxial stretching was found to be homogeneous for sufficiently high deformation rates (3 &d 2;H > 0. 1 s- 1). The stiffness and the thermal stability of the crystallites {{played an important role in}} deformation behavior. In fact, the biaxial yield stress showed linear dependence on the crystallite size. Upon simultaneous equibiaxial deformation, crystallinity and especially orientation increased, while crystallite size decreased. The isotacticity content was found to influence greatly the thermal stability of the initial morphology. Increasing isotacticity leads to an increase in DSC <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> of the initial morphology, overall stress of deformation, and in the final crystallinity, orientation, elastic modulus, and tensile strength of the end film. Finally, it was concluded that the crystalline phase, that melts during preheating prior to stretching forms a "structured melt" phase. The amount of structured melt is related to the tensile strength at break of the end film. Finally, it was showed that an optimal gloss is obtained, if the cast film is stretched about 15 °C below its melting point...|$|E

The solid dispersions were stored at 4 - 8 and 25 degrees C (25 % RH), then their physicochemical properties were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction and dissolution studies {{as a function of}} storage time. The DSC curves of solid dispersions of UC- 781 with PVP K 30 did not show any <b>melting</b> <b>peaks</b> corresponding to UC- 781 after storage, indicating no recrystallization of the drug. The DSC data obtained from PEG 6000 and Gelucire 44 / 14 showed some variations in <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> and enthalpy of fusion of the carriers. It was shown that the enthalpy of fusion of PEG 6000 in the dispersions increased after storage; it was more pronounced for samples stored at 25 degrees C compared to those at 4 - 8 degrees C indicating the reorganization of the crystalline domains of the polymer. Similarly, the enthalpy of fusion of Gelucire 44 / 14 in the solid dispersions increased as a function of time. Dissolution of UC- 781 from all solid dispersions decreased as a function of storage time. While these observations concurred with the DSC data for all solid dispersions, they were not reflected by X-ray powder diffraction data.

The as-received material possesses initially a transient crystallite form with a bimodal distribution in <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures.</b> After the melting of the initial crystallite structure, the sample can be recrystallized by various thermal treatments. A bimodal or single modal <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> distribution is formed for annealing temperatures below or above 360 C, respectively. The recrystallized crystallinities are all transient in nature. The polymers are unable to be recrystallized after being subjected to elevated temperature annealing above 450 C. The recrystallization mechanism was postulated, and a simple kinetics model was found to describe the behavior rather satisfactory under the conditions of prolonged thermal annealing. Rheological measurements made in the linear viscoelastic range support the evidence observed in the thermal analysis. Furthermore, the measurements sustain the manufacturer's recommended processing window of 400 to 420 C for this material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{work was}} aimed at {{studying}} supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) -induced melting temperature depression and crystallization of a syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP). Under scCO 2, the melting temperature of the sPP could be significantly reduced depending on the CO 2 pressure. The scCO 2 -induced crystallization of sPP was investigated using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Two <b>melting</b> <b>peaks</b> were observed in DSC. The one at lower melting temperature referred to the melting of the sPP crystals induced by scCO 2 in its amorphous phase. Its location was shifted to higher temperature, and its area increased with increasing scCO 2 treatment time, temperature, and pressure. The <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> at higher <b>temperature</b> corresponded to the melting of the sPP crystals that already existed before scCO 2 treatment. Its location and area remained almost unaffected by the scCO 2 treatment. The scCO 2 -induced crystallization was related to scCO 2 -promoted transformation of the mesophase form III of the sPP to the stable form I...|$|R
40|$|The {{deliberate}} release of B. anthracis {{is a concern}} to both the animal and human populations. The key to an effective response to a suspected biological release is a rapid, reliable and robust method for identifying the responsible agent that can be employed in a field setting. Although current screening methods for individual pathogen assays are available, they have a limited ability to detect multiple unknown pathogens, which is essential in differentiating a biological agent from a hoax. High resolution melt analysis (HRM) {{is a relatively new}} technology that has been used in this study to develop a broad-range assay. In its current form, the identification of Bacillus species utilising HRM melting temperatures (Tm) was unable to significantly distinguish six out of the nine species in the Bacillus bacterial panel. The primary <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>peak</b> (Tm 1) differentiated Bacillus and Escherichia genera, while the secondary <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>peak</b> (Tm 2) provided the potential to separate the species, particularly B. subtilis. This study provides a potential to identify bacterial species using HRM with the combination of Tm 1 and Tm 2. Additionally this study conducted an examination and comparison of five DNA extraction procedures representing the major types, such as magnetic bead purification, column purification and organic extraction. A method for the removal of environmental inhibitors and the extraction of bacterial DNA from culture has been recommended {{as a result of this}} research...|$|R
40|$|Underground coal fires {{commonly}} metamorphose or melt {{surrounding rocks}} at temperatures exceeding 1000 °C. Numerous “baked” sandstone clinker deposits {{occur in the}} Cretaceous sedimentary rocks exposed in the San Rafael Swell, UT. This study examines clinker in three main localities: 1) East Carbon, UT, 2) Helper, UT, and 3) Emery, UT. The extent of pyrometamorphism in these areas is variably developed, but reached high enough temperature in Helper, UT to initiate melting {{and the production of}} paralavas. These paralavas were examined compositionally and mineralogically to determine <b>melting</b> conditions, <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and mobility of different metals as a result of pyrometamorphism. X-ray diffraction and petrographic analysis showed that paralavas in the Helper locality contain the high temperature SiO 2 polymorphs tridymite and cristobalite which alone indicate temperatures exceeding 875 °C in several samples. Paralavas containing diopside+tridymite and cordierite+mullite+cristobalite provide more restrictive estimates of temperature as they form cotectic and eutectic assemblages in the SiO 2 -Mgo-CaO and SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3, respectively. The assemblages indicate minimum temperatures of melting and metamorphism of 1330 – 1465 ºC. The high temperatures of the paralavas generate increased metal mobility, potentially signifying a hazard if leached out into the environmen...|$|R
40|$|Simple sugars (e. g., sucrose, glucose, and fructose) are abundantly used {{as basic}} {{ingredients}} in the food industry and as excipients in the pharmaceutical industry, due to the quality attributes they contribute to the final products, such as sweet taste, flavor, texture, color, shelf-life (e. g., flavor retention via encapsulation), and carrier function of active pharmaceutical components. These quality attributes directly depend on the processing protocol employed, in particular heating conditions, {{as well as the}} type(s) of sugar used. Thus, it is important to accurately and completely characterize the sugars prior to use in specific applications. Melting has been commonly used for sugar characterization because it is an easy and quick property to measure, yet is usually repeatable and robust. In general, melting is determined by heating a sugar at a specified scanning rate using a thermal analytical technique, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The sugar loses its crystalline structure (commonly termed melting) by adsorbing heat energy, which yields the critical parameters of the resultant <b>melting</b> <b>peak,</b> i. e., the onset melting temperature (Tm onset), the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> (Tm <b>peak),</b> and the enthalpy of melting (∆H). These parameters provide a good deal of information for suga...|$|R

HDPE and mLLDPE blends were prepared by a melt-blending with compositions of 100 / 0, 80 / 20, 60 / 40, 40 / 60 / 20 / 80 and 0 / 100. Four different mLLDPEs containing various octene contents (4. 1, 6. 8, 9. 8 및 12. 5 mol. %) were investigated. The <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> and crystallization <b>peak</b> <b>temperature</b> of the blends were measured by DSC and the mechanical properties were measured in an universal testing machine. By {{observation that the}} <b>melting</b> and crystallization <b>peak</b> <b>temperatures</b> of one component were affected by its counterparts, {{it was revealed that}} HDPE and mLLDPE are miscible or at leat partially miscible at molten state. It was also found that the crystalline phase of mLLDPE contains HDPE crystals. However. it was not clear that mLLDPE was cocrystalized in the crystalline phase of HDPE.

40|$|Unbridged zirconocene catalysts, where a seven- or eight-membered ring {{fused to}} a cyclopentadiene is {{associated}} with a phenyl substituent in position 2 (C 7 Ph-Zr and C 8 Ph-Zr), were tested, under the same polymerization conditions, to produce polypropenes with micro structure, molecular properties, and thermal behavior similar to those prepared with (IndPh) (2) ZrCl 2 (W-Zr), the "classical" Waymouth catalyst. Different results were obtained from the homologue titanium catalysts (C 7 Ph-Ti and C 8 Ph-Ti) and from the titanium benzyl derivative (C 7 Bn-Ti), which produced quite heterogeneous materials with broad molecular weight and that can be separated into fractions spanning from completely atactic to fractions characterized by the presence of long isotactic blocks. A quite interesting behavior is observed with the zirconium benzyl derivative C 7 Bn-Zr, which produces good yields of a polymer with narrow polydispersity, which, despite its rather high isotacticity, shows a hardly detectable <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> and is completely ether soluble. Quite surprisingly, the same sample, after prolonged annealing, shows a narrow <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> at low <b>temperature</b> (55 - 65 degrees C).

40|$|AbstractQuasispecies of {{infectious}} bursal disease virus (IBDV) vaccine and wild-type strains were identified using real-time RT-PCR at a region of the viral genome known for sequence variability. The LightCycler (Idaho Technology, Inc.) and hybridization probe system (Roche, Molecular Biochemicals) were used. An anchor probe labeled with LightCycler Red 640 and mutation probe labeled with fluorescein were designed using the Del-E IBDV sequence. The sequence of the mutation probe included nucleotides in the hydrophilic B region of VP 2 {{that are important to}} a viral neutralizing epitope. This Del-E mutation probe was allowed to hybridize to the RT-PCR products following amplification and its temperature of dissociation (Tm) from each viral template was determined using the LightCycler <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> analysis. The observed Tm for the Del-E mutation probe with its homologous virus, Del-E, was usually 65. 5 °C but ranged from 65 to 66. 4 °C. <b>Peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperatures</b> for the test viruses were inversely proportional to the number of mutations observed between the Del-E mutation probe and target virus sequence. All the IBDV vaccine strains tested and all but two of the wild-type strains exhibited more than one <b>melting</b> <b>peak,</b> indicating that genetic subpopulations or quasispecies of the viruses were present in the samples. Since the mutation probe was located at a site which encodes a neutralizing epitope of the virus, {{it is possible that the}} genetic differences observed are translated into antigenic changes in this VP 2 epitope and contribute to antigenic diversity in the quasispecies cloud...|$|R
40|$|The radiolytic {{method was}} used to {{synthesize}} two types of nanocomposites with silver, PVA/Ag by film casting and PVA hydrogel/Ag nanocomposites. This method is particularly suitable for generating metal nanoparticles in solution. The radiolytic species (solvated electrons and secondary radicals) exhibit strong reducing properties such that metal ions are reduced at each encounter. Metal atoms then tend to grow into larger clusters. It was found that solid or swollen polymers are able to stabilize small crystallites against spontaneous growth via aggregation. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the melting behavior and kinetics of the PVA/Ag nanocomposites were investigated and compared to those of pure PVA. The melting as well as crystallization behavior of polymers is crucial because it governs the thermal properties, impact resistance and stress strain properties. Understanding the melting behavior is significant not only to tailor the properties of nanocomposites but to investigate the interactions between the constituents. The DSC curves of pure PVA and prepared nanocomposites show only one <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> between 175 and 230 °C, indicating that the melting behavior of these two systems are analogous. In both cases, with increasing heating rate, the <b>melting</b> <b>peak</b> shifts to a higher temperature, but with increasing Ag content the <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature</b> is lower. When specimens are heated at high heating rate, the motion of PVA molecular chains cannot follow the heating temperature on time due {{to the influence of}} heat hysteresis, which leads to a higher <b>peak</b> <b>melting</b> <b>temperature.</b> When Ag nanoparticles are added they increase the heat transfer among the PVA molecular chains decreasing the melting temperature. The Ag content is a major factor affecting the degree of crystallinity. It was observed that at low nanofiller content, up to the 0. 5 wt%, the degree of crystallinity of the nanocomposites increased, while at a higher content the crystallization was retarded. The half time of melting is non-linearly dependent on the amount of nanofiller. In the range from 0. 25 to 1 wt% Ag it slightly increases, because at a low Ag content the nanoparticles act as a heterogeneous nucleation agent during the crystallization process. For large amounts of nanofiller, the half time of melting is markedly higher than for pure PVA. At a higher Ag content, the nanoparticles act as a barrier that restricts the thermal motion of PVA molecular chains and the half time of complete melting increases. The significantly lower melting activation energy of the nanocomposites with high amount of nanofiller compared to pure PVA, calculated by the Kissinger method, indicated that nanoparticles reduced the heat barrier for the melting process. ...|$|R
