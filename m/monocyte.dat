5|$|Often, DVT {{begins in}} the valves of veins. The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen {{concentrations}} in the blood (hypoxemia) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to <b>monocyte</b> association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E

Intensive adhesion of <b>monocytes</b> to endothelium proves that <b>monocytes</b> are activated during pregnancy.

The level of antigen-induced gamma interferon release also was decreased when M. tuberculosis-containing <b>monocytes</b> were used as antigen-presenting cells.

40|$|Abstract. Peripheral blood <b>monocytes</b> were {{investigated}} in the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

The higher level of CD 14 +CD 16 + <b>monocytes</b> was associated with decreasing number of <b>monocytes</b> with intracellular TNF–α, and negative correlation between these parameters was revealed. On the contrary, the higher level of CD 14 +CD 16 + <b>monocytes</b> was connected with increased number of IL– 10 –producing <b>monocytes.</b> IL– 10 –producing cells were established mainly in the population of CD 16 + <b>monocytes</b> and so population of CD 14 +CD 16 + <b>monocytes</b> may represent the cells with suppressive activity.

We observed increased numbers of EVs, mostly exosomes, secreted by primary human <b>monocytes</b> and THP- 1 monocytic cells {{in the presence of}} alcohol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. EVs derived from alcohol-treated <b>monocytes</b> stimulated naive <b>monocytes</b> to polarize into M 2 macrophages as indicated by increased surface expression of CD 68 (macrophage marker), M 2 markers (CD 206 (mannose receptor) and CD 163 (scavenger receptor)), secretion of IL- 10, and TGFbeta and increased phagocytic activity. miRNA profiling of the EVs derived from alcohol-treated THP- 1 <b>monocytes</b> revealed high expression of the M 2 -polarizing miRNA, miR- 27 a. Treatment of naive <b>monocytes</b> with control EVs overexpressing miR- 27 a reproduced the effect of EVs from alcohol-treated <b>monocytes</b> on naive <b>monocytes</b> and induced M 2 polarization, suggesting that the effect of alcohol EVs was mediated by miR- 27 a.
