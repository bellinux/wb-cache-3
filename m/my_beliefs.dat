500|$|In {{accordance}} with his mother's wishes, the infant Spiro was baptized an Episcopalian, rather than into the Greek Orthodox Church of his father. Nevertheless, Agnew senior was the dominant figure within the family, {{and a strong}} influence on his son. When in 1969 Baltimore's Greek community endowed a scholarship in Theodore Agnew's name, Spiro Agnew, by then vice president, told the gathering: [...] "I am proud to say that I {{grew up in the}} light of my father. <b>My</b> <b>beliefs</b> are his." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Yorke, {{the first}} verse — [...] "I'll drown <b>my</b> <b>beliefs</b> / To have your babies / I'll dress like your niece / And wash your swollen feet" [...] — {{addresses}} the [...] "difference between young and old", when people {{grow out of}} childish behaviour; the narrator is offering not {{to grow up to}} keep someone they love. The lines [...] "And true love lives / On lollipops and crisps" [...] were inspired by a story Yorke read about a child who was left alone by his parents for days and survived by eating junk food. The song features a [...] "pleading" [...] refrain: [...] "Don't leave, don't leave." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{is true that}} a {{thing is}} said by us to exist, {{even when it is}} absent, and {{therefore}} is not and can not be perceived. But even then, its existence is to us only another word for our conviction that we should perceive it on a certain supposition; namely, if we were in the needful circumstances of time and place, and endowed with the needful perfection of organs. <b>My</b> <b>belief</b> that the Emperor of China exists, is simply <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> that if I were transported to the imperial palace or some other locality in Pekin, I should see him. <b>My</b> <b>belief</b> that Julius Cæsar existed, is <b>my</b> <b>belief</b> that I should have seen him if I had been present in the field of Pharsalia, or in the senate-house at Rome. When I believe that stars exist beyond the utmost range of my vision, though assisted by the most powerful telescopes yet invented, <b>my</b> <b>belief,</b> philosophically expressed, is, that with still better telescopes, if such existed, I could see them, or that they may be perceived by beings less remote from them in space, or whose capacities of perception are superior to mine.|$|R

500|$|When Lisa, Apu, and the McCartneys {{gather on}} the Kwik-E-Mart roof, Apu tells Lisa, [...] "I learned long ago to {{tolerate}} others rather than forcing <b>my</b> <b>beliefs</b> on them. You know, you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, 'Live and Let Live'." [...] Paul corrects Apu {{and says the}} song's title is actually [...] "Live and Let Die". In the same scene, Apu refers to himself as the [...] "fifth Beatle", and Linda alludes to {{a line in the}} Beatles' 1969 song [...] "Octopus's Garden". The McCartneys later ask Lisa if she would like to hear a song, and Apu sings part of [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", to which the McCartneys snap along.|$|E
500|$|Freed {{from the}} demands of his former commissions, Joaquim Inácio spent his time {{translating}} Jean-Félicité-Théodore Ortolan's Et Diplomatie De La Mer (The Diplomacy of the Sea) from French into Portuguese. He was a cultured person whose penchants included poetry. He was also interested in plays {{and he was an}} elected member of the Dramatic Conservatory (which sponsored the national theater) from 8 June 1856. Joaquim Inácio was very religious and he often mentioned God and Catholic saints in his letters. During the Paraguayan War in the late 1860s, upon learning that he was being mocked and criticized by the Paraguayans for his religious devotion, Joaquim Inácio merely replied: [...] "Leave me <b>my</b> <b>beliefs</b> and let them call me whatever they want." [...] He was an enthusiastic member of the Santa Casa de Misericórdia (Holy House of Mercy), a charitable organization in Rio de Janeiro. When the national capital was ravaged by yellow fever in 1854, he went from door to door asking for donations to help the sick.|$|E
500|$|As graduates, Macmillan {{and four}} other women were full members of the General Council of Edinburgh University, but they were denied the {{opportunity}} to vote in February 1906 to determine the Member of Parliament who would represent the university seat. Macmillan argued that {{the wording of the}} General Council's voting statutes used the word persons throughout, and that she and the other female graduates were indeed persons. In March, Macmillan wrote to Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy to ask for aid, as Elmy was the author of the pamphlet The Enfranchisement of Women. Macmillan told Elmy [...] "I formed <b>my</b> <b>beliefs</b> on your pamphlet." [...] Elmy recommended she contact Charlotte Carmichael Stopes for additional useful arguments. Macmillan brought the case before the University Courts in 1907 but lost, and lost a subsequent appeal. Scottish suffragists banded together to raise the £1000 required to present a case to the House of Lords. They hoped to raise awareness in Great Britain of the absurdity and injustice of denying the vote to educated women such as themselves.|$|E

2500|$|The House Republican Steering Committee {{assigned}} Turner {{to three}} committees in the House, including Foreign Affairs, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security. When {{asked about the}} news, Turner said he was [...] "very excited to be appointed to three important House committees." [...] Rep. Peter King commended Turner's involvement in homeland security, saying Turner knew that [...] "New York {{is the number one}} target." [...] Turner sided with the NYPD's intelligence gathering of Arab-Americans, and supported more funding for defense. Upon being chosen to serve on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he stated, [...] "I intend to forward <b>my</b> <b>beliefs</b> that it is in our national interest to defend our Middle East ally, Israel, and I will oppose further attempts by the U.N. to recognize a Palestinian state." [...] He co-sponsored H.R. Bill 556, which condemned Iran for human rights abuses, and urged Pres. Obama to challenge Iran for its nuclear armament policies Turner pushed for strict economic sanctions on the Iranian Central Bank, and criticized Sen. Harry Reid for stalling H.R. 1905, which would have allowed the U.S. to restrict Iran's trade internationally and bar U.S.-Iran diplomacy.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with <b>my</b> <b>beliefs</b> and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E

60|$|I had {{a brother}} in Chicopee Falls who owned manufactories--cotton, or sugar, or A. A. sheetings, or {{something}} in the commercial line. He was vulgarly rich, and therefore reverenced art.

I would demand from him a position in cotton, sugar, or sheetings for William Trotter--something, say, at two hundred a month or thereabouts.
