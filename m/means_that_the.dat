5|$|Absolute, relative, {{and fixed}} CSS {{positioning}}: Absolute positioning <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> web developer specifies the exact X and Y coordinates where an element {{is to be}} placed into the page. Relative positioning <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> web developer specifies an X and Y offset from the usual position of the element. Fixed positioning <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> element is placed relative to the browser window, and scrolls with the window rather than {{with the rest of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|In many contexts, a {{positive}} angular coordinate <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> angle ϕ is measured counterclockwise from the axis.|$|E
5000|$|Residing [...] "continuously" [...] in {{the state}} does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party can not have left the state {{during the period of}} {{residency}} nor does it <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party does not have another residence elsewhere outside New York.|$|R
50|$|Because the Ice-Out {{designation}} {{is based}} on the judgment of one person, it is unscientific. The call does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lake is entirely devoid of ice, nor does it <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> MS Mount Washington actually does go to each of its ports. It simply <b>means</b> <b>that</b> it is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship could.|$|R
5000|$|A highly {{confusing}} term is gain. For example, {{the sentence}} [...] "the gain {{of a system}} should be doubled", without context, means close to nothing.It may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.It may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.It may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling {{the population of the}} upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).|$|R
5|$|A {{daily show}} in which keepers {{demonstrate}} the natural skills of animals {{to an audience of}} visitors. Keepers use positive reinforcement training with every animal, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animals that perform in the shows are never forced into doing tricks. Because of this, the animals used in Animal Antics vary between shows.|$|E
5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|Automation <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smaller size {{of parts}} permits a mobile {{inspection}} system to examine multiple parts more quickly. In addition to mounting inspection systems on automatic devices, multiple-axis robots can remove parts from the mould and position them for further processes.|$|E
50|$|These {{advantages}} <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> financial payback {{is often}} very quick.|$|R
30|$|Let us {{start with}} the {{definition}} of certainty. We follow Levhari and Weiss (1974) and interpret certainty in two alternative ways. First, we interpret it to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> future income of the individual is equal to its expected value. Alternatively, we interpret certainty to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{state of the world}} is known.|$|R

5|$|Blacklock was inbred 3×4 to Pot-8-Os. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{stallion}} appears once in {{the third}} generation and {{once in the}} fourth generation of his pedigree. He was also inbred 3×4 to Highflyer, 4×4×4 to Herod and 4×4 to Eclipse.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} has the halite structure, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Cs+ and F pack in a cubic closest packed array as do Na+ and Cl in sodium chloride.|$|E
5|$|Coat: The Labrador Retriever's coat {{should be}} short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog {{does not get}} cold when taking to water in the winter. That <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dog {{naturally}} has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "republican form (of government)" [...] in Article 139 {{has been}} {{interpreted}} broadly: it is read not only to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> head of state office cannot be hereditary, but also to encapsulates the principle of popular sovereignty. In other words, [...] "republic" [...] is interpreted to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italian Republic is also [...] "democratic".|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> Gemara taught <b>that</b> [...] {{provided}} <b>the</b> law {{of taking}} a beautiful captive only as an allowance for human passions. The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that taking a beautiful captive according to the strictures of [...] was better than taking beautiful captives without restriction, {{just as it was}} better for Jews to eat the meat of a ritually slaughtered ill animal than to eat the meat of an ill animal that had died on its own. The Rabbis interpreted the words [...] "and you see among the captives" [...] in [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> provisions applied only if the soldier set his eye upon the woman when taking her captive, not later. They interpreted the words [...] "a woman" [...] in [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> provisions applied even to a woman who was married before having been taken captive. They interpreted the words [...] "and you have a desire" [...] in [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> provisions applied even if the woman was not beautiful. They interpreted the word [...] "her" [...] in [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> provisions allowed him to take her alone, not her and her companion. They interpreted the words [...] "and you shall take" [...] in [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soldier could have marital rights over her. They interpreted the words [...] "to you to wife" [...] in [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soldier could not take two women, one for himself and another for his father, or one for himself and another for his son. And they interpreted the words [...] "then you shall bring her home" [...] in [...] to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> soldier could not molest her on the battlefield. Rav said that [...] permitted a priest to take a beautiful captive, while Samuel maintained that it was forbidden.–22a1. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1992[...]|$|R

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one {{considers}} string theory or M-theory on an anti-de Sitter background. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> geometry of spacetime {{is described in}} terms of a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poles {{constantly}} receive less {{solar radiation}} {{than at the}} planet's equatorial region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-10 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.2, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> star is {{invisible to the}} naked eye from the perspective of an observer on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Lithic peaks: a {{far smaller}} {{proportion}} of lithics (3,000 vs. 6,000 grains per gram) is observed in H3 and H6, which <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{role of the}} continents in providing sediments to the oceans was relatively lower.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} are ergative in their alignment. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of an}} intransitive verb is treated similarly to {{the object of a}} transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.|$|E

5|$|Methods in {{programming}} language are {{the members of}} a class in a project, some methods have signatures and some don't have signatures. Methods can be void or can return something like string, integer, double, decimal, float and bool. If a method is void it <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method does not return any data type.|$|E
5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates {{the use of}} an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrated}} form {{of aluminium}} chloride has an octahedral molecular geometry, {{with the central}} aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. This <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hydrated form cannot act as a Lewis acid since it cannot accept electron pairs, and thus this cannot {{be used as a}} catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds.|$|E
