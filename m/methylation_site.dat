Due to their importance in immune responses and disorders, the molecular mechanisms leading to T-lymphocyte activation {{have been the}} subject of extensive research which has translated into important therapeutic developments. Early signalling events involving tyrosine phosphorylation are well characterised. However, later events involving other post-translational modifications are less well understood. Several studies have provided evidence suggesting a role for protein arginine methylation in T-lymphocyte activation. Arginine methylation is {{an essential}} post-translational modification in mammals and yet has not been extensively studied. No large scale analysis of arginine <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> has been performed. To gain insight into the role of protein arginine methylation in T-lymphocyte activation, the aims of this work were to: 1. Establish whether levels of arginine methylation are altered during Tlymphocyte activation 2. Use mass spectrometry based proteomics to identify arginine methylated proteins in the T-lymphocyte proteome 3. Further characterise an arginine methylated protein important to Tlymphocyte activation Arginine methylation was found to be induced after long term (> 20 hours) stimulation of primary T-lymphocytes. Large increases in the main protein arginine methyltransferase, PRMT 1, were also observed. Enrichment and labelling methods were developed to detect arginine methylated peptides from T-lymphocytes by mass spectrometry. This resulted in the identification of 265 unique arginine <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> in 141 proteins. 204 of the <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> were novel and 103 of the proteins had not previously been described as arginine methylated.

In this study, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the <b>methylation</b> <b>sites.</b> Although alanine substitutions influenced the signaling bias and the methylation level, {{all of the}} mutants retained aspartate-sensing function.

The proteome-wide identification of <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> in S. cerevisiae, based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in combination with several enrichment and fractionation strategies and on the use of heavy methyl SILAC is presented here. The majority of sites identified are in good agreement with previous reports of arginine methylation, i. e. occur in glycine-arginine-rich regions, locate to proteins involved in RNA-processing and overlap with known sites. Additionally, the data obtained suggest a bias for localisation of arginine methylation in unstructured protein regions and asparagine-rich contexts. It is further shown that the use of heavy methyl SILAC is useful for confident site identification. To overcome challenges in the global approach, the detection of <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> on overexpressed candidate proteins was also employed.

Cell movement, directed either towards nutrients or away from toxic compounds, is known as chemotaxis.

In this study, we systematically and quantitatively characterized the efficiency of chemotaxis and the precision of adaptation for cells expressing Tar mutated at one or more modification sites as the only chemoreceptor. Therefore, we constructed Tar chemoreceptors with all possible combinations of alanine substitutions at the methylation sites to specifically render them non-methylatable. These Tar mutants were then tested for their ability to mediate chemotaxis on soft agar plates. Furthermore, adaptation kinetics of Tar mutants were analyzed by in vivo FRET microscopy and wild-type Tar was investigated by mass spectrometrical analysis, which allows to follow the order and kinetics of methylation at individual modification sites during the adaptation process. We found that the receptor methylation rate following addition of attractant differs for the individual methylation sites with <b>methylation</b> <b>site</b> 2 being fastest, followed by sites 1 and 3, and site 4 having the slowest rate of methylation.

40|$|With the {{development}} of new sequencing technology, the entire N 6 -methyl-adenosine (m 6 A) RNA methylome can now be unbiased profiled with methylated RNA immune-precipitation sequencing technique (MeRIP-Seq), making it possible to detect differential methylation states of RNA between two conditions, for example, between normal and cancerous tissue. However, as an affinity-based method, MeRIP-Seq has yet provided base-pair resolution; that is, a single <b>methylation</b> <b>site</b> determined from MeRIP-Seq data can in practice contain multiple RNA methylation residuals, some of which can be regulated by different enzymes and thus differentially methylated between two conditions. Since existing peak-based methods could not effectively differentiate multiple methylation residuals located within a single <b>methylation</b> <b>site,</b> we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) based approach to address this issue. Specifically, the detected RNA <b>methylation</b> <b>site</b> is further divided into multiple adjacent small bins and then scanned with higher resolution using a hidden Markov model to model the dependency between spatially adjacent bins for improved accuracy. We tested the proposed algorithm on both simulated data and real data. Result suggests that the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms existing peak-based approach on simulated systems and detects differential methylation regions with higher statistical significance on real dataset...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{occurs at}} the adenines in the somatic macronucleus of Tetrahymena thermophila. We report on a <b>methylation</b> <b>site</b> within a DNA segment showing facultative persistence in the macronucleus. When the site is present, methylation occurs on both strands, although only 50 % of the DNA molecules are methylated...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{search for}} motifs associated with CcrM DNA <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> revealed four long (> 100 -bp) motifs (CIR sequences) present {{in up to}} 21 copies in Caulobacter crescentus. The CIR 1 and CIR 2 motifs exhibit a conserved inverted repeat organization, with a CcrM site {{in the center of}} one of the repeats...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} histone lysine {{methylation}} {{as an essential}} epigenetic mechanismn for gene regulation has been demonstrated by numerous studies where it was functionally and structurally linked to euchromatin and heterochromatin. In this work the 3 D architecture and spatial interrealtionships of different histone lysine <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> was investigated in various human cell types...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWhether human induced {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (hiPSCs) are epigenetically identical to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been debated in the stem cell field. In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns in a large number of hiPSCs (n = 114) and hESCs (n = 155), and identified a panel of 82 CpG <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> that can distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy. We show that 12 out of the 82 CpG sites were subject to hypermethylation in part by DNMT 3 B. Notably, DNMT 3 B contributes directly to aberrant hypermethylation and silencing of the signature gene, TCERG 1 L. Overall, we conclude that DNMT 3 B is involved in a wave of de novo methylation during reprogramming, a portion of which contributes to the unique hiPSC methylation signature. These 82 CpG <b>methylation</b> <b>sites</b> may be useful as biomarkers to distinguish between hiPSCs and hESCs...|$|R
