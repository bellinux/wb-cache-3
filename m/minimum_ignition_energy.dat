For the common industrial hydrocarbon gases and solvents, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> required for ignition of vapor-air mixture is lowest for the vapor concentration roughly in the middle between the lower explosive limit and the upper explosive limit, and rapidly increases as the concentration deviates from this optimum to either side. Aerosols of flammable liquids may be ignited well below their flash point. Generally, liquid aerosols with particle sizes below 10 micrometers behave like vapors, particle sizes above 40 micrometers behave more like flammable dusts. Typical minimum flammable concentrations of aerosols lay between 15 and 50 g/m3. Similarly, presence of foam {{on the surface of}} a flammable liquid significantly increases ignitability. Aerosol of flammable dust can be ignited as well, resulting in a dust explosion; the lower explosive limit usually lies between 50 and 1000 g/m3; finer dusts tend to be more explosive and requiring less spark energy to set off. Simultaneous presence of flammable vapors and flammable dust can significantly decrease the ignition energy; a mere 1 vol.% of propane in air can reduce the required ignition energy of dust by 100 times. Higher than normal oxygen content in atmosphere also significantly lowers the ignition energy.|$|E

50|$|The {{flammability}} limits (4-75% {{of hydrogen}} in air at normal temperature, wider at high temperatures), its autoignition temperature at 571 °C, its very low <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy,</b> and its tendency to form explosive mixtures with air, require provisions {{to be made}} for maintaining the hydrogen content within the generator above the upper or below the flammability limit at all times, and other hydrogen safety measures. When filled with hydrogen, overpressure has to be maintained as inlet of air into the generator could cause a dangerous explosion in confined space. The generator enclosure is purged before opening it for maintenance, and before refilling the generator with hydrogen. During shutdown, hydrogen is purged by an inert gas, then the inert gas is replaced by air; the opposite sequence is used before startup. Carbon dioxide or nitrogen can be used for this purpose, as they do not form combustible mixtures with hydrogen and are inexpensive. Gas purity sensors are used to indicate the end of the purging cycle, which shortens the startup and shutdown times and reduces consumption of the purging gas. Carbon dioxide is favored as due to the very high density difference it easily displaces the hydrogen. The carbon dioxide is admitted {{to the bottom of the}} generator first, pushing the hydrogen out at the top. Then air is admitted to the top, pushing the carbon dioxide out at the bottom. Purging is best done with the generator stopped. If done on barring, the generator fans will mix the gases and greatly increase the time required to achieve purity.|$|E

40|$|As a dust {{explosion}} {{is regarded as}} a serious hazard in the industry, knowing the sensitivity of combustible dusts helps to calculate the explosion risk. Also mixtures of a less flammable dust with a combustible dust are often encountered in the process industries. One of the important parameters in determining the ignition sensitivity is the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> (MIE). The aim of this work is to determine crucial ignition energies for different types of combustible dusts of various particle sizes. Experiments are performed to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> of pure dusts and also of different powder mixtures in air. They illustrate that by adding a small amount of a highly combustible powder (such as niacin, lycopodium and metal powder) with a less flammable powder (such as wood, cacao and South African coal) has a considerable effect on the MIE. There is a significant decrease in <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> when the fraction of the highly combustible dust exceeds 10 %.

40|$|Flame development, propagation, stability, {{combustion}} efficiency, pollution formation, {{and overall}} system efficiency {{are affected by}} the early stage of flame generation defined as flame kernel. Studying the effects of turbulence and chemistry on the flame kernel propagation is the main aim of this work for natural gas (NG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). In addition the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> laser <b>energy</b> (MILE) has been investigated for both fuels. Moreover, the flame stability maps for both fuels are also investigated and analyzed. The flame kernels are generated using Nd:YAG pulsed laser and propagated in a partially premixed turbulent jet. The flow field is measured using 2 -D PIV technique. Five cases have been selected for each fuel covering different values of Reynolds number within a range of 6100 - 14400, at a mean equivalence ratio of 2 and a certain level of partial premixing. The MILE increases by increasing the equivalence ratio. Near stoichiometric the energy density is independent on the jet velocity while in rich conditions it increases by increasing the jet velocity. The stability curves show four distinct regions as lifted, attached, blowout, and a fourth region either an attached flame if ignition occurs near the nozzle or lifted if ignition occurs downstream. LPG flames are more stable than NG flames. This is consistent with the higher values of the laminar flame speed of LPG. The flame kernel propagation speed is affected by both turbulence and chemistry. However, at low turbulence level chemistry effects are more pronounced while at high turbulence level the turbulence becomes dominant. LPG flame kernels propagate faster than those for NG flame. In addition, flame kernel extinguished faster in LPG fuel as compared to NG fuel. The propagation speed is likely to be consistent with the local mean equivalence ratio and its corresponding laminar flame speed. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of flammable aerosols presents a high potential for fire hazards {{in the process}} industry. Various industrial fluids, most of which operate at elevated temperatures and pressures, can be atomized when released under high pressure through a small orifice. Because of the complexity {{in the process of}} aerosol formation and combustion, the availability of data on aerosol flammability and flame propagation behaviors is still quite limited, making it difficult to evaluate the potential fire and explosion risks from released aerosols in the process industry and develop safety measures for preventing and/or mitigating aerosol hazards. A study is needed to investigate the relationship between aerosol combustion behaviors and the properties of the aerosols. This dissertation presents research on the combustion behaviors of flammable aerosols. Monodisperse aerosols created by industrial heat transfer fluids were generated using electrospray. The characteristics of flame propagations in aerosols and the influence of the presence of fuel droplets in the system are studied in the aerosol ignition tests. Flames in aerosols are characterized by non-uniform shapes and discrete flame fronts. Flames were observed in different burning modes. Droplet evaporation was found {{to play an important role}} in aerosol burning modes. Droplet evaporation behaviors and fuel vapor distributions are further related to aerosol droplet size, droplet spacing, movement velocity, and liquid volatility. The burning mode of a global flame with rapid size expansion is considered the most hazardous aerosol combustion scenario. This burning mode requires a smaller droplet size and smaller space between droplets. Larger droplet sizes and spacing may hinder the appearance of global flames. But when the liquid fuel has a certain level of volatility, there is an uneven distribution of fuel vapor in the system and this may cause the unique phenomenon of burning mode variations combined with enhanced flame propagation speed. Using an integrated model, the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> values of aerosols were predicted. The aerosol <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>energy</b> is influenced by the fuel-air equivalence ratio and the droplet size.

Moreover, the expected phenomenology is well reproduced for tanks made of several compartments, as a faster combustion process results from the presence of internal orifices. The impact of ignition on the subsequent explosion is also investigated, highlighting a strong influence of the ignition location. The model illustrates that the pressure evolution is the result of complex geometry effects: in particular, for a tank made of identical compartments, the total volume does not suffice to describe the main trends concerning the mechanical effects of explosion...|$|R

40|$|BAM furnace {{apparatus}} {{tests were}} conducted to investigate the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature of coal dusts (MITC) in O 2 /CO 2 atmospheres with an O 2 mole fraction from 20 to 50 %. Three coal dusts: Indonesian Sebuku coal, Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and South African coal were tested. Experimental {{results showed that the}} dust explosion risk increases significantly with increasing O 2 mole fraction by reducing the <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature for the three tested coal dust clouds dramatically (even by 100 °C). Compared with conventional combustion, the inhibiting effect of CO 2 was found to be comparatively large in dust clouds, particularly for the coal dusts with high volatile content. The retardation effect of the moisture content on the ignition of dust clouds was also found to be pronounced. In addition, a modified steady-state mathematical model based on heterogeneous reaction was proposed to interpret the observed experimental phenomena and to estimate the ignition mechanism of coal dust clouds under <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature conditions. The analysis revealed that heterogeneous ignition dominates the ignition mechanism for sub-/bituminous coal dusts under <b>minimum</b> <b>ignition</b> temperature conditions, but the decrease of coal maturity facilitates homogeneous ignition. These results improve our understanding of the ignition behaviour and the explosion risk of coal dust clouds in oxy-fuel combustion atmospheres. status: publishe...|$|R
