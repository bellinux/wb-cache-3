In vivo, macrophages migrate mostly in a constrained three-dimensional (3 D) environment. However, in vitro studies, mainly focused on two dimensions, do not provide meaningful clues about the mechanisms involved in 3 D macrophage migration. In contrast, tumor cell 3 D migration is well documented. It comprises a protease-independent and Rho kinase (ROCK) -dependent amoeboid <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> and a protease-dependent and ROCK-independent mesenchymal <b>migration</b> <b>mode.</b> In this study, we examined the influence of extracellular matrix (composition, architecture, and stiffness) on 3 D migration of human macrophages derived from blood monocytes (MDMs). We show that: 1) MDMs use either the amoeboid <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> in fibrillar collagen I or the mesenchymal <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> in Matrigel and gelled collagen I, whereas HT 1080 tumor cells only perform mesenchymal migration; 2) when MDMs use the mesenchymal migratory mode, they form 3 D collagenolytic structures at the tips of cell protrusions that share several markers with podosomes as described in two dimensions; 3) in contrast to tumor cells, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors do not impair protease-dependent macrophage 3 D migration, suggesting the involvement of other proteolytic systems; and 4) MDMs infiltrating matrices of similar composition but with variable stiffness adapt their <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> primarily to the matrix architecture. In conclusion, although it is admitted that leukocytes 3 D migration is restricted to the amoeboid mode, we show that human macrophages also perform the mesenchymal mode but in a distinct manner than tumor cells, and they naturally adapt their <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> to the environmental constraints...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe mesenchymal-amoeboid {{transition}} (MAT) {{was proposed}} {{as a mechanism}} for cancer cells to adapt their <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> to their environment. While the molecular pathways involved in this transition are well documented, {{the role of the}} microenvironment in the MAT is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated how confinement and adhesion affect this transition. We report that, in the absence of focal adhesions and under conditions of confinement, mesenchymal cells can spontaneously switch to a fast amoeboid migration phenotype. We identified two main types of fast migration—one involving a local protrusion and a second involving a myosin-II-dependent mechanical instability of the cell cortex that leads to a global cortical flow. Interestingly, transformed cells are more prone to adopt this fast <b>migration</b> <b>mode.</b> Finally, we propose a generic model that explains migration transitions and predicts a phase diagram of migration phenotypes based on three main control parameters: confinement, adhesion, and contractility...|$|E

40|$|During corticogenesis, {{pyramidal}} neurons (~ 80 % of cortical neurons) {{arise from}} the ventricular zone, pass through a multipolar stage to become bipolar and attach to radial glia[superscript 1, 2], and then migrate to their proper position within the cortex[superscript 1, 3]. As pyramidal neurons migrate radially, they remain attached to their glial substrate as they pass through the subventricular and intermediate zones, regions rich in tangentially migrating interneurons and axon fibre tracts. We examined the role of lamellipodin (Lpd), a homologue of a key regulator of neuronal migration and polarization in Caenorhabditis elegans, in corticogenesis. Lpd depletion caused bipolar pyramidal neurons to adopt a tangential, rather than radial-glial, <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> without affecting cell fate. Mechanistically, Lpd depletion reduced the activity of SRF, a transcription factor regulated by changes in the ratio of polymerized to unpolymerized actin.

40|$|Glutamatergic neurons of the {{mammalian}} {{cerebral cortex}} originate from the radial glia (RG) progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ). During corticogenesis, neuroblasts migrate toward the pial surface using two different <b>migration</b> <b>modes.</b> One is multipolar (MP) migration with random directional movement, {{and the other}} is locomotion, which is a unidirectional movement guided by the RG fiber. After reaching their final destination, the neurons finalize their migration by terminal translocation, which is followed by maturation via dendrite extension to initiate synaptogenesis and thereby complete neural circuit formation. This switching of <b>migration</b> <b>modes</b> during cortical development is unique in mammals, which suggests that the RG-guided locomotion mode may contribute to the evolution of the mammalian neocortical 6 -layer structure. Many factors have been reported {{to be involved in the}} regulation of this radial neuronal migration process. In general, the radial migration can be largely divided into four steps; (1) maintenance and departure from the VZ of neural progenitor cells, (2) MP migration and transition to bipolar cells, (3) RG-guided locomotion, and (4) terminal translocation and dendrite maturation. Among these, many different gene mutations or knockdown effects have resulted in failure of the MP to bipolar transition (step 2), suggesting that it is a critical step, particularly in radial migration. Moreover, this transition occurs at the subplate layer. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying each of these steps. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary aspects of neuronal migration in corticogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Summary 3 D amoeboid cell {{migration}} {{is central to}} many developmental and disease-related processes such as cancer metastasis. Here, we identify a unique prototypic amoeboid cell <b>migration</b> <b>mode</b> in early zebrafish embryos, termed stable-bleb migration. Stable-bleb cells display an invariant polarized balloon-like shape with exceptional migration speed and persistence. Progenitor cells can be reversibly transformed into stable-bleb cells irrespective of their primary fate and motile characteristics by increasing myosin II activity through biochemical or mechanical stimuli. Using a combination of theory and experiments, we show that, in stable-bleb cells, cortical contractility fluctuations trigger a stochastic switch into amoeboid motility, and a positive feedback between cortical flows and gradients in contractility maintains stable-bleb cell polarization. We further show that rearward cortical flows drive stable-bleb {{cell migration}} in various adhesive and non-adhesive environments, unraveling a highly versatile amoeboid migration phenotype...|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1) disseminates {{in the body and}} is found in several organs and tissues. While HIV- 1 mainly targets both CD 4 + T lymphocytes and macrophages, it has contrasting effects between these cell populations. HIV- 1 infection namely reduces the viability of CD 4 + T cells, whereas infected macrophages are long-lived. In addition, the migration of T cells is reduced by the infection, while HIV- 1 differentially modulates the <b>migration</b> <b>modes</b> of macrophages. In 2 -dimensions (2 D) assays, infected macrophages are less motile compared to the control counterparts. In 3 D environments, macrophages use two <b>migration</b> <b>modes</b> that are dependent on the matrix architecture: amoeboid and mesenchymal migration. HIV- 1 infected macrophages exhibit a reduced amoeboid migration but an enhanced mesenchymal migration, via the viral protein Nef. Indeed, the mesenchymal migration involves podosomes, and Nef stabilizes these cell structures through the activation of the tyrosine kinase Hck, which in turn phosphorylates the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP). WASP is a key player in actin remodeling and cell migration. The reprogramed motility of infected macrophages observed in vitro correlates in vivo with enhanced macrophage infiltration in experimental tumors in Nef-transgenic mice compared to control mice. In conclusion, HIV infection of host target cells modifies their migration capacity; we infer that HIV- 1 enhances virus spreading in confined environments by reducing T cells migration, and facilitates virus dissemination into different organs and tissues of the human body by enhancing macrophage mesenchymal migration...|$|R

The in silico invasion of a tumor was addressed systematically {{for the first time}} within the framework of a generalized diffusion theory. Our results reveal that a tumor not only migrates using typical Fickian diffusion, but also migrates more generally using subdiffusion, superdiffusion, and even ballistic diffusion, with increasing mobility of the tumor cell when haptotaxis and chemotaxis toward the host tissue surrounding the proliferative tumor are involved. Five functional terms were included in the hybrid model and their effects on a tumor’s invasion were investigated quantitatively: haptotaxis toward the extracellular matrix tissue that is degraded by matrix metalloproteinases; chemotaxis toward nutrients; cell-cell adhesion; the proliferation of the tumor; and the immune response toward the tumor. Haptotaxis and chemotaxis, which are initiated by extracellular matrix and nutrient supply (i. e., glucose) respectively, as well as cell-cell adhesions all drastically affect a tumor’s diffusion mode when a tumor invades its surrounding host tissue and proliferates.
