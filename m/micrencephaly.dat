40|$|Congenital malformations with {{multiple}} anomalies {{have been described}} infrequently in the veterinary literature. A stillborn male crossbred lamb with diprosopus, craniorachischisis, and arthrogryposis was examined macroscopically and histopathologically in this study. The left head was smaller than the right head. <b>Micrencephaly,</b> agnathia, and a rudimentary tongue, which was adherent to the palate, {{were present in the}} left head. <b>Micrencephaly,</b> brachygnathia superior, and cleft palate were present in the right head. Cerebellar agenesis and spinal cord hypoplasia were observed. The cerebrums and the spinal cord were covered with a tapering membranous structure. Neural and dermal tissues were noted to intervene upon microscopic examination of this structure. Disorganization of neurons was observed in both cerebrums, though it was more severe in the left one. This case demonstrates many congenital defects occurring together in a lamb...|$|E
40|$|MPKU pregnancies, with {{or without}} dietary {{treatment}} to reduce maternal plasma phenylalanine (phe), show variable, increased non-physiologic levels, as the putative cause of fetal teratogenicity. Cerebral dysgenesis with clinical neonatal microcephaly and congenital heart disease indicates altered organ morphogenesis. Although {{there is not an}} established precise relationship between maternal phe levels and outcome, dietary restriction before or early in gestation is universally advised. Both human experience and animal research have suggested differential organ responses to high and low phe levels. Structural <b>micrencephaly</b> may be due to reduced brain volume or abnormal regional brain develop-ment. Infants in MPKU are also at risk to develop PKU. <b>Micrencephaly</b> was evident by MRI in 8 of 21 infants born to 12 MPKU mothers; 2 infants of one mother developed PKU. All levels of gestational plasma phe were associated with otherwise structurally normal infant micrencephalic brains appro-priate for age in myelination. CHD occurred in one micrencephalic infant of a classic MPKU treated in the first trimester. Maternal, cord and neonatal plasma phenylalanine at delivery did not correlate with teratogenic effects. Only untreated ‘classic ’ MPKU fetal effects appear predictable...|$|E
40|$|A {{pathological}} syndrome comprising <b>micrencephaly,</b> symmetrical cerebral calcifications, and patchy de-myelination of {{the cerebral}} white matter has been delineated {{on the basis}} of seven cases reported in the literature (Horanyi-Hechst and Meyer, 1939; Hallervorden, 1950, four cases; Jervis, 1954, two cases). The last two authors considered that the con-dition was probably the consequence of an ence-phalitis occurring in early life. The purpose of the present paper is to describe another example of this rare syndrome, to report the chemical findings in the brain, and to give reasons for regarding its pathogenesis as primarily degenerative and not inflammatory. Horanyi-Hechst and Meyer (1939) had originally noted the similarity of the patchy, dis...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and radiological findings {{in a pair}} of sibs with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) are described, a boy who survived for 5 1 / 2 years and his more severely affected younger sister, who {{died at the age of}} 6 months. Neuropathological studies in this girl showed marked <b>micrencephaly</b> with severely hypoplastic, poorly gyrated frontal lobes and absent corpus callosum. Our observation supports the hypothesis that types I and III MOPD probably constitute a spectrum of one and the same entity and published data together with this report are consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The pathogenesis of this condition is as yet unknown, but its characteristics indicate a basic defect affecting cell proliferation and tissue differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				Monosomy 1 p 36 is {{the most}} common subtelomeric {{chromosomal}} deletion linked to mental retardation and seizures. Neuroimaging studies suggest that monosomy 1 p 36 is associated with brain malformations including polymicrogyria and nodular heterotopia, but the histopathology of these lesions is unknown. Here we present postmortem neuropathological findings from a 10 year-old girl with monosomy 1 p 36, who died of respiratory complications. The findings included <b>micrencephaly,</b> periventricular nodular heterotopia in occipitotemporal lobes, cortical dysgenesis resembling polymicrogyria in dorsolateral frontal lobes, hippocampal malrotation, callosal hypoplasia, superiorly rotated cerebellum with small vermis, and lumbosacral hydromyelia. The abnormal cortex exhibited &# 8220;festooned&# 8221; (undulating) supragranular layers, but no significant fusion of the molecular layer. Deletion mapping demonstrated single copy loss of a contiguous 1 p 36 terminal region encompassing many important neurodevelopmental genes, among them four HES genes implicated in regulating neural stem cell differentiation, and TP 73, a monoallelically expressed gene. Our results suggest that brain and spinal malformations in monosomy 1 p 36 may be more extensive than previously recognized, and may depend on the parental origin of deleted genes. More broadly, our results suggest that specific genetic disorders may cause distinct forms of cortical dysgenesis...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel nephrocerebellar syndrome on the Galloway-Mowat syndrome spectrum among 30 children (ages 1. 0 to 28 years) from diverse Amish demes. Children with nephrocerebellar syndrome had progressive microcephaly, visual impairment, stagnant psychomotor development, abnormal extrapyramidal movements and nephrosis. Fourteen died between ages 2. 7 and 28 years, typically from renal failure. Post-mortem studies revealed (i) <b>micrencephaly</b> without polymicrogyria or heterotopia; (ii) atrophic cerebellar hemispheres with stunted folia, profound granule cell depletion, Bergmann gliosis, {{and signs of}} Purkinje cell deafferentation; (iii) selective striatal cholinergic interneuron loss; and (iv) optic atrophy with delamination of the lateral geniculate nuclei. Renal tissue showed focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and extensive effacement and microvillus transformation of podocyte foot processes. Nephrocerebellar syndrome mapped to 700 kb on chromosome 15, which contained a single novel homozygous frameshift variant (WDR 73 c. 888 delT; p. Phe 296 Leufs* 26). WDR 73 protein is expressed in human cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cultured embryonic kidney cells. It is concentrated at mitotic microtubules and interacts with ?-, ?-, and ?-tubulin, heat shock proteins 70 and 90 (HSP- 70; HSP- 90), and the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 2 /aspartate transcarbamylase/dihydroorotase multi-enzyme complex. Recombinant WDR 73 p. Phe 296 Leufs* 26 and p. Arg 256 Profs* 18 proteins are truncated, unstable, and show increased interaction with ?- and ?-tubulin and HSP- 70 /HSP- 90. Fibroblasts from patients homozygous for WDR 73 p. Phe 296 Leufs* 26 proliferate poorly in primary culture and senesce early. Our data suggest that in humans, WDR 73 interacts with mitotic microtubules to regulate cell cycle progression, proliferation and survival in brain and kidney.

40|$|During the 1974 / 75 {{lambing season}} {{numerous}} reports were received from {{various parts of}} the Republic of South Africa and South West Africa of severe abdominal distension in ewes after vaccination with the attenuated Rift Valley fever and/or attenuated Wesselsbron disease vaccine. The ewes were vaccinated at different stages of gestation in spite of recommendations to the contrary, the syndrome being especially obvious in ewes immunized with one or both of these vaccines during the first trimester of pregnancy. In some of the flocks hydrops amnii was recorded in as many as 15 % of the ewes. Many of the ewes so affected showed a prolonged gestation of up to 6 - 7 months and, towards the end of gestation, were unable to rise or walk. They eventually died of ketosis, hypostatic pneumonia and complications due to dystocia. The foetuses examined were malformed and larger than normal with a mass of 3, 6 - 6, 7 kg. They usually showed arthrogryposis, brachygnathy inferior, hydranencephaly, hypoplasia or segmental aplasia of the spinal cord and neurogenic muscular atrophy. The amnion contained 8, 0 - 18, 0 l of amniotic fluid, the endometrium was oedematous, and cystic tube-like dilatations, 1 - 10 mm in diameter, filled with a clear fluid, were scattered in the endometrium. No definite conclusions as to the aetiology of the syndrome could be drawn from serological tests performed on the ewes, lambs or foetuses. Preliminary experimental work confirmed previous observations that the attenuated Wesselsbron disease vaccine virus is responsible for this syndrome and that the wild-type virus is also implicated. In addition, the attenuated Rift Valley fever vaccine virus was found to the responsible for arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly without hydrops amnii and for <b>micrencephaly</b> and arthrogryposis associated with hydrops amnii in the ewe.

40|$|According to {{the results}} found in {{literature}} Microcephaly — better <b>Micrencephaly</b> — is a syndrom with a very heterogenous pathogenesis which often remains unclarified. Its etiology, though occasionally purely exogenous, seems to be mostly hereditary {{in the sense of}} monomeric recessivity, as the experiences, so far rather scanty, of research in families and in twins show. The so-called Microcephalia vera is to be considered identical with this mono-recessive form. Our data may be divided in four groups: Group I comprises 35 cases of verified or almost sure M. vera in 23 sibships. The diagnosis are mainly assured by clinical data and photos and in 4 cases by post mortems, 3 of them having been most carefully examined under the guidance of brain-anatomists like C. v. Monakow, M. Minkowsky and E. Grünthal whose publications in detail are referred to here. The Sex-Ratio in our cases (17 male and 18 female) is practically 1 : 1, therefore deviating considerably from that found in Japan and even more from that found in England and in Holland. The application of Weinberg's sib-Method to our thoroughly studied, non-selected series gives the percentage of 24, 2 ± 6, 2 largely corresponding with the theoretical expectation for the assumption of simple recessivity. A parental consanquinity was only found in 10 families though even the IV. - V. Canonical degree was also considered twice and though about a third of our patients originate from isolates. The number of I. and II. cousin-marriages occur but three times each (together 26 %). Further, 1 case of incest between father and daughter is described. The main complications in our cases of M. vera are epileptic fits and fits of excitement with aggressive tendencies. An encephalocele was found only once and other states of dysraphy nowhere prevailed; neither did cerebral tumors, phacomatosis and other systematised nervous affections, as well as mongoloid idiocy, disturbances of metabolism and somatic malformations. Also psychoses were not above the average in the kinships concerned. General spasticity, a symptom found regularly in their cases by other authors was only met with in a minority of our cases. Possibly there may exist heterogenity in M. vera, which phenotipically manifests itself by {{the presence or absence of}} general spasticity. Since in Switzerland by far not all cases of M. are interned, the frequency of M. vera is difficult to ascertain. About half of our patients died in early childhood and maybe many die through abortions, the gene involved being semilethal. Growth and life-span can rarely be normal even in high-grade microcephalic idiots. Most of them, however, are undersized, exceptionally real dwarfs. Among the non microcephalic sibs of our patients we found a considerable number of feebleminded and bordeline cases, showing — but not always — a lessened head-circumference. In the parents of our microcephalics, however, only exceptionally an intellectual deficiency was stated, more frequently as a matter of fact a lessened head-circumference. The very heterozygotes are not at all always characterised physically and mentally or even in one respect. Our three other groups seem to refer to a secondary microcephaly and therefore are restricted to isolated cases. In one kinship a microcephalic boy is first cousin of an idiot with hydrocephaly. In another kinship with apparently simple recessive deaf-mutism and idiocy one patient shows microcephaly. In a third family with four sibs of clincally diagnosed cases of diffuse cerebral sclerosis each affected member was also microcephalic; here we have to deal probably — as the parents are II. cousins — with a particular specific simple recessive gen...|$|E
