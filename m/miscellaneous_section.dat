6000|$|And so {{he wandered}} on, {{alternating}} between depression and elation {{as he stared}} at the shelves packed with wisdom. In one <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>section</b> he came upon a [...] "Norrie's Epitome." [...] He turned the pages reverently. In a way, it spoke a kindred speech. Both he and it were of the sea. Then he found a [...] "Bowditch" [...] and books by Lecky and Marshall. There it was; he would teach himself navigation. He would quit drinking, work up, and become a captain. Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment. As a captain, he could marry her (if she would have him). And if she wouldn't, well--he would live a good life among men, because of Her, and he would quit drinking anyway. Then he remembered the underwriters and the owners, the two masters a captain must serve, either of which could and would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed. He cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books. No; no more of the sea for him. There was power in all that wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do them on the land. Besides, captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them.|$|E

40|$|Results of {{the first}} two years of {{observations}} using the All Sky Automated Survey prototype camera are presented. More than 140 000 stars in 50 Selected Fields covering 300 sq. degrees were monitored each clear night in the I-band resulting in the ASAS Photometric I-band Catalog containing over 50 x 10 ^ 6 individual measurements. Nightly monitoring over 100 standard stars confirms that most of our data remains within sigma_I= 0. 03 of the standard I system. Search for the stars varying on the time scales longer than a few days revealed almost 4000 variables (mostly irregular, pulsating and binaries) brighter than 13 mag. Only 155 of them are known variables included in GCVS, 56 were observed by Hipparcos satellite (46 were marked as variable). Among the stars brighter than I ~ 7. 5 (which are saturated on our frames) we have found about 50 variables (12 are in GCVS, 6 other in Hipparcos (Perryman etal 1997) catalog).

40|$|Purpose: The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is the presentation of a new integrated approach for solving a multi attribute decision making problem by the use of Entropy Fuzzy and F- PROMETHEE (fuzzy preference ranking method for enrichment evaluation) techniques. Design/methodology/approach: In these sorts of multi attribute decision making problem, a number of criteria and alternatives are put forward as input data. Ranking of these alternatives according to mentioned criteria is regarded as the outcome of solving these kinds of problems. Initially, weights of criteria are determined by implementation of Entropy Fuzzy method. According to determined weights, F-PROMETHEE method is exerted to rank these alternatives in terms of desirability of DM (decision maker). Findings: Being in an uncertain environment and vagueness of DM’s judgments, lead us to implement an algorithm which can deal with these constraints properly. This technique namely called Entropy Fuzzy as a weighting method and F-PROMETHEE is performed to fulfill this approach more precisely according to tangible and intangible aspects. The main finding of applied approach is the final ranking of alternatives helping DM to have a more reliable decision. Originality/Value: The main contribution of this approach is the giving real significance to DM’s attitudes about mentioned criteria in determined alternatives which is not elucidate in former approaches like Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Furthermore, previous methods like Shanon Entropy do not pay attention sufficiently to satisfaction degree of each criterion in proposed alternatives, regarding to DM’s statements. Comprehensive explanations about these procedures have been made in <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>sections</b> of this article. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bulletin}} board is to collect problems in higher dimensional complex analysis. We are interested both in basic research questions as well as interactive questions with other fields and sciences. We encourage everybody to submit problems to the list. This includes not only those coming up in your own work, but also others- maybe well known and classical- that you see missing, but that you think workers in the field should be aware of. Not only are we searching for basic research type questions in several complex variables, we also solicit questions exploring relations to other mathematical fields, one complex variable, partial differential equations, differential geometry, dynamics, etc. and to other sciences such as physics, engineering, biology etc. While some questions fall rather naturally {{into one of the}} subject areas in this problem list and may lead to a publishable paper, other questions may be non- specific or of a transient or technical quality. Thus we have a section called ``Scratchpad'' for conversational questions, vaguely formulated questions, or questions to which you may hope to get a quick answer. In the ``open prize problems'' section, you are welcome to offer a nice little prize to whoever does it.
