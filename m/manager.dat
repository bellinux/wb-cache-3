40|$|M. Com. (Human Resources Management) Abstract: The {{ability to}} retain top- and middle-level <b>managers</b> {{is seen as}} a {{long-term}} investment for an organisation. Retaining and developing talented top- and middle-level <b>managers</b> with organisation-specific skills and experience leads to a competitive advantage for organisations. This study explores effective retention strategies for top- and middle-level <b>managers</b> and identifies the challenges that HR <b>managers</b> face with regard to retaining top- and middle-level <b>managers.</b> Current literature relating to employee retention has been criticised for being too general, and providing few recommendations for overcoming the problem to retaining top- and middle-level <b>managers.</b> This study is important because, despite the strong need to retain top- and middle-level <b>managers,</b> HR <b>managers</b> face difficulties in retaining <b>managers</b> due to ineffective retention strategies. Losing talented <b>managers</b> {{is seen as a}} long-term cost for organisations. This study followed a quantitative approach. A questionnaire was developed based on an extensive literature review and a self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to HR <b>managers</b> registered at a professional body. A sample of 97 completed questionnaires being returned. The data were analysed using software for quantitative data, namely SPSS. The results indicated that the leadership of an organisation and performance management practices are effective retention strategies for top- and middle-level <b>managers,</b> as perceived by HR professionals. Challenges to retaining top- and middle-level <b>managers</b> include job context factors, organisational factors, and employee wellness. In addition, the results suggest that HR <b>managers</b> have more difficulty retaining middle-level <b>managers</b> than top-level <b>managers.</b> It is clear from this study that HR <b>managers</b> are interested in implementing effective retention strategies due to the rising challenges they face with regard to retaining top- and middle-level <b>managers.</b> This study contributes to knowledge regarding retention strategies and provides insights for HR <b>managers,</b> line <b>managers</b> and leaders of organisations in relation to effective retention strategies and retention challenges...|$|R

Furthermore, we consider information asymmetries between different types of insiders by comparing abnormal net sales between <b>managers</b> and non-managing insiders, between top-level <b>managers</b> and low-level <b>managers,</b> and between financial <b>managers</b> and non-financial <b>managers.</b> We show that <b>managers</b> have higher abnormal net sales than non-managing insiders, and that top-level <b>managers</b> have higher abnormal net sales than low-level <b>managers</b> prior to lawsuit announcements. We find a significant negative correlation between abnormal stock returns and abnormal net sales by <b>managers</b> and by top-level <b>managers.</b> Our evidence suggests that <b>managers</b> may engage in net selling {{in anticipation of the}} negative stock returns that are typically associated with securities class action announcements. In particular, high-rank insiders appear to place more profitable trades than low-rank insiders prior to lawsuit announcements...|$|R

First, Japanese <b>managers</b> were more concrete and reflective than American <b>managers</b> in general. But this general learning tendency may be affected in accordance with types of business that <b>managers</b> engage with. Second, Japanese <b>managers</b> were more heterogeneous in learning styles, while American <b>managers</b> showed more homogeneity of learning styles. Third, in the aspect of balance and specialization on learning styles, American <b>managers</b> demonstrated more balanced learning abilities than did Japanese <b>managers.</b> These findings suggest that group oriented countries like Japan possess symmetry on collective learning styles and asymmetry on individual learning styles; and in contrast, individual oriented countries like the US hold asymmetry on collective learning styles and symmetry on individual learning styles...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} an analysis of empirical data on ethical attitudes of profes-sionals and <b>managers</b> in relation to organizational core values in the Information Technology (IT) industry. This study investigates the association between key organizational values as independent variables and the ethical attitudes of IT <b>managers</b> as dependent variables. The study also delves into differences among IT non-managerial professionals, mid-level <b>managers,</b> and upper-level <b>managers</b> in their ethical attitudes and perceptions. Research results indicated that IT professionals from mechanistic organizations {{were much more likely to}} report – compared to those from organic organizations – that <b>managers</b> in their corporate environment engage in behaviors considered unethical and that successful <b>managers</b> were more unethical relative to unsuccessful <b>managers.</b> There were significant differences between the upper-level <b>managers</b> and the mid-level <b>managers</b> and between the mid-level <b>managers</b> and the IT non-managerial professionals on certain key ethical issues.

However, most of the literature on the subject is anecdotal and little formal empirical research has been done. Three companies are investigated to study the extent of agreement/disagreement between manufacturing and marketing <b>managers</b> on strategy content and process. A novel method permits the study of agreement between the two different functional <b>managers</b> on the process of developing strategy. The findings consistently show that manufacturing <b>managers</b> operate under a wider range of strategic priorities than marketing <b>managers,</b> and that manufacturing <b>managers</b> participate less than marketing <b>managers</b> in the strategy development process. Further, both marketing and manufacturing <b>managers</b> show higher involvement in the strategy development process in the latter stages of the Hayes and Wheelwright four-stage model of manufacturing’s strategic role...|$|R
