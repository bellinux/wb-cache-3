25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|E
25|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> {{told me that}} {{no matter}} how much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
500|$|Andy Warhol: Oh God, yes, it's true, the tin {{flowers were}} {{made out of}} those fruit cans, that's the reason why I did my first tin-can {{paintings}} ... You take a tin-can, the bigger the tin-can the better, like the family size ones that peach halves come in, and I think you cut them with scissors. It's very easy and you just make flowers out of them. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> had lots of cans around, including the soup cans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lawrence? He's {{gone through}} every penny he ever had, {{publishing}} rotten verses in fancy bindings. No, we're an impecunious lot. <b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>always</b> been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since her marriage, of course----" [...] he broke off, frowning.|$|R

500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one where <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} her life, Bertrand {{preferred}} {{her privacy}} and did not grant interviews. After a nearly eight-year battle with ovarian and breast cancer, she died aged 56 on January 27, 2007, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in the company of her children. Bertrand's mother and sister also died of cancer. Her daughter said, [...] "My grandmother also died young; so, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> thought it could happen to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born Marilyn Ann Briggs in Providence, Rhode Island, Chambers {{was raised}} in Westport, Connecticut, in a middle-class household. It is often {{reported}} that {{she was born in}} Westport; however, in a 2007 interview Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport. Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith. Chambers attended Burr Farms Elementary School, Hillspoint Elementary School, Long Lots Junior High School, and Staples High School. Her father tried to discourage her from pursuing a modeling career, citing brutal competition. [...] "Ever since I was a little kid, I've always wanted to be an actress," [...] Chambers said in 1997. [...] "I was always a performer, a junior Olympic diver, a junior Olympic gymnast. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> told me I was a show-off".|$|E
6000|$|... "It is what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is <b>always</b> blaming me for," [...] said Walter; [...] "but really, now, Edmund, doesn't it savour of the crop-ear to {{be picking}} one's words to every rogue in one's way?" ...|$|R
60|$|So I {{came away}} then, {{because he was}} looking tired. Overwork, I reckon; I never do that; I have seen the evil effects of it. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>always</b> afraid I would {{overwork}} myself, but I never did.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{averse to}} the {{purchase}} of negroes from Africa," [...] said the young gentleman, coldly. [...] "My grandfather and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> have <b>always</b> objected to it, and I {{do not like to}} think of selling or buying the poor wretches." ...|$|R
60|$|I've {{always had}} a footman. And <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> had a footman. I couldn't live a day without him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, master," [...] said Martin. [...] "I {{know it was}} careless; <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> told me that I was careless, but so was {{my father}} before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woodden, you're a born fool." [...] Also the answer: [...] "That's what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> told me, master, and {{she ought}} to know if anyone did. But what's wrong now? I obeyed orders and bought 'O. Paving.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I didn't {{even know}} {{my dad was}} bald until I was a teenager," [...] joked his son, J. C. Agajanian, Jr. (Cary) [...] "He even wore the hat sitting down for breakfast in the morning. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>always</b> getting on him about that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} your feeling, Cyril, but <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> assuredly would <b>always</b> have been {{pleased to see}} you. You know you were a favourite of hers." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>always</b> full of pep and vigor. One time at 75 {{years of}} age, she {{dressed up in}} my old Navy uniform, danced a jig and played a piece on her French harp just to help the {{neighborhood}} kids put on a backyard show. My comic Grandma, in spirit at least, is <b>my</b> own beloved <b>mother.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Miles will do all he can," [...] said Julius; [...] "he {{was almost}} broken- hearted {{when he found}} how Archie had gone. I think he was even more his hero than Raymond when we were boys, because he was more enterprising; and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> thought Archie's baffled passion for the sea reacted upon Miles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{that you}} can guess better than I," [...] said the jester; [...] "for though the night be cloudy, I warrant {{you can see the}} stars through the mist. I know nothing of the matter, not I--only <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> told me to go warily near an old rat in a trap, for he was never so much {{disposed}} to bite." ...|$|E
60|$|My mother now tried {{her best}} to draw from her her history, {{whatever}} that might be. She spoke with tact and tenderness, and with the respect due from one human being to another; for <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> held that every soul has its own inviolable private door which it {{has a right to}} keep closed, and at which even queens and duchesses, if they wish to enter, must knock humbly and reverently.|$|E
6000|$|... "He knows I'm coming, for I {{wrote and}} told <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> I <b>always</b> tell everything; but it's {{sometimes}} {{best to make}} up your mind before you get an answer." [...] Then the Doctor made up his mind that Lord Carstairs would have his own way in anything that he wished to accomplish.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I'm done for," [...] said Tom. [...] "The cussed sneaking dog, {{to leave}} me to die alone! <b>My</b> poor old <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> told me 't would be so." ...|$|R

'Long ago,' he said, 'I thought {{like you}} that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>always</b> keep the window open for me; so I stayed away for moons and moons and moons, and then flew back; but {{the window was}} barred, for mother had {{forgotten}} all about me, {{and there was another}} little boy sleeping in my bed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, sir. It {{was always}} my mother's wish that I should, when I was old enough, {{come up to}} the Soudan to make enquiries. As my father was a good Arabic scholar, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> entertained a faint hope that he might have escaped; {{especially}} as we know that a good many of the Egyptian soldiers were not killed, but were taken prisoners, and made to serve in the Mahdi's army." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] said my wife, [...] "I {{believe in}} best china, {{to be kept}} {{carefully}} on an upper shelf, and taken down for high-days and holidays; {{it may be a}} superstition, but I believe in it. It must never be taken out except when the mistress herself can see that it is safely cared for. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> washed her china herself; {{and it was a very}} pretty social ceremony, after tea was over, while she sat among us washing her pretty cups, and wiping them on a fine damask towel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{name was}} Caesar; {{he was a}} house servant of my late {{grandfather}} Wharton. You don't remember him, I believe; he died the same year with his master, while we were children. Katy yearly sings his requiem, and, upon my word, I believe he deserved it. I have heard something of his helping my English uncle, as we call General Wharton, in some difficulty {{that occurred in the}} old war. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> speaks of him with great affection. Both Caesar and Katy came to Virginia with my mother when she married. My mother was--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why do {{you choose}} this time, just when it's getting dark, to write your letters," [...] {{my father would}} expostulate, when by chance he {{happened}} {{to look into the}} room. [...] "Let me ring for the lamp, you will strain your eyes." [...] But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>always</b> excuse herself, saying she had only a few lines to finish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hm! I {{am afraid}} {{none of the}} family would make us very {{comfortable}} under the circumstances, except Marmaduke. It would be a splendid joke to go to West Kensington; only it would tell as much against us and Ned as against the Roman father. I have it! We will go to Mrs. Toplis's in St. Mary's Terrace: <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> stays there when she is in town. Mrs. Toplis knows us: {{if she has a}} room to spare she will give it to us without making any bother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have to be}} born to love horses, maybe," [...] she answered. [...] "Maybe it's because I {{always think}} of my father on his roan war-horse that makes me love horses. But, anyway, I do. When I {{was a little girl}} I was drawing horses all the time. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> {{encouraged}} me. I've a scrapbook mostly filled with horses I drew when I was little. Do you know, Billy, sometimes I dream I actually own a horse, all my own. And lots of times I dream I'm on a horse's back, or driving him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I must speak," [...] {{she thought}} wistfully. [...] "I hate to do it. I always did hate meddling. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>always</b> {{used to say}} that ninety-nine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddled with was worse than the first. But I guess it's my duty. I was Margaret's friend, and it is my duty to protect her child any way I can. If the Master does go back across there to meet her I must tell him what I think about it." ...|$|E
