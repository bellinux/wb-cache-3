500|$|The {{main idea}} behind the video is that of Gaga getting kidnapped {{by a group of}} supermodels who drug her and then sell her off to the Russian mafia for a million rubles. It takes place in a {{fluorescent}} white bathhouse. The video begins with Gaga sitting on a white throne in a brightly-lit white room. The scene shows her wearing the razor-blade glasses and surrounded by people and a harlequin Great Dane. She has her finger on the <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> of an iPod speaker, and as she releases it, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] begins to play and a dimly-lit bathhouse is shown. A bright light pans across the walls, activating fluorescent lighting, which shines through a sign reading [...] "Bath Haus of GaGa". As the first hook of the song begins, a group of female dancers wearing white long-sleeved leotards with knee-high boots and matching crowns crawl out of white, coffin-like pods. The center pod has [...] "Mons†er" [...] written on it, and Gaga emerges wearing an outfit similar to those worn by the others, who begin to dance behind her. A pastiche of ensuing scenes alternates between Gaga singing to herself {{in front of a mirror}} and lying in a bathtub.|$|E
2500|$|The Priv {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. The Verge {{felt that}} the Priv's design was [...] "quite good", noting that the thinness of the device's two halves averted it from feeling [...] "top-heavy" [...] when its keyboard was in use. The Wall Street Journal described the frame and curved screen as being [...] "a pleasure to hold and look at." [...] Ars Technica was critical of the device's overall build quality, with its back cover described as feeling [...] "spongy" [...] its sliding mechanism described as being [...] "scratchy" [...] and [...] "friction-filled", while its curved screen was considered a [...] "rather useless gimmick" [...] that was inappropriate for the device's target market. Ars Technica also panned the hardware <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> for being [...] "counterintuitive", as it does not mute the device unless it is already playing audio, otherwise triggering the system volume controls. The hardware keyboard received mixed reviews. The Wall Street Journal described the keyboard as being the [...] "smartphone equivalent of a Colonial butter churn", noting that, although it was faster to type on in comparison to virtual keyboards, the BlackBerry Classic had a larger and wider keyboard. Ars Technica felt it was [...] "unpleasant" [...] to use due to its size, flat keys and how it interacts with the OS. PC Magazine described its display as being [...] "beautiful", while Ars Technica felt {{that it had a}} [...] "grainy" [...] color reproduction.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} set {{was in the}} same Atlantic Video complex as the set for Pardon the Interruption. It featured the host's desk with the point triggers and <b>mute</b> <b>buttons,</b> opposite of four screens of the panelists with their score under them and the mute sign above them. Behind the host's desk was a map of the contiguous United States of America with the cities the sportswriters on the show appeared from. The map, divided into time zones, displayed the names of five newspapers representing each time zone. The Los Angeles Times represented the Pacific Time Zone, the Denver Post the Mountain Time Zone, the Dallas Morning News and Chicago Sun-Times both represented the Central Time Zone, and the Boston Globe represented the Eastern Time Zone. This was to create a regionally biased discussion, but this was later phased out.|$|R

5000|$|An analog matrix mixer {{contains}} {{a number of}} simple electronic mixer circuits, the quantity being the number of inputs multiplied {{by the number of}} outputs. Each electronic mixer controls the level (gain) of one input going to one output. The level control is usually a rotating potentiometer (called a [...] "pot"). Each row of electronic mixer circuits, one from each input, feeds a summing amplifier or combining amp at the output. A fader (a linear potentiometer) may be used to control the level of each output signal. Other controls may include a <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> for each input/output intersection, a <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> for each input, a <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> for each output, and buttons that invert the input signal polarity. The output signals of the matrix mixer may be digital, or they may be balanced or unbalanced analog. It is possible in a matrix mixer to combine an all-analog signal path with digital control of level.|$|E
50|$|The {{program has}} a track editor mode that {{supports}} 99 layered tracks.

50|$|The harmony 720 remote {{is closely}} related to the 500 series, as it has a square shape and a layout akin to those remotes. When {{compared}} to the 525, you will find the same buttons above the LCD. The 720 has a colour LCD with six buttons/activities instead of four. The eight play/stop etc. buttons have been moved to the lower part. The <b>Mute</b> and Prev <b>buttons</b> have been moved and in their place, there are extra up and down buttons — same as on the 550. Compared to the 500 series, the glow button has been removed. These remotes do not have the Sound and Picture buttons to change key mappings, like the 550/555 remotes does. Lacking red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons, the 720 has 49 buttons. It can control up to 12 devices.|$|R
500|$|The iPad 2 {{features}} an Apple A5 package-on-package (PoP) System-on-chip (SoC), which comprises a 1GHz dual-core 32-bit Cortex-A9 CPU, 512 MB of RAM and a dual-core PowerVR SGX543MP2 GPU. Other features include {{front and rear}} cameras, a three-axis gyroscope, headset controls, proximity and ambient light sensors, microphone, magnetometer, accelerometer and a 9.7inch multi-touch screen with a maximum resolution of 1024×768 hence resulting in 132 ppi. The iPad 2 has four physical switches, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the home screen, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: wake/sleep, volume up/down, and a third switch for either screen rotation lock or <b>mute.</b> The home <b>button</b> on the iPad 2 is [...] "easier to double tap" [...] than the previous generation of the iPad. Apple reduced {{the size of the}} iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from the display, integrating new thinner glass technology for the touch screen overlay, and slightly reducing the space between the display and battery. The iPad 2's screen is thinner, lighter, and yet stronger than the original iPad's. The iPad 2 also supports screen mirroring via the digital AV adapter and through AirPlay as of iOS 5.|$|R

50|$|The {{photograph}} is of a Space Command 600, {{and was the}} remote control designed for use with their color television receivers. The Space Command 600 was introduced in 1965 and this particular design was in use {{until the end of}} the 1972 model year. The Space Command 600 remote control had an additional, distinctive feature—this remote control could also adjust color hues. By pressing the <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> on the remote, a relay would be activated at the television in which to transfer the VHF motor drive tuner circuit to the motorized hue control. This would allow the user to adjust the hue in increments by depressing the channel up or down buttons on the remote control, and restore the television to normal tuning operation when the <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> was pressed again (mute off).|$|E
50|$|On {{a digital}} mixing console, {{the process is}} usually the same, but often many of the {{adjustments}} are consolidated into {{a common set of}} knobs. Each channel will still retain an individual fader and <b>mute</b> <b>button.</b> On digital boards, it is also common for each channel to have compression and a noise gate.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} include the <b>mute</b> <b>button.</b> If mute is pressed during writing of automation, the audio track will be muted during {{playback}} of that automation.Depending on software, other parameters such as panning, sends, and plug-in controls can be automated as well. In some cases, automation can be written using a digital potentiometer instead of a fader.|$|E
50|$|The DSS80 was {{afflicted with}} a glitch {{concerning}} the main volume control. At times, {{when one of}} the buttons was held down, the volume would quickly increase to the maximum, or decrease to the minimum setting.

50|$|The 4-pin XLR {{connector}} is also {{commonly used}} on amateur radio microphones, but transferring unbalanced audio instead, {{and using the}} 4th pin (with the common ground) for a push-to-talk (PTT) circuit activated by {{a button on the}} microphone. Some broadcast radio professionals also use these microphones, instead using the PTT circuit as a cough button (a momentary <b>mute</b> <b>button)</b> so that they may cough, clear their throat, or make comments to others in the studio without the sounds being broadcast.|$|E
50|$|Although the Echo is {{intended}} to be voice-controlled at the unit, a microphone-enabled remote control similar to the one bundled with the Fire TV is available for purchase. An action button on top of the unit is provided for user setup in a new location, and the <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> allows the microphones to be turned off. The top half-inch of the unit rotates to increase or decrease the speaker volume. The Echo must be plugged in to operate since it has no internal battery.|$|E

The advertisement campaign for the Flash-matic remote control noted its ability to [...] "shut off annoying commercials while the picture remains on the screen.” The <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> was explicitly designed {{for the purpose of}} tuning out of commercials. As a result of this new feature as well as the Flash-matic's pistol shape, the Flash-matic's ad campaigns invited viewers to [...] "shoot" [...] the annoying commercials or announcers that they were tired of listening to, while leaving the image present so that the viewer would know when to turn the sound back on.|$|E
5000|$|Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame {{rated the}} SNES version four stars {{out of five}} and wrote, [...] "Vegas Stakes is an {{excellent}} example of how to do a casino game on the console format. Instead of merely aiming for the gambling crowd, the developers included several surrounding characters to inject some life into the game." [...] However, Marriott also wrote, [...] "The graphics aren't anything to shout about -- most screens are digitized still pictures. Cards might be hard for some players to read as they are a bit on the small side." [...] Marriott also criticized the game's music and sound: [...] "While each casino has its own theme song, it repeats endlessly and there's no way to turn it off. Make sure you have your thumb close to the remote control's <b>mute</b> <b>button!</b> Some voice clips would have been appreciated..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mid-to high-priced amps {{may have}} other {{switches}} (which on some amps are switched on by pulling an existing rotary knob out) that boost or cut {{some part of}} the frequency range, such as [...] "bright boost", [...] "deep boost" [...] or [...] "mid scoop" [...] switches. Amps with an onboard audio compressor or limiter, which is used to protect the speakers from sudden peaks in volume and from damage due to power amplifier clipping, may have only an on/off switch to turn on the effect (as with lower- to mid-priced amps), or they may have one or more knobs to control how much compression is applied to the bass tone (typically a ratio and threshold knob or just a single knob). Some 2000s-era amps may have an electronic tuner and a <b>mute</b> <b>button,</b> to mute the sound of tuning during a break between songs without having to change the volume settings. On some amps, vertical sliders may be provided to control a graphic equalizer, which gives the bassist control over a number of frequency bands.|$|E
50|$|The {{signal flow}} on a channel strip on an analog mixer {{generally}} flows {{from top to}} bottom. At the top is an input, which is typically a female XLR jack. Moving downward, {{the next step in}} the signal processing is typically a gain knob. A pad switch may also be provided to attenuate particularly strong signals. The next main segment of the processing is equalization. A high pass filter button is present in many cases, as well as semi or fully parametric equalization. Depending on the design of the mixer, there may also be knobs for auxiliary sends, typically used for monitors and Effects units. A pan knob can be used to send the signal to a specific side in a stereo system. A Pre-fade listen (PFL) button allows the channel to be monitored. Depressing this button can display the level on a signal meter, and will also route the audio of that channel to a headphone output. A <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> will silence the channel in both the main mix and auxiliary sends. Finally, a fader or level knob controls the volume being sent to the main mix.|$|E

5000|$|The show [...] "scores the argument" [...] by {{awarding}} {{points or}} deducting points from panelists {{at the discretion}} of the host depending on the strength or weakness of their arguments. The awarding and deduction of points has changed throughout the series. Originally, under host Max Kellerman, being muted cost a panelist five points. Later, Kellerman changed the scoring whereby [...] "good" [...] answers received two points, [...] "great" [...] answers received three, and a mute subtracted three points from a panelist's score. Shortly before Kellerman left the show, the mute was reduced to its current -1. After Tony Reali took over the show, the number of points awarded or deducted was randomized at his discretion. For example, Reali might give a single point for a weak argument, or many points for a particularly strong case backed by statistical information, or not. Points may also be taken away for self-promotion, such as bragging about a good column or a successful upset prediction. (According to Reali, [...] "Self-promotion is the mating call of the mute button!") In addition, complaints about how many points that they or another panelist received, usually results in a deduction and/or mute. Reali mainly uses the <b>mute</b> <b>button</b> when a panelist interrupts another panelist, begins to ramble, or changes his or her previous opinion on a given topic.|$|E

50|$|In 1983, Tandy {{introduced}} the Cosmic 2000 Fire Away {{and it was}} a departure from the design of the previous two games. This may have been due to Tandy licensing the game from a different company, in this case, Hanzawa, rather than through Gakken. Actronics also licensed the game from Hanzawa, marketing it under the name Twinvader III. The case was shaped to resemble an arcade game and the joystick was replaced with left and right buttons. The order of the main controls were also reversed with the fire button being on the left and the missile station (called a fortress in this version) movement controls on the right. As the name suggests, the player had to score 2,000 points in order to win. The score counter, however, had only three places so when the player reached the first 999 points, it would then reset to 000 and continue until the next 999 was reached, ending the game upon the next point. Like the previous two games, there were three modes of difficulty. A new invader was added in which, upon being hit, would split into two. Waves were introduced, called convoys, which were composed of 10 invaders. 5 invaders could be on the playing field at one time. There was a demo mode which would run the game on its own and also a <b>mute</b> <b>button.</b> Tandy's version used a blue case while Actronics used a brown case. The player gained victory after destroying 15 convoys (150 invaders) or earns 2,000 points and the player lost if all fortresses are destroyed or one of the invaders lands. Every 1,000 points earned the player a bonus fortress. The game used four C batteries or could be played using an AC adapter. Retail price was $39.95.|$|E
