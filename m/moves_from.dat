5|$|Musical notes {{return in}} Banjo-Tooie, but are now used {{to learn new}} <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> Bottles' brother, the drill {{sergeant}} Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role from the first game. All of Banjo and Kazooie's <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> the first game are immediately accessible in Banjo-Tooie, and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, {{and the ability to}} play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.|$|E

5|$|In the {{transfer}} window, Arsenal sold several fringe players, notably Nelson Vivas to Internazionale and Sylvinho to Celta Vigo; goalkeeper John Lukic was released following {{his decision to}} retire. Goalkeeper Richard Wright was signed as an earmarked understudy to David Seaman, while midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst and striker Francis Jeffers were purchased in big money <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> Rangers and Everton respectively. Perhaps the marked signing for Arsenal was the acquisition of defender Sol Campbell, who moved from local rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a free transfer.|$|E
5|$|The USS Slater (DE-766), {{which is}} the only {{destroyer}} escort still afloat in the United States, sits at Steamboat Square near the foot of Madison Avenue. The ship is open from April to November to the public. The destroyer closes to the public from December to March and <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> the Steamboat Square to the port's Rensselaer side. In August 2008 part of the Japanese film Orion in Midsummer (scheduled for release in spring 2009) was filmed on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{jet stream}} <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> West to East {{bringing}} changes of weather. Meteorologists now {{understand that the}} path of jet streams affects cyclonic storm systems at lower levels in the atmosphere, and so knowledge of their course has become {{an important part of}} weather forecasting. For example, in 2007 and 2012, Britain experienced severe flooding {{as a result of the}} polar jet staying south for the summer.|$|E

5|$|The {{rise in the}} {{popularity}} of the bat'leth has {{led to the formation of}} martial arts teams aiming to develop a martial art distinct from the one Curry initially developed.

Unknown to her, this {{decision}} is used by Raden Koesoema as proof of {{her that she was}} not trustworthy. Winanta falls into despair, but eventually marries Fatimah.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned {{to one or two}} breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon will inherit the species of its mother, and <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E

5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between the blood in the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|During Copeland's training, {{he trained}} one weekday and all weekend. The school's {{practice}} ring was a 12-by-14-foot boxing ring with a harder mat {{than that of}} a typical wrestling ring. The ceiling above it was low, with exposed pipes, preventing top-rope <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> being performed. Copeland later credited this environment with forcing him to drill and improve his technical mat-based wrestling. His classmates included Johnny Swinger, Joe E. Legend, and Rob Etcheverria (who later became notable for training wrestlers such as Gail Kim, Angelina Love, and Taylor Wilde).|$|E
5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.|$|E

5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common starlings include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the rook and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Peggy Carter must {{balance the}} routine office work she does for the Strategic Scientific Reserve while {{secretly}} assisting Howard Stark, who finds himself framed for supplying deadly weapons to {{enemies of the}} United States. Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, to find those responsible and dispose of the weapons. Carter eventually <b>moves</b> <b>from</b> New York City to Los Angeles {{to deal with the}} threats of the new atomic age in the wake of World War II, gaining new friends, a new home and potential new love.|$|E
5|$|New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While {{it is seen}} in 2D, most of the {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous Mario games, Mario (or Luigi) can collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. <b>Moves</b> <b>from</b> 3D games featuring Mario reappear in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.|$|E
