40|$|In a 15 -week animal-house experiment, 24 steers {{were offered}} {{one of six}} diets based on {{molasses}} and ad libitum barley straw. Three levels of dietary nitrogen (N) and three levels of dietary phosphorus (P), in factorial combination, were formulated {{by the addition of}} urea, formaldehyde-treated wheat gluten and <b>monosodium</b> <b>orthophosphate.</b> Food intake, liveweight gain, plasma metabolites and P kinetics were measured under dietary regimens similar to those experienced by cattle grazing Australia 2 ̆ 7 s northern semi-arid rangelands. The adverse effect of the low dietary N on both liveweight change and feed intake was greater and more immediate than that of the dietary P deficiency. The reduction in feed intake due to the P deficiency approached that caused by the N deficiency after 10 weeks. Under conditions of adequate dietary N, there was a trend for the effects of P deficiency on liveweight gain to be exacerbated. Dietary N and P deficiency reduced the concentrations of plasma urea-N and inorganic P respectively. Dietary N deficiency had no effect on cortical rib bone thickness but P deficiency markedly decreased bone thickness. Faecal endogenous loss of P and P absorption efficiency ranged from 9 to 21 mg/kg LW and 0 · 63 to 0 · 82 respectively for P intakes from 6 to 41 mg/kg LW. Faecal endogenous losses were closely related to dry matter intake and plasma inorganic P together. Dietary N deficiency affected the efficiency of absorption of P. The results of this experiment indicate that cattle consuming diets containing low levels of N and P require supplementary N and P in combination to avoid severe depletion since an increase in N intake alone exacerbated the P deficiency. The results are also discussed in relation to the published findings regarding P metabolism and the implications for the calculation of P requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{phosphorus}} supplements on the metabolism of phosphorus in the gastrointestinal tract of sheep were examined. One group of sheep was fed {{on a low}} phosphorus (P-L) diet and three other groups on diets supplemented with <b>monosodium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> (P-MSOP), meat and bone meal (P-MBM) or bran (P-ORG). The total phosphorus (TP), ultrafilterable phosphorus (UP) and nucleic acid phosphorus (NP) in the digesta were measured. There was a large net secretion of phosphorus into the rumen and {{the first quarter of}} the small intestine, and net absorption from the remainder of the small intestine of all sheep. The relative concentration of phosphorus in the omasum suggested considerable omasal secretion and a subsequent abomasal absorption of phosphorus, but this was considered to be largely an artefact. There were no consistent differences between diets in the net secretion and absorption of TP at sites along the gastrointestinal tract. Sheep fed on the P-L diet secreted more phosphorus per unit of phosphorus intake than sheep on the other diets. Most UP was present in the abomasum and cranial small intestine where the pH was lowest. The concentration of UP fell precipitously in the small intestine, which suggested that this was the major form of phosphorus absorbed and that there was a high degree of complex formation at the higher pH. The concentration of NP was relatively constant, and the lowest NP/TP ratios were found in the cranial small intestine. NP formed in the rumen was mainly degraded in the cranial small intestine. NP represented half the TP in the colon of sheep fed on diet P-L. The results indicate that the form of phosphorus supplement did not influence phosphorus metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inorganic}} phosphorus (Pi) supplied by abomasal infusion on phosphorus metabolism {{were tested in}} three cows of the Swedish red and white breed in a study with a 3 × 3 Latin square design. <b>Monosodium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> dihydrate (NaH 2 PO 4. 2 H 2 O) solution with three different levels of P (0, 14. 4 and 28. 8 g/d) was infused in the abomasum for four days in each experimental period. Blood, rumen liquid, feces and urine samples were collected. Co-EDTA {{was used as a}} marker for the estimation of rumen liquid phase volume and rumen fluid outflow rate. Pi absorption tended to increase as P supply increased. This was accompanied by a tendency for the reduction of Pi absorption efficiency suggesting mechanisms in the small intestine regulating Pi absorption. It appeared that the fractional absorption rate of Pi was negatively related to the increasing amount of P supply. In addition, P infusion resulted in increased salivary Pi concentration. It was suggested that salivary glands could have increased Pi secretion in response to increased Pi flux in plasma. This was evidenced from the unchanged plasma Pi concentration in relation to increased Pi absorption. Urinary Pi excretion played a negligible role in P balance. It was concluded that P homeostasis was controlled within gut through regulation of Pi uptake, salivary Pi secretion and fecal Pi excretion...|$|R
