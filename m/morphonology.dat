50|$|Morphophonology (also morphophonemics or <b>morphonology)</b> is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that studies the interaction between morphological and phonological or phonetic processes. Its chief focus is the sound changes {{that take place in}} morphemes (minimal meaningful units) when they combine to form words.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{contributions}} in morphology, Dressler established, together with Wurzel and Panagl, a subtheory of 'Natural Morphology' {{based on the}} establishment of more or less [...] "natural" [...] operations on universal, typological, or language-specific levels, respectively. In a monograph on <b>morphonology,</b> he proved <b>morphonology</b> to be a subtype of morphology, contrary to contemporary claims in generative phonology of its being treated as a phonological phenomenon. Dressler proposed a model of morphological operations between lexical and grammatical functions, thereby establishing a gradual scale between derivational and inflectional processes. His theory explains why derivational rules apply before inflectional rules, and why 'unprototypical' derivation such as diminutive and 'unprototypical' inflections such as plural formation sometimes get mixed in the middle, cf. German [...] "Kind-er-chen" [...] (child-PL-DIM) -- where derivation occurs after inflection.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the same}} time, Dressler worked on Breton {{language}} from a phonological, text linguistic and sociolinguistic perspective ('language death'). At that time morphology, phonology and <b>morphonology</b> were also {{of interest to}} him. Since 1972, what was later called 'sociophonology' has been developed, first as 'fast speech rules', later in a refined model on 'casual speech' and competing phonological processes and rules.|$|E
50|$|From 1973 onwards, {{in search}} of 'external evidence' for {{linguistic}} theoretical assumptions (as opposed to generative models, but as an important science-theoretical background for theoretical arguments), Dressler {{became interested in the}} disturbed speech of aphasia. Similarly, he started to work with psychologists on a model of psychological '(de)activation' for phonological processes and, with his background in IE studies, he compared historical evidence with his phonological theory, making conclusions about rules, processes and the boundaries of phonological theory towards <b>morpho(no)logy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} aspect of Rotuman <b>morphonology</b> is what will be hereafter called the [...] "incomplete" [...] and [...] "complete" [...] phases although they have also {{been referred to as}} [...] "long" [...] and [...] "short" [...] forms, [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary" [...] forms, [...] "absolute" [...] and [...] "construct" [...] cases, and [...] "proper & original" [...] and [...] "altered or construct" [...] forms. [...] The complete phase applies to semantically definite or specific terms. Otherwise, in normal conversation (that is, excluding song, poetry, and chant), the incomplete phase applies to all but the last morpheme of a word and all but the last word of a phrase. [...] This can lead to syllable-final consonants in a language that has an underlying all-open syllable system.|$|E

Focusing on morphonotactics in English (5. 1.), German (5. 2.), Italian (5. 3.) and Polish (5. 4.), we establish a gradient continuum between morphonotactics and phonotactics and investigate the impact of morphological and phonological typology on cross-linguistic differences in the number and nature of morphonotactic clusters. 1...|$|E

The justification for such an approach is discussed with reference to examples from a variety of languages and the approach is compared to Koskenniemi's two-level account of <b>morphonology.</b> Keywords: morphology, phonology, syllables. 1 Introduction The field of computational morphology was revolutionized by the work of Kimmo Koskenniemi (1983, 1984), whose two-level model of <b>morphonology</b> has been used for the description of several languages, including English, French, Finnish and Japanese. It is attractive computationally, being based on finite state transducers. However, we shall argue that, although FSTs are good at mapping strings of symbols onto strings of symbols, morphological representation is tree-like rather than string-like. Work on computational morphology can roughly be divided into Koskenniemi-type models, which give an account of phonological (or orthogra [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{we discuss}} diachronic and variationist aspects of morphonotactics, a new research 5 eld {{that we have}} tried to establish over the last years (cf.

Morphonotactics is the area of interaction between morphotactics and phonotactics and represents a sub 5 eld of <b>morphonology,</b> which in turn is the area of interaction between morphology and phonology (cf. Dressler 1985, 1996). We claim that in this interaction morphotactics typically creates phonotactically marked structures which occur never or only exceptionally in monomorphemic words. In our contribution we deal with typical diachronic changes. Our claim about the markedness of morphonotactic sequences is tested mainly against data from Polish, Lithuanian and other Balto-Slavic languages. Our theoretical basi...|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{a complex}} of Russian lexical and onomastic units: dialect lexemes астрадúм, востроды́мка, острадúм, острогúн, остроды́м which carry {{the meaning of a}} negative characterization of a person (‘a cruel person’, ‘somebody who causes harm’, ‘an arrogant person’, ‘a thief’ etc.); anthroponyms: the nickname Остро- дым, the surnames Астрадимов, Астрадымов, Востродымов, Острадымов, Остродымов; the Perm set expression поймать остродыма ‘to finish harvesting a field’. Considering materials in historical derivation, <b>morphonology</b> and ethnolinguistics, the author performs a group reconstruction of these units.

40|$|Phonotactics determines phonological {{conditions}} on the co-occurrence of sounds within words or syllables. Morphonotactics is a subcomponent of <b>morphonology</b> concerned with the co-occurrence of sounds at morphological boundaries. Due to the semiotic priority of morphology over phonology, morphonotactics allows us to explain the motivation for those consonant clusters that phonotactics has failed to account for. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the influence of universal phonotactic and morphonotactic preferences on the acquisition of consonant clusters in the process of second language acquisition. We hypothesize that phonotactically unmarked lexical clusters will be easier to learn and less susceptible to modifications than phonotactically marked ones. Phonotactic markedness will be measured according to the Net Auditory Distance Principle. As for the morphonotactic clusters, it is assumed that in spite of their phonotactically dispreferred status, second language learners will put some effort into their acquisition. The subjects in the study are Korean and Chinese learners of Polish...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to account for the place and the {{properties}} of Vocatives in the linguistic system. A general sketch of the nature of Vocatives is first presented, in which it is suggested that the exclusion of Vocatives from the Case category is not justified. Then Vocatives are investigated, with special attention on the <b>morphonology</b> of Romance data. It is shown that Vocatives do not obey any prosodic minimality restriction; from this point of view, Vocatives pattern alongside with monosyllabic imperatives discussed in Floricic & Molinu (2009). Peripherality, it is suggested, is thus one of the most important features of Vocatives: Vocatives will be argued to be peripheral in the case system, a feature which is reflected as well in their exceptional phonological maked-up. Non-solidarity will thus be claimed to characterize Vocatives as a category, hence the possibility of its appearance or disappearance in such or such a language, regardless of the existence of the other case...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} a hybrid system for morphological analysis and synthesis. This system {{consists of two}} parts. The treatment of <b>morphonology</b> and non-concatenative morphology {{is based on the}} two-level approach proposed by Koskenniemi (1983). For the concatenative part of morphosyntax (i. e. affixation) a grammar based on feature-unification is made use of. Both parts rely on a morph lexicon. Combinations of two-level morphology with feature-based morphosyntactic grammars have already been proposed by several authors (c. f. Bear 1988 a, Carson 1988, Görz & Paulus 1988, Schiller & Steffens 1989) to overcome the shortcomings of the continuation-classes originally proposed by Koskenniemi (1983) and Karttunen (1983) for the description of morphosyntax. But up to now no linguistically satisfying solution has been proposed for the treatment of non-concatenative morphology in such a framework. In this paper I describe an extension to the model which will allow for the description of such phenomena. Namely it is proposed to restrict the applicability of two-level rules by providing them with filters in the form of feature structures. It is demonstrated how a well-known problem of German morphology, so-called "Umlautung", can be described in this approach in a linguistically motivated and efficient way...|$|E
40|$|The {{framework}} of the paper is Natural Syntax initiated by Janez Orešnik in thetradition of (morphological) naturalness as established by Wolfgang U. Dressler and Willi Mayerthaler. The basic tenets of Natural Syntax are described {{at the beginning of}} the paper. Natural Syntax is here applied to aspects of Old Indian synchronic verbal <b>morphonology</b> and verbal morphosyntax: (1) Causative -áya- verbs in Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. The root vowel a is short in closed syllables and long in open syllables. (2) Rig Veda and Atharva Veda contain 31 intransitive and 175 transitive -áya- verbs. (3) Rig Veda and Atharva Veda do not contain any causative verbs to the basic transitive verbs. (4) Post-Vedic double transitive verbs (the early construction) contain an obligatory accusative corresponding to the subject of the base verb, and an optional accusative corresponding to the object of the base verb. (5) Post-Vedic double transitive verbs (the late construction) contain an obligatory instrumental corresponding to the subject of the base verb, and an accusative corresponding to the object of the base verb. (6) The accusative mentioned in (5) is not obligatory. The data have been taken from Jamison (1983), a monograph about Old Indian -áya- verbs...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this book is to give a {{description}} of the Cholón language as represented in the Arte de la Lengua Cholona (ALC), a colonial grammar written in 1748 by a Franciscan friar, named Pedro de la Mata. The ALC is kept in the British Library in London. Nowadays, the Cholón language is probably extinct. It was spoken in North Peru in the valley of the Huallaga river. Cholón formed a small language family together with the neighbouring language Híbito. The description of eighteenth-century Cholón, the linguistic part of the book, is preceded by a description of secondary sources and of theories about genetic relations (chapter 1), by an ethnohistorical sketch (chapter 2), and by an analysis of the manuscript (chapter 3). The linguistic part starts with an analysis of the orthography used in the ALC and of the observations about certain sounds, in order to reconstruct a tentative sound system (chapter 4). Chapter 5 deals with <b>morphonology.</b> In this chapter attention is paid to syllable structure, to phenomena like vowel suppression and harmonization, and to stem-initial consonant changes. Nominal and verbal morphosyntax are discussed in chapters 6 and 7, respectively. Cholón is an agglutinative language. Besides nouns and verbs, which are the most important word categories, Cholón has a small class of adverbs (chapter 8) and interjections (chapter 9). In chapter 10 discourse markers, such as question and exclamation markers, are treated. Chapter 11 is dedicated to the negation. In chapter 12, a survey of the different subordinate clauses is given. The linguistic part ends with a lexicon. Promotores: W. F. H. Adelaar, P. C. Muysken. With summary in Dutch. Printed copies can be ordered through www. lotpublications. n...|$|E
