50|$|Lincoln Industrial Corporation (Lincoln) is a {{manufacturer}} of automated lubrication systems, <b>manual</b> <b>lubrication</b> equipment and industrial pumping systems, and subsidiary of Svenska Kullagerfabriken AB (SKF). Founded in 1910, {{the company has been}} responsible for many of the inventions that established modern lubrication practices in automotive maintenance and industry.|$|E
50|$|Since green gas' analysis, other {{manufacturers}} have {{also begun to}} produce adapters that attach to propane tanks available at many retail stores. These sometimes include reservoirs to store lubricant (usually silicone oil). The propane option has become popular because the solution is cheaper and more widely available than Green Gas. Although propane alone does not have lubrication in the propellant, proponents of using propane instead of green gas state {{that this can be}} remedied by <b>manual</b> <b>lubrication</b> of internal parts before use of the gun.|$|E
40|$|Lubrication is {{the process}} or {{technique}} employed to reduce the wear of one or both surface in close proximity. Most of the bear lubrication fail due to the {{too much or too}} less grease injected using <b>manual</b> <b>lubrication.</b> So, to replace the <b>manual</b> <b>lubrication</b> discrete wiring employed in lubrication system in heavy machines using PLC. The PLCâ€™s can be used to overcome the shortcomings PLC is mainly used to reduce the labor cost, power consumption, complication in circuits. ...|$|E
50|$|CLP is {{a highly}} penetrating, mobile liquid and is {{intended}} for field application to satisfy the complete need of cleaning, lubricating, and short term preservation of military weapons. CLP facilitates the effective removal of firing residues, gums, and other contaminants from weapon components while providing lubrication and short term preservation for reliable weapons operation. CLP {{may be used in}} lieu of MIL-PRF-372, MIL-PRF-3150,MIL-PRF-14107, and MIL-L-46000 where authorized by the applicable weapons <b>manual</b> or <b>lubrication</b> order.|$|R

50|$|Other minor {{differences}} included {{fuel gauge}} placement, with the UK Phantom I's at the tank but some US models having {{one on the}} dash, and <b>manual</b> central <b>lubrication</b> systems. The UK Phantom employed Enots nipples, some {{times as many as}} 50, which required attachment of a special Enots oil pressure gun and needed time-consuming service at 500, 1000 and 2000 mile intervals; the US model used a centralized Bijur system which lubricated all the oiling points with a stroke of a single pump.|$|R
40|$|The task {{of every}} well-organized {{function}} in the maintenance of lubrication, which is to achieve lower costs to workers in the maintenance and lubricants and spare parts. <b>Manual</b> <b>lubrication</b> system components tribomechanical persisted, despite the great efforts and poor ergonomic conditions for acting of lubrication, {{but in recent years}} is much more marked appreciable progress of improving lubrication by introducing of automatic lubrication systems in almost all industries throughout the world. Inadequate lubrication are now the most common reasons for early termination tribomechanical components, which can certainly cause further damage to the machines themselves. Much of the damage can be avoided by choosing an appropriate method of automatic lubrication systems, choosing the appropriate dosage and method of lubricants for specific conditions of exploitation. The aim {{of this study was to}} indicate the economic adequacy of applying automatic lubrication system tribomechanical components. Key words: the economic adequacy, the automatic lubrication, tribology, the lubricant 1...|$|E
