40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} of the laminar burning velocity are mostly limited in pressure and temperature and can be compromised by the effects of flame stretch and instabilities. Computationally, these effects can be avoided by calculating one-dimensional, planar adiabatic flames using chemical oxidation mechanisms. Chemical kinetic models are often large, complex and {{take a lot of}} computation time, and few models exist for multi-component fuels. The aim of the present study is to investigate if simple <b>mixing</b> <b>rules</b> are able to predict the laminar burning velocity of fuel blends with a good accuracy. An overview of different <b>mixing</b> <b>rules</b> to predict the laminar burning is given and these <b>mixing</b> <b>rules</b> are tested for blends of hydrocarbons and ethanol. Experimental data of ethanol/n-heptane and ethanol/n-heptane/iso-octane mixtures and modeling data of an ethanol/n-heptane blend and blends of ethanol and a toluene reference fuel are used to test the different <b>mixing</b> <b>rules.</b> Effects of higher temperature and pressure on the performance of the <b>mixing</b> <b>rules</b> are investigated. It was found that simple <b>mixing</b> <b>rules</b> that consider only the change in composition are accurate enough to predict the laminar burning velocity of ethanol/hydrocarbon blends. For the blends used in this study, a Le Chatelier's rule based on energy fractions is preferable because of the similar accuracy in comparison to other <b>mixing</b> <b>rules</b> while being more simple to use...|$|R

In this article, the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) including both the classical van der Waals <b>mixing</b> <b>rule</b> and the Wong-Sandler <b>mixing</b> <b>rule</b> is utilized to correlate the Gas-Liquid Equilibrium (GLE) data from available open published literature and to analyze the solubility of nitrogen in halon alternatives such as HFC 227 ea (C 3 HF 7), CF 3 I, FC 218 (C 3 F 8), and HFC 125 (C 2 HF 5) with Halon 1301 (CF 3 Br) as a reference.
