2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{although}} there is a large market for vaginal microbicides in developing nations, rectal microbicides are stigmatized and less researched.

40|$|The CAPRISA 004 {{study in}} South Africa has {{accelerated}} {{the development of}} vaginal and rectal <b>microbicides</b> containing antiretrovirals that target specific enzymes in the reproduction cycle of HIV, especially reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTI). In this review we discuss the potential relevance of HIV- 1 RTIs as <b>microbicides,</b> focusing in the nucleotide RTI tenofovir and six classes of nonnucleoside RTIs (including dapivirine, UC 781, urea and thiourea PETTs, DABOs and a pyrimidinedione). Although tenofovir and dapivirine appear to be most advanced in clinical trials as potential <b>microbicides,</b> several issues remain unresolved, e. g., the importance of nonhuman primates as a "gatekeeper" for clinical trials, the emergence and spread of drug-resistant mutants, the combination of <b>microbicides</b> that target different phases of viral reproduction and the accessibility to <b>microbicides</b> in low-income countries. Thus, here we discuss the latest research on RTI as <b>microbicides</b> {{in the light of}} the continuing spread of the HIV pandemic from the point of view of medicinal chemistry, virological, and pharmaceutical studies...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn 2007, nearly 7000 {{new cases}} of HIV {{infection}} occurred each day. There is a constant increase {{in the proportion of}} women newly infected with HIV in the global population; this increase is particularly high in some areas of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa. <b>Microbicides</b> are products that are being developed to empower women against HIV. First- and second-generation <b>microbicides</b> are broad-spectrum products that include surface active agents, vaginal defense enhancers, and blocking agents. Third-generation <b>microbicides</b> are HIV-specific and include replication and entry inhibitors formulated as gels or as vaginal rings. However, there is a concern that antiretroviral-based <b>microbicides</b> could lead to drug resistance if they are used by HIV-positive women who are unaware of their HIV status. To reach the highest number of women possible, <b>microbicides</b> should be available over-the-counter, which might not be the case with antiretroviral-based formulations. In contrast, non-antiretroviral-based <b>microbicides</b> will have the advantage of being initiated and controlled by women themselves and they will not jeopardize the use of life-saving drugs...|$|R

5000|$|The International Rectal <b>Microbicide</b> Advocates {{was formed}} in 2005 through a {{collaboration}} between the Canadian AIDS Society, the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, and the Community HIV/AIDS Mobilization Project (which disbanded in 2011). [...] No other advocacy group existed - or currently exists - whose focus is on rectal <b>microbicide</b> research and development.|$|E
40|$|Vaginal <b>microbicides,</b> {{designed}} to prevent HIV infection in women, {{are one of the}} most promising biomedical interventions. Clinical trials of second-generation <b>microbicides</b> have begun; if shown to be effective, they could be licensed within 5 – 10 years. Because these <b>microbicides</b> contain antiretrovirals (ARVs), they could be highly effective. However, there is concern that, if used by HIV-positive women, ARV resistance may evolve. By analyzing a mathematical model, we find that adherence could have both beneficial and detrimental effects on trial outcomes. Most importantly, we show that planned trial designs could mask resistance risks and therefore enable high-risk <b>microbicides</b> to pass clinical testing. We then parameterize a transmission model using epidemiological, clinical, and behavioral data to predict the consequences of wide-scale usage of high-risk <b>microbicides</b> in a heterosexual population. Surprisingly, we show that reducing a participant's risk of resistance during a trial could lead to unexpectedly high rates of resistance afterward when <b>microbicides</b> are used in public health interventions. We also find that, paradoxically, although <b>microbicides</b> will be used by women to protect themselves against infection, they could provide greater benefit to men. More infections in men than in women will be prevented if there is a high probability that ARVs are systemically absorbed, <b>microbicides</b> are less than ∼ 50 % effective, and/or adherence is less than ∼ 60 %. Men will always benefit more than women in terms of infections prevented per resistant case; but this advantage decreases as the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains increases. Interventions that use ARV-based <b>microbicides</b> could have surprising consequences...|$|R
40|$|Viruses are {{important}} human pathogens causing substantial mortality and morbidity {{as well as}} economic damage. The lack of vaccination strategy and viral resistance to antiviral chemotherapy reemphasize the need for <b>microbicides</b> to eliminate or control viral outbreak. The activity and interactions of <b>microbicides</b> with the viral particle has been far less studied than their effects on bacteria. In addition, differences in virus size and structure as well as the diversity of efficacy test protocols used add to the fragmentation of information and the general lack of understanding of virucides. This chapter is focusing on the use of <b>microbicides</b> to destroy or control the transmission of viruses. The test methodologies are reviewed together with the general virucidal efficacy of different <b>microbicides.</b> Finally, the mechanisms of virucidal action of a number of <b>microbicides</b> are described as well as virus survival to microbicidal exposure...|$|R
50|$|Substantial {{numbers of}} {{men who have sex}} with men in {{developed}} countries use lubricants containing nonoxynol-9. This suggests that they might be receptive to the concept of using topical rectal <b>microbicides</b> if such products were to become commercially available. However, the development of rectal <b>microbicides</b> is not as advanced as that of vaginal <b>microbicides.</b> One reason for this is that the rectum has a thinner epithelium, greater surface area and lower degree of elasticity than that of the vagina. Due to these factors, a microbicidal preparation that is effective when applied vaginally might have a different degree of effectiveness when applied rectally. In January 2010, the National Institutes of Health awarded two grants totaling $17.5 million to the University of Pittsburgh to fund research into rectal <b>microbicides.</b> That research will include investigations into product acceptability of rectal <b>microbicides</b> with homosexual men ages 18 to 30 years old.|$|R

40|$|Defensins {{are highly}} {{abundant}} antimicrobial peptides {{in the female}} genital mucosa. We have previously shown that human defensins 5 and 6 (HD 5 and HD 6), produced by cervicovaginal epithelial cells, significantly enhance HIV infectivity in vitro. Candidate polyanion <b>microbicides,</b> including PRO 2000, cellulose sulfate and carrageenan, failed to protect women against HIV infection in large-scale clinical trials, but the molecular basis of ineffectiveness was not clear. We hypothesized that mucosal host factors such as HD 5 an HD 6 may alter the activity of polyanion <b>microbicides</b> against HIV. Our results demonstrated that HD 5 and HD 6 but not their linear analogs antagonized the anti-HIV activity of PRO 2000, cellulose sulfate and carrageenan in vitro. Polyanion <b>microbicides</b> also reduced the HIV-enhancing effect of these defensins. We conclude that mucosal host factors could negatively impact the efficacy of topical <b>microbicides</b> against HIV, {{and their impact on}} the activity of candidate <b>microbicides</b> needs to be considered during the preclinical evaluation...|$|R
50|$|Detergent and {{surfactant}} <b>microbicides</b> such as nonoxynol-9, {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} and Savvy (1.0% C31G), act by {{disrupting the}} viral envelope, capsid or lipid membrane of microorganisms. Since detergent <b>microbicides</b> also kill host cells and impair the barrier function of healthy mucosal surfaces, they are less desirable than other agents. Additionally, clinical trials have not demonstrated these agents to be effective at preventing HIV transmission. Consequently, laboratory and clinical trials testing this class of products as <b>microbicides</b> have largely been discontinued.|$|R
