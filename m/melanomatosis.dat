40|$|Melanomas {{are one of}} {{the most}} common skin tumors in horses. 1, 2 Several therapies for the {{treatment}} of <b>melanomatosis</b> exist, including the administration of the H 2 receptor antagonist Cimetidine. Cimetidine has been found to slow down growth of the primary tumor and preventing disease progression, by acting as an immunomodulator. 3, 4 The aim of this study was to try to confirm the positive effects of cimetidine on melanomas in a group of 41 grey horses. The 41 Horses of the 63 horses on the Heilan International Equestrian club with different degrees of <b>melanomatosis</b> were given Cimetidine 2, 5 mg/kg/TD for three months. Every 30 days the location, number and size of the melanomas were registered. Differences in number of melanomas after three months were tested using descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon signed test. In this population of horses 65 % had melanomas. After the three months of cimetidine administration a significant growth in number of melanomas was found comparing the first and the last measurement. In this study the positive effects of cimetidine on melanomas cannot be confirmed. In contrast, we found an actual growth in number of melanomas after three months of cimetidine administration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a clinically controlled {{study on the}} effectiveness of cimetidine an H 2 receptor antagonist for the treatment of melanoma in grey horses. Fifteen grey horses (age range 18 to 27 years) with dermal <b>melanomatosis</b> were divided in three groups. Group A served as the control group; groups B and C received cimetidine at two different protocols for 60 days (3. 5 mg/kg PO, BID and 7. 5 mg/kg PO, SID). The number and size of the masses was monitored before, during and after therapy. No differences were found between groups regarding number and size of melanomas before and after treatments (p > 0. 05). Only in one horse it was possible to notice a slight size reduction of some of the masses however this may have been due to the anti-inflammatory effect of cimetidine as already demonstrated previously. It was concluded that cimetidine is not effective in treating dermal <b>melanomatosis</b> of grey horses. Differences of effectiveness in other studies could possibly be due to the variants of melanomas treated or to different treatment protocols. Further controlled studies are necessary to evaluate cimetidine effectiveness on different type of melanomas and other neoplasias arising from tissues other than skin. Also the mechanism of action of cimetidine on horse melanoma requires further investigation...|$|E
30|$|Primary {{melanoma}} of {{the central}} nervous system is a rare tumour that accounts for approximately 10  % cases of CNS melanoma, the rest being metastases to the CNS from other primary sites [11]. Primary CNS melanoma arises directly from melanocytes within the leptomeninges, derived from the neural crest during early embryonic development [12, 13]. Primary melanoma of the CNS may present with either localised intra-/extraaxial mass lesions or diffuse meningeal <b>melanomatosis.</b> The discrete mass lesions can be extraaxial, intracerebral, intraventricular or intramedullary in locations [11, 14]. Primary intraventricular malignant melanoma arises from arrested melanocytic cells in the choroid plexus.|$|E

40|$|Effectiveness of {{cimetidine}} medication on melanomas in 40 grey horses. Nienke M. Helle 1, Coby Lettinga 1, Na Liu 2, Chao Sha 2, Joop B. A. Loomans 1, 2 1. 	Fac. Veterinary Medicine, Departement Equine Health Sciences, Utrecht University, The Netherlands 2. 	Heilan International Equestrian Club, Xin qiao, Jiangsu, China J. B. A. Loomans@uu. nl Introduction The melanoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} common cutaneous tumors in horses and consists mainly of melanocytes. 1, 3, 4 Common localizations are the perineal and perianal region, the external genitalia and the ventral surface of the tail. 2. Several therapies for the treatment of <b>melanomatosis</b> exist, including the administration of the H 2 receptor antagonist Cimetidine. Cimetidine has been found to slow down growth of the primary tumor and preventing disease progression, by acting as an immunomodulator. 3, 5 The aim of this study was to try to confirm the positive effects of cimetidine on melanomas in a group of 40 grey horses. Materials and Methods Forty grey horses with ages ranging between 5 and 19 years on the Heilan International Equestrian Club with different degrees of <b>melanomatosis</b> were given Cimetidine (2, 5 mg/kg/TD) during 90 days in a watery solution in their forage. Every 30 days the size, the localization and the amount of the melanomas of each horse were registered. Differences in number of melanomas after three months were tested using descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon signed test. The total surface area was used as the standard for size and was calculated by multiplying the narrowest and broadest point of the melanomas and adding these numbers to give one measurement value per horse per time period. Statistical significance of the total surface area was tested using the linear mixed model method. Results In this population of horses 65 % had melanomas. After the three months of cimetidine administration a significant growth in number of melanomas was found comparing the first and the last measurement. See figure 1. The total surface area of the melanomas of each horse of the fourth measurement was not significantly different from the total surface area of each horse at the first measurement. Conclusions In this study the positive effects of cimetidine on melanomas cannot be confirmed. In contrast, we found an actual growth in number of melanomas after three months of cimetidine administration and did not lead to a reduction of the total melanoma surface area. References 1.

40|$|Abstract. An 11 -year-old, Black and Tan Coonhound dog was {{presented}} {{with a history of}} lameness of the right hind leg for 2 months, osteolysis in the right distal femur, a pulmonary mass, and a presumptive diagnosis of osteosarcoma. By cytologic examination, neoplastic melanocytes were noted from fine needle aspirates of the femoral and pulmonary masses. Postmortem examination revealed a disseminated melanoma involving the right femoral bone marrow, lung, multiple lymph nodes, and adrenal gland, with diffuse infiltration of the leptomeninges of the brain and spinal cord. This case report describes a unique presentation of canine melanoma, which in some ways resembles leptomeningeal <b>melanomatosis,</b> a rare human melanoma variant. Key words: Bone marrow metastasis; dogs; leptomeningeal melanomatosis; melanoma. Melanomas account for 7 % of all malignant canine tumors. 15 Most canine melanomas involve the oral cavity, mucocutaneous junctions, nailbed, and eye.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} a cohort of patients with leptomeningeal <b>melanomatosis</b> (LM) and to determine prognostic factors for outcomes in these patients. The primary hypothesis was that more exten-sive burden of CNS metastasis at the time of diagnosis of LM (as evidenced by imaging of the CNS parenchyma and meninges and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] cytology status [positive versus negative]) correlates with poorer outcomes. The records of all patients with LM treated at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1944 and 2002 were reviewed. Information on clinical course and out-comes was gathered. Univariate and multivariate analy-ses were performed on 110 patients using Cox propor-tional hazards regression analysis to examine the effects of possible predictive factors on survival. The overall median survival from LM diagnosis was 10 weeks, with a 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 8 – 14 weeks. Eighty-six (78. 2 %) patients had cutaneous primary lesions, and 23 (20. 9 %) had melanoma of unknown primary site. The primary hypothesis was not proven. Neither the presence of parenchymal CNS metastases, nor greater imaging evidence of LM, nor positive CSF cytology at diagnosis correlated with survival outcomes. Univariate analyses revealed possible predictors of longer survival, includ-ing the presence of supratentorial or spinal LM on imag-ing at diagnosis versus its absence and any treatment of LM, whereas elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase at the time of LM diagnosis predicted shorter survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of a primary melanoma lesion originating on the trunk predicted Prognostic factors and outcomes in patients with leptomeningeal melanomatosi...|$|E
40|$|The {{literary}} {{review is}} divided into two main parts, the first part is dealing with the coloring of horses and their genetic base and the second part is dealing with melanoma formations of horses and their division. In the chapter about several color types of horses there is a description of forming basic color types which is done by three locuses: COLOR, EXTENSION and AGOUTI. Locus COLOR (CREAM) controls whether or not to create pigment. EXTENSION locus controls about the type of pigment and AGOUTI locus controls the distribution of pigment. The next subsection gives a breakdown of the white color in horses. Greying proces is related with locus GREY where there is a loss of pigment and the coat itself. This process and mutation is commonly connected with dermal melanoma. Non-pigmented spots called vtiligos are connected with the greying process, which is more intense with increasing age. Vtiligios are commonly found in grey horses, at the same locations as dermal melanoma. The places are perianal area under the tail, around the vulva, lips, eyes and around the penis. Melanoma formations are divided according to whether they occur in Grey horses or other colored horses and whether they have a benign or malignant potential. A further breakdown of melanomas at grey horses is whether it is a separate, smaller segments or large, associated lesions, when this condition is called dermal <b>melanomatosis.</b> At the end of the thesis there is a description of the treatment options for melanoma. The most effective appears to be a surgical removal of smaller formations. There were studies which have examined the anticancer action of the drug cimetidine but the results are not yet sufficiently conclusive. As preventing the occurrence of melanoma in grey horses it is appropriate to implement the necessary measures and individuals who are concerned should not be included in the next breeding...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} three decades dental {{implants}} have become increasingly used in partially edentulous periodontally compromised patients. The type of bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus is influenced by the periodontal bacteria present on the surfaces of the remaining teeth. Peri-implant sulci of partially edentulous individuals harbour more motile rods and spirochetes than those of fully edentulous individuals. If Peri-implantitis arises, it may lead to implant failure. This complication occurs more frequently in patients with poor oral hygiene. This is a site-specific bacterial infection similar to that caused by periodontal bacteria around teeth and it should be prevented. This study was conducted to radiographically evaluate hard tissue response around 6 implants, over a 2 -year period, in a previously surgically treated patient affected by severe chronic periodontitis. Psychological considerations and behavioral management of the patient are described. A complex implant-perio-prosthodontic case of a 54 -year-old man affected by meningeal <b>melanomatosis</b> with a history of generalized severe chronic periodontitis was recruited. A comprehensive periodontal examination around teeth was accomplished before periodontal and implant treatment. After diagnostic work-up, compromised teeth from 1. 3 to 2. 3 and from 3. 2 to 4. 2 were extracted. Tooth 1. 7 was also extracted. Afterwards fixed provisional restoration rehabilitated all the natural dentition and the missing teeth. Endodonthic therapies were conducted on all the teeth due to high dentinal sensitivity and pre-prosthodontic crown reconstructions performed. Periodontal surgery with modified Widman flaps were then accomplished on all the teeth. Three months later four maxillary implants in position 1. 3, 1. 1, 2. 1, 2. 3 and two mandibular implants in position 4. 2, 3. 2 were inserted. During mandibular implants positioning, the mental mussels were isolated and detached to achieve proper guided bone regeneration. During implant surgery, due to systemic conditions concern, the patient underwent intravenous sedation. Five months later the implants and the teeth were rehabilitated with fixed metal-ceramic bridges. Regarding the upper prosthetic rehabilitation, the incisors marginal edges were kept vertical to the nasal spine, due to lack of previous reference points. According to the reference points previously determined, the difference in bone level between radiographs taken at implants insertion and at the maintenance appointments was calculated. The health of the periodontally treated teeth resulted greatly enhanced. The mean alveolar bore loss was 0, 30 mm after a 2 -year observation period. The control of the periodontal disease before implant insertion in patients with severe chronic periodontitis is of paramount importance, as well as a regular maintenance program is essential for the health of the periodontal and peri-implant tissues. The management of patients with complex needs requires a multidisciplinary team designed to meet all the patient’s needs on various levels...|$|E
