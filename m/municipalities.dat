5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division <b>municipalities</b> are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give <b>municipalities</b> a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. <b>Municipalities</b> are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special <b>municipalities</b> (officially public bodies) were formed. These <b>municipalities</b> function the same as regular <b>municipalities</b> and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E
