40|$|Microwave {{tomography}} is {{a microwave}} imaging method {{in which the}} resolution is not limited by wavelength, but rather by measurement noise and modelling errors. Inversion algorithm is used for obtaining an image from the measured scattered waves. Performance improvement of the inversion algorithm is introduced by approximately modelled antennas as a point, line or plane source. Such modelling of antennas introduces modelling errors. Antenna array in the unshielded measurement chamber will pick up external interference, as well as backscattering of array's own radiation. Multipath occurring in measurement chamber has a large impact on the measurement performance. The wave propagated {{through the air and}} reflected from the chamber walls could mask a weaker wave scattered by the object under imaging. Also, a larger number of the antennas improves inversion and gives a more accurate image. This paper proposes a novel design of enclosed <b>measurement</b> <b>antenna</b> array for microwave tomography. To obtain an accurate and efficient antenna model in 3 D FDTD, a square spiral wire antenna is used in this design. A metal shield protects the process of measurement from external interference and backscattering. Between the antenna array and the metal shield an absorption wall is introduced, which decreases multipath and partially prevents signal masking. Square spiral wire antennas are overlapped and packed, giving a larger number of antennas in the same space. Enclosed antenna array is modelled in 3 D FDTD. Proposed antenna array is compared with solutions found in literature. Comparison is done using metrics relevant for antenna array measurement in microwave tomography...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the design}} of a dual {{polarized}} Vivaldi antenna array is described. The Vivaldi elements are fed by broadband microstrip-to-slotline baluns. A 2 : 1 bandwidth (3. 4 to 7 GHz) was achieved for VSWR, gain and cross-polarization isolation. The design iteration, simulations and measured results are presented. The design for the Vivaldi antenna is motivated by the need for a broadband <b>measurement</b> <b>antenna</b> for an antenna test range (ATR). The ATR is capable of a dual axis rotation to create 3 -D plots and to calculate the total radiated power (TRP). 1 The TRP calculation involves the summation of the measured radiated power due to E φ and E θ. Therefore, measurement of each polarization is required. Because of the need for quick characterization of antennas in the ATR, it is desirable to have a receiving antenna that can be electronically switched to receive E φ or E θ. Otherwise, the antenna under test (AUT) would need to be rotated for each polarization, making the test twice as long. Currently, dual polarized dipoles are used to achieve fast characterization. Cross-polarization isolation in excess of 20 dB can be achieved with these dual dipoles. However, as the frequency gets higher (a few gigahertz), the dipoles become more tedious to construct due to their small size. Also, since the dipoles are inherently narrow band, it is quite desirable to replace them with a broadband dual polarized antenna. The Vivaldi (end fire exponentially tapered slot) antenna array is a promising candidate for this application since it has been shown to exhibit the desired characteristics: a broadband pattern, broadband impedance and high cross-polarization isolation...|$|E
