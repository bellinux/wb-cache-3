A 2014 quality objective for ***** Technologies dictates that a unique <b>manufacturing</b> <b>batch</b> record must be created for each cell culture processes performed by the department {{by the end of}} Quarter 1. As a result of the project detailed herein, 186 <b>manufacturing</b> <b>batch</b> records that meet current quality requirements were created and approved for the manufacturing department's cell banking and bulk cell production processes that replace the department's laboratory notebooks that have historically documented such activities. Further, the Manufacturing Work Instructions document that accompanies each batch record was updated to current department requirements. This achievement of {{the first part of this}} project represents a broken bottleneck that precluded the department from culturing the vast majority of the company's cell lines due to lack of batch records. Additionally, this achievement has increased efficiency by saving 50 labor hours for the department's supervisor from the creation and approval of affected documents. The second half of the project focused on batch records that are required that meet current quality and FDA labeling requirements for the manufacture of DNA controls included in the CE-marked in vitro diagnostic kits ***** Technologies offers to its European customers. This project achieved the created and approval of batch records for all DNA controls used in CE-marked kits. A second achievement for the second half of this project represents increased efficiency from the implementation of software that allows an author to create any amount of unique documents from a generic template. This will save the department 100 labor hours when the department creates 654 <b>manufacturing</b> <b>batch</b> records for DNA and RNA controls that ***** Technologies offers as General Purpose Reagents.

40|$|Emitters {{inserted}} in drip irrigation laterals cause local head loss, generally estimated {{as a product}} of a coefficient and the velocity head. This local head loss coefficient and the emitter discharge curve hydraulic parameters may exhibit considerable variability attributable to the manufacturing process. This paper provides a framework for assessing whether the variability in the hydraulic parameters could lead to significant differences in the performance of rolls of drip irrigation laterals from the same <b>manufacturing</b> <b>batch.</b> A system approach with inlet pressure as input, pressure distribution along the drip lateral and inlet discharge as outputs (or responses), and a drip lateral hydraulic model as the transfer function is explored. Within a Bayesian statistical framework of parameter uncertainty based on the Metropolis algorithm, the hydraulic parameters of pressure-compensating drip lateral rolls from the same <b>manufacturing</b> <b>batch</b> were inferred (calibrated). Overlapping of the space (region) of the hydraulic parameters of different drip laterals give an indication of compatibility (similarity) of the drip laterals. Results indicated that half of the drip lateral rolls tested were strongly compatible, a third were weakly compatible, and the remainder were not compatible with any other. This finding has significant ramifications in the design of drip irrigation lateral networks. Therefore, it is essential to closely examine the hydraulic properties of drip laterals for the design of drip irrigation networks to avoid poor performance of the system...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis examines the use of distributed discrete-event simulation techniques {{as part of an}} aid to the design of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems. The methodology and objectives of the design of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems are described and an assessment is made of the use of modelling and simulation as part of the method. Criteria are developed for a simulator used during the. detail design stage. The different approaches taken by existing simulation systems to building and configuring simulation models and their use of particular simulation techniques are described. Limitations on simulation models due to the sequential processing of event-lists and activity scans are identified in a review of the problems of simulation that current existing distributed simulators have been designed to answer. The advantages of concurrent and distributed computing and in particular, a tightly-coupled multi-microprocessor computing engine for executing the normally batch-processed computing tasks of simulation are identified. A novel approach to the distr bution of the computational tasks in a distributed simulation system is described and the operation of a simulator built using this approach to simulate the operation of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems is also described. The question of whether such a distributed simulator of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems satisfies the criteria is examined on the basis of an analysis of the operation of the simulator. It is shown that a number of advantages in the areas of level of detail, configuration, parallel processing and speed of execution can be achieved through the use of distributed computing and multi-processing techniques for simulation during the detail design stage of highly automated <b>batch</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems...|$|R

40|$|Since {{minced meat}} is very {{susceptible}} for microbial growth, characterisation of the bacterial community dynamics during storage {{is important to}} optimise preservation strategies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of different production batches and the use of different preservatives on the composition of the bacterial community in minced meat during 9 days of cold storage under modified atmosphere (66 % O 2, 25 % CO 2 and 9 % N 2). To this end, both culture-dependent (viable aerobic and anaerobic counts) and culture-independent (454 pyrosequencing) analyses were performed. Initially, microbial counts of fresh minced meat showed microbial loads between 3. 5 and 5. 0 log cfu/g. The observed microbial diversity was relatively high, and the most abundant bacteria differed among the samples. During storage an increase of microbial counts coincided with a dramatic decrease in bacterial diversity. At the end of the storage period, most samples showed microbial counts above the spoilage level of 7 log cfu/g. A relatively similar bacterial community was obtained regardless of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>batch</b> and the preservative used, with Lactobacillus algidus and Leuconostoc sp. as the most dominant microorganisms. This suggests that both bacteria played an important role in the spoilage of minced meat packaged under modified atmosphere. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Various {{types of}} {{aluminum}} (Al) alloys {{are used in}} many industrial fields, such as the aerospace industry, automotive industry, cable industry, {{as a result of}} the nice mechanical and technological properties, such as the high tensile strength, high strength to weight ratio, favorable corrosion resistance, nice castability and machinability [1]. Particularly, with the flourishing development of the cell phone industry, Al alloy phone shells gradually replace those made of the plastic and stainless steel [2], for instance, shells of the distinguished iPhone are made of the anodized 6063 Al-Mg alloy. In business applications, the customer preference puts forward extremely high requirements in the surface quality of the phone shells, which can be obtained by milling and subsequent polishing. Due to the very large <b>manufacturing</b> <b>batch</b> for the phone shells, it is believed that the production cost may sharply rise with increasing the process, so it is of great significance to accomplish the machining only by milling, or milling and simple polishing processes. Al alloys perform good machinability owing to the low hardness, favorable strength and relatively high thermal conductivity, while have too high ductility, and the ductility will further increase with the temperature owing to the low melting point and the inferior high-temperature stability. As a result, the Al alloys have a strong tendency to stick to the cutting tool and to form build-up edges when machined. These build-up edges can severely affect surface finish and even remove small portions of the tool when it intermittently breaks away [3], and thus both the machining quality and the tool life deteriorate.|$|E

However, the typical case is that dedicated cells and families cannot be created to accommodate the whole population of parts and all machines, and, often a sizable "remnant" cell is left to serve those parts that do not fit into any families.
