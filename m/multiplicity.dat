5|$|Cantor {{extended}} {{his work on}} the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and inconsistent multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an inconsistent <b>multiplicity.</b> He used this inconsistent <b>multiplicity</b> to prove the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.|$|E

5|$|Technetium can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its <b>multiplicity</b> of valencies. This caused {{a problem in the}} separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing, where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was exacerbated by the mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.|$|E
