50|$|The central {{argument}} of The General Theory {{is that the}} level of employment is determined not by the price of labour, as in classical economics, but by the spending of <b>money</b> (<b>aggregate</b> demand). Keynes argues that it is wrong to assume that competitive markets will, in the long run, deliver full employment or that full employment is the natural, self-righting, equilibrium state of a monetary economy. On the contrary, underemployment and underinvestment are likely to be the natural state unless active measures are taken. One implication of The General Theory is that an absence of competition is not the main issue regarding unemployment; even reducing wages or benefits has no major effect.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{in detail}} {{the relationship between the}} money stock defined by money aggregates M 1 and M 2 and the real GDP in the Czech Republic for period between 1996 and 2015. A long-term relationship between the real GDP and the <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> is not found using quarterly time series data. These conclusions are in accordance with the economic theory which does not confirm that money affects level of the real GDP in the long run. Short-term relationship between given variables is also analysed. Results indicate that the growth rate of the <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> M 1 statistically significantly affects the growth rate of the real GDP in the same direction which is in line with monetary theories of business cycle. On the other hand, any statistically significant relationship for the <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> M 2 is not found which speaks in favour of the Real Business Cycle theory. The Policy Ineffectiveness Proposition accepted by New Classical Macroeconomists is also tested in the thesis. The issue is investigated for the whole period and subsequently for shorter time from 2000 to 2015 where the uniform monetary policy is applied. Results for the <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> M 1 imply that expected changes in the growth rate of M 1 play important role in the money-output relationship which is consistent with the New Keynesian Macroeconomic theory. Considering the shorter period of time, Lucas' theory seems to be more appropriate explanation. Outcomes for the aggregate M 2 provide mixed conclusions which support rather the Real Business Cycle theory. At the end of the thesis, there is a section devoted to the quasi money (one of M 2 aggregate components) as a possible source of mixed results...|$|E

The objective {{of the article}} is to determine, describe and assess the impact of the changes of money supply (as measured by the <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> M 2) {{on the development of the}} American stock market. Another objective is to find out whether the changes in money supply are reflected in the changes of stock prices immediately or with a time delay of several weeks. Methodology/methods Regarding to the aim of the article was all useful historic data of money suplly (measured with <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> M 2) and close values of DJIA obtain in monthly frequence, since 1959 to 2011. From econometric methods, will be using Pearson correlation index, Dickey-Fuller stationary test and test of Granger causality, which will be focus on realtionship between money supply (M 2) and stock prices (DJIA index). Scientific aim The aim of this article is by using econometric methods find, describe and analyze ipact of changing money supply to selected stock market. The second aim is disclose, if stock market react immediately or with time delay (in week). Findings The correlation analysis shows, that between change of money supply and stock index is high dependence (correlation index 0. 9224). By calculating with time delay, was correlation index high too, but slowly decrease. By market colaps in year 2007 and 2008, was correlation index negative with value - 0. 9477, no matter to money supply rasing, that is meaning, that investors have to calculate with psychologic factors, which are very strong in nervous time and market crashes. The result of Granger causality test for 1 month delay failed to show a relationship between money supply and DJIA index. With application of 2, 3 and 6 month delay the dependence was demonstrated, rejecting the null hypothesis stat-ing that the M 2 <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> does not affect the DJIA stock index Conclusions (limits, implications etc) Reached results can be biased by using first diferention of raw data and in correlation analysis was using raw (non-sesonally adjusted) data of development DJIA index and sesonally adjusted data of money supply. The weak spot is using Dow Jones Index in place of S&P 500 index, which is more wider. By changes in analysis is possible to measure the impact of money supply (measured by Money with Zero Maturity aggregate) on stock index and compare both results and make decision, which aggregate is better for forecasting. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{consensus in}} monetary policy and business cycle analysis is that <b>money</b> <b>aggregates</b> are not useful {{as an intermediate}} target for monetary policy or as an information variable. The uselessness of money as an intermediate target is driven by empirical research that suggests that money demand is unstable. In addition, the informational quality of money has been called into question by empirical research that fails to identify a relationship between money growth and inflation, nominal income growth, and the output gap. Nevertheless, this research is potentially flawed {{by the use of}} simple sum <b>money</b> <b>aggregates,</b> which are not consistent with economic, aggregation, or index number theory.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} to monetary policy studies by conducting fundamental research and gathering empirical evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} monetary policy in the U. S., U. K., Germany and Japan. The financial crisis in 2007 / 08 highlighted the weakness of using nominal interest rates as the main monetary policy instrument. Before the financial crisis in 2007 / 08, the new monetary consensus (Bernanke 1992, 1995, and 1996, Woodford, 2003) that interest rates could be the effective intermediate instrument to influence the economy was widely accepted by central banks. It had developed since the failure of monetarism in the late 1970 s. Some central banks (BOE, ECB, and RBNZ) have adopted specific inflation targeting, and approach it through the short-term interest rate. However, as the short-term interest rate has approached zero in a number of countries, it has become apparent that new monetary policy instruments are needed. Quantitative variables (including measures of money and credit) have since become of greater concern again, especially since a policy of “quantitative easing (QE) ” was adopted by the Bank of England in 2009. The main goal of this research is to provide empirical evidence on the interaction between financial variables (interest rates, money and credit) and economic variables (nominal GDP). Three main questions are being dealt with: (1) Are financial variables (interest rates, money and credit) appropriate to target nominal GDP? (2) Do quantitative variables (money and credit) have superior predictive abilities to the price variable (interest rate) in predicting nominal GDP? (3) Do credit variables perform better than <b>money</b> <b>aggregates</b> in explaining nominal GDP? The empirical analysis employs simple regressions, Granger causality tests, the general-to-specific modelling methodology and VARs model. The empirical results suggest that quantitative variables (<b>money</b> <b>aggregates</b> and GDP-circulation credit) have more predictive power for nominal GDP than price variables (interest rates). Meanwhile the GDP-circulation credit displays more accurate features than <b>money</b> <b>aggregates</b> to target nominal GDP. Overall the outcomes not only enrich the literature regarding the monetary policy in the U. S., U. K., Germany and Japan but also provide further empirical support for a modified ‘credit view’ of the transmission of monetary policy. They also have implications for the design of a successful monetary policy implementation regim...|$|R

Even in the Bulgarian case, the usual <b>money</b> <b>aggregate</b> has proven more influential to inflation than fiscal deficits.
