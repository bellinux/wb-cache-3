5000|$|A cost {{of funds}} index or COFI is a {{regional}} average of interest expenses incurred by financial institutions, {{which in turn is}} used as a base for calculating variable rate loans.

COFIs, in turn, are usually calculated by a self-regulatory agency like Federal Home Loan Banks. In California, for example, many home mortgage loans are indexed to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. Interest rates on COFI loans and mortgages tend to fluctuate more slowly than variable-rate loans linked to other indexes.

40|$|The {{deviations}} of hourly ƒ 0 F 2 from <b>monthly</b> <b>medians</b> for 20 stations in Europe {{during the period}} 1958 - 1998 are studied. Spectral analysis is used to show that, both for original data (for each hour) and for the deviations from <b>monthly</b> <b>medians,</b> the deterministic components are the harmonics of 11 years (solar cycle), 1 year and its harmonics, 27 days and 12 h 50. 49 m (2 nd harmonic of lunar rotation period L 2) periodicities. Using histograms for one year samples, it is shown that the deviations from <b>monthly</b> <b>medians</b> are nearly zero mean (mean < 0. 5) and approximately Gaussian (relative difference range between % 10 to % 20) and their standard deviations are larger for daylight hours (in the range 5 - 7). It is shown that the amplitude distribution of {{the positive and negative}} deviations is nearly symmetrical at night hours, but asymmetrical for day hours. The positive and negative deviations are then studied separately and it is observed that the positive deviations are nearly independent of R 12 except for high latitudes, but negative deviations are modulated by R 12. The 90 % confidence interval for negative deviations for each station and each hour is computed as a linear model in terms of R 12. After correction for local time, it is shown that for all hours the confidence intervals increase with latitude but decrease above 60 °N. Long-term trend analysis showed that there is an increase in the amplitude of positive deviations from monthly means irrespective of the solar conditions. Using spectral analysis it is also shown that the seasonal dependency of negative deviations is more accentuated than the seasonal dependency of positive deviations especially at low latitudes. In certain stations, it is also observed that the 4 th harmonic of 1 year corresponding to a periodicity of 3 months, which is missing in ƒ 0 F 2 data, appears in the spectra of negative variations. 1...|$|R

The journey was slow and obviously lasted longer than planned and it was already winter when they arrived. After a lot of trouble that ended very nearly deadly, they arrived in Ayan on 4 December 1844 and Tiling began his work. At the time of his arrival, Ayan had only about 100 inhabitants and his duties as a doctor took up only about an hour per day. Thus Tiling could spend most of the day making scientific observations. One example is the temperature tables he made starting November 1847. He took temperatures three times per day, at 7 a.m., 2 p.m. and 9 pm, calculated <b>monthly</b> <b>median</b> values, and monthly high and low temperatures.

40|$|Abstract Background Diabetes is {{a growing}} health concern in {{developing}} countries, with Cameroon population having an estimated 6 % affected. Of note, hospital attendees appear to be increasing all over the country, with fluctuating numbers throughout the annual calendar. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the relationship between diabete hospitalization admission rates and climate variations in Yaounde. Methods A retrospectively designed study was conducted in four health facilities of Yaounde (Central Hospital, University teaching hospital, Biyem-Assi and Djoungolo District Hospitals), using medical records from 2000 to 2008. A relationship between diabetes (newly diagnosed diabetes patients or decompensated diabetics) hospitalization admissions and climate variations was determined using the “ 2000 – 2008 ” national meteorological database (precipitation and temperature). Results The <b>monthly</b> <b>medians</b> of precipitation and temperature were 154 mm and 25 °C, respectively. The month of October received 239 mm of precipitation. The <b>monthly</b> <b>medians</b> of diabetic admissions rates (newly diagnosed or decompensated diabetes patients) were 262 and 72 respectively. October received 366 newly diagnosed diabetics and 99 decompensated diabetics. Interestingly, diabetic hospitalization admissions rates were higher during the rainy (51 %, 1633 / 3232) than the dry season, though the difference was non-significant. The wettest month (October) reported the highest cases (10 %, 336 / 3232) corresponding to the month with the highest precipitation level (239 mm). Diabetes hospitalization admissions rates varied across health facilities [from 6 % (189 / 3232) in 2000 to 15 % (474 / 3232) in 2008]. Conclusion Diabetes is an important epidemiological disease in the city of Yaounde.
