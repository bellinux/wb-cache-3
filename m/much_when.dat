5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too <b>much</b> <b>when</b> finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E

25|$|Although MGR's {{charisma}} probably {{played a}} significant role in DMK's success, his popularity also cost the party <b>much.</b> <b>When</b> the party leaders tried to neutralise his powers, MGR launched his own party in 1972, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, with support of the lower cadres alone. According to Professor Hardgrave one of the reasons for antipathy between MGR and the DMK leadership was Karunanidhi's attempt to bring his son M. K. Muthu into the party to replace MGR and to convert MGR fan clubs into Muthu fan clubs. The fictionalised account of the troubled relationship between Karunanidhi and MGR was later portrayed in the Tamil film Iruvar (The Duo) in 1997.|$|E

25|$|When Mar Ukba {{was about}} to die, he asked to see his charity accounts. Finding gifts worth 7,000 Sijan gold denarii {{recorded}} therein, he exclaimed that the provisions were scanty and the road was long, and he forthwith distributed half of his wealth to charity. The Gemara asked how Mar Ukba could have given away so <b>much,</b> <b>when</b> Rabbi Elai taught that when the Sanhedrin sat at Usha, it ordained that if a person wishes to give liberally the person should not give more than {{a fifth of the}} person's wealth. The Gemara explained that this limitation applies only during a person's lifetime, as the person might thereby be impoverished, but the limitation does not apply to gifts at death.|$|E

25|$|Just {{as having}} too little water is {{detrimental}} to the grapevine, so too is having too <b>much.</b> <b>When</b> vines become water-logged they become a target for various microbial agents such as bacteria and fungi that compete with the vine for nutrients in the soil. Additionally excessively moist soil is poor conductor of valuable heat radiating from the ground. In general wet soils are cold soils which can be especially problematic during the flowering causing poor berry set {{that could lead to}} coulure. It also becomes an issue during the ripening stage when vines in cool-climate regions may need additional heat radiated from the ground in order to sufficiently ripen its fruit (an example of this is the slate-based vineyards of the Mosel in Germany). Therefore, well draining soils are considered very conducive to producing quality wine. In general light-textured (such as sand and gravel) and stony soils tend to drain well. Soils heavy soils and those with high proportions of organic matter also have the potential to drain well if they having a crumbling texture and structure. This texture relates to the friability of the soil which can come from earthworms and other organisms that have burrowed tunnels throughout the soil. Much like rocks, these tunnels give water a freer passageway through soil and contributes to its drainage.|$|E

500|$|The machine, whose {{height is}} {{reported}} to be between , includes two bronze wind scoops that turn in opposite directions. It also indicates the temperature (when 20 °F or above) via vertical colored lights along the sculpture's stem. Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (°F). Referring to an additional light system (below the stainless steel globe) that indicates air quality, The Oregonian reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects [...] "semismoggy" [...] air and a red light indicates poor air quality. However, in 1998 one writer for The Oregonian warned: [...] "you don't want to breathe so <b>much</b> <b>when</b> the white light is on".

500|$|In a [...] "reversed opening", White {{plays an}} opening {{typically}} played by Black, but with colors reversed and thus an extra tempo. Evans writes of such openings, [...] "If a defense is considered good for Black, {{it must be}} even better for White with a move in hand." [...] Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik reportedly expressed the same view. Watson questions this idea, citing Suba's thesis that Black, by moving second, has more complete information than White. He writes, [...] "everyone has such difficulties playing as White against a Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5), but ... leading masters have no qualms about answering 1.c4 with 1...e5." [...] To explain this paradox, Watson discusses several different reversed Sicilian lines, showing how Black can exploit the disadvantages of various [...] "extra" [...] moves for White. He concludes, [...] "The point is, Black's set-up in the Sicilian is fine as a reactive system, but not worth <b>much</b> <b>when</b> trying to claim the initiative as White. This is true because Black is able {{to react to the}} specific plan White chooses; in Suba's terms, his information is indeed a move greater! Furthermore, he is {{able to take advantage of}} dead equal positions which White (hoping to retain the advantage of the first move) would normally avoid." ...|$|E
