The GEMSS Grid infrastructure addressed this issue by offering end-to-end QoS {{in the form of}} explicit timeliness guarantees for compute-intensive medical simulation services. Within GEMSS, parallel applications installed on clusters or other HPC hardware may be exposed as QoS-aware Grid services for which clients may dynamically negotiate QoS constraints with respect to response time and price using Service Level Agreements. The GEMSS infrastructure and middleware is based on standard Web services technology and relies on a reservation based approach to QoS coupled with application specific performance models.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays {{computed}} tomography (CT) becomes very popular and useful in both medical and dental areas. Due {{to the standard}} DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file format of CT images containing special headers of image, patient and device information, dentists or specialists require to use DICOM viewer software to display those images. After acquiring a CT scan, a traditional way to transfer the CT images from the CT workstation to another place is by having someone carry a CD containing DICOM images with or without viewer software. To accommodate or speed up this process, especially when an interpreting radiologist and a referring dentist are in different places, we have developed a CT image management and communication service process which provides online dental image management as well as viewer software available for the invocation by web and mobile applications. Our system can support image stream, online CT scan request and image download services. The web and mobile applications allow dentists or specialists to view and analyze images at anywhere anytime. This complete system would gain high benefits to not only a dental CT service center but also other <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>service</b> centers as well.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents and}} evaluates a methodology for scheduling medical application workloads in virtualized computing environments. Such environments are being widely adopted by providers of “cloud computing” services. In {{the context of}} provisioning resources for medical applications, such environments allow users to deploy applications on distributed computing resources while keeping their data secure. Furthermore, higher level services that further abstract the infrastructure-related issues can be built on top of such infrastructures. For example, a <b>medical</b> <b>imaging</b> <b>service</b> can allow <b>medical</b> professionals to process their data in the cloud, easing them from the burden of having to deploy and manage these resources themselves. In this work, we focus on issues related to scheduling scientific workloads on virtualized environments. We build upon the knowledge base of traditional parallel job scheduling to address the specific case of medical applications while harnessing the benefits afforded by virtualization technology. To this end, we provide the following contributions: An in-depth analysis of the execution characteristics of the target applications when run in virtualized environments. A performance prediction methodology applicable to the target environment. A scheduling algorithm that harnesses application knowledge and virtualization-related benefits to provide strong scheduling performance and quality of service guarantees. In the process of addressing these pertinent issues for our target user base (i. e. medical professionals and researchers), we provide insight that benefits a large community of scientific application users in industry and academia. Our execution time prediction and scheduling methodologies are implemented and evaluated on a real system running popular scientific applications. We find {{that we are able}} to predict the execution time of a number of these applications with an average error of 15 %. Our scheduling methodology, which is tested with medical image processing workloads, is compared to that of two baseline scheduling solutions and we find that it outperforms them in terms of both the number of jobs processed and resource utilization by 20 - 30 %, without violating any deadlines. We conclude that our solution is a viable approach to supporting the computational needs of medical users, even if the cloud computing paradigm is not widely adopted in its current form...|$|R
