To maintain secrecy within the factory and amongst out-sourced producers during the design of the pre-production models, two baseplate moulds were made, one carrying the inscription 'Rover 90' and the other for a mythical car called 'Road Hawk'.

5000|$|Characters {{were printed}} using a 5x7 dot matrix array of wires; the device {{from which it}} derived {{the shape of the}} {{character}} was a metal plate, called the [...] "code plate," [...] with space for 1960 pins (35 pins times 56 printable characters). If the dot was not to be printed in a given character, the pin was <b>machined</b> <b>off.</b> By correctly positioning the plate and pressing it against one end of the array of printing wires, only the correct wires were pressed against the ribbon and then the punched card. (This printer mechanism was generally considered by IBM Customer Engineers to be difficult to repair. One of the most common problems was wires breaking in the tightly curved narrow tube between the code plate and the ribbon - extracting the fragments and replacing the bundle of 35 wires was very tedious). The printing mechanism was prone to be damaged if a user attempted to duplicate [...] "binary" [...] cards with non-standard punch patterns. These could cause the code-plate positioning mechanism to try to shift the plate beyond its intended range of motion, sometimes causing damage. Turning off printing did not actually prevent the damage, as many people assumed, because the code-plate mechanism remained engaged with the punch unit and shifted the code plate. Turning off printing only suppressed pressing the printing pins into the ribbon and card.|$|E

The wear test {{was carried out by}} using block-on-ring test machine. Sliding dry wear behavior was studied under applied loads of 50, 100 and 150 N. The results show that wear resistance is independent of austempering temperature with an applied load of 50 N, but there is a strong dependence at higher austempering temperatures with applied loads of 100 and 150 N. Wear mechanism is described as being due to subsurface fatigue, with cracks nucleated at plastically, deformed graphite interfaces. The wear controlling mechanism is the crack growth when wear shows a dependence on applied load and austempering temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing of metal parts represents a promising process {{that could be}} used alongside traditional manufacturing methods. The research scenario in this field is still largely unexplored, as far as the technological solutions adopted to integrate different processes are concerned and in terms of environmental and economic impact assessment. In this article, an electron beam melting (EBM) process and a machining process have been analyzed and compared using a cradle-to-grave life cycle-based approach. The production of components made of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy has been assumed as a case study. The proposed methodology is able to account for all of the main factors of influence on energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions when the component shape is varied. The results prove that, besides the direct energy intensity of the manufacturing processes, the impacts related to material usage are usually dominant. Therefore, when complex geometries have to be manufactured, the {{additive manufacturing}} approach could be the best strategy, if it enables a larger amount of material savings than conventional machining. Vice versa, when a small amount of material has to be <b>machined</b> <b>off,</b> the high energy intensity of an EBM process has a negative effect on the performance of the process...|$|E

P/M rings of iron and AISI 4340 grade of blended powders were prepared using suitable die set assembly on a 1. 0 MN capacity hydraulic press. The ring geometries were aintained to outer Diameter: Inner Diameter: Height:: 8 : 4 : 2 and density {{in the range of}} 86 ± 1 per cent of theoretical by employing controlled pressure in the range of 480 ± 10 MPa and taking pre-weighed powders. These ring preforms were coated with indigenously developed ceramic coating to protect them against oxidation during sintering. These preforms were sintered in an electric muffle furnace at 11500 ± 100 C for a period of 100 minutes and subsequently hot upset forged to different height strain levels and quenched in linseed oil. Residual ceramic coating was gently <b>machined</b> <b>off</b> followed by dimensional and density measurements. Analysis of the experimental data has revealed that the rate of densification followed the second order polynomial of the form: Y = a 0 + a 1 X + a 2 X 2; Where, Y = fractional theoretical density achieved, i. e., (ρf/ρth), X = the fractional height deformation. The values of „a 0 ‟, „a 1 ‟ and „a 2 ‟ were dependent upon the composition.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective {{of the study was}} to examine factors that influence the strength of butt welds and gain an understanding of the process of failure. The study was divided into several sectors. The first and primary part of the programme was to determine the extent to which the pipe system's long-term strength under both internal fluctuating and constant pressure is reduced by the presence of axially misaligned butt welds. The second objective was to examine fracture initiation sites and crack propagation paths of the failed aligned and misaligned butt welded samples in relation to the melt flow zone and the weld bead in order to establish the cause of failure. Finally the project considered the influence of selected welding parameters on the fatigue performance of aligned butt fusion welds and an investigation into the influence of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing technique on the basic material's properties. Fatigue and stress-rupture lifetimes were found to decrease significantly with increasing axial misalignment at the butt fusion weld in 63, 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipe systems at 79 °C in a water environment. In the butt fusion weld having axial misalignment of 20 per cent of the wall thickness and above, the reduction in the fatigue and stress-rupture lifetime was greater than 50 per cent compared to the aligned weld. It was not clear whether there is a pipe size effect or not; there was no marked change in the fatigue performance of misaligned butt welds for the three pipe diameters examined. However, the fatigue performance of the aligned butt welds in 90 and 125 mm was noticeably better compared to 63 mm pipe systems. The stress rupture performance of misaligned butt welds in 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipes was more than halved compared to those in 63 mm pipe systems. Both the fatigue and stress rupture performance of misaligned butt welds could be explained in terms of amplified axial stress and in general, the Ory expression for evaluating the increase in axial stress due to misalignment appears to be valid. The temperature dependence of the fatigue performance of aligned and misaligned butt fusion welds in 63 and 90 mm MDPE pipe systems suggests that if continuous internal fluctuating pressure under the conditions examined is maintained, then the butt fusion welds with axial misalignment of below 10 per cent of the wall thickness may well meet the design lifetime of 50 years at the service termperature. Under stress-rupture conditions, all the misaligned butt welds considered in the three pipe diameters surpassed the minimum specified requirement of 170 hours at 79 °C. The fatigue was the most aggresive condition of the two for minor misalignment. Examination of the circumferential butt weld failures revealed that the crack invariably initiated from the notch located at the inner weld bead and no preferred crack propagation path was taken in relation to the melt flow zone. It was proved that the notch was responsible for the observed circumferential failure of aligned butt welds in 63 mm MDPE pipes by testing these butt fusion welds where the internal weld bead was <b>machined</b> <b>off.</b> The failure site for the internal weld bead <b>machined</b> <b>off</b> sample was in the pipe remote from the weld inferring that the material in the melt flow zone does not constitute any weakness. The effect of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing in 63 mm HDPE pipe was found to increase the density (and crystallinity) signifying a slow annealing process in the material. However, the changes in these parameters were not of sufficient scale to strongly influence the performance. The main effect of elevated temperature testing in water environment appears to be the extraction of stabiliser from the base polymer as was indicated by the rapid decrease in oxidation induction time with the ageing times.

40|$|A {{railway wheel}} flat is a flat {{spot on the}} rolling surface of a wheel caused by its unintentional sliding on the rail. The reason for the sliding may be poorly adjusted, frozen or defect brakes, or too high braking forces in {{relation}} to the available wheel/rail adhesion. Contaminations on the rail such as leaves, grease, frost and snow aggravate the problem. The temperature rise caused by the sliding, and the rapid cooling into the adjacent material when the wheel starts rolling again, may lead to formation of brittle martensite around the flat. The thermal impact and the phase transformations will generate large residual stresses. The residual stress field will interact with the rolling contact stresses and it will promote the formation and growth of cracks. Another consequence of wheel flats on a rolling wheelset is impact loading on bearings and suspensions and on rails, sleepers, bridges, etc. A numerical model for the prediction of martensite formation is proposed. The model is based on a commercial FE-code, enhanced by subroutines to handle the phase transformations and describe the thermal load. Features and limitations of the model are examined. A parametric study is performed in order to determine those combinations of thermal load and brake locking time which lead to considerable martensite formation. The effect of modifications of material parameters is investigated. A constitutive model is developed for the calculation of stresses in a material going through phase transformations. Transformation plasticity and plastic hardening memory loss during phase transformations are handled. The model is implemented in a commercial FE-code. Simulations indicate large residual stresses beneath the martensitic area of the wheel flat. Extensive full-scale field experiments have been designed, performed and evaluated. More than 200 wheel flats were formed under controlled conditions involving different wheel loads, train speeds and sliding durations. Also the friction coefficient between the wheel and the rail was varied (and indirectly measured). Samples extracted from the tested wheels were metallographically examined with respect to phase transformations and cracks around the flat. The numerical model for prediction of martensite formation was qualitatively verified and quantitatively calibrated. In the experiments, martensite was found beneath all flats, and cracks were observed in most cases. It is concluded that the risk for future spalling in the wheel tread should be considered for all wheelsets with flats. A damaged wheelset should be taken out of service as quickly as possible. When reprofiling the wheels, all martensite and also an additional layer of several millimeters should be <b>machined</b> <b>off...</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Manuscript I: The {{removal of}} {{residual}} casting material from gating {{has traditionally been}} performed by abrasive grinding techniques. However, high amounts of belt wear can occur when working with high strength alloys, especially those typically seen in the aerospace industry. An alternative machining process called electrochemical machining (ECM) uses electrolysis to precisely remove material at high rates. ECM has many advantages over conventional grinding: no tool wear, no induced mechanical or thermal stresses, and high removal rates independent of material hardness or strength. The industrial application of ECM to residual casting material removal can potentially realize large cost savings and decreased component processing time by eliminating belt wear and increasing material removal rates. The approach taken in this work is the design and fabrication of a laboratory apparatus {{for the purpose of}} testing the ECM of casting material. Commercial ECM machines, while more powerful, can be excessively large and cost prohibitive when performing an initial feasibility study. Many times these commercial machines are calibrated to mass produce a specific part, and do not have the level of variability desired for laboratory experimentation. The test apparatus presented provides a robust and relatively low cost method of investigating the applicability of ECM to this purpose. The device is comprised of an electrolyte filtration and delivery system, a stable machining enclosure, and a single axis computer controlled tool. The ECM variables that can be adjusted include electrolyte temperature, mass flow rate, applied voltage, tool feed rate, and electrode gap. Process data from these variables is collected via multiple sensors in the machine and provides real-time feedback to users. A universal tool connection and workpiece fixture allows for different experimental setups to be easily tested. From experimentation with this test apparatus, {{it will be possible to}} identify optimum methods for the ECM of these residual casting artifacts. Manuscript II: Rapid tool wear can occur during the removal of residual protrusions from high strength alloy parts. In this work, a new method of using electrochemical machining (ECM) capsules to remove protrusions without any tool wear is presented. An ECM capsule is an electrochemical cell that is placed on a part over a protrusion, and removes material through electrolysis. These capsules are advantageous due to their low cost and simplicity compared to conventional ECM equipment. The use of these capsules is demonstrated in two ways. First, a parameter optimization was performed on the material removal rates of Inconel 718 and Titanium 6 - 4 bar stock using a 2 ⁸⁻⁴ fractional factorial design of experiments. Then, using the optimized values, torch-cut protrusions were <b>machined</b> <b>off</b> of manufactured Titanium 6 - 4 parts. Inherent variability in the geometry of the protrusions rendered it difficult to completely remove the protrusions without cutting into the part. Surface scans of the parts showed that the capsules were able to successfully remove between 63...|$|E
