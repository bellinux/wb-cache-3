5|$|After the war, Bagramyan {{remained}} {{in command of}} the Baltic Military District, commanding operations against partisans in Lithuania and Latvia. In 1954, he was appointed Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense. In 1955, he was appointed Deputy <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> with the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union. He was also head of the Military Academy of General Staff and commander of the reserve forces of the Soviet Armed Forces.|$|E

5|$|During {{the same}} year, however, he allowed his pro-American <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense,</b> General Lon Nol, {{to crack down}} on leftist activities, {{crushing}} the Pracheachon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi. Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives {{as a result of his}} failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E
5|$|In modern Syria, Zenobia is {{regarded}} as a hero; her image appeared on banknotes, and in 1997 she was the subject of the television series Al-Ababid (The Anarchy). The series was watched by millions in the Arabic-speaking world. It examined the Israeli–Palestinian conflict from a Syrian perspective, where the queen's struggle symbolized the Palestinians' struggle to gain the right of self-determination. Zenobia was also the subject of a biography by Mustafa Tlass, Syria's former <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> and one of the country's most prominent figures.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, 1980, IAF guided {{missiles}} destroyed two armored cars carrying SA-9 batteries, {{manned by}} Libyan troops, near Sidon. The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do nothing of the kind.|$|E

5|$|The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo {{held their}} final {{demonstration}} in 2006, believing that Kirchner, unlike previous presidents, {{was not their}} enemy. They became political allies of Kirchner, who placed them in prominent locations during his speeches, and the group became a powerful NGO. He further underscored civilian control over the military by appointing Nilda Garré — {{who had been a}} political prisoner during the Dirty War — the country's first woman <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense.</b> As a result of his policies and approach, relations between the civilian authorities and the military remained tense throughout Kirchner's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its impact}} and scale, the Battle of Triangle Hill {{is one of}} the least known episodes of the Korean War within the Western media. For the Chinese, this costly victory {{presented}} an opportunity to promote the value of endurance and sacrifice. The courage demonstrated by the Chinese soldiers at Triangle Hill was repeatedly glorified in various forms of media, including several major motion pictures. Qin Jiwei was also celebrated as the hero of Shangganling and eventually rose to become the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> and the Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress. The 15th Corps {{became one of the most}} prestigious units within the PLA, and the PLAAF selected the 15th Corps to become China's first airborne corps in 1961. It remains the most elite corps-size unit in China today.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that Menem was {{under investigation for}} his role in the 1995 Río Tercero explosion, which is alleged to have been part of the weapons scandal involving Croatia and Ecuador. Following an Appeals Court ruling that found Menem guilty of aggravated smuggling, he was sentenced to seven years in prison on June 13, 2013, {{for his role in}} illegally smuggling weapons to Ecuador and Croatia; his position as senator earned him immunity from incarceration, and his advanced age (82) afforded him the possibility of house arrest. His <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> during the weapons sales, Oscar Camilión, was concurrently sentenced to five and a half years.|$|E

5|$|Initially, President Grinius {{refused to}} resign, {{but he was}} {{eventually}} persuaded that Polish invasion was imminent and that Smetona had sworn to uphold the constitution. On 19 December 42 delegates of the Seimas met (without the Social Democrats or the Peasant Popular Union) and elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the new Speaker of the Seimas. Stulginskis was the formal head of state {{for a few hours}} before Smetona was elected as the President (38 deputies voted for, two against, and two abstained). The Seimas also passed a vote of confidence in the new cabinet formed by Voldemaras. Constitutional formalities were observed thereby. The Lithuanian National Union secured other major roles: Antanas Merkys assumed office as <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> and Ignas Musteikis as Minister of the Interior.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May, Deutschland was {{attacked}} by two Republican planes. It was claimed that their Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias, or else had been fired upon by it. 32 sailors were killed, the Kriegsmarine's greatest loss {{of life in the}} war. After a retaliatory attack on Almeria (Valencia had been the original target, but minefields posed too great a problem), Germany came close to withdrawing from the agreement, but British diplomatic efforts to keep Germany patrolling prevailed. After the Germans claimed that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran, it formally withdrew from international patrols to enforce the agreement. Republican <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> Indalecio Prieto considered a declaration of war on Germany, but Soviet fear of a world war prevented this.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{sought to}} maintain an impression of normality. Just before Ramadan was to begin on 26 September, the Ministry of War publicly announced that military personnel could register to take leave to perform a Umrah (pilgrimage) in Mecca. Egyptian newspapers announced that sailboat races would be held, participants of which included several high-ranking officers of the Egyptian Navy. In addition, a visit planned for October 8 (two days after the scheduled attack) by the Romanian <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War, and a program for his visit was announced. This coincidental visit would be promptly canceled once war broke out on 6 October, but it proved useful {{as part of the}} deception plan.|$|E

5|$|After a {{recommendation}} from high-ranking Dutch naval officers that the Koninklijke Marine (Royal Netherlands Navy) be bolstered so any attacker {{would have to}} deploy {{a significant amount of}} their fleet to the East Indies, keeping it from other theaters of war, the <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> ordered the Navy to prepare designs for a two or three-member class of battlecruisers. As they had not previously designed a modern capitalship, and the only information available on modern designs came from public literature and editions of Jane's Fighting Ships, the Dutch turned to Germany. This initially bore no results, as the two sides were unable to come to terms. During this time, a preliminary plan was drawn up without foreign assistance; completed on 11 July 1939, it was missing many of the post-First World War advances in warship technology. In particular, the armor protection was completely outmoded.|$|E
5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate for Prime Minister. The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to disagree {{with the majority of}} his government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President. By late evening on June 15, Smetona and <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Brigadier General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not attack, that there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division and Brigadier General Kim Suk Won clashed over whether the division should retreat or attack. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E

5|$|In August 1939, Ljotić's cousin, Milan Nedić, was {{appointed}} Yugoslav <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense.</b> Later that year, almost all Zbor publications, including Otadžbina, Buđenje, Zbor, Naš put (Our Path) and Vihor (Whirlwind), were prohibited. Ljotić exploited the connections {{he had with}} Nedić {{to ensure that the}} banned Zbor-published journal Bilten (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout the country by military couriers. Ljotić was the journal's main contributor and editor-in-chief. Fifty-eight issues of Bilten were published from March 1939 until October 1940, in which Ljotić advocated a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy and criticized Belgrade's tolerance of Jews. As many as 20,000 copies each were printed of later issues of the journal. Ljotić was particularly pleased with being able to exert his ideological influence over young military academy trainees as well as older officers.|$|E
5|$|In peacetime, the {{commander}} of the land forces is the <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense,</b> while in wartime, the President of Romania becomes the supreme commander of the armed forces. The main combat formations of Romania are the 2nd Infantry Division Getica, and the 4th Infantry Division Gemina. Until 2015 the Romanian land forces fielded a third division, namely the 1st Division Dacia. Before June 2008, the 1st and 4th divisions were known as the 1st Territorial Army Corps and the 4th Territorial Army Corps and in turn they used to be called the 1st Army and 4th Army prior to 2000. However due to their personnel having been reduced considerably in order to reach compatibility with NATO standards they were renamed and reorganized as divisions. In 2010, the Joint HQ command was renamed as 2nd Infantry Division Getica and received units from the 1st and the 4th Infantry divisions.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the first}} cabinet, {{organised}} in Chascomús, was composed of trusted colleagues of Alfonsín. Alfonsín appointed as minister of labour Antonio Mucci, who belonged to a faction of the UCR that sought to reduce the influence of Peronism among labour unions, and promptly sent a bill to Congress designed to promote independent unions. Facing an economic crisis, he appointed Bernardo Grinspun as minister of the economy. He appointed Aldo Neri minister of health, Dante Caputo minister of foreign relations, Antonio Tróccoli minister of interior affairs, Roque Carranza minister of public works, Carlos Alconada Aramburu minister of education, and Raúl Borrás <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense.</b> Juan Carlos Pugliese led the chamber of deputies, and Edison Otero was the provisional president of the senate.
