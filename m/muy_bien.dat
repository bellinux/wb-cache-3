In 1942, Eva {{experienced}} some economic stability when a company called Candilejas (sponsored by a soap manufacturer) hired her for a daily role {{in one of their}} radio dramas called <b>Muy</b> <b>bien,</b> which aired on Radio El Mundo (World Radio), the most important radio station in the country at that time. Later that year, she signed a five-year contract with Radio Belgrano, which assured her a role in a popular historical-drama program called Great Women of History, in which she played Elizabeth I of England, Sarah Bernhardt, and the last Tsarina of Russia. Eventually, Eva Duarte came to co-own the radio company. By 1943, Eva Duarte was earning five or six thousand pesos a month, making her one of the highest-paid radio actresses in the nation. Pablo Raccioppi, who jointly ran Radio El Mundo with Eva Duarte, is said to have not liked her, but to have noted that she was [...] "thoroughly dependable". Eva also had a short-lived film career, but none of the films in which she appeared were hugely successful. In one of her last films, La cabalgata del circo (The Circus Cavalcade), Eva played a young country girl who rivaled an older woman, the movie's star, Libertad Lamarque.|$|E

La hipótesis relaciona este elemento iconográfico,espacial, con la filosofía y teología de la historia, de corte joaquinita, que los franciscanos y jesuitas difundieron por América durante esos años, con ribetes cercanos a la herejía. El trabajose articula en tres partes; en la primera se hace una sucinta presentación de la Teología de laTrinidad hasta la época tratada; la segunda parte hace un breve repaso del milenarismo franciscanoy jesuita que se desplegó por América en estos siglos; por último, {{la tercera}} parte presentala hipótesis central del trabajo, que articula sus diferentes partes, a saber: la posible conexiónentre la Trinidad trifacial y el milenarismo de corte joaquinita al interpretar este tipo derepresentación herética de la Trinidad como una representación espacial, sincrónica, de lastres Edades, la del Padre, la del Hijo y la del Espíritu, despliegue diacrónico de la teología de lahistoria a partir de la que ciertos monjes entendieron la conquista del Nuevo Mundo. Se concluyeanalizando dos ejemplos <b>muy</b> bellos y <b>bien</b> conservados de Trinidad trifacial debidasrespectivamente a Jerónimo de Cosida, pintor aragonés, y a Gregorio Vázquez de Arce y Ceballos,que desarrolló su obra pictórica en Santa Fe. Se proponen los resultados de este trabajocomo hipótesis a verificar, lo que exige seguir buscando evidencias documentales para poderafirmar la relación de los círculos en los que se movían los pintores de estas Trinidades heterodoxas con el joaquinismo como teología de la historia también con aspectos heterodoxos. In this {{paper we propose}} a {{hypothesis}} regarding the possible theological and political meaningof the images of the trigeminal trinity that arose, fundamentally in the colony during the 16 th to 18 th centuries. The hypothesis relates this iconographic, spatial, element with the philosophyand theology of history, of Joachimite tradition, which the Franciscans and Jesuits spreadaround America during these years, with adornments close to heresy. The study is articulatedin three parts; the first a succinct presentation is made of the Theology of the Trinity until theperiod dealt with; the second part provides a brief revision of Franciscan and Jesuit millenarianismthat spread throughout America in these centuries; finally, the third part presents thecentral hypothesis of the study that articulates its different parts, namely, the possible connectionbetween the trigeminal Trinity and Joachimite millenarianism on interpreting this type ofheretic representation of the Trinity as a spatial, synchronic representation of the three Ages,that of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, a diachronic display of the theology of historybased on how certain monks understood the conquest of the New World. The conclusion analy 52 — Articlesses two very beautiful and very well-conserved examples of trigeminal Trinity painted respectivelyby Jerónimo de Cosida, from Aragon, and Gregorio Vázquez de Arce y Ceballos, whodeveloped his work in Santa Fe.

40|$|Los antecedentes de la papaya (Carica papaya, L.) en Canarias vienen a poner de manifiesto, la viabilidad de este cultivo en invernadero y la posibilidad de su mayor expansión a corto plazo, {{debido a}} la introducción a {{lo largo de}} los últimos años de {{cultivar}}es comerciales y de gran calidad, procedentes de Hawaii ('Sunrise') y de Brasil 'Baixinho de Santa Amalia' (BSA). En este trabajo se ha estudiado el crecimiento, desarrollo y productividad de los cultivares Sunset, Sunrise, y de los genotipos BH- 65 y 'Baixinho de Santa Amalia' y las características morfológicas y organolépticas de sus frutos, con el fin de continuar con la selección de aquellos cultivares que mejor se adapten y cumplan con las exigencias mínimas de mercado, que mantengan una buena productividad en aquellas zonas marginales para la platanera y que sirvan de base para futuros programas de mejora. Los resultados ponen de manifiesto que los mayores porcentajes de floración se obtienen en el mes de Mayo (6 meses después de la plantación) en las plantas hermafroditas de todos los cultivares, correspondiendo los mayores porcentajes a 'Sunset' y 'Sunrise' (80 y 90, 4 %, respectivamente). El número de hojas emitidas mensualmente es semejante en todos los cultivares, entre 7, 5 y 7, 8. Las plantas femeninas de 'Sunrise' así como las hermafroditas de 'Sunset' tienen mayor diámetro, y además, este último cultivar es más precoz en florecer y sus frutos son de mayor peso y tamaño. Hay que destacar también que en el punto de consumo los frutos del cultivar Sunrise son los que poseen mayor contenido en sólidos solubles totales (10, 33 ºBrix). Además, los frutos hermafroditas de 'Sunrise' son los primeros en ser recolectados (422 días desde la plantación). Finalmente, señalar que el cultivar Sunset destaca por ser el más productivo (59, 5 kg/pl) y por tener mayores rendimientos por hectárea (158, 627 kg/ha). No obstante, los genotipos BH- 65 y BSA poseen un comportamiento <b>muy</b> semejante, si <b>bien</b> tienen menor porte en el primer año de cultivo (142, 9 y 138, 8 cm) menor altura a la primera flor (40, 6 y 42, 2 cm) y menor longitud de entrenudos (1, 4 y 1, 3 cm). Las características descriptivas de los frutos son muy parecidas sin existir diferencias significativas entre ellas. Los frutos tienen buen tamaño (13, 74 x 7, 81 cm y (12, 68 x 7, 98 cm) y peso (392, 92 y 418, 8 g.) y una producción excelente, cualidades de gran interés para el cultivo de la papaya bajo invernadero. The history of the papaya (Carica papaya, L.) in the Canary Islands came to show the viability of this crop under greenhouse {{and the possibility of}} further expansion in short term due to the introduction, over the last years, of high-quality of commercial cultivars from Hawaii ('Sunrise') and Brazil 'Baixinho de Santa Amalia'(BSA). In this work it was studied the growth, development and productivity of the cultivars Sunset, Sunrise and the genotype BH- 65, and 'Baixinho de Santa Amalia', and the morphological and organoleptic characteristics of the fruits, in order to continue with the selection of those cultivars that best adapted and agree with the market requirements, maintain a good productivity in marginal areas for banana production and serve as a basis for future breeding programs. The results show that the highest flowering percentages took place in May (6 months after being planted) in hermaphrodite plants for all cultivars, corresponding to 'Sunset' and 'Sunrise' the maximum percentages (80 and 90. 4 %, respectively). The number of leaves emitted monthly is similar in all cultivars, between 7. 5 and 7. 8. The female plants of 'Sunrise'and the hermaphrodites of 'Sunset' have greater diameter, and in addition, the last cultivar is precocious in blooming and the fruits are bigger in size and weight. Note also that at the consumption point of the fruit, the cultivar Sunrise showed the highest total soluble solids content (10. 33 ° Brix). Moreover, hermaphrodite fruits of 'Sunrise' are the first to be collected (422 days from planting). Finally, the cultivar Sunset has become the most productive (59. 5 kg / pl) and has the highest yields per hectare (158. 627 kg / ha). However, the genotypes BH- 65 and BSA have a very similar behaviour, but are smaller {{in the first year of}} cultivation (142. 9 y 138. 8 cm) the first flower appears at a lower height (40. 6 y 42. 2 cm) and a there is lower length of internodes (1. 4 y 1. 3 cm). The descriptive characteristics of the fruits are very similar with no significant differences between them. The fruits have a good size (13. 74 x 7. 81 y 12. 68 x 7. 98 cm) and weight (392. 92 and 418. 8 g.) and excellent production qualities of great interest for the cultivation of papaya under greenhouse...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{conversation}} analysis approach is adopted {{as the basis}} for a qualitative study of the adverbial phrase <b>muy</b> <b>bien,</b> which is widely employed in evaluative and polite contexts in standard Spanish. The study shows how this expression has expanded its range of functions to act as a discourse marker in the vernacular Spanish of Castellón (Spain). In spoken discourse, <b>muy</b> <b>bien</b> has a number of different uses. For instance, it can function as an affirmative answer in reactive interventions, or as a signal of self-confirmation or self-correction in initiative turns. Moreover, it also has other metadiscursive functions such as that of introducing new topics or redirecting old ones. The multifunctionality of this adverbial phrase is a consequence of a process of pragmaticalization, that is to say, a semantic blurring away from the referential meaning towards more procedural and discursive ones in different conversational contexts. Furthermore, the issue of formal and semantic convergence with oral Catalan (in its Valencian variety) is discussed...|$|E

These values are indices of the behavior of the welded joint and therefore, they can be considered as factors that control the process. This work is performed to optimize the GMAW process of the aluminum alloy AA 6063 -T 5 by means of the response surface methodology (RSM). The variables herein considered are the arc voltage, the welding speed, the wire feed speed and the separation between surfaces in butt joints. The response functions that are herein studied are the overhead, the width, the penetration and the angle of the bead. The obtained results by RSM show high grade of agreement with the experimental values. The procedure is experimentally validated by welding for the theoretically obtained optimized technological conditions and a wide agreement between theoretical and experimental values is found.

40|$|La teología de Von Balthasar, de manera implícita, da muchas claves para una teología {{pastoral}} o práctica. A partir de la experiencia básica del ser -la distinción entre ser y ente- y del ser humano -descubrimos nuestra individualidad al tiempo que descubrimos nuestro ser comunitario-, Balthasar desarrolla una teología de la analogía de los trascendentales del ser, que muestra la capacidad básica de la realidad de expresar la gloria de Dios. Pero esta capacidad de la realidad se basa, a su vez, en que la creación es obra del Logos, que luego se hace carne; y más hondamente aún en que en Dios existe lo otro de sí, en el Verbo divino. Es la analogia entis cristológica la que fundamenta la forma -o estructura concreta del ser- como expresión de la gloria de Dios, la que fundamenta la posibilidad de una lectura teológica de la realidad. El artículo muestra <b>muy</b> <b>bien</b> cuáles pueden ser los fundamentos filosóficos y teológicos para poder realizar una lectura teológica de la realidad. Implicitly, Von Balthasar's theology {{offers many}} keys for a practical or pastoral theology. From the basic experience of being, {{the distinction between}} being and a being, and of a human being, we discover our individuality {{at the same time}} as we discover our communal being. Balthasar develops a theology of the transcendence of being that shows us the basic capacity of reality to express the glory of God. But this capacity of reality is based, in turn, on creation being the work of Logos, who becomes flesh, and even more deeply in God existing in the other self, in the Divine Word. It is the christological entis analogy which supports the form (or the concrete structure of being) as an expression of the glory of God, which supports the possibility of a theological reading of reality. The article shows very well what the philosophical and theological foundations could be for being able to carry out a theological reading of reality...|$|E
40|$|Resumen: En el desarrollo de la maestría se estudian cantidades de estrategias, modelos, corrientes, y tendencias educativas actuales; casi todas tienen como resumen la célebre frase “no le des el pez, enséñale a pescar”, esto significa que más que enseñarle una cantidad de contenidos, debe enseñársele a los alumnos aquello que les permita en un futuro ser capaces de aprender por ellos mismos, se les enseña a aprender. Esta frase suena <b>muy</b> <b>bien</b> pero lleva a enfrentar grandes desafíos por parte de los docentes, en un escenario saturado de información de mala calidad, errónea cuando no parcializada, es un verdadero reto enseñar a identificar información valiosa, esta sería ya una gran meta, enseñar estrategias de búsqueda, análisis y selección de información es {{actualmente}} indispensable. Con lo anterior en mente la Unidad Didáctica {{cuenta con}} los contenidos disciplinares del tema en cuestión, además con las actividades que propician en los alumnos el aprendizaje significativo del tema, asimismo permite desarrollar el aprendizaje cooperativo mediante un trabajo en equipo bien dirigido, actividades que propician la participación de todos, la crítica y la creación del conocimiento de manera colectiva. Abstract: During the master’s degree, we have studied {{a lot of}} educational strategies, models, trends and current styles {{and almost all of}} them have in common the well-known Chinese proverb, «Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach him to fish and you feed him {{for the rest of his}} life». It means that instead of teaching your students a great deal of contents, teach what allows them to be able to learn by themselves in the future, teach them to learn. This aphorism sounds well, but implies to cope with great challenges on the part of teachers on saturated scenarios of poor quality information, erroneous if not biased. It would be a great goal, and therefore a real engagement, to teach to identify valuable information. In a nutshell, we -as teachers- may not postpone any longer to teach search strategies, analysis and selection of information. Taking into account the above, the didactic unit has the disciplinary content of the outlined topic; besides that, the activities that encourage students in meaningful learning of the topic and also allows the development of cooperative learning through well managed team work; such activities must foster the participation of all students, criticism and knowledge creation collectively...|$|E
