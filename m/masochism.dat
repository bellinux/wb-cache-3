Fetishism with the phallus architecturally and in smaller implements was also exhibited by certain Christian sects in medieval times, such as the Manichaeans, and was connected with <b>masochism</b> and sadism, a form of religious flagellantism. Smaller phallic shaped monuments {{in the form of}} idols, even vases, rings, drinking vessels and jewellery have been well-documented and could be found within medieval churches of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Both Krafft-Ebing and Freud {{assumed that}} sadism in men {{resulted}} from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. <b>Masochism</b> in men, however, {{was seen as a}} more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that <b>masochism</b> in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that <b>masochism</b> was so inherent to female sexuality that {{it would be difficult to}} distinguish as a separate inclination.|$|E
25|$|The triskelion as a BDSM symbol {{can easily}} be {{perceived}} as the three separate parts of the acronym BDSM; which are BD, DS, and SM (Bondage & Discipline, Dominance & Submission, Sadism & <b>Masochism).</b> They are three separate items, that are normally associated together.|$|E
25|$|Baumeister (2010) {{found that}} masochistic males {{experienced}} greater: severity of pain, frequency of humiliation (status-loss, degrading, oral), partner infidelity, active participation by other persons, and cross dressing. Trends {{also suggested that}} male <b>masochism</b> included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship should be noted because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister (2010) observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male <b>masochism</b> to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.|$|E
25|$|The term {{sadomasochism}} {{is derived}} from the words sadism and <b>masochism.</b> These terms differ somewhat from the same terms used in psychology, since those require that the sadism or <b>masochism</b> cause significant distress or involve non-consenting partners. Sadomasochism refers to the aspects of BDSM surrounding the exchange of physical or emotional pain. Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting pain, degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario. Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM—for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised—and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties. Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).|$|E
25|$|Notable European {{works of}} erotica {{at this time}} were Gamiani, or Two Nights of Excess (1833) by Frenchman Alfred de Musset and Venus in Furs (1870) by the Austrian author Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. The latter erotic novella brought the {{attention}} of the world to the phenomenon of <b>masochism,</b> named after the author.|$|E
25|$|The word Sadism {{originates}} {{from the}} works of Donatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade, and the word <b>Masochism</b> originates from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of Venus in Furs. However, {{it is worth noting}} that the Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in Justine. Venus in Furs describes a consented domme-sub relationship.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, such works as Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue and 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade were exemplars {{of the theme}} of sado-masochism and {{influenced}} later erotic accounts of Sadism and <b>masochism</b> in fiction. De Sade (as did the later writer Sacher-Masoch) lent his name to the sexual acts which he describes in his work.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Waugh {{argues that}} Natan {{revolutionized}} pornographic film in France. He {{was one of}} the first, and certainly the most prominent, filmmaker to include bisexuality and homosexuality in his films, and introduced <b>masochism</b> to French adult film as well. Joseph Slade, who originally claimed that Natan unquestionably produced {{some of the most important}} hardcore film of the 1920s, now admits there is room for doubt over whether Natan worked in pornography at any time after 1910.|$|E
25|$|Female Prisoner Amazons from September 2005 was a {{women in}} prison-themed DVD with Tachibana heading a large cast of AV idols. In her {{starring}} role in the ninth entry in CineMagic's Bondage Doll, Tachibana underwent training designed to lead her to the pleasures of <b>masochism.</b> Bondage, gagging, and blind-folding ensue. In July 2006, Tachibana was again the star of a humiliation-themed DVD, Lesbian Teachers' Water Spanking. In the DVD, she {{played the role of}} a teacher who is tied up and dowsed with bodily fluids.|$|E
25|$|Rejection is not {{desired by}} a primary masochist in {{quite the same}} sense as the feigned {{rejection}} occurring within a mutually consensual relationship—or even where the masochist {{happens to be the}} one having actual initiative power (this is the confusion of the distinctions of casual appearance and discrete motives which underlies the analyses of Deleuze and Sartre, for example). In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World, René Girard attempts to resuscitate and reinterpret Freud's distinction of primary and secondary <b>masochism,</b> in connection with his own philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Following a phenomenological {{study of}} nine {{individuals}} involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain {{as central to}} their experience, sexual <b>masochism</b> was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much {{as described in the}} descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with behavioral spin as found in problem gamblers.|$|E
25|$|Descriptions in Justine seem to {{anticipate}} Radcliffe's scenery in The Mysteries of Udolpho and the vaults in The Italian, but, unlike these stories, {{there is no}} escape for Sade's virtuous heroine, Justine. Unlike the milder Gothic fiction of Radcliffe, Sade's protagonist is brutalized throughout and dies tragically. To have a character like Justine, who is stripped without ceremony and bound to a wheel for fondling and thrashing, would be unthinkable in the domestic Gothic fiction written for the bourgeoisie. Sade even contrives a kind of affection between Justine and her tormentors, suggesting shades of <b>masochism</b> in his heroine.|$|E
25|$|Havelock Ellis, in Studies in the Psychology of Sex, {{argued that}} there is no clear {{distinction}} between the aspects of sadism and <b>masochism,</b> and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.|$|E
25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is {{that women}} are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; <b>masochism</b> may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Particularly revered among Ballard's admirers is {{his short}} story {{collection}} Vermilion Sands (1971), set in an eponymous desert resort town inhabited by forgotten starlets, insane heirs, very eccentric artists, and the merchants and bizarre servants who provide for them. Each story features peculiarly exotic technology such as cloud-carving sculptors performing {{for a party}} of eccentric onlookers, poetry-composing computers, orchids with operatic voices and egos to match, phototropic self-painting canvases, etc. In keeping with Ballard's central themes, most notably technologically mediated <b>masochism,</b> these tawdry and weird technologies service the dark and hidden desires and schemes of the human castaways who occupy Vermilion Sands, typically with psychologically grotesque and physically fatal results. In his introduction to Vermilion Sands, Ballard cites this as his favourite collection.|$|E
25|$|According to Joseph Slade, Natan's {{career in}} {{pornography}} {{did not end}} there. Slade writes that Natan directed at least one hardcore pornographic film in Romania. {{but it was in}} France that Natan produced and acted in at least 20 hardcore heterosexual and bisexual hardcore pornographic films between 1920 and 1927, and established his own studio (Rapid Film) to develop and process the films he shot. Slade wrote that nearly all French pornographic films from this period which include bisexual and homosexual content were produced by Natan. The same source states that Natan himself was bisexual, and engaged in intercourse on screen in a number of films, notably Le Menage Moderne Du Madame Butterfly (1920) and La Maîtresse du Capitaine de Meydeux (1924). Furthermore, Slade claimed that he introduced <b>masochism</b> into French pornographic film.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{focuses on}} the title character, a {{spinster}} librarian. Soon {{after the death of}} her father while on vacation in Rome, Martha meets a wealthy civil engineer who sweeps her off her feet. They encounter again at a wedding in her hometown of Constance and marry. However their married life becomes an exercise for her husband to express his sadism and for Martha to endure her <b>masochism.</b> Her husband shows his desire for her violently leaving marks on her body. He obsessively controls her life, her diet, her taste in music and her interest until she is confined to their house. Martha's initially positive wish to be liked by her oppressive and abusive husband push her to such an extreme that she becomes deranged leading to her own permanent physical paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The Eliminators {{debuted in}} the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling {{promotion}} at Gangstas Paradise in September 1995. They were initially {{brought in to}} job to the Steiner Brothers but after {{it became apparent that}} Steiners were leaving ECW, the Eliminators were booked to win their debut match, a six-man tag team match, which pitted Eliminators with Jason against Taz and Steiner Brothers. ECW promoter Paul Heyman quickly abandoned plans to give them a sadism and <b>masochism</b> character and instead booked them as an unstoppable force in the ECW tag team division. They were managed by Jason. The Eliminators won the ECW Tag Team Championship on three occasions between 1996 and 1997, feuding with teams such as the Dudley Boyz, The Gangstas, The Pitbulls, Sabu and Rob Van Dam and the Steiner Brothers.|$|E
25|$|Finally, after Deleuze, René Girard {{included}} {{his account}} of sado-masochism in Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World, originally Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde, 1978, making the chapter on <b>masochism</b> a coherent part of his theory of mimetic desire. In this view of sado-masochism, {{the violence of the}} practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding {{of the value of the}} love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.|$|E
25|$|Known in Przemyśl as the {{beautiful}} Rosenbach daughter, Helene {{was given the}} title of most 'brilliant {{enough to be a}} son.' It was in early childhood when Helene and her father began to experience tension in their relationship. Spurred by her thirst for education and her disdain for the life her mother planned for her, Helene turned to her father, only to find him unwilling to help her further her education past the age of fourteen. In her work, The Psychology of Women, Deutsch connects one aspect of feminine <b>masochism</b> with her attachment to her father and the possible consequences of such an identification. She writes that a father will sometimes break his relationship with his daughter when she approaches the age of sexual maturity. Helene later attributed her father's resistance to his subservience to his wife and desire for peace at home.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from NME {{compared the}} structure of the recording to 1980s-style riffs of Michael Jackson and further described the track as a [...] "harder, carbon copy" [...] of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] that is [...] "easily as good as her breakthrough single". Robert Christgau recognized [...] "Oops!...

Andy Battaglia of Salon described the track as a [...] "sweetly sadistic companion piece to the <b>masochism</b> lite lurking beneath her debut '...Baby One More Time'".|$|E
500|$|Nixon had Agnew {{deliver a}} series of speeches attacking their {{political}} opponents. In New Orleans on October 19, Agnew blamed liberal elites for condoning violence by demonstrators, [...] "a spirit of national <b>masochism</b> prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals". The following day, in Jackson, Mississippi, Agnew told a Republican dinner, [...] "for too long the South has been the punching bag for those who characterize themselves as liberal intellectuals... their course is a course that will ultimately weaken and erode the very fiber of America." [...] Agnew, though he denied Republicans had a Southern Strategy, stressed that the administration and Southern whites had much in common, including the disapproval of the elites. Levy argued that such remarks were designed to attract Southern whites to the Republican Party to help secure the re-election of Nixon and Agnew in 1972, and that Agnew's rhetoric [...] "could have served as the blueprint for the culture wars of the next twenty-to-thirty years, including the claim that Democrats were soft on crime, unpatriotic, and favored flag burning rather than flag waving". The attendees at the speeches were enthusiastic, but other Republicans, especially from the cities, complained to the Republican National Committee that Agnew's attacks were overbroad.|$|E
2500|$|Freud {{introduced}} the terms [...] "primary" [...] and [...] "secondary" [...] <b>masochism.</b> Though this idea {{has come under}} a number of interpretations, in a primary <b>masochism</b> the masochist undergoes a complete, not just a partial, rejection by the model or courted object (or sadist), possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate. This complete rejection {{is related to the}} death drive (todestrieb) in Freud's psychoanalysis. In a secondary <b>masochism,</b> by contrast, the masochist experiences a less serious, more feigned rejection and punishment by the model. Secondary <b>masochism,</b> in other words, is the relatively casual version, more akin to a charade, and most commentators {{are quick to point out}} its contrivedness.|$|E

2500|$|Psychiatry has an {{insensitive}} {{history in}} the area of BDSM. There have been many involvements by institutions of political power to marginalize subgroups and sexual minorities. Mental health professionals {{have a long history of}} holding negative assumptions and stereotypes about the BDSM community. Beginning with the DSM-II, Sexual Sadism and Sexual <b>Masochism</b> have been listed as sexually deviant behaviours. Sadism and <b>masochism</b> were also found in the personality disorder section. This negative assumption has not changed significantly which is evident in the continued inclusion of Sexual Sadism and Sexual <b>Masochism</b> as paraphilias in the DSM-IV-TR. The DSM-V, however, has depathologized the language around paraphilias in a way that signifies [...] "the APA's intent to not demand treatment for healthy consenting adult sexual expression". These biases and misinformation can result in pathologizing and unintentional harm to clients who identify as sadists and/or masochists and medical professionals who have been trained under older editions of the DSM can be slow to change in their ways of clinical practice.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the later}} 20th century, BDSM activists have protested against these {{conceptual}} models, {{as they were}} derived from the philosophies of two singular historical figures. Both Freud and Krafft-Ebing were psychiatrists; their observations on sadism and <b>masochism</b> were dependent on psychiatric patients, and their models were built on the assumption of psychopathology. BDSM activists {{argue that it is}} illogical to attribute human behavioural phenomena as complex as sadism and <b>masochism</b> to the 'inventions' of two historic individuals. Advocates of BDSM have sought to distinguish themselves from widely held notions of antiquated psychiatric theory by the adoption of the initialized term, [...] "BDSM" [...] as a distinction from the now common usage of those psychological terms, abbreviated as [...] "S".|$|E
2500|$|Before Deleuze, however, Sartre had {{presented}} his own theory of sadism and <b>masochism,</b> at which Deleuze's deconstructive argument, which {{took away the}} symmetry of the two roles, was probably directed. Because the pleasure or power {{in looking at the}} victim figures prominently in sadism and <b>masochism,</b> Sartre was able to link these phenomena to his famous philosophy of the [...] "Look of the Other". Sartre argued that <b>masochism</b> is an attempt by the [...] "For-itself" [...] (consciousness) to reduce itself to nothing, becoming an object that is drowned out by the [...] "abyss of the Other's subjectivity". By this Sartre means that, given that for the [...] "for-itself" [...] desire to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object, one possible strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected, tested, and humiliated; and in this way the for-itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship, which would be both that of the abuser and the abused. Conversely, Sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim. That means that the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his essay}} Coldness and Cruelty, (originally Présentation de Sacher-Masoch, 1967) Gilles Deleuze rejects the term [...] "sadomasochism" [...] as artificial, {{especially}} {{in the context of}} the quintessentially modern masochistic work, Sacher-Masoch's Venus In Furs. Deleuze's counterargument is that the tendency toward <b>masochism</b> is based on intensified desire brought on or enhanced by the acting out of frustration at the delay of gratification. Taken to its extreme, an intolerably indefinite delay is 'rewarded' by punitive perpetual delay, manifested as unwavering coldness. The masochist derives pleasure from, as Deleuze puts it, the [...] "Contract": the process by which he can control another individual and turn the individual into someone cold and callous. The sadist, in contrast, derives pleasure from the [...] "Law": the unavoidable power that places one person below another. The sadist attempts to destroy the ego in an effort to unify the id and super-ego, in effect gratifying the most base desires the sadist can express while ignoring or completely suppressing the will of the ego, or of the conscience. Thus, Deleuze attempts to argue that <b>masochism</b> and sadism arise from such different impulses that the combination of the two terms is meaningless and misleading. A masochist's perception of their own self-subjugating sadistic desires and capacities are treated by Deleuze as reactions to prior experience of sadistic objectification. (E.g. in terms of psychology, compulsively defensive appeasement of pathological guilt feelings as opposed to the volition of a strong free will.) The epilogue of Venus In Furs shows the character of Severin has become embittered by his experiment in the alleged control of <b>masochism,</b> and advocates instead the domination of women.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{indication}} that the relationship of Spielrein and Jung involved sadism or <b>masochism,</b> as suggested in theatrical renditions of the story.
