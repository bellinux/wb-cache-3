In this study, we analysed 47 migrations of 28 brown skuas Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi breeding on King George Island in the Maritime Antarctic. Brown skuas from this population used {{a large area}} during the non-breeding period north of 55 °S, including parts of the Patagonian Shelf, Argentine Basin and South Brazil Shelf, areas which are characterised by high levels of marine productivity. However, individual birds utilised only a subset of these areas, adopting 1 of 4 distinct <b>migration</b> <b>strategies</b> {{to which they were}} highly faithful between years, and showed high repeatability in departure and arrival dates at the breeding ground. Although they spent the majority of the non-breeding season within a particular region, almost all individuals used the same area in the late winter, exploiting its seasonal peak in productivity.

50|$|In South Korea {{the first}} {{returning}} Chinese egrets, almost always already in full-breeding plumage, start to arrive back in mid-April. Their first appearance is in small numbers on offshore islands, especially in stormy weather, with immigration over by mid-May. The period of spring migration is therefore rather short, and most birds {{are thought to}} arrive in their Korean breeding colonies without staging anywhere along the Korean coast. The autumn migration is rather more leisurely with many egrets appearing to move southwards along the west coast during August and September, before departing Korea probably out through the south-west of the peninsula across the Yellow Sea. Other Chinese egrets probably move westwards directly across from Gyeonggi Bay towards the Shandong Peninsula, and then down the Chinese coast. During August and September 1998 two survey circuits were conducted along most {{of the west and}} south coast of South Korea and provided some insight into the suspected autumn <b>migration</b> <b>strategy,</b> with around 475 Chinese egrets found between August 18 and September 2, increasing to 615 between September 13 and 28.

In the literature, most researchers focus only on single VM migration using either post-copy or pre-copy migration, only a few focus on multiple VM migration problem. Sun et al. [90] proposed improved serial <b>migration</b> <b>strategy</b> and introduced post-copy migration into it. They proposed the M mixed <b>migration</b> <b>strategy</b> which uses the improved serial <b>migration</b> <b>strategy</b> with parallel migration. Also, authors have developed M/M/C/C and the M/M/C queuing models there are C service channels, and the system can service up to C customers. The proposed approaches also handle the failure rate of the transmission network. Mainly the memory-intensive live migration technique either use pre-copy or post-copy which are already implemented in Xen and KVM hypervisors. The proposed improved serial <b>migration</b> <b>strategy</b> and m mixed <b>migration</b> <b>strategy</b> for multiple VM migration can be implemented using Xen or KVM. The queuing models are used for analyzing performance metrics like average waiting time, blocking ratio, average waiting queue length, and average queue length of each migration request.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{in recent years}} have seen an explosion of tracking and stable isotope studies of seabirds, often involving repeated measures from the same individuals. This wealth of new information has allowed the examination of the extensive variation among and within individuals in foraging and <b>migration</b> <b>strategies</b> (movements, habitat use, feeding behaviour, trophic status, etc.) in unprecedented detail. Variation is underpinned by key life-history or state variables such as sex, age, breeding stage and residual differences among individuals (termed ‘individual specialization’). This variation has major implications for our understanding of seabird ecology, because it affects the use of resources, level of intra-specific competition and niche partitioning. In addition, it determines the responses of individuals and populations to the environment and the susceptibility to major anthropogenic threats. Here we review the effects of season (breeding vs. nonbreeding periods), breeding stage, breeding status, age, sex and individual specialization on foraging and <b>migration</b> <b>strategies,</b> as well as the consequences for population dynamics and conservation...|$|R

40|$|Migration {{is often}} {{thought of as a}} risky {{endeavor}} in which a migrant trades a known low return for an unknown but potentially higher return.

40|$|Migrating {{birds are}} {{believed}} to minimize the time spent on migration rather than energy. Birds seem to maximize migration speed in different ways as a noteworthy variation in <b>migration</b> <b>strategies</b> exists. We studied <b>migration</b> <b>strategies</b> of a flight mode and feeding generalist, the Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus, using GPS-based satellite telemetry. We expected the gulls to achieve very high overall migration speeds by traveling via the shortest direct route, traveling during {{a large part of}} the day and night, and making few and short stopovers. Fourteen individuals were tracked between the Dutch breeding colony and the wintering sites in England, southern Europe and northwest Africa. The gulls did not travel via the shortest possible route but made substantial detours by their tendency to follow coasts. Although the gulls traveled during most of the day, and sometimes during the night, they did not achieve long daily distances (177 and 176 km/day in autumn and spring, respectively), which is explained by the gulls stopping frequently on travel days to forage. Furthermore, due to frequent and long migratory stopovers, their overall migration speed was among the lowest recorded for migratory birds (44 and 98 km/day, in autumn and spring, respectively). A possible explanation for the unexpected frequent stopovers and low migration speeds is that gulls do not minimize the duration of migration but rather minimize the costs of migration. Energy rather than time might be important for short-distance migrating birds, resulting in very different <b>migration</b> <b>strategies</b> compared with long-distance migrants...|$|R

40|$|Migration is a {{widespread}} strategy that enables animals to escape harsh winter conditions. It {{has been well documented}} that migration phenology in birds is changing in response to recent climate warming in the northern hemisphere. Despite the existence of large temporal and geographical scale ringing data on birds in Europe, changes in <b>migration</b> <b>strategies</b> in relation to climate warming have not been well studied, mainly {{because of a lack of}} appropriate statistical methods. In this paper, we develop a method that enables us to investigate temporal changes in <b>migration</b> <b>strategies</b> from recoveries of dead ringed birds. We estimated migration probability as the ratio between recovery probabilities of conspecific birds originating from different countries but potentially wintering in the same country. We applied this method to two European thrushes: the entirely migrant redwing Turdus iliacus, and the partially migrant blackbird T. merula. We tested for an immediate and a 1 -year lagged relationship between our migration probability and climatic covariates (i. e. mean winter temperature in France and the North Atlantic Oscillation). Using ringing-recovery data collected in Finland, Germany, Switzerland and France from 1970 to 1999, we detected contrasting responses in these two species, likely related to their different migratory behaviours. Both species showed a decline in the probability for northern and eastern birds to winter in France. The entirely migratory redwing exhibited a year-to-year plastic response to climate, whereas the decline in the partially migrant blackbird was smooth, suggesting underlying genetic processes. The proposed method, thus, allows us to identify useful indicators of climatic impacts on <b>migration</b> <b>strategies,</b> as well as highlighting differences between closely related species...|$|R
