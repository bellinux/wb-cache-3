During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films {{over the next ten}} years and would become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. Breezy was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Players {{take control}} of Nier—a <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> in Nier and Nier Gestalt and a teenaged boy in Nier Replicant—though the {{character}} can be renamed by the player. The player directly controls Nier through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings. The three-dimensional world is divided into areas separated by loading screens, and the player can move freely throughout these areas by walking, running, jumping, and climbing ladders. In some rooms and buildings, the camera swings {{to the side and}} Nier is restricted to moving as in a two-dimensional platforming environment, while during certain battles the camera pulls up to simulate a top-down shoot 'em up or other video game genres.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{within two}} weeks of {{finishing}} her GCSE examinations, Winslet made her screen debut {{as one of the}} main cast members of the BBC science fiction television series Dark Season. Her part was that of Reet, a schoolgirl who helps her classmates fight against a sinister man distributing free computers to her school. She did not earn much from the job, and at age 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, she worked at a delicatessen. In 1992, she had a small part in the television film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, an adaptation of Angus Wilson's satirical novel of the same name. Winslet, who weighed 185 pounds at the time, played the daughter of an obese woman in it. While filming, an off-hand comment from the director Diarmuid Lawrence about the likeness between her and the actress who played her mother prompted Winslet to lose weight. She next took {{on the role of the}} young daughter of a bankrupt <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> (played by Ray Winstone) in the television sitcom Get Back (1992–93).

Platelet functions including bleeding time, platelet aggregation, adenine nucleotides, beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, thromboxane generation, and aspirin measurement were determined.

5|$|The Heart of Ezra Greer is a 1917 American silent drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Emile Chautard. The film focuses on Ezra Greer, a successful <b>middle-aged</b> <b>man</b> who searches for his college age daughter, Mary. The wayward Mary was romanced and abandoned by Jack Denbeigh, later bearing his child. Once Ezra becomes broke he finds employment as the valet for Jack Denbeigh. After Jack's engagement to a cabaret girl, Mary becomes upset and leaves her child at Jack's home. Contrary to Jack's wishes, Ezra keeps the child and Jack ultimately reveals {{that the child is}} his own. Ezra convinces Jack to make things right and Ezra convinces the cabaret girl to leave Jack. After a carriage accident in which the baby is injured, Ezra and Jack rush to the hospital and find Mary as a nurse crying over the child. The film ends with the marriage of Jack and Mary. The film was released by Pathé on October 7, 1917. The film was the final release from Thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers. Criticism for the film hinged on far-fetched coincidences to drive the plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{consistently}} shown that oral supplementation of deep ocean minerals (DOM) improves vascular function in animals and enhances muscle power output in exercising humans. Purpose: To {{examine the effects}} of DOM supplementation on the cerebral hemodynamic response during physical exertion in young and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men.</b> Design: Double-blind placebo-controlled crossover studies were conducted in young (N = 12, aged 21. 2 ± 0. 4 years) and <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> (N = 9, aged 46. 8 ± 1. 4 years). The counter-balanced trials of DOM and Placebo were separated by a 2 -week washout period. DOM and Placebo were orally supplemented in drinks before, during, and after cycling exercise. DOM comprises desalinated minerals and trace elements from seawater collected ~ 618 m below the earth's surface. Methods: Cerebral hemodynamic response (tissue hemoglobin) was measured during cycling at 75 % VO 2 max using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Results: Cycling time to exhaustion at 75 % VO 2 max and the associated plasma lactate response were similar between the Placebo and DOM trials for both age groups. In contrast, DOM significantly elevated cerebral hemoglobin levels in young men and, to a greater extent, in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> compared with Placebo. An increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was observed in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men,</b> 2 h after exhaustive cycling, but was attenuated by DOM. Conclusion: Our data suggest that minerals and trace elements from deep oceans possess great promise in developing supplements to increase the cerebral hemodynamic response against a physical challenge and during post-exercise recovery for <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the reductions of the changes in the respective influence of the cardiac sympathetic and vagal activity control and delta EEG activity with aging alter the interactions between the heart rate variability (HRV) and the delta sleep EEG power band. METHODS: A polysomnography was performed on 16 healthy young men and 19 healthy <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> across the first 3 NREM-REM cycles. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram recordings. High Frequency (HF(nu)) of HRV as well as the maximum of cross-spectrum, coherency, gain and phase shifts between HF(nu) and delta sleep EEG power band were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Young men experienced more deep sleep than <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> (P< 0. 001). In middle-aged subjects, HF(nu) was lower than the HF(nu) of their younger counterparts (P< 0. 001), but they showed similar increases during NREM sleep and similar decreases during REM sleep as the young subjects. Cross-spectrum values, coherency, gain and phase shifts between HF(nu) and delta were identical between the two groups. Modifications in HF(nu) show parallel changes and precede changes in delta EEG band by a similar leads of 11 +/- 6 min in young men and 9 +/- 7 min in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men</b> (P= 0. 23). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced changes in the respective influence of the cardiac sympathetic and vagal activity and delta EEG activity with progressive aging do not alter the relationship and phase difference between changes in the relative predominant cardiac vagal activity and delta power in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men.</b> SIGNIFICANCE: Interaction between the cardiac sympathetic and vagal activity with delta EEG activity is maintained in <b>middle-aged</b> <b>men.</b> Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.
