The couple settled at Delegate, New South Wales; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair <b>Musterer,</b> Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful {{of the works of}} emerging major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, grew out of step with trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, Australian War Memorial, National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Queensland Art Gallery.|$|E
500|$|There {{was in any}} case, as art {{historian}} Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, [...] "no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s". Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits, while her approach to her subject matter became [...] "more and more didactic". Women were frequently portrayed, both as rural workers (as in The Fair <b>Musterer)</b> and in domestic or family scenes (as in On The Hilltop). Several images, such as On the Hilltop and Spring Afternoon, Knockalong portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting. Her most [...] "stereotypically feminine" [...] work was The Summer House, which shows two of Rix Nicholas's friends with some freshly cut flowers, in a setting that, unlike most of her works of the period, screened out the surrounding landscape. It was a picture about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed. Yet it {{has become one of}} her best known works, its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon-holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles.|$|E

Hughes (aged 33) was seen as a choice representing a generational shift and was seen as the strongest voice on environmental issues, a key area of concern for the party.|$|E

Despite being described from Pitt Island, {{it has not been}} seen there since Hall discovered it, probably because its host plant there has been almost wiped out by sheep. It is one of four Hadramphus weevil species, all endemic to New Zealand, specialised, flightless, and rare.|$|E

5000|$|James Inglis was {{the station}} manager from 1906 to 1925. He {{had joined the}} New Zealand and Australian Land company Limited in 1888 and worked at both Wellshot and Eddington Station before {{returning}} to Wellshot to manage the property. Inglis's son Eric Ronald (3 June 1898 - 16 February 1991) later documented life on the station in a memoir: [...] "When we arrived at Wellshot many of the facilities were run down and below standard, and Father had much renovation and rebuilding work done. This was greatly appreciated. There were usually {{about five or six}} jackaroos at the station, as well as an overseer, book keeper, blacksmith, engineer, horse boy, a head <b>musterer</b> and about seven musterers, and a married couple. The male half of the married couple would cook and his wife would do all the housekeeping at the station.". Eric Inglis served with the 11th Light Horse Regiment in World War I and wrote a memoir titled Days Long Since.|$|E
5000|$|While Australian artists embraced {{modernism and}} {{addressed}} the city, Rix Nicholas focussed on representing a pastoral ideal. In France in the 1920s, Rix Nicholas had entertained Roy de Maistre, {{one of the}} first Australians to experiment with abstractionism, and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his 'colour-music theory'; however when modernism confronted Australian art in the 1920s and 1930s, Rix Nicholas sided against it.There was in any case, as art historian Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, [...] "no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s".

5000|$|This is why George G. Reeve, Desmond's first biographer, could {{honestly}} {{write that}} [...] "To many another person seeking his acquaintance Desmond held aloof, {{and to a}} great extent surrounded himself - 'behind the veil' as it were - by a 'mystery halo' and a sacrosanctness hard to penetrate." [...] Desmond’s second biographer, Darrell W. Conder, concurs and indeed, after presenting the tangle that constitutes Desmond’s life in New Zealand, Australia and America, questions not only Desmond's origins, but his actual birth name. This doubt is based on Desmond's continuous use of pseudonyms and aliases throughout his adult life. George G. Reeve continues [...] "Arthur Desmond, for that was the real name of 'Ragnar Redbeard' was a native of Hawkes sic Bay, New Zealand, where he was born about the year 1842 of Irish ancestry." [...] In 1921 The International Communist carried a short article on Desmond in which it was claimed that he was [...] "… a native of Napier, Hawkes sic Bay, Maoriland". (The International Communist for Saturday, 17 September 1921, p. 2 article [...] "Redbeard in Sydney" [...] by 'Gullangulong') New Zealand National Dictionary biographer Rachel Barrowman adds: [...] "Arthur Desmond was unknown to the electors of [...] when he stood for Parliament in [...] 'We only know that Mr. Desmond is a cattle-drover, and that he is of Radical tendencies', the editor of the Hawke's Bay Herald wrote. He was said to be 25 years old his birth in 1859, born in New Zealand of Irish descent. He had been in Hawke's Bay since the late 1870s, and had worked as a <b>musterer</b> in south Taranaki. Of his background and personal life nothing more is known." [...] Of the three candidates in the electorate, Desmond came last.|$|E
