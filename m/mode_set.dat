FatBits showed each pixel as a clickable rectangle {{with a white}} border. The FatBits editing <b>mode</b> <b>set</b> the standard for many future editors. MacPaint included a [...] "Goodies" [...] menu which included the FatBits tool. This menu was named the [...] "Aids" [...] menu in prerelease versions, but was renamed [...] "Goodies" [...] as {{public awareness of the}} AIDS epidemic grew in the summer of 1983.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} two games and the 2007 {{expansion}} , the majority of the songs on the main career <b>mode</b> <b>set</b> lists are covers of the original song; for example, a song may be presented as [...] "Free Bird as made famous by Lynyrd Skynyrd". [...] Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock introduces a much larger range of original recordings, and World Tour featured a setlist that contained all master recordings. [...] The covers throughout the games are mostly recreated by WaveGroup Sound who has worked before to create songs for Beatmania, Dance Dance Revolution, and Karaoke Revolution, making small changes to the guitar portions to make them more adaptable for gameplay. [...] Almost all of the unlockable bonus songs are songs performed by the original artist for the game (the only exception is the song [...] "She Bangs the Drums" [...] by The Stone Roses, which is featured in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock).|$|E

New features include flaming hellhounds, the Wunderwaffe DG-2 weapon and ten new achievements/trophies. The map also introduced four new playable characters who have appeared in several subsequent Nazi Zombie maps: Tank Dempsey U.S.M.C, Nikolai Belinski of the Red Army, Nazi Doctor Edward Richtofen and Takeo Masaki of the Japanese Imperial Army. The multiplayer map [...] "Banzai" [...] {{is set in a}} jungle featuring a river bridge, villages, a waterfall and hidden caves. The [...] "Corrosion" [...] map is set in a run-down train yard in Russia, featuring broken pipelines and train cars. The [...] "Sub Pens" [...] map is located in a bombed-out Japanese submarine base with heavy rain.|$|E
2500|$|Blizzard {{has plans}} to add new {{characters}} and maps to the game. With respect to characters, Kaplan expected they will release these one at a time, rather than in groups, allowing the new character to be stabilized before adding the next. Kaplan referred to the negative feedback received after the grouped introduction of the final three charactersGenji, Mei, and D.Vaduring the closed beta period, which if repeated could be [...] "disruptive" [...] to the game's community. For example, the first new character, Ana, was revealed and playable on the Public Test region from July 12, 2016, and made available to all on the Windows version on July 19 with console versions following in the days after. Other characters like Sombra were added in a similar manner, along with other new features. In regards to maps, Blizzard first announced a new map, called [...] "Eichenwalde", on August 16, 2016. [...] Blizzard is also able to add in new game modes and cosmetics, such as sprays and skins, among other things. Themed limited-time modes and cosmetics have also been made available for events and holidays, such as the 2016 Summer Olympics or Halloween. Some of these additions are derived from player feedback to Blizzard. In {{the case of the}} [...] "Overwatch Uprising" [...] event during April 2017, Kaplan said that players wanted to have more story put into the game, inspiring them to create a new story-driven player-vs-environment <b>mode</b> <b>set</b> during Overwatch's past that helped to create some new narrative and provide cosmetic items to reflect that.|$|E
60|$|When Fergus and Waverley met, {{the latter}} was struck with the {{peculiar}} grace and dignity of the Chieftain's figure. Above the middle size and finely proportioned, the Highland dress, which he wore in its simplest <b>mode,</b> <b>set</b> off his person to great advantage. He wore the trews, or close trowsers, made of tartan, chequed scarlet and white; in other particulars his dress strictly resembled Evan's, excepting {{that he had no}} weapon save a dirk, very richly mounted with silver. His page, as we have said, carried his claymore; and the fowling-piece, which he held in his hand, seemed only designed for sport. He had shot {{in the course of his}} walk some young wild-ducks, as, though CLOSE TIME was then unknown, the broods of grouse were yet too young for the sportsman. His countenance was decidedly Scottish, with all the peculiarities of the northern physiognomy, but yet had so little of its harshness and exaggeration that it would have been pronounced in any country extremely handsome. The martial air of the bonnet, with a single eagle's feather as a distinction, added much to the manly appearance of his head, which was besides ornamented with a far more natural and graceful cluster of close black curls than ever were exposed to sale in Bond Street.|$|E
