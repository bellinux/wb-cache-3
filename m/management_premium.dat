Depending on available information and project requirements, cost estimates evolve in tandem with project lifecycle stages; conceptualisation, design development, execution and facility <b>management.</b> The <b>premium</b> placed on the accuracy of cost estimates is crucial to producing project tenders and eventually in budget management. Notwithstanding the initial slow pace of its adoption, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has successfully addressed a number of challenges previously characteristic of traditional approaches in the AEC, including poor communication, the prevalence of islands of information and frequent reworks. Therefore, {{it is conceivable that}} BIM can be leveraged to address specific shortcomings of cost estimation. The impetus for leveraging BIM models for accurate cost estimation is to align budgeted and actual cost. This paper hypothesises that the accuracy of BIM-based estimation, as more efficient, process-mirrors of traditional cost estimation methods, can be enhanced by simulating traditional cost estimation factors variables. Through literature reviews and preliminary expert interviews, this paper explores the factors that could potentially lead to more accurate cost estimates for construction projects. The findings show numerous factors that affect the cost estimates ranging from project information and its characteristic, project team, clients, contractual matters, and other external influences.

40|$|The {{competitive}} landscape of global airline industry {{has changed dramatically}} {{as the result of}} airline deregulation and globalization impacts. Arguably, the most viable change for traditional airlines is the increased price pressures due to fierce competition from low cost carriers (LCCs). The ‘no frills’ formula, which involves reduction in service and comfort levels, challenges the retaining of full service model and more generally, the model focusing on service quality. Furthermore, reduction in average profitability, instability in return rate of traditional airlines leads to urgent need for traditional airlines to change business model. This research gave serious attention to key factors that shape the competition in airline sector, with aims to identify what sustainable competitive advantage that conventional airlines should focus on. Drawing from extensive industry indicators and market information, it was found that demand for air travel is so diverse and there is potential for service differentiation. In deed, if implemented successfully, network carriers can earn superior profit. The research conducted comprehensive and in-depth analysis of Singapore airlines, a highly profitable and famous for its service excellence.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the financial performance of pension funds in Croatia. Although there are other factors which are important in the pension funds overall performance, this paper focuses on investment accomplishments. The purpose of measuring portfolio performance is to determine whether portfolio managers add value compared to passive investment strategies. The traditional approach to pension funds’ performance evaluation underlines standard measures of financial performance (e. g. ratios such as Sharpe’s, Sortino’s, Treynor’s, etc.) which quantify the ability of pension fund managers to deliver an active <b>management</b> risk <b>premium,</b> with respect to benchmarks. In this paper, the previously mentioned traditional measures of risk-adjusted performance are applied to Croatian pension funds. Due to recent changes in pension systems in other Eastern European countries once again emphasis is put on this issue in Croatia. The analysis furthermore includes evaluation of pension funds’ asset allocation. The period of analysis covers twelve years, from the establishment of pension funds in Croatia in 2002 until 2013. The main hypothesis of the paper states that Croatian pension funds underperform with respect to benchmark comparisons, set as return on the combined CROBEX/CROBIS portfolio. Results show that the main hypothesis does not hold. The financial performance of pension funds directly influences their competitiveness, derived from the possibility of measuring their success in active portfolio management. In addition, pension funds are expected to support the national economy. By investing their accumulating assets, they can protect jobs and enhance economic growth. However, they can achieve that only if they are competitive in means of financial performance.   Keywords: pension funds, financial performance, competitiveness, Croatia</p...|$|R

By transferring knowledge to farmers, partnerships present a new source of technological change, which, in combination with certification, holds potential for improved environmental <b>management</b> and price <b>premiums</b> for producers. However, the emphasis on certification results in a comparatively narrow target group of farmers and is associated with high financial burdens for producer organizations.

In 2003, the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and the ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) were adopted as standards for diagnostic classification and acute care procedure classification. Simultaneously, the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) were translated and tested in China 's local applied environment.Another coding standard, named Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), was applied to serve as general identifiers for clinical observation in hospitals. Personal identifier codes were widely employed in different information systems, involving name, sex, nationality, family relationship, educational level and job occupation. However, these codes within different systems are inconsistent, when sharing between different regions. Considering this large quantity of vocabulary, classification and coding standards between different jurisdictions, the healthcare provider realised that using multiple systems could generate issues of resource wasting and a non-conflicting national level standard was beneficial and necessary. Therefore, in late 2003, the health informatics group in Ministry of Health released three projects to deal with issues of lacking national health information standards, which were the Chinese National Health Information Framework and Standardisation, the Basic Data Set Standards of Hospital Information System and the Basic Data Set Standards of Public Health Information System.|$|R
40|$|Organic {{farming is}} {{a rapidly growing}} sector both in Croatia and elsewhere. However, there is some concern as to what a {{widespread}} adoption of organic farming would bring to society as a whole. The {{costs and benefits of}} this development and the associated trade-offs are largely unknown and have hardly been explored. There is a vast body of evidence showing that organic farming in most cases environmentally outperforms non-organic systems. However, organic farming is associated with lower yields and its further expansion might lead to job losses in some other sectors and potentially jeopardise the overall economic strength of a country. This research presents an attempt to assess the environmental and economic consequences of the large-scale adoption of organic farming in Croatia in regard to national agricultural productivity, the labour force and environmental and economic performance. Besides farming the assessment has also taken into account the impact on farm-upstream linked sectors: energy, farm inputs manufacturing, trade, transport and research, education, advisory, veterinary and administrative services. In order to obtain the real value-added of these sectors, their gross value-added has been corrected for the associated environmental costs and public investments.

It further outlines the volumes, trends, distribution channels, major players, and price premiums in 12 nations across Europe and Japan, as a companion to an earlier North American report. While some common parallels exist, such as the priority for consistency and quality standards, the substantial inter-market differences emphasize the need to approach each country and sometimes each distribution channel with an appreciation for its unique distinctions. Overall, the striking emergence and growth of sustainable coffees has catapulted them quickly from a small niche industry to become {{a significant part of the}} mainstream market.

It developed widely after the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 with the primary goal of achieving SFM. Expectations held for the certification systems included decreasing forest land degradation, the establishment of sound forest management policy, the promotion of public participation in <b>management,</b> a price <b>premium</b> for certified wood products and improved access to the 'green market'. The majority of certification systems aim to maintain or improve the ecological, social and economic functions of forest ecosystems. Certification is supposed to guarantee that forests are well-managed. Forest certification is categorised by function and geographical location. There are currently two types of functions 'management-system-based' and 'performance-based'. Managementsystem-based systems assess a company's management processes. On the other hand, performance-based systems evaluate a company's operations in the managed land. Currently, many certifications are management-system-based. From a geographic perspective, there is international certification and national certification. Many national certification schemes are members of international certification schemes. Certification can also apply to wood products that use wood material certified against the standard when all chain of production processes are evaluated, with respect to the environmental and social impacts. A single certification logo can be issued to the producer. Forest certification schemes can assess any type of forest against criteria and indicators (C&I) to assess if they have been implemented against standards at the national level. At least nine international initiatives and agreements for C&I forest certification systems have been developed. Six recognized forest certification systems are reviewed within. None of these certification systems have exactly the same C&I thresholds. Differences between schemes largely arise from the different expectations of the primary stakeholders of the schemes. Certification bodies are voluntary, independent, and non-government. An increasing number of certifications may bring confusion and complexity as various standards develop. The certification systems are not clear to the general public because targets and effects are not usually well defined. Different types of forests can be assessed at specific levels of the standard. However, dissimilar forests approved by the same certification can equally claim that their forest management practice is environmentally sound. Yet, different criteria, conditions, and systems for environmental sustainability are found in each standard. Nevertheless, all certification bodies seem to be developing towards socially and economically acceptable systems. Standards have been adapting {{to the needs of the}} various stakeholders. This can make the different certification systems converge. Measures for ecological sustainability in certification systems seem to be less well-developed, in general, than measures to ensure social and economic sustainability...|$|R
40|$|On March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), {{the most}} {{significant}} U. S. health policy legislation since Medicare and Medicaid, became law. The law’s main objective {{is to reduce the}} number of uninsured U. S. residents. Among its most important provisions, is the creation of new health insurance marketplaces, where consumers can choose from a range of health plan options and potentially receive tax credits to pay for coverage. Nationwide, new marketplaces are estimated {{to reduce the number of}} uninsured U. S. residents by more than 20 million over ten years. States have the option of implementing their own marketplace—a state-based marketplace (SBM) —or to defer responsibility to the federal government. North Carolina chose to defer to a Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM). FFM states have the option to engage in plan <b>management,</b> which includes <b>premium</b> rating standards, transparency, accreditation, geographic service areas, and premium rating areas. States who currently do not choose to or do not have the capacity to implement their own marketplace have the option to transition to a State-Federal Partnership or SBM, or conduct plan management, in the future. Given its high rate of uninsurance, increasing health insurance costs, and an apparent demand for health insurance, North Carolina policymakers should consider whether a FFM or SBM would better serve its residents. However, the state also needs to consider what additional responsibilities it would need to take on, and whether the benefits of a SBM exceed its costs from the perspective of North Carolina residents. In particular, North Carolina needs to consider what additional investments it needs to make in outreach and enrollment; how it will setup a viable IT system; impact of regulatory flexibility; and if it can garner the necessary political support to make marketplace implementation successful. The early experiences of SBM states are also instructive in the challenges and opportunities that come with implementing a SBM. This paper highlights how SBM implementation played out in two states that have gotten a lot of attention, Massachusetts and Kentucky, and key takeaways that will help North Carolina decide its future role in marketplace implementation. With more than 8 million enrollees in marketplaces across the country, including nearly 360, 000 in North Carolina, the state has an important decision to make. Should North Carolina take an active role in shaping its health insurance market, or maintain the status quo? There are arguments to be made on both sides of this issue, but under the assumption that ACA repeal is unlikely, it is important for policymakers in North Carolina to ask themselves whether they want the federal government to continue to manage their health insurance market for the foreseeable future. Recommendations I recommend North Carolina take on a more active role in the implementation of the ACA by taking the following steps: 1. 	Issue an executive order establishing a commission to evaluate the costs and benefits of establishing a SBM and issue a recommendation on whether or not North Carolina should implement an SBM. 2. 	Pass legislation enabling the North Carolina Department of Insurance to conduct plan management for health plans available on North Carolina’s marketplace. The above recommendations represent a balanced approach the state could take that acknowledge the political contentiousness around the ACA, and the fact that nearly 360, 000 North Carolinians have already enrolled in coverage. Indeed, now that approximately 8 million individuals have enrolled in coverage through marketplaces, it would be very difficult for Congress to repeal the ACA. In addition, depending on the draft language of the executive order, the commission North Carolina establishes could still have access to federal funding in 2014 to complete its work. Politics may continue to drive the direction of ACA implementation in North Carolina, however, by taking a more active role in plan management and establishing a commission to evaluate the costs and benefits of establishing a SBM, North Carolina would avoid the potential political fallout that may result if it immediately implemented a SBM. In addition, it would not be increasing costs to the state, and it would be taking steps to improve the quality of health plans available to residents...|$|R
