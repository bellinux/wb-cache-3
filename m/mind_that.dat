5|$|Although {{reference}} to major morphological {{categories such as}} root, stem, leaf, and trichome are useful, one has to keep in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> these categories are linked through intermediate forms so that a continuum between the categories results. Furthermore, structures {{can be seen as}} processes, that is, process combinations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always keep in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the remains they are working with were once a person.

5|$|In {{standardized}} tests, if {{a question}} asks about {{the behavior of}} even numbers, it might be necessary to keep in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> zero is even. Official publications relating to the GMAT and GRE tests both state that 0 is even.|$|E

5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} borne in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end, which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become, since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Die Another Day, the media began {{questioning}} whether or not Brosnan would reprise the role for a fifth time. At that time, Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> both fans and critics were very unhappy with Roger Moore playing the role until he (Moore) was 58, but he was receiving popular support from both critics and the franchise fanbase for a fifth instalment. For this reason, he remained enthusiastic about reprising his role.|$|E
5|$|The barbarisation theory, {{ultimately}} {{derived from}} Edward Gibbon's 18th-century magnum opus, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, contains two propositions. (1) That the late army recruited much {{greater numbers of}} barbarian-born troops than {{the army of the}} Principate; and (2) that the greater number of barbarian recruits resulted in a major decline of the army's effectiveness and was a leading factor in the collapse of the Western Roman empire. As discussed above, proposition (1) is probably correct, although it should be borne in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> probably about three-quarters of the late army's recruits remained Roman-born. This section considers proposition (2).|$|E

5|$|The creators likened {{themes of}} the episode to the Star Wars trilogy, {{referring}} to the revelations about Fox Mulder's father, and Sophie's Choice, referring to how the Mulders were forced to choose Fox or Samantha to be taken.

5|$|The {{status quo}} {{is no longer an}} option and there is an unquenchable desire for greater devolution. Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come.

5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E

He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to popular}} demand from citizens, Ben restarts the youth {{basketball}} league, although {{with only two}} teams. They are coached by Ron (Nick Offerman), who is extremely strict and disciplined with his players, and Andy (Chris Pratt), who is very laid back and lets his kids go out of control. Tom (Aziz Ansari), who referees the game, becomes jealous when his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives to support Ron. Tom insists he is happy with his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) and does not <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Wendy is dating Ron. However, Tom repeatedly calls false fouls against Ron's players until {{all of them are}} benched. When Ron and Wendy get angry, Tom ejects them from the games and declares it a forfeit, which concerns Lucy.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
