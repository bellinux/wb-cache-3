5|$|<b>Much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a {{renovation}} project, Domitian's building {{program was}} intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural renaissance.

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the culmination of the 'Pax Romana'.

Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ.

5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers.

Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million.

At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
