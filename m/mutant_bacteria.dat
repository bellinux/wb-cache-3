40|$|The omega subunit, the {{smallest}} subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase, {{is known to}} be involved in maintaining the conformation of the beta' subunit and aiding its recruitment {{to the rest of the}} core enzyme assembly in Escherichia coli. It has recently been shown in Mycobacterium smegmatis, by creating a deletion mutation of the rpoZ gene encoding omega that the physiological role of the m subunit also includes providing physical protection to beta. Interestingly, the mutant had altered colony morphology. This paper demonstrates that the mutant mycobacterium has pleiotropic phenotypes including reduced sliding motility and defective biofilm formation. Analysis of the spatial arrangement of biofilms by electron microscopy suggests that the altered phenotype of the mutant arises from a deficiency in generation of extracellular matrix. Complementation of the mutant strain with a copy of the wild-type rpoZ gene integrated in the bacterial chromosome restored both sliding motility and biofilm formation to the wild-type state, unequivocally proving the role of omega in the characteristics observed for the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium.</b> Analysis of the cell wall composition demonstrated that the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium</b> had an identical glycopeptidolipid profile to the wild-type, but failed to synthesize the short-chain mycolic acids characteristic of biofilm growth in M. smegmati...|$|R

50|$|ActA was {{discovered}} by analysing lecithinase-negative Tn917-lac Listeria mutants because of the phenotype that {{they were unable to}} spread from cell to cell. These <b>mutant</b> <b>bacteria</b> still escaped from the phagosomes as efficiently as wild-type bacteria and multiplied within the infected cells but they were not surrounded by actin like wild-type bacteria. Further analysis showed, that Tn917-lac had inserted into actA, the second gene of an operon. The third gene of this operon, plcB, encodes the L. monocytogenes lecithinase. To determine whether actA itself, plcB or other co-transcribed downstream regions are involved in actin assembly, mutations in the appropriate genes were generated. All mutants except the actA mutants were similar to wild-type concerning association with F-actin and cell-cell spreading.

50|$|Recently, {{another study}} has {{determined}} {{the organization of}} the bacteriochlorophyll molecules in green sulfur bacteria. Because they have been so difficult to study, the chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria are the last class of light-harvesting complexes to be characterized structurally by scientists.

To get around this problem, the team used a combination of different experimental approaches. Genetic techniques to create a <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium</b> with a more regular internal structure, cryo-electron microscopy to identify the larger distance constraints for the chlorosome, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the chlorosome's component chlorophyll molecules, and modeling to bring together all of the pieces and create a final picture of the chlorosome.|$|R
50|$|The gene in {{question}} is inactivated by insertional mutation; a transposon is used which inserts itself into the gene sequence. When that gene is transcribed and translated into a protein, the insertion of the transposon affects the protein structure and (in theory) prevents it from functioning. In STM, mutants are created by random transposon insertion and each transposon contains a different 'tag' sequence that uniquely identifies it. If an insertional <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium</b> exhibits a phenotype of interest, such as susceptibility to an antibiotic it was previously resistant to, its genome can be sequenced and searched (using a computer) {{for any of the}} tags used in the experiment. When a tag is located, the gene that it disrupts is also thus located (it will reside somewhere between a start and stop codon which mark the boundaries of the gene).|$|R
50|$|An early phase {{clinical}} trial using the platform of ‘Minicell’ nanoparticle for drug delivery {{have been tested}} on patients with advanced and untreatable cancer. Built from the membranes of <b>mutant</b> <b>bacteria,</b> the minicells were loaded with paclitaxel and coated with cetuximab, antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is often overexpressed {{in a number of}} cancers, as a 'homing' device to the tumor cells. The tumor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells have been derived, regard it as invading microorganism and engulf it. Once inside, the payload of anti-cancer drug kills the tumor cells. Measured at 400 nanometers, the minicell is bigger than synthetic particles developed for drug delivery. The researchers indicated that this larger size gives the minicells a better profile in side-effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver, digestive system and skin. This Phase 1 {{clinical trial}} demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patients. As a platform technology, the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti-cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side-effects.|$|E
50|$|To {{create the}} mutant, three genes were inactivated that green sulfur {{bacteria}} acquired late in their evolution. In this {{way it was}} possible to go backward in evolutionary time to an intermediate state with much less variable and better ordered chlorosome organelles than the wild-type. The chlorosomes were isolated from the mutant and the wild-type forms of the bacteria. Cryo-electron microscopy was used to take pictures of the chlorosomes. The images reveal that the chlorophyll molecules inside chlorosomes have a nanotube shape. The team then used MAS NMR spectroscopy to resolve the microscopic arrangement of chlorophyll inside the chlorosome. With distance constraints and DFT ring current analyses the organization was found to consist of unique syn-anti monomer stacking. The combination of NMR, cryo-electron microscopy and modeling enabled the scientists to determine that the chlorophyll molecules in green sulfur bacteria are arranged in helices. In the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacteria,</b> the chlorophyll molecules are positioned at a nearly 90-degree angle in relation to the long axis of the nanotubes, whereas the angle is less steep in the wild-type organism. The structural framework can accommodate disorder to improve the biological light harvesting function, which implies that a less ordered structure has a better performance.|$|E
50|$|While the {{production}} of public goods aims to benefit all individuals, it also leads {{to the evolution of}} cheaters, or individuals that do not pay the cost of producing a good, but still receive benefits (Figure 1). In order to minimize fitness costs, natural selection will favor individuals that do not to secrete while taking advantage of the secretions of their neighbors. In a population of siderophore secreting cells, non-secreting mutant cells do not pay the cost of secretion, but still gain the same benefit as the wild-type neighbors. Recently, Griffin et al. (2004) investigated the social nature of {{the production}} of siderophores in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When cells were grown in pure culture were placed in an iron-limiting environment, populations of cells that secreted siderophores (wild-type) outcompeted a population of mutant non-secretors. Therefore, siderophore production is beneficial when iron is limiting. However, when the same populations were placed in an iron-rich environment, the mutant population outcompeted wild-type population, demonstrating that siderophore production is metabolically costly. Finally, when both wild type and <b>mutant</b> <b>bacteria</b> were placed in the same mixed population, the mutants can gain the benefit of siderophore production without paying the cost, and hence increase in frequency. This concept is commonly referred to the tragedy of the commons.|$|E

Mutant plasmid PI 258 penI 443, which produces penicillinase constitutively in wild-type cells, was fully constitutive for penicillinase production when it was harbored by mutant 655 par- 1. Therefore, the bacterial mutation does not interfere directly with the transcription of the penZ gene or translation of the penicillinase messenger ribonucleic acid. Mutant plasmid PII 147 penI 220 was fully inducible in the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium,</b> even though the wild-type plasmid PII 147 was only partially inducible in the par- 1 mutant.

40|$|The {{cornerstone}} of population genetics is a probabilistic {{understanding of the}} ultimate fate—survival or extinction—of rare mutations. If a mutation is beneficial, it enables its carrier to reproduce faster than native wild-type individuals. In classic derivations and in the considerable body of research that has followed, “faster” has been defined mathematically to mean “able to produce more surviving offspring per generation. ” Many organisms, however, may increase their reproductive rate by producing {{the same number of}} offspring in a shorter generation time: a <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium,</b> for example, may complete the cell cycle and produce two offspring more quickly than the wild type. We find that the ultimate fixation probability of a mutation conferring a shorter generation time differs from that of a mutation conferring more offspring by a factor of 2 ln(2) —nearly 40 %.

One of these mutants appeared to be defective in multiplication in guinea pig lungs and spleens, yet it multiplies normally in guinea pig alveolar macrophages. Here we report further characterization of the mutated gene and its protein and the virulence role of the gene. The complete sequence of the gene, now called lvgA, is 627 bp long, and its protein product is approximately 27 kDa in size. lvgA was present in all 50 strains of L. pneumophila tested. No significant nucleic acid or protein homology {{was found in the}} GenBank database for the gene, nor were any distinctive motifs discovered in a search of other databases. The expression of both DotA and IcmX in the lvgA mutant was normal. Subcellular fractionation studies localized LvgA to the outer membrane fraction, and protease digestion studies suggested {{that at least some of}} the protein is surface expressed. No change in bacterial lipopolysaccharide composition or reactivity to serogroup-specific antisera was detected in the mutant. Growth competition studies with alveolar macrophages showed that the mutant was outcompeted by its parent 3 -fold in 24 h and 24 -fold in 48 h, in contrast to what was observed with the null phenotype in parallel testing with alveolar macrophages or with the A 549 alveolar epithelial cell line. This macrophage defect of the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium</b> was due to slower growth, as the mutant invaded alveolar macrophages normally. Electron microscopy showed that the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium</b> resided in a ribosome-studded phagosome in alveolar macrophages, with no distinction from its parent. The lvgA mutant was outcompeted by its parent about sixfold in guinea pig lungs and spleens; prolonged observation of infected animals showed no late-onset virulence of the mutant. Transcomplementation of the mutant restored the parental phenotype in guinea pigs. The lvgA mutant was twofold more susceptible to killing by human β-defensin 2 but not to killing by other cationic peptides, serum complement, or polymorphonuclear neutrophils. lvgA is a novel virulence gene that is responsible for pleiotropic functions involving both extracellular and intracellular bacterial resistance mechanisms...|$|R

In silico and transcriptional analyses suggest that this locus (genes FTL_ 0200 to FTL_ 0209 in the live vaccine strain [LVS]) constitutes an operon controlled by the alternative sigma factor σ 32. The first gene, FTL_ 0200, encodes a putative AAA+ ATPase of the MoxR subfamily. Insertion mutagenesis into genes FTL_ 0200, FTL_ 0205, and FTL_ 0206 revealed a role for the locus in both intracellular multiplication and in vivo survival of F. tularensis.

We have investigated the role of the C-terminal hexapeptide of SifA as a potential site for membrane anchoring. An S. typhimurium strain carrying a deletion of the se-quence encoding this hexapeptide (sifA 6) was found to be attenuated for systemic virulence in mice. In mouse macrophages, sifA 6 <b>mutant</b> <b>bacteria</b> displayed a re-duced association with vacuolar markers, similar to that of sifA null <b>mutant</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and exhibited a dra...|$|E
40|$|An Rc-mutant of Escherichia coli {{that lacks}} UDPgalactose 4 -epimerase grows {{normally}} without galactose but makes lipopolysaccharide lacking {{most of its}} carbohydrate. Exogenous galactose overrides the mutation and results {{in the formation of}} a complete lipopolysaccharide, thereby producing a smooth phenocopy. The smooth phenocopy was much more resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum than was the rough phenotype. More complement was utilized by the rough mutant in the bactericidal process than by the smooth phenocopy. An antiserum was prepared in rabbits to a specific outer membrane protein in the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium,</b> the lambda receptor, whose expression could be suppressed by the addition of 10 mM maltose. The effect of the O-antigen in the lipopolysaccharide produced by the smooth phenocopy on the binding of antibody to the lambda receptor was determined. The smooth phenocopy exhibited significantly less binding of antibody than did the rough phenocopy. In addition, expression of the lambda receptor had little effect on the binding of antibody to the lambda receptor in the smooth phenocopy but caused significantly increased binding in the rough mutant. The results suggest that the increased resistance to the lethal action of normal human serum shown by the smooth phenocopy {{may be due to the}} blocking of antibody binding sites by the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide, thereby preventing activation of the classical pathway of complement...|$|R
40|$|Although cyclic glucans {{have been}} shown to be {{important}} for a number of symbiotic and pathogenic bacterium–plant interactions, their precise roles are unclear. Here, we examined the role of cyclic β-(1, 2) -glucan in the virulence of the black rot pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (Xcc). Disruption of the Xcc nodule development B (ndvB) gene, which encodes a glycosyltransferase required for cyclic glucan synthesis, generated a mutant that failed to synthesize extracellular cyclic β-(1, 2) -glucan and was compromised in virulence in the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Infection of the <b>mutant</b> <b>bacterium</b> in N. benthamiana was associated with enhanced callose deposition and earlier expression of the PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1 (PR- 1) gene. Application of purified cyclic β-(1, 2) -glucan prior to inoculation of the ndvB mutant suppressed the accumulation of callose deposition and the expression of PR- 1 in N. benthamiana and restored virulence in both N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis plants. These effects were seen when cyclic glucan and bacteria were applied either to the same or to different leaves. Cyclic β-(1, 2) -glucan–induced systemic suppression was associated with the transport of the molecule throughout the plant. Systemic suppression is a novel counterdefensive strategy that may facilitate pathogen spread in plants and may have important implications for the understanding of plant–pathogen coevolution and for the development of phytoprotection measures...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a method}} for constructing <b>mutants</b> in <b>bacteria</b> that are not amenable to mutant isolation by conventional means. A one-step marker exchange procedure was used to construct nitrogen fixation (nif) mutants of the obligate methane-utilizing bacterium Methylosinus sp. strain 6, using transposon 5 (Tn 5) -containing nif genes cloned into pBR 325. The resultant mutants appeared to contain defects in nif structural genes, and DNA hybridization analysis showed that although {{one out of five}} had apparently been produced as a result of double-crossover homologous recombination, a variety of molecular events had led to the production of the other four mutants...|$|R
