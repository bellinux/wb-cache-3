Yorke wrote his 2006 solo single [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] about David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destructions</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> <b>In</b> a 2008 television performance of [...] "House of Cards", Yorke dedicated the chorus lyric, [...] "denial, denial", to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases.

The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that {{there was no evidence of}} weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and that invading the country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's 12 February 2003 report. On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.|$|E

It contained a number of allegations according to which Iraq also possessed WMD, including chemical weapons and biological weapons.

Subsequent investigation revealed that the September Dossier had been altered, on Campbell's orders, to be consistent with a speech given by George W.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the recent}} U. S. -led {{invasion}} of Iraq, serious questions have arisen over truth claims made {{to justify the}} war and the reporting of these claims in the media. These include allegations about weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> (WMD) <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> and possible links between Saddam Hussein’s regime and terrorist groups like al Qaeda. Prior to the invasion of Iraq there was some debate over the legitimacy of these claims and subsequent information from Iraq reveals that {{there were a number of}} inadequacies. The paper examines the extent to which American newspapers and their counterparts in Canada, India and the United Kingdom accurately presented information on Iraq to their readers during the build-up to the invasion and the extent to which the selection of sources played a role in the reporting. A content analysis of the specific claims was performed on articles published during the period between 9 / 11 and the invasion of Iraq. Results were compared between American papers and their international counterparts, including a discussion of how the selection of sources influenced the discourse...|$|R

2500|$|Opposition to {{a would-be}} {{military}} attack on Iran followed several {{claims that the}} United States and/or Israel might carry out such an attack, in relation to claims that Iran may try to produce nuclear weapons. Some analysts say that Iran's potential production of nuclear weapons is {{the real reason for}} an attack, while others say that it is an excuse. Noam Chomsky claims that the real reason for a would-be attack would be to [...] "control Middle East energy resources", in particular petroleum. and physicist Jorge Hirsch claims that the real reason is that the US wishes to demonstrate its intent and capability to [...] "use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries". Starting in 2005, these analysts, including Seymour Hersh, former UN weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> inspector <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> from 1991 to 1998, Scott Ritter, Joseph Cirincione, director for non-proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Professor at the University of San Francisco and Middle East editor for the Foreign Policy in Focus, Stephen Zunes claimed that the United States planned a military attack against Iran.

5000|$|Detailed {{questioning}} {{covered the}} Iran-Iraq War and {{his use of}} chemical weapons against Iranians. Saddam denied repeated assertions by his interrogator of a current weapons of <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> capability <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> yet had resisted U.N. weapons inspections because he [...] "was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities than the repercussions of the United States for his refusal to allow U.N. inspectors back into Iraq," [...] according to the reports. The former leader reportedly maintained {{that he did not}} collaborate with Al-Qaeda, as had been suggested by George W. Bush administration officials in support of its policy of regime change <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Saddam said he feared Al-Qaeda would have turned on him, and was quoted calling Osama bin Laden a [...] "zealot." [...] The face-to-face sessions were conducted by Assyrian American George Piro, an FBI supervisory special agent (SSA), one of only a few FBI agents who spoke Arabic fluently. Saddam was led to believe that his interrogator was a high-ranking U.S. government official with direct access to U.S. President George W. Bush, when in reality he was in a relatively low-level position at the time.Piro discussed the interrogation process during an interview on the television news magazine 60 Minutes in January 2008.In an official statement, a senior FBI official in Piro’s chain of command characterized the perceived success of their interrogation of Saddam Hussein as one of the agency's top accomplishments in its 100-year history.|$|R

In diverse publications and interviews he underlined the priority of civil rights and democratic principles over other interests of the state. The new laws issued after 9/11 in Germany, the US and other countries were seen as largely problematic by him, produced in great haste, going too far and even not being efficient. In 2005, the War on Terror was described by him as a dangerous development in international politics in German TV (3sat): „It was forgotten that one has to respect one's own principles when fighting terrorism. If one totally forgets about one's own core values, it is not worth it.“ His condemnation of secret actions of the CIA directed against Muslim individuals in Europe, which included illegal kidnappings, in 2005 received wide attention in the press. In 2011 he organized a conference on secret services and the question of ethics ("Ethik und Nachrichtendienste") at the Evangelische Akademie Bad Boll, with the participation of important representatives of the international intelligence community, from the USA, Russia, Israel, France among others.|$|R

The combination of the various bands of the images is called pan-sharpening and it can be carried on using different algorithms and strategies.
