A decade and a half later, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt would also attack the city and destroy its fortified wall closest to the sea, as well as its citadel. However, by that time, <b>Mocha's</b> trade in its country's precious commodity of coffee grains (Coffea arabica) had already been supplanted by Ethiopia which was the principal trader of this commodity to North Africa and which sold for a third of the price of the same coffee imported from Arabia.|$|R
5000|$|Tradition {{has it that}} Caolán was so {{impressed}} with Colman's potential as a Christian apostle and with his charism for performing miracles that he sent him to visit various other monasteries so that he might learn from the religious practices and forms of community life he would encounter there and enjoy the opportunity of more extensive learning, especially in Holy Scripture. To perfect his knowledge of the Scriptures St. Colman went to the great school of Emly, c. 470 or 475, and remained there some years. At length he returned to Mahee Island to see his old master, St. <b>Mochae,</b> and remained under his guidance for a long period, acting as assistant in the school.

6000|$|The ideal in expression, then, deals {{also with}} the generic, and evades {{embarrassing}} particulars in a generalization. We say Tragedy with the dagger and bowl, and it means something very different to the aesthetic sense from Tragedy with the case-knife and the phial of laudanum, though these would be as effectual for murder. It was a misconception of this that led poetry into that slough of poetic diction where everything {{was supposed to be}} made poetical by being called something else, and something longer. A boot became [...] "the shining leather that the leg encased"; coffee, [...] "the fragrant juice of <b>Mocha's</b> berry brown," [...] whereas the imaginative way is the most condensed and shortest, conveying to the mind a feeling of the thing, and not a paraphrase of it. Akin to this was a confounding of the pictorial with the imaginative, and personification with that typical expression which is the true function of poetry. Compare, for example, Collins's Revenge with Chaucer's.|$|R
2500|$|In 1900, Rodolfo Armando Philippi named both Mus tarsalis (from Valdivia Province in {{mainland}} Chile) and Reithrodon longicaudatus (from {{a small island}} near Chiloé), {{both of which are}} now classified as Irenomys tarsalis. Philippi's Reithrodon longicaudatus was transferred into a new genus, Irenomys, by Oldfield Thomas in February 1919. The name, which means [...] "peace mouse" [...] in Greek, referred to the end of World War I four months before. Another of the species Philippi described in 1900, Mus <b>mochae,</b> was later transferred to Irenomys because of a mismatch between the skin and skull, but it is in fact a member of the genus Abrothrix and not closely related to Irenomys. In his 1943 work on The mammals of Chile, Wilfred Hudson Osgood recognized the close relation between Philippi's Mus tarsalis and Reithrodon longicaudatus and referred them to a single species, then called Irenomys tarsalis. Osgood retained two subspecies, Irenomys tarsalis tarsalis on the mainland and Irenomys tarsalis longicaudatus on Chiloé and nearby islands, on the basis of slight differences in pelage coloration. In the few mature specimens of the latter subspecies that Osgood had, the underparts are somewhat lighter than in examples of I. t. tarsalis, which has a pinkish color in the underparts, but Osgood stressed that further material could well indicate that the two forms could not be distinguished.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} monastic {{settlements in}} Ireland emerged {{at the end}} of the fifth century. It was from Illtud and his colleagues that the Irish sought guidance on matters of ritual and discipline. Enda of Aran is called the [...] "patriarch of Irish monasticism". A warrior prince of Oriel, upon the death of his betrothed he decided to study for the priesthood. He first joined St Ailbe at Emly, before travelling to Ninian’s Candida Casa in Scotland, where he was ordained. About 484 he established the first Irish monastery at Killeaney on Aran Mor. Finnian of Clonard is said to have studied under Cadoc at Llancarfan in Glamorganshire. Finnian of Moville studied under Colman of Dromore and <b>Mochae</b> of Noendrum, before he too went to Candida Casa. Ireland was a rural society of chieftains living in the countryside. As in Wales, if a clan chieftain accepted Christianity so did those he ruled. Commonly Irish monasteries were established by grants of land to an abbot or abbess who came from a local noble family. The monastery became the spiritual focus of the tribe or kin group. Successive abbots and abbesses were members of the founder’s family, a policy which kept the monastic lands under the jurisdiction of the family (and corresponded to Irish legal tradition, which only allowed the transfer of land within a family).In Ireland, the abbot was often called [...] "coarb", a term designating the heir of successor of the founder.|$|R

40|$|Drill-strings are slender {{structures}} used {{to drill}} the oil-well {{in searching for}} oil and gas. Failures of drill-strings cause the loss {{of time and money}} and therefore predicting fatigue damage induced by vibrations is of benefit. In this thesis, fatigue calculation of drill-strings is conducted in both time domain and frequency domain, considering axial and torsional vibrations. In time domain analysis, the stress time histories at any specific location of the drillstring are obtained from a finite element model. Both deterministic and random excitations are taken into account. Then using a rainflow counting method, the damaging stress cycles are extracted. Based on the linear cumulative damage law, fatigue damage is then calculated and fatigue life of the drill-string is therefore predicted. Results under both deterministic and random excitations are compared against each other. Time domain fatigue analysis gives accurate predictions at the cost of long calculating time. For the sake of time-saving, a method in frequency domain is developed. The drill-string vibration model is built using continuous parameter method. Power spectral densities (PSD) of the random excitation are assumed. In the process to gain expected damage, equivalent stress spectra are calculated based on <b>Mocha’s</b> random fatigue failure criterion. Then the expected fatigue damage and predicted life are estimated by a spectral method: Dirlik’s method. Further, the drill-pipe threaded connection, which is used to connect numerous drillpipes collars to form a drill-string, is investigated. With the help of ANSYS workbench 15. 0, a standard 4. 5 ” API line pipe threaded connection model is built. Random excitation is considered mainly due to the unevenness of rock formation being drilled. Firstly, a static stress analysis is conducted considering "make-up" and "tensile load" steps. Then modal analysis and random vibration analysis are conducted, assuming acceleration PSD as input. Finally, based on three-band technique, the fatigue damage is calculated. Computer simulations are run and results are given by the above three fatigue damage calculation methods. Results show the critical positions of both the drill-string and the threaded connection, where attention should be paid to by the manufacturers and the drilling operators. Although some limitations exist, this thesis proposed two ways to evaluate fatigue damage of a drill-string. The threaded pipe connection, which is a complex structure, is also analyzed. Further research work will aim at the validation of the simulations...|$|R
