5|$|Location of ambush {{and death}} : A number of reports {{have come down}} of Troilus' death {{variously}} mentioning water, exercising horses and the Thymbra, though they do not necessarily build into a coherent whole: the First Vatican Mythographer reports that Troilus was exercising outside Troy when Achilles attacked him; a commentator on Ibycus says that Troilus was slain by Achilles in the Thymbrian precinct outside Troy; Eustathius of Thessalonica's commentary on the Iliad says that Troilus was exercising his horses there; Apollodorus says that Achilles ambushed Troilus inside the temple of Thymbrian Apollo; finally, Statius reports that Troilus was speared to death as he fled around Apollo's walls. Gantz struggles to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he sees as contradictory material, feeling that Achilles' running down of Troilus' horse makes no sense if Troilus was just fleeing to the nearby temple building. He speculates that the ambush at the well and the sacrifice in the temple could be two {{different versions of the}} story or, alternatively, that Achilles takes Troilus to the temple to sacrifice him as an insult to Apollo.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{acceptance}} of Revelation into the canon has from the beginning been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was heterodox, and what was even heretical. Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature (its purpose is offering hope to the downtrodden), and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context. Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the author may have intended.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are {{variable in the}} manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who are able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E

2500|$|In Blumenthal's view, {{experiments}} such {{as these}} show that our appreciation of food is subjective, determined by information sent by the senses to the brain: [...] "the {{ways in which we}} <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we are eating and decide {{whether we like it or}} not depend to a large extent on memory and contrast. Memory provides us with a range of references – flavours, tastes, smells, sights, sounds, emotions – that we draw on continually as we eat." [...] His dishes, therefore, tend to be designed to appeal to the senses in concert, and through this to trigger memories, associations and emotions. Thus the Nitro-poached Green Tea and Lime Mousse on the Fat Duck menu is served with spritz of ‘lime grove’ scent from an atomiser; and the Jelly of Quail dish includes among its tableware a bed of oak moss, as well as being accompanied by a specially created scent of oak moss that is dispersed at the table by means of dry ice.|$|E
60|$|I {{had some}} plate and some jewels, {{as might be}} supposed, my fortune and former {{circumstances}} considered; and my husband, who had never stayed to be distressed, had not been put to the necessity of rifling me, as husbands usually do in such cases. But as I had seen an end of all the ready money during the long time I had lived {{in a state of}} expectation for my husband, so I began to make away one thing after another, till those few things of value which I had began to lessen apace, and I saw nothing but misery and the utmost distress before me, even to have my children starve before my face. I leave any one that is a mother of children, and has lived in plenty and in good fashion, to consider and reflect what must be my condition. As to my husband, I had now no hope or expectation of seeing him any more; and indeed, if I had, {{he was a man of}} all the men in the world the least able to help me, or to have turned his hand to the gaining one shilling towards lessening our distress; he neither had the capacity or the inclination; he could have been no clerk, for he scarce wrote a legible hand; he was so far from being able to write sense, that he could not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> others wrote; he was so far from understanding good English, that he could not spell good English; to be out of all business was his delight, and he would stand leaning against a post for half-an-hour together, with a pipe in his mouth, with all the tranquillity in the world, smoking, like Dryden's countryman, that whistled as he went for want of thought, and this even when his family was, as it were, starving, that little he had wasting, and that we were all bleeding to death; he not knowing, and as little considering, where to get another shilling when the last was spent.|$|E

Both are imaginary.|$|R

40|$|The {{presenter}} {{poses the}} argument that the Alice books by Lewis Carroll can be seen as Alice’s apprenticeship as a storyteller. By extension, it provides a model of how language play and narratives always work towards recruiting listeners, readers and spectators to become re-tellers and story-makers themselves. Alice recites and listens to verses and songs, she <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> she experiences during her adventures, she engages in verbal dueling and wordplay, and she learns to accept and invite the fantastic without losing herself. At the close of Alice in Wonderland she even recounts her dream-story to her sister, in turn making the sister recall fragments of the story. Thus, we see already in the frame story the invitation to readers/listeners/critics to perpetuate Alice’s adventures ad infinitum, a process, which in the end leads to Alice “escaping her narration” and turning her into an example of “written folklore. ...|$|R

40|$|The central {{question}} of this thesis is: {{what is the}} relationship between speech and the world? I address this question through Merleau-Ponty's late philosophy of language, specifically as it is elaborated in his posthumously published work The Visible and the Invisible. I draw upon his notions of invariance, the visible and the invisible, and reversibility. Using these notions, I posit that the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the situation in which we speak, both precedes and <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is said. In responding to this {{central question}}, I draw upon the interpretations of both Martin C. Dillon and Renaud Barbaras. I employ the work of Dillon in order to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the notion of reversibility and, in order to give weight to the idea that the relationship between speech and the world is characterized by reversibility, I consider Merleau-Ponty's view of metaphor, as it is interpreted by Barbaras. This exploration illustrates that reversibility is operative even in our mundane use of metaphoric language. In sum, in this work, I consider the relationship between speech and the world. I argue that speech cannot be properly understood in absence of its worldly situation. In that, it is the situation in which one speaks that <b>makes</b> the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> an expression intelligible and I demonstrate that this understanding <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> is articulated by Merleau-Ponty through his notion of reversibility...|$|R
