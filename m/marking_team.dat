40|$|On the University of Dundee’s Masters in Medical Education online {{distance}} learning programme, students were feeling {{a sense of}} isolation {{and a lack of}} dialogue around assessment. For example one student commented “it is very lonely working through assignments at distance” echoing other students’ evaluations. Staff were also concerned by the lack of continuity in terms of establishing a relationship with the student or a shared context for the assessment task which is crucial for effective feedback. There was no formal way of knowing whether the student had engaged with or acted on feedback provided or even understood it. Feedback timeliness, quality and quantity were inconsistent across the <b>marking</b> <b>team.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{improvement}} {{in health care}} is an essential attribute towards maintaining quality while meeting today’s growing patient populations, budget constraints, and competitive environments. Such challenges are not exclusive to health care. Other high-risk industries aviation, for example have shown excellent approaches to focusing on quality while increasing efficiency and client-centeredness. In this thesis, studies on the application of six industrial quality and safety improvement methods in eye hospitals are described: business process reengineering, safety <b>marking,</b> <b>team</b> resource management, quality costing, value chain analysis, and benchmarking. The {{studies show that the}} application (and adaptation) of these methods can be successful and result in various positive safety and efficiency outcomes. Mirroring other industries stimulates critical reflection while catalyzing the diffusion of innovations. Health care providers are urged to have divergent views, create a data-driven culture, and cooperate with health service researchers to create an evidence-based management practice and be, in itself, a vehicle for change...|$|E
40|$|The {{presentation}} will {{be devoted}} to current practice to the staff feedback on assessment. Every year we receive NSS results, which seem to be particularly low {{in relation to the}} assessment feedback, so a short survey has been carried out to ask students regarding their views on staff feedback. Results of this survey led to a practice dilemma to adapt and develop alternative ways to assessment feedback provision. This workshop is based on a pilot work, which was carried out during the 2013 - 14 academic year. Students (MSc and BSc levels) were offered to try out a different approach to feedback. Proposed new approach to assessment feedback was based on works by Race (2010). The main steps include: planning and preparation, standardisation, very focused marking period (spped marking in 2 - 3 working days) and moderation. Overall the <b>marking</b> <b>team</b> produced high quality feedback outcomes in much shorter marking times. Students were offered feedback without marks via Blackboard and later were invited to discuss feedback without marks during a brief individual tutorial. Extremely positive evaluations were received from our students - 100 % satisfaction, which has never happened in my practice earlier. There are some practical limitations to this approach, which were discussed during this workshop...|$|E
40|$|Ideas from phenomenography inform {{this study}} to {{investigate}} variation in staff experiences of a decision to introduce digitally shared academic supervision record keeping in a university-based School of Healthcare Sciences in the United Kingdom. At the time, the school's assessment and feedback strategy entitled students to individual formative supervision feedback on all draft essays before submitting them for summative assessment. Prior to the move to a shared digital record, records of supervisory events were stored in individual email inboxes or networked file-store, {{as well as on}} paper that was sometimes held in more than one location for the same student. A blogging platform within the university's virtual learning environment was used because, while it allowed students to only view their own records, the whole academic <b>marking</b> <b>team</b> could access any of the students' records. Lave and Wenger’s ‘Legitimate Peripheral Participation’ provides a theoretical lens for analysis of data collected in interviews with four staff who were selected to represent variations between and within the 'old-timers' and 'new-comers'. The phenomenographic 'outcome space' table is eschewed in favour of a narrative presentation of data that seeks to provide a 'direct encounter' with the phenomena of interest. As such, it represents a case study of informal networked learning, by those on the journey of 'newcomers' from the periphery to full participation and those who guide them. This analysis is challenged by the data, given the varied ways in which staff approached the change to digitally shared supervision record keeping and how the shared records were or were not taken up as a resource to help new staff learn the practice of academic supervision. Staff who had recently moved into academic roles from senior positions in clinical practice experienced dissonance when adjusting to a more permissive information security regime. The study offers insights into the cultural conceptual 'baggage' that can inhibit productive networked learning and the importance of human actors to encourage it and overcome these barriers. The role of students in challenging recalcitrant 'old-timers' into adopting the new digital practice is noted. These actors are held to speak back to theories within networked learning, actor-network theory and Lave and Wenger's communities of practice...|$|E

40|$|Technology is {{confirmed}} {{to be an}} effective tool for assessment and feedback, in particular for computer-assisted assessment (Irons, 2008; Challis, 2005), producing feedback (Heinrich et al., 2009) and publishing feedback (Bloxham and Boyd, 2007; Denton, 2003; Denton et al., 2008). The arrival of affordable mobile devices has introduced a new means for enhancing the above practices (Fabian and MacLean, 2014; Plimmer and Mason, 2006; Salem, 2013). Student preferences to smart phones and tablet devices steer the technological innovation towards ubiquitous mobile connectivity. Inspired by the benefits of such life and study style, educators have started exploring the use of these technologies. Tablet computers prove to become their preferred choice as they resolve some of the limitations associated with the design, readability and comprehensiveness of the feedback for mobile devices with smaller screens (Strain-Seymour, 2013, Rootman-le Grange and Lutz, 2013). This paper reports how tablets and the Form Connext mobile app have been used for engaging a sample of 300 Business Studies students in in-class online assessment and designing and providing timely comprehensive feedback. The study has followed an action research strategy that is grounded on a continuous and dynamic process of reflection (Carr and Kemmis, 2003) on the effectiveness of assessment of student projects documented electronically through wikis and electronic portfolios. It refines the use of tablets for summative and formative assessment of the project-based learning tasks through three review cycles, each of which incorporated a Reflection and Improvements stage. The experience resulted in enhancement of assessment strategies and contribution to the development of contemporary models of learning through effective assessment and feedback (Carr and Kemmis, 2003). The results of the work confirm that tablet computers are an effective tool in assessing e-materials in larger classes for two primary reasons. Firstly, design of e-forms facilitates rigorous process of reflection and understanding assessment criteria that in turn benefit students when preparing for the assessment. Hence, legible and detailed feedback is produced anytime anywhere with synchronous updates within the <b>marking</b> <b>team.</b> Secondly, students benefit from immediate comprehensive feedback allowing them to reflect on and improve their understanding of subject matters, as well as to engage in discussing specific details of the work that are captured through the form. An unexpected outcome was the enhanced reputation and respect to the tutors amongst students, the triggering of student curiosity and enthusiasm in applying similar approach to their own work. The diffusion for the practice amongst other units and identifying other purposes for which the mobile app could be used are also seen as achievements exceeding the expectations of the project team...|$|E
