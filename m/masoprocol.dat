40|$|PDI, protein {{disulfide}} isomerase, {{is one of}} {{the most}} versatile proteins and highly expressed in mammalian cells because there is a vast number of proteins that must undergo processing before secretion to their final destinations. PDI has several functions: oxidation of nascent proteins and isomerization of existing disulfide bonds. It also possesses chaperone activity and participates in protein degradation. Because of its structure, PDI can exist in a reduced or oxidized form. In mammalian cells it is mostly reduced due to the high demand of disulfide bond shuffling of secreted proteins within the ER, PDI a, a’, and b’ posses the ability to facilitate substrate folding. In our experiments we are using rat PDI and according to the sequence there are cysteine residues located in a and a’ domains. These cysteine residues may contribute to the catalytic activity of this domain and will be analyzed in future studies. Misfolded proteins, and the associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, are emerging as hallmarks of age- and neurodegeneration-related disorders such as Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent and compelling evidence has linked nitrosative stress and the ER-resident oxidoreductase, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), to the pathogenesis of PD and AD. Overexpression of PDI has been found to reduce the formation of polyubiquitinated proteins, making the oxidoreductase an important target for therapeutic intervention in PD, AD and other age- and neurodegeneration-related disorders. We demonstrate the NO-scavenging ability of the biphenolic natural products curcumin and <b>masoprocol</b> and the concomitant prevention of S-nitrosylation of PDI by a model NO-donor. Furthermore, both ethnopharmaceuticals accelerate protein fold acquisition in their neat and nitrated forms, making them attractive candidates for prevention of age- and neurodegeneration-related diseases. ...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{disulfide}} isomerase (PDI), {{the chief}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -resident oxidoreductase chaperone, {{is known to}} catalyze the maturation of disulfide-bond-containing proteins primarily through oxidation-reduction and isomerization functions. The ratedetermining step in the oxidative regeneration path of disulfide-bond-containing proteins generally couples chemical thiol-disulfide-exchange reactions to a physical conformational folding reaction. I have determined the impact of PDI and its subdomains on the ratedetermining step in ribonuclease A folding and on the physical structure-forming step of select ER-processed proteins including RNase A. This was facilitated through application of a novel chemical tool to exclusively populate native-disulfide-containing intermediates in unstructured forms. The described biochemical inroad permits a deconvoluted study of the physical halfprocess in the rate-determining step from its chemical counterpart. Analysis of folding kinetics of RNase A and other proteins reveal that the highly evolved oxidoreductase activity of PDI masks its chaperone-like activity, impedes conformational folding of ER-processed proteins, and limits its potential to accelerate the rate-determining step in oxidative regeneration. Implications of the heretofore unknown and anomalous self-limiting behavior of PDI {{are discussed in the}} context of oxidative maturation and misfolding in vivo. ^ Nitrosative stress has recently been demonstrated as a causal in a select sporadic variant of Parkinson’s (PD) and Alzheimer’s (AD) diseases. Specifically, elevated levels of Nitric Oxide (NO) disrupt the redox activity of protein disulfide isomerase by S-nitroso modification of its redox-active cysteines. This leads to accumulation of misfolded AD- and PD-specific proteins. I have recently demonstrated in vitro that polyphenolic phytochemicals, curcumin and <b>masoprocol,</b> can prevent S-nitroso-PDI formation by scavenging NO*. In this study, using dopaminergic SHSY- 5 Y cells, I have monitored the aggregation of green-fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged synphilin- 1 (a known constituent of PD Lewy neurites) as a function of rotenoneinduced nitrosative stress. Importantly, I demonstrate a marked decrease in synphilin- 1 aggregation when the cell line is previously incubated with 3, 5 -bis (2 -flurobenzylidene) piperidin- 4 -one (EF 24), a curcumin analogue, prior to rotenone insult. Furthermore, my data also reveal that rotenone attenuates PDI expression in the same cell line, a phenomenon that can be mitigated through EF 24 intervention. I was also interested to investigate the bioavailability of EF 24 through binding assay with a specific carrier protein, human serum albumin (HSA). With high affinity binding sites, HSA is a major transporter for delivering several endogenous compounds and drugs in vivo. In this dissertation, the binding parameters of EF 24 to HSA have been determined. ^ Together, these results suggest that polyphenolic phytochemical EF 24 can exert neuroprotective effects by ameliorating nitrosative stress-linked damage to PDI and the associated onset of PD in tested models. Essentially, EF 24 can serve as a scaffold for the design and development of PD and AD specific prophylactics. ^ Another aspect of this dissertation was to investigate the role of PDI in cancer. PDI can bind to estrogens as well as interact with its receptor protein (i. e., estrogen receptors (Er) α and β, respectively). It has previously been shown that PDI also acts as an intracellular 17 β-estradiol (E 2) -binding protein that transports and accumulates E 2 in live cells. Intracellular PDI-bound E 2 can be released from PDI upon a drop in E 2 levels; the released E 2 can augment estrogen receptor-mediated transcriptional activity and mitogenic action in cultured cells by modulating the Erβ/Erα ratio. In this dissertation, I observed a significant increase in Erβ/Erα ratio, upon rotenone-induced insult to PDI. Specifically, rotenone-induced insult to PDI leads to the down regulation of ERα and up-regulation of ERβ proteins, respectively. My data also shoId that the PDI-dependent disruption of the estrogenic status of cells can be restored through intervention by the polyphenolic curcumin analog, diphenyl difluoroketone (EF 24), which acts by rescuing PDI from reactive oxygen species-induced damage. My study indicates that EF 24 can {{play a vital role in}} maintaining estrogenic status in target cells suggesting future applications in select cancers. ...|$|E
