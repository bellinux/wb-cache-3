40|$|This study {{provides}} the first quantitative geochemical, petrological, and mineralogical data on major rock types and minerals in the Kafubu area. Highly magnesian talc-chlorite ± actinolite ± magnetite metabasites hosting emerald mineralization {{are identified as}} metamorphosed komatiites. These rocks contain 3000 - 4000 ppm Cr, and provided the amount of this element necessary for the crystallization of emeralds. Associated amphibolites of andesitic and basaltic-andesitic composition are low in chromium. The estimated equilibration temperatures during regional metamorphism, using amphibole-plagioclase thermometry on several amphibolite samples, gave a narrow interval of 590 - 630 °C, assuming a pressure of 400 - 600 MPa. This metamorphic event pre-dates the emerald mineralization and the emplacement of pegmatite dikes. Emerald-bearing phlogopite schists are confined to the contacts of quartz-tourmaline veins and quartz-feldspar pegmatites with magnesian metabasites. The quartz-tourmaline veins and pegmatite dikes are genetically related to a hidden fertile granite pluton. The formation of phlogopite schists from metabasite {{was associated with the}} introduction of ca. 8 - 10 wt. % K 2 O, 3 - 4 wt. % fluorine, 0. 12 - 0. 74 wt. % Li 2 O, 1700 - 2900 ppm Rb, and spikes of beryllium. Quartz-feldspar pegmatites of the Kafubu area, often evolved as albite-dominated types, belong to the rare-element pegmatites of the LCT family (i. e., Li-Cs-Ta), with common beryllium enrichment. The identification of several Nb-Ta minerals (manganocolumbite-manganotantalite, niobian rutile, tantalian rutile, and plumbomicrolite) underlines the geochemical typology of pegmatites. High activities of fluorine (up to 4 wt. % F in phlogopite schists) and boron (in exceptionally abundant tourmaline) probably functioned as solidus/liquidus depressants during evolution of mineralizing fluids and their separation from the parent granite. These fluids deposited quartz-tourmaline veins, and altered the adjacent metabasites into emerald-bearing phlogopite schists. Thus, {{in the case of the}} Kafubu emerald area, the classical explanation for the origin of emeralds in schist-related deposits still stands. Data on pegmatite occurrences in active mines and exploration pits, and their extrapolation into the surrounding area, point to the existence of a single, major Kafubu pegmatite field that overlaps the extensive horizons of Cr-rich metabasite. 40 K/ 40 Ar dating of muscovite from a <b>muscovite</b> <b>pegmatite</b> and a quartz-tourmaline-muscovite vein accompanying the Be-mineralization records closure of the system within the interval of 452 - 447 Ma. ...|$|E
40|$|The granite-pegamatites of the {{northern}} areas of Pakistan are well-known for hosting of various types of gemstones such as the aquamarine, topaz, bi-and tri-colored tourmalines, apatite fluorite etc. The Shigar valley pegmatites are also one of these that hold a variety of gemstones, This valley is about 32 km northeast of Skardu, the headquarter of Baltistan, northern Pakistan and it provides a route to K 2 mountains. Both meta-igneous and meta-sedimentary rocks of the Asian plate and Kohistan-Ladakh island arc, are exposed in the Shigar valley. The Main Karakoram Thrust is passing {{through the center of}} this valley, separating the meta-sediments of the Asian plate from the meta-igneous and meta-sediments of Kohistan-Ladakh island arc Multiphase metamorphism and deformation has occurred in this area, therefore, the meta-sediments {{to the north of the}} Northern Suture are collectively known as the "Karakoram Metamorphic Complex". The grade of metamorphism varies from greenschist to amphibolite grade facies. Besides, the multi phase metamorphism and deformation, igneous intrusions of both the pre-and post-collisions are also exposed in the valley. The last phase of post-collisional igneous intrusion is present in the form of leucogranites and gem-bearing pegmatites (the focus of present study). The pegmatitic rocks need special attention to understand their petrogenesis because these are of dual nature. They occur either the off shoots of near by plutonic bodies or separate magmatic pulses due to direct anataxis. There are series off different processes involving the emplacement of plutonic units, the formation of pegmatile, and their host gemstones and the rare element-hearing minerals. The present study is being carried out to understand the petrogenetic evolution of the Shigar valley pegmatites and the formation different types of gemstones in these pegmatites. A reconnaissance field work was carried out in the study area and the samples were collected from different pegmatite bodies for petrographic, geochemical studies and mineral chemistry. On the basis of field features and petrographic studies, the pegmatites of the Shigar valley are broadly classified into two types: gem-bearing and gem-barren pegmatites. The gem-bearing pegmatites are generally zoned having three or four zones, while the gem-barren pegmatites are simple both in mineralogy and internal structure. Symmetrical zoning is the common feature of the gem-bearing zoned pegmatites, while some of the dykes exhibit asymmetrical zoning. Besides this, on the basis of presence or absence or the relative proportion of the accessory mineral phases, these pegmatites are further classified into four suh-classes. These four suh-classes are: 1. muscovite-schorl-beyl-garnet pegmatites, 2. muscovite-schorl pegmatites. 3. biotite Â± garnetÂ± <b>muscovite</b> <b>pegmatite</b> and 4. muscovite-biotite Â± garnet pegmatite. " The petrographic and mineral chemistry data of the studied rocks and gemstones indicate that no rare element-bearing mineral phases have been identified in these pegmatites. This suggests that these pegmatites belong to the miarolitic pegmatite class instead of rare element pegmatite class. The gemstones found in the Shigar valley are mainly aquamarine, topaz, fluorite, apatite, tourmaline, axinite, zoisite and clinozoisite etc. Field study suggests that all the gemstones are not of pegmatitic origin but some of them, such as axinites, zoisites, and clinozoisites are either metasomatic or metamorphic in origin. It is also noticed that the gemstones of pegmatitic origin are mostly found either at the core-margin zone or in the intermediate zone of the zoned pegmatites. In case of internal evolution of the Shigar valley pegmatites, grain size increases from the margin towards core, which indicates that the crystallization starts from margin toward,' core. The presence of vugs/cavities of the gemstones near the core zone also supports the above crystallization sequence. The geochemical data of the studied pegmatites shows that these pegmatites are mostly peraluminous and granitic in character. The mqjor, trace and rare earth element characteristics of these pegmatite. " exhibit that these belong to the post-collisional tectonic settings. Keeping 'in view the results obtained for the studied pegmatites and the prevailed models for the generation and propagation of granitic pegmatites, it is evident that these pegmatites have been formed by the direct ana taxis of a meta-sedimentary protolith instead of heing the off shoots either of Baltoro or Mango Gusar plutons, which are exposed to the northeast of the Shigar valley. On the basis of radiometric dates for the host rocks of the Shigar valley pegmatite, it is concluded that the Shigar valley pegmatite, are not older than 5 Ma. This is in correspondence with the youngest leucogranites of the High Himalayas, which are generally of 5 -JO Ma, The Shigar valley pegmatites, share many characteristics with the other post-collisional leucogranite of rthe High Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan regions. Like the post-collisional leucogranites of High Himalayas, the Shigar valley pegmatites also have tourmaline as a ubiquitous mineral phase, suggesting a similar source rock for these pegmatites. In addition, the presence of topaz, fluorite and apatite in the Shigar valley pegmatites indicates that the source rock was rich in boron. fluorine, chlorine, water and other volatiles. Moreover, the absence of lithium and rare-metal bearing mineral phases in the pegmatites of Shigar valley indicates that the source rock might have been depleted in these metals...|$|E

We present here field observations to show the imprints (tectonic fabrics) of multiple ductile deformation episodes in the LHS terrain. The earliest penetrative fabric, axial planar to N-S trending reclined folds, suggest a regional tectonic event in the DSH prior to the active phase of Indo-Asia collision.

A minimum pressure of eraplacement of • 1, 500 bars is indicated {{by the presence of}} two coexisting feldspars in the granites, and a moderate depth is supported by a lack of coeval volcanism and absence of porphyritic textures that characterize hypabyssal intrusions. A contact metamorphic-metasomatic aureole in the sur-rounding pelitic metasediments consists of tourmaline, biotite, and muscovite zones that are superimposed on muscovite-chlorite zone regional metamorphism. Whole-rock carbon analyses demonstrate a volatilization of graphite in the metasediments as a function of distance from the intrusion, and the presence of andalusite in the aureole constrains the maximum pressure to approximately 3, 800 bars.

40|$|Near Mesoraca (southern Sila, Calabria) a ductile {{shear zone}} transects syn-tectonic Late Hercynian granitoids and wall rocks. Granitoids are chiefly {{represented}} by foliated granodiorites and, {{to a minor}} extent, by foliated tonalites. Wall rocks are mainly represented by migmatitic paragneisses, which underwent peak metamorphism at 300 - 304 Ma. In {{the core of the}} shear zone mylonitic granodiorites show a clear grain size reduction and microstructures related to deformation at medium- to high-temperature conditions. Migmatitic paragneisses, foliated and mylonitic granodiorites mostly show concordant fabric elements. In addition, the preferred orientation of euhedral feldspars in granitoids indicates that fabric anisotropy started to develop in the magmatic state. These features strongly suggest that shear deformation was active during granitoids emplacement and protracted in subsolidus conditions. In mylonitic granodiorites, kinematic indicators and quartz axis analyses coherently suggest a top-to-W sense of shear, in the present geographic coordinates. Geobarometry indicates that deformation took place at middle crustal levels (P = 445 ± 138 MPa). Overprinting and crosscutting relations allowed to bracket timing of deformation. This outlasted peak metamorphism in wall rocks and was active during emplacement of the granitoids. On the other hand, late pegmatitic dykes were unaffected by significant deformation. <b>Muscovite</b> in <b>pegmatite,</b> dated by Rb-Sr method, provided an age of 265 ± 3 Ma.

40|$|International audienceMicas are {{ubiquitous}} minerals within granitic and pegmatitic rocks. Thepresence and {{the composition}} of micas are believed to depend stronglyon the magma they crystallised from. We studied major and traceelements, using both electron microprobe and Laser Ablation ICP-MS,within primary micas (biotite, muscovite and lepidolite) from the differentgranitic phases of the St Sylvestre leucogranite complex (WesternFrench Massif Central), and associated pegmatitic plugs intrusive in thegranite. The granite can be biotite-only, biotite-muscovite or muscoviteonly. Compositions of granitic micas do not vary significantly exceptfor the muscovite-only facies that has a slightly higher F-rich content. Pegmatitic biotite is quite homogenous within single bodies but recordsa considerable compositional change within the entire pegmatitic fieldranging from F-poor (similar to granite) towards F-rich. Pegmatitic muscoviteappears rather homogeneous in major element composition withonly a slightly higher Li-mica content than most granitic muscovite. Trace elements contents in muscovite are lower than in biotite but compositionaltrends {{are very similar to}} trends observed in biotite contents. While the variation observed within micas from the pegmatite can berelated to a magmatic differentiation, facies variation within the granitemay be related to changes in magma parameters such as f(O 2) and thusare probably not related to differentiation processes. From here it appearsthat granite and pegmatite, even though spatially associated, mayfollow different evolutions and may not be genetically linked despitecommon characters. Differences of trace element concentration betweenbiotite and <b>muscovite</b> in <b>pegmatite</b> can either be the consequence of partitioncoefficient between biotite and muscovite or a diachronous crystallisationof muscovite and biotite.

40|$|Veins and {{pervasive}} wall-rock alteration composed of coarse muscovite +/- quartz +/- pyrite are documented {{for the first}} time in a porphyritic granite at Luhr Hill in the Yerington District, Nevada. Coarse muscovite at Luhr Hill occurs at paleodepths of similar to 6 - 7 km in the roots of a porphyry copper system and crops out on the scale of tens to hundreds of meters, surrounded by rock that is unaltered or variably altered to sodic-calcic assemblages. Coarse muscovite veins exhibit a consistent orientation, subvertical and N-S striking, which structurally restores to subhorizontal at the time of formation. Along strike, coarse muscovite veins swell from distal, millimeter-thick muscovite-only veinlets to proximal, centimeter-thick quartz-sulfide-bearing muscovite veins. Crosscutting relationships between coarse <b>muscovite</b> veins, <b>pegmatite</b> dikes, and sodic-calcic veins indicate that muscovite veins are late-stage magmatic-hydrothermal features predating final solidification of the Luhr Hill porphyritic granite. Fluid inclusions in the muscovite-quartz veins are high-density aqueous inclusions of similar to 3 - 9 wt% NaCl eq. and < 1 mol% CO 2 that homogenize between similar to 150 and 200 A degrees C, similar to fluid inclusions from greisen veins in Sn-W-Mo vein systems. Our results indicate that muscovite-forming fluids at Luhr Hill were mildly acidic, of low to moderate salinity and sulfur content and low CO 2 content, and that muscovite in deep veins and alteration differs in texture, composition, and process of formation from sericite at shallower levels of the hydrothermal system. Although the definition of greisen is controversial, we suggest that coarse muscovite alteration is more similar to alteration in greisen-type Sn-W-Mo districts worldwide than to sericitic alteration at higher levels of porphyry copper systems. The fluids that form coarse muscovite veins and alteration in the roots of porphyry copper systems are distinct from fluids that formed copper ore or widespread, shallower, acidic alteration. We propose that this style of veins and alteration at Luhr Hill represents degassing of moderate volumes of overpressured hydrothermal fluid during late crystallization of deep levels of the Yerington batholith...|$|R

This pegmatite is {{a representative of the}} MSREL–REE subclass of the <b>muscovite</b> – rare-element <b>pegmatites.</b> The beusite usually occurs there as a Mn-dominant, (Ca,Fe) -bearing, Mg-enriched phase devoid of the typical lamellar intergrowths with triphylite or sarcopside, evolving toward more and more Mn-enriched varieties, stabilized by the earlier crystallization of tourmaline and fluorapatite. In terms of enrichment in Mn, the beusite from Szklary is on a level with that from the Cross Lake pegmatite in Canada, considered as the example richest in Mn worldwide. Similarly, Mn-rich fluorapatite containing up to 19. 3 wt. % MnO, and a Mn-dominant apatite-group mineral containing up to 31. 5 wt. % MnO, are two apatite species richest in Mn worldwide, the second close to the ideal	Mn 3 Ca 2 (PO 4) 3 (Cl,F,OH) composition. The progressive removal of Fe over Mn, a decrease in the activities of F and Fe due to crystallization of abundant Fe-bearing tourmaline and fluorapatite, extraction of Mn from pegmatite-forming, H 2 O-undersaturated, Cl-enriched melts by an exsolved H 2 O-, F- and Cl-bearing volatile phase, and metasomatic alteration induced by residual Mn- and Cl-bearing fluids additionally enriched in Mn released during the dissolution of metastable beusite are the main reasons of such a high degree of Mn enrichment in the phosphates from the Szklary pegmatite...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{metamorphic}} phengites are known: one {{is linked to}} high pressure and is 3 T; the other is 2 M 1, and its composition is linked to rock-compositional constraints. This work investigates the octahedral sheet crystal-chemical {{differences between the two}} phengite types. Seven dioctahedral micas were studied: (1) one 3 T phengite from an ultrahigh-pressure metagranitoid in the Dora Maira massif, Italy (P ~ 4. 3 GPa, T ~ 730 °C); (2) five 2 M 1 phengites from medium-P orthogneisses in the Eastern Alps metamorphic basement, Italy (P ≤ 0. 7 GPa, T ~ 500 – 600 °C); and (3) one 2 M 1 ferroan <b>muscovite</b> from <b>pegmatite</b> in Antarctica (P ≤ 0. 2 GPa, T ~ 500 °C). All micas display significant extents of celadonite substitution. In particular, the 2 M 1 -phengite formulae (calculated on the basis of 11 O) have 0. 68 < IVAl < 0. 82 atoms per formula unit (apfu); octahedral atoms are dominated by Al (1. 6 – 1. 8 apfu), with minor and variable Fe (0. 20 – 0. 35 apfu) and Mg (0. 05 – 0. 17 apfu), and very minor Ti, Mn, and Cr. Total octahedral occupancies are slightly above 2. 00 apfu, i. e., there seems to be partial occupancy of the third M site. For all micas, we recorded XAFS spectra on mosaics of carefully separated flakes oriented flat on a plastic support that could be rotated so as to account for the polarization of the synchrotron radiation beam, and we processed them {{on the basis of the}} AXANES theory. Spectra show angle-dependent absorption variations for Al and Fe, which can be deconvoluted and fitted by dichroic effects. Pre-edges consistently show most Fe to be Fe 3 + and little angle-dependent intensity variations. The 2 M 1 -ferroan muscovite from Antarctica displays the same AXANES behavior as 2 M 1 -phengites. By contrast, the ultrahigh-pressure 3 T-phengite from Dora Maira (having IVAl = 0. 42 apfu, and Al and Mg as the dominant octahedral constituents) has XAFS spectra that differ significantly. Not only is the IVAl feature strongly reduced, in agreement with the increased Si content, but also Fe XAFS spectra show one broad feature only, indicating that all Fe is Fe 2 + in a fully disordered distribution with no angle-dependent variations. We conclude that this 3 T-phengite is actually contaminated by exsolved Fe-bearing pyrope platelets, which cannot be resolved under SEM examination; by contrast, the 2 M 1 -phengites, unrelated to high-pressure, suggest Al/Fe 3 + order over the M 1 and (M 2, M 3) sites, as also does the 2 M 1 pegmatitic muscovite...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{bodies of}} pegmatites have been {{located within the}} rocks of Sausar Group (Precambrian) {{occurring}} in the Kolar valley, north of Koradi, in Nagpur district of Central India. The XRD and the chemical data have shown that these pegmatites are mostly potassic (K 2 O = 15. 58 to 16. 31 % and Na 2 O= 2. 50 to 3. 12 %) and are barren of economic mineral deposits. The pegmatites range from a few cm to more than 50 m in width with a maximum extension of about one kilometre. Several mappable pegmatite bodies trend roughly EW and NS, and many good outcrops are encountered in the Kolar Valley and Suradevi Hills. Based {{on the field and}} petrographic studies, the pegmatites of this area are characterised in terms of size, shape and mode of emplacement. They are mostly tabular, lenticular, branching and irregular bodies, localised along bedding, foliation, fault planes, tension joints and fold axis. Structurally they can be subdivided into concordant and discordant types {{on the basis of their}} relationship with the country rocks. Mineralogically, pegmatites are grouped into (1) Simple Pegmatite, containing quartz, feldspar, biotite, apatite, garnet and (?) monazite, and (2) Complex Pegmatite comprising in addition muscovite, tourmaline and epidote. However, common mineral variation is observed at different places within the same body of pegmatite. In these <b>pegmatites,</b> <b>muscovite,</b> quartz, tourmaline and feldspar seem to have developed mainly in two distinct generations, for example, the muscovite of earlier generation forms tiny "books" while later crystals occur as small disseminated flakes in the groundmass of less coarser quartz. The earlier quartz is strongly deformed, while the later occurs as veins of variable dimensions. The black tourmaline of earlier generation is represented by schorlite and of later origin has been identified as dravite. It may be concluded that these pegmatites were formed by the influx of fluids rich in silica, Al and K that filled the fractures and other planes of weakness (foliation) in the host rocks.

The petrographic analysis shows that the pegmatite samples contain mainly quartz (35 %), plagioclase (15 %), microcline (10 %) and muscovite (12 %) with accessories like tourmaline, tantalum, niobium and illmeno-rutiles. Geochemical analysis of the <b>muscovites</b> extracted from <b>pegmatites</b> show that these rocks are enriched in silica (> 60 %) and Al 2 O 3 (> 12 %) and depleted in Fe 2 O 3, MgO and TiO 2. Trace element analysis shows that the pegmatites contain rare metals with moderately high Ta, Nb, Sn, Rb, Li and Cs values and depleted in Ti, Ba and Zr. Elemental ratios indicate low ratios of K/Cs, Th/U and K/Rb. Variation plots of Ta/(Ta+Nb) versus Mn/ (Mn+Fe) show that the pegmatites plot in the complex (beryl subtype) field. The Na/K versus Sn, Nb, Rb variation plots show that the pegmatites of Komu area are mineralized and compare favourably with those of other mineralized pegma-tite areas like Egbe and Ijero in southwestern Nigeria. The variation plots of Ta versus K/Cs, and Ta/W versus Cs, also confirm rare metal mineralization of Komu pegmatites, which plot over the mineralized line of Beus and Gordiyenko. The K/Rb versus Rb, Cs and Sn plots indicate low K/Rb ratios indicating moderate differentiation. The Rare Earth Elements (REE) show high heavy REE values and lower light REE values with prominent positive Ce anomaly and negative Eu anomaly from normalized chondrite plots. K/Ar dating of the age of mineralization of muscovites extracted from the pegmatite yielded late Pan-African ages between 502. 8 ± 13 Ma and 514. 5 ± 13. 2 Ma.

The value obtained in biotite from the host Saint Sylvestre granite falls within this range (δ 7 Li = - 1. 5 ‰). Lithium concentrations {{are consistent with the}} degree of magmatic evolution of each pegmatite type: from 630 ppm in Type II up to 13, 500 ppm in the more evolved Type VI pegmatite. Although the rare-element contents e. g., Li, Cs, Ta of the micas are consistent with pegmatite differentiation, δ 7 Li (‰) are firstly, independent of the degree of magmatic differentiation (independent of pegmatite type) and secondly, independent of the content of Li and other flux-elements such as Be and Cs. <b>Muscovite</b> sampled in <b>pegmatite</b> V from the Chabannes locality is the only pegmatite to exhibit a δ 7 Li variation from intermediate unit (- 1. 7 ‰) to internal pegmatitic unit (+ 3. 4 ‰). The nature of this δ 7 Li variation suggests that there was extensive fractional crystallisation during the pegmatite’s consolidation. The independence of δ 7 Li (‰) evolution from the degree of magmatic evolution and the presence of distinct major rare-element bearing phases throughout the pegmatite field tend to confirm that the δ 7 Li (‰) values recorded in mica are inherited from crustal source rocks common to the granite and pegmatite-forming melts. We propose that the distinct pegmatite subtypes (beryl columbite vs lepidolite-petalite subtypes) observed throughout the Monts d’Ambazac Pegmatite Field reflect the diverse contributions of crustal protoliths. The lack of evidence of surrounding alteration combined with the absence of increasing Li-content within the host granite tend to confirm that the δ 7 Li values obtained within this pegmatite field are primary, and that no Li-diffusional process and/or mixing-driven Li-isotope fractionation has overprinted these isotopic compositions. In light of these results, the process of partial melting of protoliths enriched in rare-element bearing phases, e. g., mica, garnet, seems to be more responsible for Li-isotope fractionation than Li-diffusion or fractional crystallisation at the temperature of pegmatite consolidation. Finally, we discuss the use of Li isotopic compositions to identify the most highly evolved pegmatitic systems...|$|R

It forms a portion of a project initiated between Venetia Mine, the Venetia- Limpopo Nature Reserve and Professor Jay Barton of RAU to geologically map in detail the area around the pipes (scale < 1 : 10 000) and to study various aspects of the regional geology. The rock types into which the Venetia kimberlite pipes intruded belong to the Venetia klippe, an east-west trending synclinal structure with the axial plane dipping steeply northwards. Lithologically, the Venetia klippe comprises four layered units in which interlayered granitic or arkosic quartzofeldspathic gneisses, with and without biotite and garnet, and para and ortho-amphibolite, quartzite and meta-carbonate rocks (marble and limestone), banded iron formation and calc-silicate rock occur. Geochemical analysis (SEM and electron microprobe) of the meta-carbonates (re-crystallised magnesian limestone, coarse-grained marble and fine-grained foliated marble), indicate the precursors to be magnesian limestone, dolomite and limestone. Several events have been identified during the structural evolution of the area. They include: formation of gneissic metamorphic layering, tectonic suturing between different lithologies, formation of a syncline and east-west strike-slip faulting, north-south trending folds and northeast-southwest dextral strike-slip faulting, tourmaline bearing pegmatite emplacement, dolerite intrusion, tourmaline absent pegmatite emplacement, kimberlite emplacement and reactivation of pre-existing structures. Depositional structures only in the fine-grained foliated marble are preserved, e. g. graded bedding, cross-bedding, rip-up clasts and channels. These structures suggest deposition of the carbonates in two main depositional environments; peritidal (channels and rip-up clasts) and subtidal shelf (graded bedding and cross-bedding). A study of pegmatites in the area shows two main pegmatite types: tourmaline bearing and tormaline absent, each locally displaying a zonation. Mineralogically, the pegmaties are rich in quartz and albite and lack K-feldspar so they are classified as sodic-rich or plagio-pegmatites. Step heating 40 Ar/ 39 Ar analyses of <b>muscovite</b> from undeformed <b>pegmatite</b> yields an age of — 2. 0 Ga, which is interpreted to represent the time of pegmatite emplacement into the Venetia klippe rocks. Structurally, the pegmatites are sheet-like bodies cross-cutting compositional layering, joints, faults, folds and the dolerite, except for the older tourmaline bearing pegmatite that has intruded along east-west faults, but not northeast-southwest trending faults. By applying the principles of a dike propagation model, the source of the Venetia pegmatites should be greater than 5 X 5 X 5 km in volume and a maximum of 10 km away. An appropriate granitic source has been recognized on the farm Gotha to the south of the mine by Martina Barnett. Leucocratic granodiorite, tonalite and granite with minor xenoliths of amphibolite, quartzite and magnetite quartzite define the Gotha Granitic Complex and pegmatite decreases in abundance away from it to the north and east. Deposition of Unit 3 lithologies into a rifted basin and an ancient epeiric sea is possible. However, there is more evidence (peritidal and shelf environments of the metacarbonates) and clean mature quartzites to suggest deposition into a passive continental margin or epeiric sea similar to the Malmani dolomites of the Transvaal Supergroup...|$|R
