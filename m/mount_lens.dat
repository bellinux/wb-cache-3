50|$|Macro {{photography}} {{may also}} be accomplished by <b>mounting</b> a <b>lens</b> in reverse, {{in front of a}} normally <b>mounted</b> <b>lens</b> of greater focal length, using a macro coupler which screws into the front filter threads of both lenses. This method allows most cameras to maintain the full function of electronic and mechanical communication with the normally <b>mounted</b> <b>lens,</b> for features such as open-aperture metering. The magnification ratio is calculated by dividing the focal length of the normally <b>mounted</b> <b>lens</b> by the focal length of the reversed lens (e.g., when an 18 mm <b>lens</b> is reverse <b>mounted</b> on a 300 mm lens the reproduction ratio is 16:1). The use of automatic focus is not advisable if the first lens is not of the internal-focusing type, as the extra weight of the reverse-mounted lens could damage the autofocus mechanism. Working distance is significantly less than the first lens.|$|R

Cosina Voigtländer products have included 35mm film SLR and rangefinder camera bodies, and lenses for the M39 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> (Leica screw <b>mount),</b> M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> Leica M <b>mount,</b> and other <b>lens</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SD10 {{supports}} only Sigma SA <b>mount</b> <b>lenses.</b> Only Sigma produces lenses to {{fit this}} mount, although their range is fairly broad.
