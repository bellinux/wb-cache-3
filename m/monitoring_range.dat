This work discusses the particular relationship between the <b>monitoring</b> <b>range</b> and the communication range, and proposes an optimal deployment with self-healing movement algorithm for closed or semi-closed area with irregular shape, which can not only satisfy both coverage and connectivity by using as few nodes as possible, but also compensate the failure of nodes by mobility in WSNs.

Besides, we calculate the location of dead nodes by Geometry Algorithm, and move the higher priority nodes to replace them by an-other Improved Virtual Force Algorithm (IVFA). Eventually, simulation results based-on MATLAB are presented, which do show that this optimal deployment with self-healing movement algorithm can ensure the coverage and communication of an entire region by requiring the least number of nodes and effectively compensate the loss of the networks...|$|E
40|$|OSNR {{monitoring}} {{is indispensable}} for coherent systems to ensure robustreliable network operation and potentially enable impairment-aware routing for future dynamic optical networks. In a longhaul transmission link with chromatic dispersion (CD) and fiber nonlinearityit {{is difficult to}} distinguish between amplifier noise and fiber nonlinearity induced distortions from received signal distributions even after various transmission impairment compensation techniquesthus resulting in grossly inaccurate OSNR estimates. Based on the received signal distributions after carrier phase estimation (CPE) we propose to characterize the nonlinearity-induced amplitude noise correlation across neighboring symbols and incorporate such information into error vector magnitude (EVM) calculation to realize fiber nonlinearity-insensitive OSNR monitoring.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{remarkable}} development of modern medical treatment and technology, the threat of pandemic diseases such as anthrax, cholera, and SARS has not disappeared. As a part of emerging healthcare decision problems, many researchers have studied how to detect and contain disease outbreaks, and our research is aligned with this trend. This thesis mainly consists of two parts: epidemic simulation modeling for effective intervention strategies and spatiotemporal monitoring for outbreak detection. We developed a stochastic epidemic simulation model of a pandemic influenza virus (H 1 N 1) to test possible interventions within a structured population. The possible interventions — such as vaccination, antiviral treatment, household prophylaxis, school closure and social distancing — are investigated in {{a large number of}} scenarios, including delays in vaccine delivery and low and moderate efficacy of the vaccine. Since timely and accurate detection of a disease outbreak is crucial in terms of preparation for emergencies in healthcare and biosurveillance, we suggest two spatiotemporal monitoring charts, namely, the SMCUSUM and RMCUSUM charts, to detect increases in the rate or count of disease incidents. Our research includes convenient methods to approximate the control limits of the charts. An analytical control limit approximation method for the SMCUSUM chart performs well under certain conditions on the data distribution and <b>monitoring</b> <b>range.</b> Another control limit approximation method for the RMCUSUM chart provides robust performance to various <b>monitoring</b> <b>range,</b> spatial correlation structures, and data distributions without intensive modeling of the underlying process.
