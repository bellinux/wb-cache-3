25|$|Prevention of {{infectious}} diarrhea is by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing with soap. Breastfeeding {{for at least}} six months is also recommended as is vaccination against rotavirus. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar, is the treatment of choice. Zinc tablets are also recommended. These treatments have been estimated to have saved 50 million children in the past 25 years. When people have diarrhea it is recommended that they continue to eat healthy food and babies continue to be breastfed. If commercial ORS are not available, homemade solutions may be used. In those with severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required. Most cases; however, can be managed well with fluids by mouth. Osmotic diarrhea can also be the result of <b>maldigestion</b> (e.g., pancreatic disease or Coeliac disease), in which the nutrients are left in the lumen to pull in water. Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives (which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has lactose intolerance can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have fructose malabsorption, excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea. In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.|$|E

40|$|Lactose <b>maldigestion</b> is {{a common}} genetic trait in up to 70 % of the world's population. In these subjects, the {{ingestion}} of lactose may lead to prebiotic effects which can be confirmed by measurement of breath hydrogen. After a period of continuous lactose ingestion, colonic bacterial adaptation is measurable as improved parameters of lactose digestion. There may be inherent benefits in this process of adaptation which may protect against some diseases. We attempt to link therapeutically beneficial probiotics (VSL 3, Seaford Pharmaceuticals Inc, Ontario) with improvement in parameters of lactose <b>maldigestion.</b> Two groups of five subjects with <b>maldigestion</b> were fed one or four packets of VSL 3 (one packet containing 450 x 109 live bacteria) before testing and then 17 days later. A 50 g lactose challenge was carried out before and after feeding. While there was a trend toward increasing rather than reducing of summed breath hydrogen, no statistically significant changes were observed between results from before testing and those from testing 17 days later. The authors conclude that direct consumption of the probiotic VSL 3 may not improve parameters of lactose <b>maldigestion</b> without metabolic activation.

40|$|Clinical {{conditions}} in which secondary <b>maldigestion</b> associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occur include chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, partial or total gastrectomy, and pancreatic resection. <b>Maldigestion</b> can cause serious weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and subjective complaints associated with steatorrhea.

40|$|Introduction Diarrhea {{remains a}} major problem for {{community}} health in Indonesia. More than 25 % of children with severe diar- rhea suffer from malabsorption syndrome. Objectives This study aimed to determine the age range of chil- dren with acute diarrhea, the prevalence of macronutrient malab- sorption, and the relationship between age and bacterial infec- tion in macronutrient malabsorption. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, subjects were chil- dren aged 0 - 59 months with acute diarrhea whose stools were obtained and examined in the laboratory of Gastrohepatology Division, Department of Child Health, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospi- tal, Jakarta from January 2002 to December 2003. Results Children with acute diarrhea were mostly in the age range of 0 - 11 months (61 %). The prevalence of lactose malab- sorption was 11 %, carbohydrate malabsorption was 19 %, and fat malabsorption was 51 %. Moreover, the age group of 0 - 11 months had a 1. 5 times greater possibility of lactose and fat malabsorption compared to that of 12 - 59 months. The 12 - 59 months age group had a greater possibility of suffering carbohydrate <b>maldigestion</b> (70 %). The group of children who did not suffer from bacterial infection had a higher prevalence of lactose mal- absorption (54 %), carbohydrate <b>maldigestion</b> (65 %), and fat malabsorption (58 %). Conclusions Acute diarrhea occurred more frequently in the age of 0 - 11 months. There was a significant correlation between the age groups of 0 - 11 months and 12 - 59 months in experiencing macronutrient malabsorption.

40|$|About {{half of all}} {{patients}} with chronic pancreatitis (CP) develop diabetes mellitus (DM) due {{to the loss of}} islet cell mass, not just beta cells as in Type 1 DM (T 1 DM), or due to insulin resistance, as in Type 2 DM (T 2 DM). Patients with DM from loss of islets due to pancreatic disease or resection are diagnosed with pancreatogenic or Type 3 c DM (T 3 cDM). Patients with T 3 cDM also lose counter-regulatory hormones, such as glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide, and experience <b>maldigestion</b> associated with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Patients with T 3 cDM are therefore more susceptible to hypoglycemia and a mismatch (asynchrony) between food ingestion and nutrient absorption. At the same time, the use of incretin therapy is likely useless, since <b>maldigestion</b> leads to the release of higher levels of hind gut hormones, including GLP 1. Thus, T 3 cDM caused by CP or destruction of the islets involves a special class of potential risks and comorbidity that may be overlooked if the CP has not been diagnosed...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{prevalence}} of lactose <b>maldigestion</b> in Greek adults is 75 % but {{the age at}} which the lactase activity starts declining is not known. The prevalences of lactose mal-digestion and intolerance were investigated in 1 50 randomly selected Greek children 5 - 1 2 y old by using breath-hydrogen analysis after ingestion oflactose (2 g/kg body wt, maximum 50 g) or 0. 240 L of milk. Prevalence of lactose <b>maldigestion</b> in-creased with age (y- 7. 30 + 6. 49 x, r = 0. 88, P = 0. 004), being 29. 4 % and 80. 0 % at ages 5 and 12 y, respectively. Before testing, the reported prevalences of milk-related symptoms by children with high and low lactose-digestion capacity were 21. 1 % and 39. 7 % (X 2 = 5. 96, P = 0. 015), respectively. However, the corresponding prevalences of lactose intolerance after ingestion of milk were 7. 3 % and 8. 6 % (x 2 = 0. 1, P = 0. 72) and only three children had a zH 2 20 ppm postprandially.

Methods A total of 50 male patients with proven chronic pancreatitis (36 / 50 alcohol; 42 / 50 smokers) were studied. Pancreatic exocrine function was assessed using the fecal elastase- 1 test. Blood and urine samples were analyzed for parameters related to pancreatitis, nutrition, endocrine status, and bone metabolism. Bone mineral density was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorption (DXA) and conventional vertebral X-rays. A standardized questionnaire for osteoporosis was given.

40|$|Exocrine {{pancreatic}} insufficiency {{caused by}} chronic pancreatitis results from various factors which regulate digestion and absorption of nutrients. Pancreatic function {{has been extensively}} studied over the last 40 years, even if some aspects of secretion and gastrointestinal adaptation are not completely understood. The main clinical manifestations of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are fat malabsorption, known as steatorrhea, which consists of fecal excretion of more than 6 g of fat per day, weight loss, abdominal discomfort and abdominal swelling sensation. Fat malabsorption also results in a deficit of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) with consequent clinical manifestations. The relationships between pancreatic <b>maldigestion,</b> intestinal ecology and intestinal inflammation have not received particular attention, even if in clinical practice these mechanisms {{may be responsible for}} the low efficacy of pancreatic extracts in abolishing steatorrhea in some patients. The best treatments for pancreatic <b>maldigestion</b> should be re-evaluated, taking into account not only the correction of pancreatic insufficiency using pancreatic extracts and the best duodenal pH to permit optimal efficacy of these extracts, but we also need to consider other therapeutic approaches including the decontamination of intestinal lumen, supplementation of bile acids and, probably, the use of probiotics which may attenuate intestinal inflammation in chronic pancreatitis patients...|$|E
40|$|Several {{reports have}} {{indicated}} that fecal elastase- 1 (EL- 1) determination is a new, sensitive, and specific noninvasive pancreatic function test; however, very few patients with malabsorption due to small intestine diseases {{have been included in}} the previous studies. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the diagnostic accuracy of fecal EL- 1 and fecal chymotrypsin (FCT) in distinguishing between pancreatic <b>maldigestion</b> and intestinal malabsorption. Three groups of subjects were studied: group A included 49 patients with known cystic fibrosis (25 males, median age 5 years); group B included 43 subjects with various small intestine diseases (17 males, median age 6 years); and group C included 45 children without any history of gastrointestinal disease (22 males, median age 5 years). In all patients, stools were collected for 72 h on a standard diet and fecal EL- 1, FCT, and steatocrit tests were performed. Both EL- 1 and FCT were below normal limits in all CF patients with pancreatic <b>maldigestion</b> not treated with pancreatic enzyme (100 % sensitivity for both assays); El- 1, but not FCT, was also below normal in all the CF patients with pancreatic <b>maldigestion</b> treated with pancreatic extracts. Both EL- 1 and FCT values in the CF group were significantly lower than in subjects with various small intestinal diseases and in children without any history of gastrointestinal disease (P < 0. 0001). FCT, but not EL- 1, values showed an inverse statistically significant correlation with steatocrit values in the whole CF group (P < 0. 001); FCT was below normal in three of four CF patients with steatorrhea on pancreatic enzyme therapy. Both EL- 1 and FCT had 100 % specificity when calculated in children without any history of gastrointestinal disease; in contrast, specificity was 86 % for EL- 1 and 76 % for FCT if we considered the control group with small intestinal diseases: low EL- 1 was observed in two cases of intestinal giardiasis, two cases of short bowel syndrome, one case of celiac disease, and one case of intestinal pseudobstruction; FCT was abnormal in four cases of intestinal giardiasis, three cases of celiac disease, one case of short bowel syndrome, one case of Crohn's disease, and one case of intestinal pseudobstruction. Diagnostic accuracy was 92 % for fecal EL- 1 and 82 % for FCT. Steatocrit values were over the normal limit in 11 patients with small intestine diseases; in 7 / 11 of these patients at least one of the pancreatic test results was below the normal limit. In conclusions, in patients with CF, fecal EL- 1 determination is not more sensitive than FCT in identifying pancreatic maldigestion; however, fecal EL- 1 assay is more specific than FCT determination in distinguishing pancreatic <b>maldigestion</b> from intestinal malabsorption...|$|E
