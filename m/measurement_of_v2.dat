Two-particle correlations, where the particles {{have a large}} separation in pseudorapidity, are compared in He- 3 + Au and in p + p collisions and indicate that collective effects dominate {{the second and third}} Fourier components for the correlations observed in the He- 3 + Au system. The collective behavior is quantified in terms <b>of</b> elliptic <b>v(2)</b> and triangular v(3) anisotropy coefficients measured with respect to their corresponding event planes. The v(2) values are comparable to those previously measured in d + Au collisions at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy. Comparisons with various theoretical predictions are made, including to models where the hot spots created by the impact of the three He- 3 nucleons on the Au nucleus expand hydrodynamically to generate the triangular flow. The agreement of these models with data may indicate the formation of low-viscosity quark-gluon plasma even in these small collision systems...|$|R
