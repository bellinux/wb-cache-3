The complexity within a production company is characterized by the challenges encountered in daily business processes and can be described by the four dimensions of complexity: variety, heterogeneity, dynamics and non- transparency, as well as their interrelationships. Despite this increasing importance, only few companies have access to adequate tools for complexity management. Most companies have not introduced or implemented yet a complexity management system/approach or they do not know, if the used complexity management methods are efficient and adequate. Therefore, the question rises: How can a company be reviewed and evaluated regarding its complexity management skills?Maturity models can be used to support the analysis and assessment of skills and development-levels of products, processes or organizations by defining different levels of maturity, in order to assess the extent to which an object fulfills defined qualitative requirements. The various levels of maturity within such models can be used to describe the different achievable skill levels. Maturity models not only include methods for the assessment of skill levels, but also provide incentives and measures to increase the degree of maturity. After the introduction of measures to increase the skill level of maturity these models are also suitable to measure and evaluate the progress made. This paper presents an approach for an evaluation model of complexity management systems. First, the basics of the so-called advanced Complexity Management are given, highlighting the difference between complexity and complicacy as well as the comparing external and internal complexity. The fields and dimensions of complexity are presented as well. After that, maturity models fundamentals are presented by showing state-of-the-art maturity model approaches. Furthermore, the overall <b>maturity-based</b> <b>approach</b> for evaluation of complexity management systems, especially the maturity of their functionalities and capabilities regarding the needs and purposes of manufacturing enterprises, is presented by adapting and combining existing methods and models. The <b>maturity-based</b> <b>approach</b> describes different levels of complexity management systems within a production company, also taking into account recommendations and measures to increase the degree of maturity...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, many {{construction}} companies use <b>maturity-based</b> <b>approaches</b> to support {{decisions that have}} strong impact on costs and sustainability of the construction process, such as: age of pre-stressing operations, decision of propping/formwork removal; instant of subjection to load, etc. Current approaches to quality control through maturity consist in evaluating the compressive strength evolution of the concrete mix at a reference curing temperature (usually 20 °C), together with {{the determination of the}} apparent activation energy (Ea) of the mix. The value of Ea is usually obtained from one of these three sources: (i) reference recommendations based on the type of cement; (ii) calorimetric testing; (iii) testing of compressive strength evolution at several distinct temperatures. The only technique of determining Ea that really addresses a mechanical property is the latter one, demanding however the deployment of many specimens and tests. Furthermore, the destructive character of this technique limits the possibility of maintaining the same specimen for the entire Ea testing, thus increasing the variability/scattering of results. The present study intended to evaluate the possibility of assessing mechanical-based activation energy for concrete through continuous or quasicontinuous assessments of E-modulus since very early ages. E-modulus is a mechanical property depending on the advancement of the hydration reaction and the temperature stories during the curing, with the interesting characteristic of allowing non-destructive testing to be carried out. This paper presents an inter-laboratory and inter-technique comparative study of E-modulus evolution at several temperatures. Three laboratories were involved, contributing with specific testing techniques applied to a single mix of normal strength concrete: 1) BTJASPE (BéTon au Jeune Age, Suivi de la Prise et du module d'Elasticité), available at IFSTTAR in France; 2) EMM-ARM (Elasticity Modulus Measurement through Ambient Response Method) available at the University of Minho in Portugal; 3) TSTM (Temperature Stress Testing Machine), available at Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.
