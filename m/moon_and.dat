5|$|Following the Babylonians, {{significant}} {{advances in}} astronomy {{were made in}} ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world. Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena. In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> Sun, {{and was the first}} to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system. In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe. Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy. The Antikythera mechanism (c. 150–80 BC) was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the Sun, <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> planets for a given date. Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, <b>Moon,</b> <b>and</b> Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E

5|$|After {{incubating}} {{for around}} 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases {{the chance of}} escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced.

5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the <b>Moon</b> <b>and</b> the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
