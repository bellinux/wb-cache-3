40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Methylenediphenyl</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (<b>MDI)</b> {{was used}} as the chain {{extender}} for low molecular weight poly(lactic acid) (PLA) to produce high molecular weight biode-gradable polymer material with a better heat resistance. PLA prepolymer with a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 5800 and a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 9800 was produced by direct polycondensation using stannous octoate as the catalyst. After 40 min of chain extension at 175 °C, the resulting polymer had a Mn of 15, 000 and a Mw of 57, 000. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the low molecular weight PLA prepolymer was 48. 6 °C. After chain extension, the Tg of the resulting polymer was raised to 67. 9 °C, as determined by DSC. DMA results also indicate that the heat resistance was improved by the chain extension.

All blends were prepared using a plasti-corder and characterized for tensile properties, thermal properties and morphology. Scanning electron micrographs showed that phase separation occurred, leading to poor tensile properties. Therefore, <b>methylenediphenyl</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (<b>MDI)</b> {{was used as}} an interfacial compatibilizer to improve the mechanical properties of PLA/tapioca blends. The addition of MDI could improve the tensile strength of the blend with 60 wt% tapioca, from 19. 8 to 42. 6 MPa. In addition, because PLA lacked toughness, acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) was added as a plasticizer to improve the ductility of PLA. A significant decrease in the melting point and glass-transition temperature was observed on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry, which indicated that the PLA structure was not dense after ATBC was added. As such, the brittleness was improved, and the elongation at break was extended to several hundred percent. Therefore, mixing ATBC with PLA/tapioca/MDI blends did exhibit the effect of plasticization and biodegradation. The results also revealed that excessive plasticizer would cause the migration of ATBC and decrease the tensile properties...|$|E

Biomarkers of TDI and MDI were determined as the corresponding amines, toluenediamine (TDA) and methylenedianiline (MDA), in hydrolysed urine, plasma and erythrocytes from exposed workers.

The levels of TDA and MDA in urine varied considerably during and between work days, while only limited variations were seen in plasma. At least two urinary elimination phases were observed. A relation was found between the concentrations of TDA and MDA in plasma and the urinary elimination rates of TDA and MDA after the cessation of work. A significant correlation was also found between the concentrations of TDA in plasma and the TDI air levels. TDI was found to be covalently bound to albumin in plasma and most likely to haemoglobin in erythrocytes. In urine, different TDI-modified biomolecules were observed.

Specific IgE (sIgE) and IgG (sIgG) binding was measured with fluorescence enzyme immunoassay in 43 study subjects (using conjugates prepared in-vapor, in-solution and commercial preparations). The differential clinical diagnosis included standardized measurement of pulmonary function, non-specific bronchial hyper-responsiveness, specific MDI-prick test (MDI-SPT) and specific inhalation challenge (MDI-SIC). Detailed diagnostic scheme allows the differential OA(I) and MDI-induced hypersensitivity pneumonitis (P-I). The presumed OA(I) diagnoses were confirmed in 84 % (45 % cases having demonstrable sIgE antibodies) with RR 5. 7, P > 0. 001, when OA(I) diagnosis is correlated with MDI-SIC/MDI-SPT (RR 1. 28 for MDI-SIC alone); sIgG antibodies were clinically relevant for P-I {{and not for the}} OA diagnosis. MDI-specific IgE data generated with commercial ImmunoCAP preparations show high correlation with our in-vapor generated MDI conjugates. Isocyanate-specific IgE antibodies are not always detectable but their presence is strongly predictive of OA(I) and supportive for the diagnosis. MDI-SPT can be a valuable parameter differentiating OA(I) and P-I.

Part I - Environment This part of the evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to the environment in all life cycle steps. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterisation for each protection goal in the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric compartment has been determined. The environmental risk assessment concludes that there is no concern. Part II ¿ Human Health This part of the evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to human populations in all life cycle steps. The scenarios for occupational exposure, consumer exposure and humans exposed via the environment have been examined and the possible risks have been identified. The human health risk assessment concludes that there is concern for workers and consumers with regard to irritation of skin, eye and respiratory tract, skin sensitisation and lung effects induced by repeated inhalation exposure. There is a need for further information and for testing (on hold) on the toxicity for fertility for workers and consumers. For humans exposed via the environment and for human health (physico-chemical properties) there is no concern.

40|$|Isocyanates are of {{toxicological}} relevance {{since they}} are considered to cause occupational asthma. The majority of polyurethanes is based on aromatic diisocyanates (e. g., TDI and MDI), they are used for foams, elastomers, adhesives and coatings. Therefore we studied reactions of p-tolylisocyanate (pTI), 2, 4 -toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and 4, 4 - <b>methylenediphenyl</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (<b>MDI)</b> with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (AcCys) with different molar ratios in aqueous buffer solutions of pH 5. 0 - 7. 4. Type and amounts of products formed in these reactions were identified and quantified. Conjugates of AcCys and the aromatic isocyanates have been synthesized and characterized as reference materials. Conjugates and ureas {{were found to be}} the main products. The ratio of these two compounds varied with the ratio of AcCys to isocyanate. Approximately 90 % of pTI conjugate were found for the 10 : 1 ratio, approximately 40 % conjugate for the 10 : 5 and around 15 % for the 10 : 15 ratio. For TDI yields of conjugate were comparable. Ureas, apart from minor amounts of TDA-urea could not be determined quantitatively due to formation of oligomeric ureas with different end groups. Minor amounts of MDI-conjugates were found apart from high amounts of insoluble material, which proved to be unreacted MDI encapsulated by oligomeric ureas. The reaction of the -SH group with the isocyanate moiety is independent of the pH of the solution in the range studied. No diamine, i. e. 2, 4 -TDA or 4, 4 -MDA, could be detected in reactions of the diisocyanates 2, 4 -TDI or 4, 4 -MDI. Small amounts of p-toluidine (pTA) were found in the reaction of the mono isocyanate pTI when it was in excess with respect to AcCys. Reactions of the isocyanates with an aqueous buffer solution of pH 6. 5 in the absence of AcCys gave ureas as main products, while significant amounts of unreacted diisocyanates remained encapsulated in the mixture. No 2, 4 -TDA or 4, 4 -MDA was detected under these conditions. Again small amounts of pTA were formed from the reaction of pTI with water...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryX. Susan SunPoly(lactic acid) (PLA), a {{synthetic}} biopolymer, is a promising substitute of some petroleum-based polymers {{due to its}} mechanical and biodegradable properties. But, {{because of the high}} cost of PLA (compared to those petroleum plastics for disposable application), starch has been incorporated into PLA to reduce cost and accelerate the biodegradability rate of the composites. But, the addition of starch as filler to PLA decreased mechanical performance of the composite. The addition of <b>methylenediphenyl</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (<b>MDI)</b> into PLA/starch blends improved drastically the mechanical properties of the composite. Results from thermal-degradation analysis showed that PLA had the highest Arrhenius activation energy and strongest thermal endurance of all samples, followed by PLA/starch/MDI and PLA/starch. Aged samples exposed to fluctuating humidity storage conditions significantly decreased their performance. But, storing the samples in plastic bags could minimize degradation of properties. PLA and its composites with starch would not significantly affect application function when they are stored in controlled environment. PLA and PLA/starch based composites sealed in plastic bags can be stored in fluctuating humidity conditions (30 - 90 % RH) for up to 30 days. Tensile strength, elongation, and damping increased with average particle size of starch granules (APS). But, declination of these properties was detected with APS larger than 45 mm. Crystallinity increased as the APS decreased. Young’s modulus, storage modulus, and moisture absorption were not significantly affected by the starch APS. The use of MDI as a coupling agent altered the role of starch APS on those properties of poly(lactic acid) /starch composite. The oxidation of the primary alcohol group on C 6 of starch molecules up to 10 % degree of substitution did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of PLA/starch/MDI, but the composites showed a reduced inelastic deformation (tensile curve) and significant increase in storage modulus and damping. Results suggest that a substitution of hydroxyl group on C 6 of starch molecules for carboxyl group (up to 10 %) increased the strengthening effect of MDI enough to reduce inelastic deformation of the composites upon load, but not enough to enhance mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Among {{three major}} diisocyanates: TDI, <b>methylenediphenyl</b> <b>diisocyanate</b> (<b>MDI)</b> and {{hexamethylene}} diisocyanate (HDI), TDI has {{been regarded as}} {{the leading cause of}} diisocyanate-induced asthma. The principal feature of TDI-induced asthma is the airway inflammation with influx of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. This in turn leads to the variable airway hyper-responsiveness. TDI-induced asthma can share many similar features with allergic asthma, such as increased total and specific IgE serum levels, activated CD 4 + T cells, eosinophils and mast cells, increased levels of IL- 4 and IL- 5 and airway remodeling. So far, the pathogenic mechanism of TDI-induced asthma is still far from clear. It has been commonly accepted that TDI sensitization involves binding of TDI to carrier molecules. Specific IgE to diisocyanate has been regarded to be helpful in the diagnosis of occupational asthma. Particularly, increased immunoglobulin IgG 1 was suggested to be associated to TDI exposure and the protein-conjugated TDI can be a useful marker for progress of TDI-asthma. In the past decades, the reports on the phenotype of immune response to TDI have been quite controversial. Maestrelli et al. reported that increased levels of Th 2 cytokines were detected in the airways and bronchial mucosa of TDI asthmatics. However, some authors such as Lummus et al. observed Th 1 -like response characterized by {{an increase in the number}} of neutrophils and the levels of IFN-y and IL- 8. In order to better address those issues, we established a TDI BALB/c mouse model by subcutaneous sensitization and intranasal challenge to investigate the inflammatory and immune responses that occurred in the development of TDI-induced asthma. In this model, the Th 2 mode was involved since the TDI mice demonstrated Th 2 -like immune responses with significantly increased serum total IgE, IL- 4 and decreased IFN-y. Airway remodeling was initiated in the early phase of the development of the TDI asthma. However, neutrophildominant pulmonary inflammation in TDI-induced mouse model of asthma suggested a different inflammatory phenotype from the eosinophil-dominant allergic responses induced by high molecular weight chemicals, such as OVA and OVA 323 - 339. There are several different routes of exposure from which the professional workers finally could develop asthma. The skin might function as one of most possible initiative site for sensitization and later on, the final target tissue, airways became hyper-sensitive and asthma occurred. In this context, the improved mouse model by repeated epicutaneous sensitization and intranasal challenge was established. Similar inflammatory and immune responses were triggered as in the mice by subcutaneous sensitization. Furthermore, followed by exposure to TDI, increased airway hypersensitivity was observed when indicated by Penh with the method of plethysmography. It seems that IgG 1 may not be ignored as well as IgE in the development of TDI-induced asthma, at least in mouse model of asthma...|$|E
