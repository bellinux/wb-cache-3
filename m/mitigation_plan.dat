25|$|If {{event or}} event chain occurs {{during the course}} of a project, it may require some {{mitigation}} effort. In some cases, mitigation plans can be generated. Mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the <b>mitigation</b> <b>plan</b> to an event or event chain. These small schedules will be triggered when an event chain occurs. The same <b>mitigation</b> <b>plan</b> can be used for different events.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules site gained {{independence}} from Dupont {{as a result}} of federal anti-trust action in 1912. Hercules Powder Company contributed significantly to the production of explosives during both World Wars. By the Second World War, the plant had diversified to produce fertilizers and other chemical products. Eventually the facility was out-competed by foreign manufacturers, and the plant was closed in 1976. However, by this time the surrounding area was experiencing rapid growth as the commuter belt moved further outward from San Francisco. By the mid-1970s, home construction companies began to build new subdivisions and changed Hercules into the residential suburb as it was known up until the late 1990s. Back in the 1970s, Hercules {{was one of the first}} cities in the United States to develop a comprehensive Noise Element of the General Plan. This work included the production of noise contour maps for all major highways and arterial roads, as well as a citywide <b>mitigation</b> <b>plan.</b> Considerable study has been made of the heavy metal lead accumulated as upper layer soil contamination from prior air pollution smokestack emissions from the California Powder Works operations from this era.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of developing countries have {{expressed an interest in}} greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in the agriculture sector. However, compared to <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> in some other sectors, progress with developing agricultural <b>mitigation</b> <b>plans</b> and the allocation of climate finance to the agriculture sector have been limited. The purpose of this guide is to provide national policy makers, advisors and other stakeholders in the agriculture sector with an introduction to the main <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> approaches and the key elements that may need to be considered in the planning process. This guide describes two of the main approaches to GHG <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> in developing countries: Low-Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). It explains the possible relationships between them and their status within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). National <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> processes have policy, technical and institutional dimensions {{that need to be addressed}} in an integrated and iterative manner. For each of these dimensions four key elements are outlined. Examples from <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> processes in developing countries are provided to illustrate the range of options for addressing these key elements in country-specific ways. Special considerations for including smallholder farmers in the planning process are highlighted. This guide may be read as a companion document to the recent publication, National integrated <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> in agriculture: A review paper, which reviewed LEDS in 18 developing countries and agricultural NAMAs in 30 countries.

Once those two things are done then you must develop a floodplain map for public dissemination and then lobby the state legislators and the local realtor’s board and this is all funded with local money. The ninth goal for the <b>mitigation</b> <b>plan</b> is to enhance NFIP information through dissemination of brochures and {{public information}} releases. Once you have handed out the brochures you much put flood maps on the County’s website, continue participation in CRS activities, update F.I.R.M and continue with storm readiness.

50|$|When {{it comes}} to these {{specific}} towns {{being involved in the}} Dare County Hazard <b>Mitigation</b> <b>Plan</b> instead of their own specific city plans {{it has a lot to}} do with the fact that the Outer Banks itself is very vulnerable. These towns are often hit very hard when {{it comes to}} disasters in our state and they get the full force of the damage. These cities are often the ones who need the most help so it only makes sense that they pull together and collaborate on a plan for all of them. There are many smaller communities within these cities and the population is constantly growing as more people move the Outer Banks. Since so many people move every year to the Outer Banks of North Carolina their <b>mitigation</b> <b>plan</b> constantly needs to be updated in order to efficiently help all of its citizens.

40|$|Many US {{municipalities}} {{are engaged}} in climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning,</b> or efforts to reduce their communities’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through land-use, transportation, and energy planning. However, they face a number of procedural and institutional obstacles that limit the adoption and implementation of those plans. The literature identifies some {{of the factors that}} lead municipalities to join relevant policy networks, but provides little guidance for overcoming the aforementioned obstacles and adopting policies to reduce community-wide GHG emissions. With this study I increase the understanding of climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> by examining whether the adoption of these plans and policies is driven primarily by local demographic, economic, environmental, or political – institutional characteristics. My research is based upon a survey of 255 US municipalities. I combine the survey responses with secondary data and use multiple regression techniques to estimate the impact of fifteen demographic, political – institutional, economic, and environmental variables on the adoption of climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>plans</b> and policies. The influence of neighboring jurisdictions, the presence of staff members assigned to energy or climate planning, and the level of community environmental activism are found to have the greatest impact on climate mitigation policy adoption. These findings support the conclusion that the extent of climate <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> is driven primarily by internal processes, and municipalities that are successful in this area do not fit any one profile according to their demographic, economic, or environmental characteristics. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose {{and scope}} of the review: This review of {{national}} greenhouse gas (GHG) <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> in the agriculture sector has two objectives: (i) to provide national policy makers and others in the agriculture sector with an overview of national <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> processes and aid then in identifying the relevance of these processes for promoting agricultural development; (ii) to provide policy makers and advisors involved in low-emission development planning processes with an overview of <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning</b> in the agriculture sector and in particular to highlight the relevance of agriculture to national <b>mitigation</b> <b>plans</b> and actions. The review provides an overview of agreements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on GHG mitigation in developing countries (Section 1. 2). It distinguishes between low-emission development strategies (LEDS), which aim to guide a transition to a low-emission development pathway, and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), which are mitigation policies and measures undertaken in line with national development strategies. Chapter 2 reviews 32 LEDS from 18 developing countries. It provides summary analysis of the planning processes, the types of plans that have been produced and the contents of these plans. Chapter 2 also analyses the alignment of these LEDS with other policy goals and enabling conditions for planning, and summarizes lessons that have been gained from experience. Chapter 3 reviews 62 NAMAs in the agriculture sectors of 30 countries. It describes the status of development of the NAMAs, the agricultural activities proposed and the alignment of the NAMAs with other policies and policy goals. Chapter 3 also identifies key elements that support the development of the conception, design and implementation of NAMAs. Chapter 4 summarizes the status of and trends in national agricultural <b>mitigation</b> <b>planning,</b> the barriers and risks involved, and the opportunities and potentials for agricultural NAMAs. It also suggests an approach to NAMA development in the agriculture sector based on 12 basic building blocks...|$|R
