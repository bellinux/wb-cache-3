40|$|SummaryThe {{probabilistic}} {{expression of}} cytokine genes in differentiated T helper (Th) cell populations remains ill defined. By single-cell analyses and mathematical modeling, {{we show that}} one stimulation featured stable cytokine nonproducers as well as stable producers with wide cell-to-cell variability in the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> expression. <b>Focusing</b> on interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression by Th 1 cells, mathematical modeling predicted that this behavior reflected different cell-intrinsic capacities and not mere gene-expression noise. In vivo, Th 1 cells sort purified by secreted IFN-γ amounts preserved a quantitative memory for both probability and <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> IFN-γ re-expression for at least 1  month. Mechanistically, this memory resulted from quantitatively distinct transcription of individual alleles and was controlled by stable expression differences of the Th 1 cell lineage-specifying transcription factor T-bet.

Thus, individual Th cells commit to produce distinct amounts of a given cytokine, thereby generating functional intrapopulation heterogeneity...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{explored}} a robust representation strategy of texture images for visual recognition. The widely used local descriptor for texture analysis is local binary pattern, which characterizes each 3 × 3 local patch (microstructure) into a binary series {{by comparing the}} surrounding pixel intensity with the center one, and further has been extended to local ternary patterns via quantizing the difference values between the surrounding pixels and the center one into − 1, 0, and 1, which can be explained as the active status (i.e., positively activated, negatively activated, and not activated). However, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>focused</b> pixel, the pre-set threshold η for quantization in the conventional LTP remains fixed, which would violate the principle of human perception. Motivated {{by the fact that}} human perception of a pattern depends not only on the absolute intensity of the stimulus but also on the relative variance of the stimuli, we proposed a novel local ternary pattern (LTP) with data-driven quantization according to Weber’s law (called WLTP), which is equivalent to adaptively (data-driven) decide the quantization point according to the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>focus</b> pixel. This proposed quantization strategy is inspired by Weber’s law, a psychological law, which states that the noticeable change of a stimulus such as sound or lighting by a human being is a constant ratio of the original stimulus. Further, we incorporated the spatial and orientation context into WLTP and explored the rotation invariant co-occurrence among WLTP that has much higher descriptive capability than that of conventional LBP-based descriptors for image representation. Our experiments on two texture datasets and one food dataset confirmed that our proposed strategy greatly improved recognition performance as compared to the LBP-based descriptors and other state-of-the-art approaches.|$|R

The pre-load on a rock bolt {{plays an important role}} in the structural reinforcement and it is vital to monitor the pre-load status of rock bolts. In this paper, a rock bolt pre-load monitoring method based on the piezoceramic enabled time reversal method is proposed. A lead zirconate titanate (PZT) patch transducer, which works as an actuator to generate stress waves, is bonded onto the anchor plate of the rock bolt. A smart washer, which is fabricated by sandwiching a PZT patch between two metal rings, is installed between the hex nut and the anchor plate along the rock bolt. The smart washer functions as a sensor to detect the stress wave. With the increase of the pre-load values on the rock bolt, the effective contact surface area between the smart washer and the anchor plate, benefiting the stress wave propagation crossing the contact surface. With the help of time reversal technique, experimental results reveal that the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>focused</b> signal clearly increases with the increase of the pre-load on a rock bolt before the saturation which happens beyond a relatively high value of the pre-load. The proposed method provides an innovative and real time means to monitor the pre-load level of a rock bolt. By employing this method, the pre-load degradation process on a rock bolt can be clearly monitored. Please note that, currently, the proposed method applies to only new rock bolts, on which it is possible to install the PZT smart washer...|$|R
30|$|Although LBP-based {{descriptors}} showed promising performances {{compared to}} other feature representations, {{it is obvious that}} LBP only thresholds the differential values between neighborhood pixels and the focused one to 0 or 1, which is very sensitive to noise existing in the processed image. Tan et al. extended LBP to local ternary pattern (LTP) [20], which considers the differential values between neighborhood pixels and the focused one as no or negative/positive stimulus, and successfully applied for face recognition under difficult lighting conditions. Given a pre-set positive threshold η, LTP [20] can obtain a series of ternary values for local pattern representation. However, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>focused</b> pixel, the pre-set threshold η remains fixed, which would violate the principle of human perception. Therefore, following the fact that human perception of a pattern depends not only on the absolute intensity of the stimulus but also on the relative variance of the stimuli, we propose to quantize the ratio between the neighborhood and the center pixels, which is equivalent to adaptively (data-driven) decide the quantization point according to the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>focus</b> pixel. This proposed quantization strategy is inspired by Weber’s law, a psychological law [21], which states that the noticeable change of a stimulus such as sound or lighting by a human being is a constant ratio of the original stimulus. When the stimulus has small magnitude, small change can be noticeable. Thus, we propose a data-driven quantized local ternary pattern (WLTP) based on Weber’s law, which gives the activation status of the neighborhood pixels by data-driven thresholding the noticeable change according to the stimulus <b>of</b> the <b>focus</b> pixel: positively activated (magnitude: 1) if the ratio between the stimulus change and the focused one is larger than a constant η, negatively activated (magnitude: − 1) if the change ratio is smaller than −η, not activated (magnitude: 0) otherwise. By incorporating a co-occurrence (here, i.e., spatial and orientation) context, we extend the proposed WLTP to a rotation invariant co-occurrence WLTP (RICWLTP), which is robust to image rotation and has the high descriptive ability among WLTP co-occurrences. Compared with the-state-of-the-art methods, our proposed strategy can achieve much better performance results for several visual recognitions including two texture datasets and one food image dataset.|$|R
40|$|The {{enhanced}} {{sonic boom}} or supersonic boom generated {{as a result}} of atmospheric refraction in threshold Mach number flights was recreated in a ballistic range by firing projectiles at low supersonic speeds into a stratified medium obtained by slowly injecting carbon dioxide into air. The range was equipped with a fast-response dynamic pressure transducer and schlieren photographic equipment, and the sound speed variation with height was controlled by regulating the flow rate of the CO 2. The schlieren observations of the resulting flow field indicate that the generated shocks are reflected near the sonic cutoff altitude where local sound speed equals body speed, provided such an altitude exists. Maximum shock strength occurs very nearly {{at the point where the}} incident and reflected shocks join, indicating that the presence of the reflected shock may have an appreciable effect on the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>focus</b> factor.

40|$|The {{standard}} procedure to generate initial conditions in numerical simulations of structure formation {{is to use}} the Zel’dovich approximation (ZA). Although the ZA correctly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity perturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented, particularly for velocity perturbations because of the ZA failure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual dynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We extend the standard formulation of non-linear perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as non-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the initial conditions. These new non-linear solutions interpolate between the initial conditions and the late-time solutions given by the exact non-linear dynamics.

The image features based on micro-descriptors such as local binary patterns (LBP) and local ternary patterns (LTP) {{have been very}} successful {{in a number of}} applications including face recognition, object detection, and texture analysis. Instead of binary quantization in LBP, LTP thresholds the differential values between a focused pixel and its neighborhood pixels into three gray levels, which can be explained as the active status (i.e., positively activated, negatively activated, and not activated) of the neighborhood pixels compared to the focused pixel. However, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>focused</b> pixel, the thresholding strategy remains fixed, which would violate the principle of human perception. Therefore, in this study, we design LTP with a data-driven threshold according to Weber’s law, a human perception principle; further, our approach incorporates the contexts of spatial and orientation co-occurrences (i.e., co-occurrence context) among adjacent Weber-based local ternary patterns (WLTPs, i.e., data-driven quantized LTPs) for texture representation. The explored WLTP is formulated by adaptively quantizing differential values between neighborhood pixels and the focused pixel as negative or positive stimuli if the normalized differential values are large; otherwise, the stimulus is set to 0. Our approach here is {{based on the fact that}} human perception of a distinguished pattern depends not only on the absolute intensity of the stimulus but also on the relative variance of the stimulus. By integrating co-occurrence context information, we further propose a rotation invariant co-occurrence WLTP (RICWLTP) approach to be more discriminant for image representation. In order to validate the efficiency of our proposed strategy, we apply this to three different visual recognition applications including two texture datasets and one food image dataset and prove the promising performance that can be achieved compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.|$|R
