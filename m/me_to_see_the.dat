500|$|Special effects makeup {{designer}} David White took {{head and}} body casts of actors, such as Bautista, {{to experiment with}} materials used to create the characters. White said, [...] "James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> real deal there on set." [...] White {{was careful not to}} use [...] "modern" [...] creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different colored aliens. For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create [...] "a colorful science-fiction world", and include elements of 1950s and 60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, {{as an example of the}} latter. Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.|$|E
2500|$|Eagle Scout filmmaker Steven Spielberg {{had been}} a long-time {{supporter}} of Scouting, depicting a young Indiana Jones as a Boy Scout in the 1989 film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and helping to create the Cinematography merit badge. Spielberg resigned from the BSA Advisory Council in 2001, saying, [...] "it has deeply saddened <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Boy Scouts of America actively and publicly participating in discrimination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renoir {{was largely}} raised by Gabrielle Renard, his nanny and his mother's cousin, {{with whom he}} {{developed}} a strong bond. Shortly before his birth, {{she had come to}} live with the Renoir family. She introduced the young boy to the Guignol puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs My Life and My Films, [...] "She taught <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the cliché." [...] Gabrielle was also fascinated by the new motion-picture invention, and when Renoir was only a few years old she took him to see his first film.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Marquis, but remembering betimes {{that from}} your enemy's speech you may sometimes learn {{where to look}} for his next attack, I thought better of it and bade my host admit him.|$|R
60|$|It was amusing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how <b>the</b> detective's {{overbearing}} manner {{had changed}} suddenly {{to that of}} a child asking questions of its teacher.|$|R
6000|$|... "Her eyes," [...] said Mr. Stone, [...] "have a {{peculiar}} look; they help <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> into <b>the</b> future. I have noticed {{the same look}} {{in the eyes of}} female dogs." ...|$|R
2500|$|Moriarty has {{respect for}} Holmes's intelligence, stating that [...] "It {{has been an}} {{intellectual}} treat for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> manner in which you [...] have grappled with this case" [...] and that [...] "it would be a grief {{for me to take}} an extreme measure." [...] Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes's life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted and he is placed [...] "in positive danger of losing my liberty" [...] as well as furiously elbowing aside passengers in the train station in his pursuit of the disguised Holmes. Moriarty also shows a fiercely independent streak, pursuing Holmes to Switzerland alone, while by contrast Holmes takes Watson with him everywhere he goes.|$|E
60|$|EMMY. I said {{theres a}} lady bothering <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> doctor. That isnt asking. Its telling.|$|E
60|$|EMMY [entering and {{immediately}} beginning to dust the couch] Theres a lady bothering <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> doctor.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{your wife}} said, but she wished <b>me</b> {{particularly}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> case," [...] said Dr. Thompson. [...] "It’s also my duty as the medical {{officer of the}} port." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They do. 'Tis on {{such that}} the future of the ray-public rests." [...] And then he added: [...] "Sure, Bertie, it gripped <b>me</b> heart <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> mother's old chair!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] said I. And {{although}} my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was highly gratifying <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> answer spoilt his joke, {{and brought him}} to a dead stop.|$|R
60|$|With {{the words}} I looked out below <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> old hunter {{standing}} in the glade waving his arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he assented. [...] "But aren't {{you coming}} up to the station with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Prince-Regent arrive? He's due at seven, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do {{not talk}} so,' said Theodora. 'It only grieves <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pain I have given; {{but it would}} be worse not to break off at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not long}} however before Kenton and Jeph both appeared, the one looking sad, the other sulky. [...] "Too late," [...] Jeph muttered, [...] "and father won't let <b>me</b> go <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sport." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, fine! I made papa drive <b>me</b> over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> game. It's {{going to}} be {{something}} grand, so I've heard," [...] went on Minnie, and then she added: [...] "Thought you and your brothers were coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not blame}} {{me more than}} you can help!" [...] she said. [...] "It was a great shock <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you--with <b>the</b> son of Martin de Vaux. It was more than a shock; it was a horror <b>to</b> <b>me!</b> He is like his father! He is very like his father!" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of course it was {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> faces of these two over whom hovered a most cruel death; but I could well imagine the expression of despair on their faces.|$|E
60|$|It {{was always}} a comfort to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> soldier spirit crop up in her. While that {{remained}} in her she would be Joan of Arc, and able to look trouble and fate in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's boss fun," [...] Milton {{said to his}} father. [...] "It's ahead o' husking corn. It does tickle <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> future sheriff of {{the county}} diggin' pertaters while I'm ridin' around in my best clo'es makin' speeches." ...|$|E
6000|$|A FAINT, sickening {{scent of}} irises Persists all morning. Here {{in a jar}} on the table A fine proud spike of purple irises Rising above the class-room litter, makes <b>me</b> unable <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> class's lifted and bended faces Save in a broken pattern, amid purple and gold and [...] sable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hain't none of {{you folks}} got spunk enough <b>to</b> carry <b>me</b> over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> jedge?" [...] demanded Lem; [...] "my horses ain't fit to travel to-night." [...] Another silence followed, and Lem laughed contemptuously but good-naturedly, and turned on his heel. [...] "Guess I'll walk, then," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{found her}} very {{attractive}} indeed," [...] Tavernake admitted, without hesitation. [...] "She had an air with her. She {{was quite different}} from all the women I have ever met at the boarding-house or anywhere else. She has a face which reminded me somehow of the Madonnas you took <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in <b>the</b> National Gallery the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Dick," [...] {{observed}} March as {{they rode}} along, [...] "you must get <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Wild Man of the West; if you're so intimate with him, you can easily bring him into the cave; now won't you, Dick?" ...|$|E
60|$|Even {{before the}} smoke had cleared away {{sufficiently}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> captives, our people rushed forward, all reloading as they ran, and during {{two or three}} minutes the confusion was so great that I could not make out what might be going on.|$|E
60|$|It was {{too dark}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> look of triumph {{on the faces of}} our captors; but I knew they wore such expressions, because of the cries of {{satisfaction}} and shouts of delight which burst from them when we, unarmed, stood in their midst.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is there {{something}} he doesn't want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> in <b>the</b> {{news of the}} year 'seventy-seven?" [...] The one explanation which suggested itself to her mind assumed that form of expression--and the one method of satisfying her curiosity that seemed likely to succeed, was to search the volume which Alban had reserved for his own reading.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true, {{every word}} of it!" [...] a shrill voice rose up, and the murmuring grew louder {{in the body of}} the court, while it pleased <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>the</b> riders of Carrington vied with our humbler neighbors in this sign of approval. Then some one sternly called [...] "Silence!" [...] and the {{examination}} commenced again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} you will do every thing with perfect accuracy, Captain. At one o'clock, then, we meet at <b>the</b> Buck-stane--Stay, permit <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a minute}} Felix {{was up and}} had called out Mali from the {{neighboring}} hut. [...] "Tell Missy Queenie," [...] he cried, [...] "to come with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> man-a-oui-oui! The man-a-oui-oui has sent me for us to come. She must make great haste. He wants us immediately." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{caught the}} hand in his, and {{we stood in}} that connexion, looking at each other. We stood so, a long time; long enough for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek, and leave it a deeper red.|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s so {{very kind}} of you to propose that,” Lady Agatha said in a moment to Mrs. Lemon. “I think I’ve never been in a ship—except of course coming from England. I’m sure mamma would wish <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Hudson. We used to go in immensely for boating in England.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{pretended to}} be very angry,' he said, 'but she allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that if <b>the</b> worst came to the worst she would not permit <b>me</b> <b>to</b> break my heart.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you was {{shook up}} and silly," [...] said Dan. [...] "Anyway, {{there was only}} dad an' <b>me</b> aboard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. <b>The</b> cook he don't count." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I was {{employed}} {{to do all that}} I could to prevent the marriage. You employed me yourself, my lord. It was you sent <b>me</b> down <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> young man, and explain to him how impertinent he was. It isn't my fault, Lord Kingsbury, if things have got themselves changed since then." ...|$|R
