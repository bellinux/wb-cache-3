A third trihydroxy acid, 8,9,12-trihydroxy-5Z,10E,14Z eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin C3 or TrXC3), has been detected in rabbit and mouse aorta tissue incubated with arachidonic acid. The metabolism of HxA3 to TrXA3 and HXB3 to TrX is accomplished by soluble epoxide hydrolase in mouse liver; since it is widely distributed in various tissues of various mammalian species, including humans, soluble epoxide hydrolase may be the principal enzyme responsible for metabolizing these and perhaps other hepoxilin compounds. It seems possible, however, that other similarly acting epoxide hydrolases such as microsomal epoxide hydrolase or epoxide hydrolase 2 may prove to hepoxilin hydrolase activity. While the trihydroxy products of hepoxilin synthesis are {{generally considered to be}} inactive and the sEH pathway therefore considered as functioning to limiting the actions of the hepoxilins, some studies found that TrXA3, TrXB3, and TrXC3 were more powerful than HxA3 in relaxing pre-contracted mouse arteries and that TrXC3 was a relatively potent relaxer of rabbit pre-contracted aorta.|$|E

The ultra-fine grid is necessary to capture the length scales revealed by a complementary analysis of the steady detonation wave structure.

As a result, mathematically verified solutions for a mixture initially of all O 3 at one atmosphere and 298. 15 K have been obtained; the solutions are converging at a rate much faster than the sub-first order convergence rate of all shock-capturing schemes.

40|$|AbstractThe study {{objective}} was to compare the effect of budesonide administered as a nebulized suspension as compared to a spray with a spacer in adult asthmatics. In a double-blind, double-dummy crossover study, 26 adult patients with <b>moderately</b> severe <b>unstable</b> asthma were randomized to three 4 -week treatment periods with budesonide 0 · 8 mg b. i. d. administered by a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with spacer (Nebuhaler®) and budesonide 1 mg and 4 mg b. i. d. administered by a Pari Inhalier Boy® jet nebulizer. The nebulizer was activated only during inspiration. The total mass output was similar from the two devices but their fraction of small particles differed {{by a factor of}} 2 in favour of pMDI. Effect was evaluated from daily home measurements of peak expiratory flow (PEF), need of β 2 -agonist and symptom scores. Plasma cortisol and budesonide levels were measured in a subgroup of 10 patients. A consistent trend showed the nebulizer treatment to be at least as efficient as the pMDI plus spacer treatment. In actual fact, the apparent order of effect was: 4 mg nebulized suspension treatment ≥ 1 mg nebulized suspension treatment ≥ 0 · 8 mg pMDI with spacer treatment. Plasma budesonide and plasma cortisol also exhibited dose-related levels independent of device. The adverse effects reported appeared {{to be related to the}} dose rather than delivery device. Accordingly, the effect was related to total mass output, rather than to the small particle fraction of the budesonide aerosol. These results attest to the efficiency of jet-nebulized budesonide suspension, and indicate nebulized budesonide to be equipotent to standard budesonide therapy delivered by pMDI with Nebuhaler®, provided nebulization is synchronized with inspiration and no loss of aerosol occurs during expiration...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} coherent vortices {{and spatial}} distributions of energy density in asymptotic states of numerically simulated, horizontally homogeneous, doubly periodic, quasi two-dimensional f-plane turbulence. With geophysical applications in mind, the paper progresses from freely decaying two-dimensional flow to freely decaying equivalent barotropic flow, freely decaying two-layer quasi-geostrophic ~QG! flow, and, finally, statistically steady two-layer QG turbulence forced by a baroclinically unstable mean flow and damped by bottom Ekman friction. It is demonstrated here that, with suitable elaborations, a two-vortex state having a sinh-like potential vorticity/streamfunction (q/c) scatter plot arises {{in all of}} these systems. This extends, at least qualitatively, previous work in inviscid and freely decaying two-dimensional flows to flows having stratification, forcing, and dissipation present simultaneously. Potential vorticity steps and ribbons of kinetic energy are shown to form in freely decaying equivalent barotropic flow and in the equivalent barotropic limit of baroclinically unstable flow, which occurs when Ekman damping is strong. Thus, contrary to expectations, strong friction can under some circumstances create rather than hinder the formation of sharp features. The ribbons are present, albeit less dramatically, in <b>moderately</b> damped baroclinically <b>unstable</b> turbulence, which is arguably a reasonable model for mid-ocean mesoscale eddies...|$|R

As {{a result of the}} very high low-level temperature and dew point, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values were in excess of 8,000 J/kg; generally, values of 1,500 J/kg are considered to be <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable,</b> whereas values of more than 4,000 J/kg are considered [...] "extreme". The lifted index (LI), the dominant estimate of instability used at the time, was also extreme. Generally, an LI value of -6 °C or below readily supports severe thunderstorm development, but during the day the LI value ranged from -12 °C to -14 °C. Such extreme instability can lead to explosive thunderstorm development, very strong updrafts, and modulates the updraft to better enable tornadogenesis.|$|E

The risk area was shifted eastward and heightened to an enhanced risk the following day, with the SPC warning of {{the potential for}} damaging wind gusts and a strong tornado or two. A mesoscale convective system developed across eastern Texas early on January 2, aided by the combination of a strong upper-level trough, a <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable</b> atmosphere, and sufficient moisture. As the convection progressed east, hundreds of damaging wind reports and numerous tornado reports were received. The Louisiana towns of Bunkie and Hessmer sustained moderate damage from EF1 tornadoes. An EF2 tornado destroyed chicken houses and caused tree damage near Mount Olive, Mississippi, while another EF2 struck Rehobeth, Alabama, causing considerable damage at a local festival grounds. Rear flank downdraft winds away from the Rehobeth tornado killed four people when a large tree crushed a mobile home. Three separate EF2 tornadoes occurred near Blakely and Arlington, Georgia, causing major tree damage, destroying farm structures, and causing severe roof damage to a few homes.

40|$|Several {{methods are}} {{described}} {{that could be}} used by a farm manager to define the spatial and temporal stability within a field from a series of yield maps. A quantitative analysis of soil phosphate concentration and pasture dry matter yield data over 4 years (2004 - 2007) were investigated to identify the spatial and temporal stability in a 6 ha pasture field. The data were combined into two maps that characterize the spatial and temporal variation recorded over the 4 years. The two maps were then combined to create a single map with five management classes, each with different characteristics that can {{have an impact on the}} way the field is managed. These categories are: high yielding and stable, high yielding and moderately stable, low yielding and stable, low yielding and <b>moderately</b> stable and <b>unstable.</b> The unstable class represents 83 % and 93 % of the total area with regard to soil phosphate concentration and pasture dry matter yield, respectively. Results from this study show that the significant temporal stability found cancels out over time, leaving a relatively homogenous map of spatial variation. The implication of the findings is that each pasture field should be managed according to the current year’s conditions. These results also justify a further study that evaluates the soil phosphorous dynamics under Mediterranean conditions...|$|R
40|$|A bright {{prominence}} {{associated with}} a coronal mass ejection (CME) was seen erupting from the Sun on 9 April 2008. This prominence was tracked by both the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) EUVI and COR 1 telescopes, and was seen to rotate about the line of sight a it erupted; therefore, the event has been nicknamed the "Cartwheel CME. " The threads of the prominence {{in the core of}} the CME quite clearly indicate the structure of a weakly to moderately twisted flux rope throughout the field of view, up to heliocentric heights of 4 solar radii. Although the STEREO separation was 48 deg, it was possible to match some sharp features in the later part of the eruption as seen in the 304 A line in EUVI and in the H-alpha-sensitive bandpass of COR I by both STEREO Ahead and Behind. These features could then be traced out in three-dimensional space, and reprojected into a view in which the eruption is directed toward the observer. The reconstructed view shows that the alignment of the prominence to the vertical axis rotates as it rises up to a leading-edge height of approximately equal to 2. 5 solar radii, and then remains approximately constant. The alignment at 2. 5 solar radii differs by about 115 deg from the original filament orientation inferred from H-alpha and EUV data, and the height profile of the rotation, obtained here for the first time, shows that two thirds of the total rotation are reached within approximately equal to 0. 5 solar radii above the photosphere. These features are well reproduced by numerical simulations of an <b>unstable</b> <b>moderately</b> twisted flux rope embedded in external flux with a relatively strong shear field component...|$|R
40|$|The current {{economic}} situation in rural territories {{is characterized by}} many challenges to their sustainable development. The level {{and quality of life}} in rural areas, underdevelopment of social infrastructure, the environmental situation significantly contributes to the depopulation of the rural territories. In this regard, {{it is very important to}} research and discuss the possible decision of problems of development of rural settlements. The actions of the state on formation of the complex of normative-legal documents regulating state policy in the field of rural development are aimed at ensuring the management of these areas by federal authorities which leads to some extent to resource dependence on it, and reduces the motivation of regional and municipal management to the formation of effective policy of rural development. The management of the regions chooses its directions of developing rural areas, without taking into account the prevailing socio-economic situation at the municipal level and features of development of rural settlements, which reduces the effectiveness of the management of the territory. As an example the authors have evaluated the level of rural areas development in Orel Region and proposed a classification of areas at regional level. The results of the research show that there could be three levels of rural territories development: highly stable, <b>moderately</b> stable and <b>unstable</b> areas. The main indicators of development of rural territories were selected as follows: incomes and expenses of budgets of rural areas, the volume of investments in fixed capital, average monthly nominal accrued wages of employees of enterprises and organizations, agricultural production in farms of all categories of the rural population.

40|$|As part of {{a general}} {{investigation}} {{to determine the effects of}} simulator motions on pilot opinion and task performance over a wide range of vehicle longitudinal dynamics, a cooperative NASA-AMAL program was conducted on the centrifuge at Johnsville, Pennsylvania. The test parameters and measurements for this program duplicated those of earlier studies made at Ames Research Center with a variable-stability airplane and with a pitch-roll chair flight simulator. Particular emphasis was placed on the minimum basic damping and stability the pilots would accept and on the minimum dynamics they considered controllable in the event of stability-augmentation system failure. Results of the centrifuge-simulator program indicated that small positive damping was required by the pilots over most of the frequency range covered for configurations rated acceptable for emergency conditions only (e. g., failure of a pitch damper). It was shown that the pilot's tolerance for unstable dynamics was dependent primarily on the value of damping. For configurations rated acceptable for emergency operation only, the allowable instability and damping corresponded to a divergence time to double amplitude of about 1 second. Comparisons were made of centrifuge, pitch-chair and fixed-cockpit simulator tests with flight tests. Pilot ratings indicated that the effects of incomplete or spurious motion cues provided by these three modes of simulation were important only for high-frequency, lightly damped dynamics or <b>unstable,</b> <b>moderately</b> damped dynamics. The pitch- chair simulation, which provided accurate angular-acceleration cues to the pilot, compared most favorably with flight. For the centrifuge simulation, which furnished accurate normal accelerations but spurious pitching and longitudinal accelerations, there was a deterioration of pilots' opinion relative to flight results. Results of simulator studies with an analog pilot replacing the human pilot illustrated the adaptive capability of human pilots in coping with the wide range of vehicle dynamics and the control problems covered in this study. It was shown that pilot-response characteristics, deduced by the analog-pilot method, could be related to pilot opinion. Possible application of these results for predicting flight-control problems was illustrated by means of an example control-problem analysis. The results of a brief evaluation of a pencil-type side-arm controller in the centrifuge showed a considerable improvement in the pilots' ability to cope with high-frequency, low-damping dynamics, compared to results obtained with the center stick. This improvement with the pencil controller was attributed primarily to a marked reduction in the adverse effects of large and exaggerated pitching and longitudinal accelerations on pilot control precision...|$|R
40|$|Aggregate {{stability}} and aggregate size distribution on soil surface that is impacted by rain drops affect soil erosion yet {{little is known}} about less weathered coarse textured soils. The objectives of the current study were to determine (i) the aggregate {{stability and}} associated aggregate fraction size distribution and (ii) the impact of the initial aggregate size on the aggregate stability and the resulting sediment fraction size distribution following rain drop impact in some quartz dominated coarse textured soils in the Eastern Cape Province. Soil samples for this experiment were collected from 14 ecotopes on the surface with a natural slope between 7. 5 to 11 % and at the depth between 0 to 0. 2 m in the Eastern Cape Province. In each ecotope, twenty-five different spots were sampled using a spade at depth 0 to 0. 2 m in other to eradicate biasness and ensure homogeneity. Thereafter, the soil samples were mixed to make a composite sample. The composited soil samples were then placed in rigid containers and taken to the soil science laboratory of the University of Fort Hare, Alice Campus where analyses were carried out. The soil properties were determined by passing the 0. 053 mm fragments. The remaining > 0. 053 mm was re-immersed in ethanol and further oven dried at 40 o C for 5 minutes. Thereafter, the > 0. 053 mm fraction was transferred from 0. 053 mm sieve, oven dried at 40 o C, dry sieved using Digital Electromagnetic Shaker on a six column of sieves: 2 mm, 1 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 25 mm, 0. 106 mm, and 0. 053 mm. The aggregate stability was determined using the resulting size distribution in seven classes by calculating the mean weight diameter (MWD, mm). The soils were very stable, <b>moderately</b> stable or <b>unstable.</b> The presence of smectite and cultivation as opposed to pasture lowered aggregate stability. The studied soils showed three different aggregate size distributions. Unstable soils were dominated by 0. 106 – 0. 25 mm aggregate size and showed a positively skewed aggregate fraction size distribution. Aggregates finer than 0. 106 mm were limited because of the coarse nature of the soil texture. Moderately stable soils broke down to both micro aggregates, 0. 106 – 0. 25 mm and macro aggregates, 2 – 5 mm giving a bimodal distribution. The aggregate size distribution in the very stable soils was dominated by the aggregate fraction size 2 – 5 mm and a negatively skewed aggregate fraction size distribution. The smaller the initial aggregate size the higher was the aggregate stability but the reverse was true for splash erosion. It was thought that the short 5 minutes duration of the rainfall might not have been enough to cause a total breakdown of the aggregates. Alternatively, ecotopes that were dominated by primary soil minerals such as quartz showed different breakdown behaviour compared to those containing secondary minerals such as kaolinite or smectite...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the thermoresponsive {{dispersion}} stability of nanoparticles coated with self-assembled ionic surfactant shells. The {{objective is to}} provide experimental evidence for a loss of colloidal stability at high temperatures and to explore the characteristics of {{and the reason for}} the dispersion breakdown. The influence of the properties of the system, e. g. concentrations or the structure of the surfactant, should be investigated in order to control the temperature of dispersion breakdown. The dispersion stability of hydrophilic boehmite-nanoparticles in aqueous sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) solutions was studied at room temperature. On increasing surfactant concentration and decreasing particle concentration, the system changes from stable via <b>moderately</b> stable to <b>unstable</b> and back. Fully redispersed particles are present being stabilised, in first approximation, by a self-assembled surfactant bilayer on the surface. The position of two transitions, namely for complete precipitation and for beginning redispersion, can be fitted accurately by using a simple model based on an H-type adsorption and including the specific surface area of the particle and molar area of the surfactant. In order to assess influence of the surfactant chain length on the dispersion stability, dispersion stability diagrams of hydrophobic boehmite nanoparticles in aqueous n-alkyltrimethylammonium bromide solutions (CnTAB, alkyl chain lengths 10 - 16) were investigated in detail. On increasing surfactant concentration and decreasing particle concentration, the dispersions change from unstable to fully stable. At very high surfactant concentration, an additional instability region caused by depletion flocculation is found. At low particle concentrations, the transition from the intermediate to the stable region, i. e. the disappearance of the precipitate, occurs at a constant surfactant concentration. This concentration is introduced as the “critical dispersion concentration” (cdc). The logarithm of the cdc shows a linear dependence on the surfactant chain length, thus a cmc-analogous behaviour. Turbidity measurements in a pressurised vessel give clear evidence that dispersions of nanoparticles with self-assembled ionic surfactant shells (both hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles) breakdown at elevated temperatures of 100 - 200 °C. For hydrophobic boehmite particles in CnTAB solution at constant particle concentration, the temperature of dispersion breakdown increases strongly up to a maximum with increasing surfactant concentration. The breakdown is triggered by the desorption of the surfactant molecules from the particle surface and subsequent flocculation of the particles by hydrophobic interactions. The adsorption-desorption equilibrium, which is influenced by the surfactant concentration, is the origin of the increase of the dispersion breakdown temperature. For C 10 TAB and C 12 TAB, the dispersion breakdown temperature drops again with increasing surfactant concentration after the maximum, because the mechanism of the dispersion breakdown changes. Since from here on the surfactant micelles are still present when the dispersion breaks down, destabilisation is caused by depletion flocculation. For C 14 TAB and C 16 TAB, the dispersion breakdown temperature deceases only slightly with increasing surfactant concentration after the maximum. Since additionally micelles are dissolved before the dispersions break down, nanoparticles coated with C 14 TAB and C 16 TAB generally are only subject to surfactant desorption. Long surfactant chains are found to give higher dispersion breakdown temperatures than short ones. For a quantitative comparison with respect to the much different surfactant concentrations of C 10 TAB and C 16 TAB, the concentration of not-adsorbed, thus free surfactant molecules in solution, cfree, is normalised to the corresponding cmc. At a normalised concentration of 1, the temperatures of dispersion breakdown show a linear dependence on the surfactant chain-length. The dispersion breakdown temperature depends strongly on the particle concentration gammaboehmite. The decrease of the breakdown temperature with increasing gammaboehmite is in good qualitative agreement with the dependence on surfactant concentration, since cfree decreases, when the total surfactant concentration is kept constant. However, for a quantitative comparison at constant cfree, higher particle concentrations gives lower dispersion breakdown temperatures than low gammaboehmite, which is most likely affect by a different number of the counterions dissociated from the ionic-surfactant shell on the particles. A redispersion of high-temperature flocculated dispersions upon cooling is possible, even though heavily dependent on the surfactant concentration. There is a minimum concentration of around the cmc required for redispersion, and depletion flocculated samples at high concentration cannot be redispersed...|$|R

On the other hand, analysis of the α-globin genes showed a base substitution at codon 125 (CTG→CGG) of the α 2 -globin gene, ascertaining a homozygosity for Hb Plasencia (HBA 2 :c. 377 T>G). This variant has an unstable α chain. In {{the absence of a}} thorough work-up, dyserythropoietic anemia associated with hemoglobin (Hb) variants having a <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable</b> α chain, may be mistaken for CDA II...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a near-infrared imaging survey of Globule 2 in the Coalsack. This Bok globule {{is the highest}} density region of this southern hemisphere molecular cloud and {{is the most likely}} location for young stars in this complex. The survey is complete for K < 14. 0, H < 14. 5, and J < 15. 5, several magnitudes more sensitive than previous observations of this globule. From the large number of background stars, we derive an accurate near-infrared extinction law for the cloud. Our result, EJ−H/EH−K = 2. 08 ± 0. 03, is significantly steeper than results for other southern clouds. We use the J − H/H − K color-color diagram to identify two potential young stars with K < 14. 0 in the region. We apply H-band star counts to derive the density profile of the Coalsack Globule 2 and use a polytropic model to describe the internal structure of this small cloud. For a gas temperature T ∼ 15 K, this globule is <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable...</b>|$|E
40|$|Double-diffusive finger {{convection}} is a {{hydrodynamic instability}} {{that can occur}} when two components with different diffusivities ae oppositely stratifkd {{with respect to the}} fluid density gradient as a critical condition is exceeded. Laboratory experiments were designed using sodium chloride and sucrose solutions in a Hele-Shaw cell. A high resolution, full field, light transmission technique was used to study the development of the instability. The initial buoyancy ratio (RP), which is a ratio of fluid density contributions by the two solutes, was vtied systematically in the experiments so that the range of parameter space spanned conditions that were nearly stable (RP= 2. 8) to those that were <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable</b> (Z$=l. 4). In systems of low Rp, fingers develop within several minutes, merge with adjacent fingers, form conduits, and stall before newer-generated fingers ~avel through the conduits and continue the process. Solute fluxes in low Rp systems quickly reach steady state and are on the order of 104 m 2 See-’. In the higher Rp experiments...|$|E
40|$|A stock exhibiting hypermutability {{with respect}} to visible mutants (Om) {{affecting}} optic morphology was subjected to genetic analysis. The production of Om mutants, independently recovered with a frequency of two per 104, is restricted to females and depends primarily on homozygosity of their X chromosomes; in heterozygotes, Om mutability is stimulated {{by the presence of}} either one of two extrachromosomally replicating elements previously identified in other stocks having cryptic mutability systems. The semidominant and nonpleiotropic Om mutants are not associated with gross rearrangements and they map to at least 15 loci. Most of the loci defined by mapping are represented by two or more Om mutants which, despite considerable interlocus mimicry, sometimes display locus-specific phenotypes. Om mutants are <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable,</b> and they are subject to dominant suppressors that arise spontaneously at either of two X-linked loci. An interpretation of these observations invokes an X-linked transposable element (tom) that specifically inserts into control sequences shared by a set of structural genes involved in eye morphogenesis...|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} methods for {{identifying}} {{the stability of}} asphaltene in crude oil. These methods can approximately determine oils with the potential of asphaltene precipitation. Some of the older, but more popular, methods have been employed for the stability of asphaltenes, including asphaltene–resin ratio, Oliensis spot test, light scattering, measurement of particle size, colloidal instability index (CII), microscopic observations, and refractive index (RI). The latter (RI) was first introduced and used by Buckley (1999 for predicting the asphaltene precipitation onset. The {{results showed that the}} RI was independent of asphaltene content and occurred at a characteristic RI of 1.42 – 1.44. Another method- used to predict asphaltene deposition CII was presented by Yen et al. (2001) as CII = (Saturates + Asphaltene)/(Aromatics + Resin). They found that, if CII is less than 0.7, the oil would be stable, and asphaltene precipitation would not occur. However, if this index is higher than 0.9, the oil would be very unstable, and thus asphaltene precipitation would occur. Finally, if it is between 0.7 and 0.9, the oil would be <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{instability}} of circular vortices is studied numerically {{in the surface}} quasigeostrophic (SQG) model, and their evolutions are {{compared with those of}} barotropically unstable 2 D vortices. The growth rates in the SQG model evidence similarity with their barotropic counterparts for moderate radial gradients of temperature (or of vorticity in the 2 D model). For stronger gradients, SQG vortices are more unstable than 2 D vortices. The nonlinear, finite-amplitude evolutions of perturbed vortices provide evidence that <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable,</b> elliptically perturbed vortices form tripoles. When they are more unstable, they break into two dipoles. Weakly unstable vortices with triangular perturbations form transient quadrupoles that break; they stabilize only for large gradients of mean temperature. Finally, with square perturbations, pentapoles degenerate into dipoles, at least for the range of mean temperature gradients explored here. The analysis of nonlinear stabilizations reveals that the deformation of the vortex core and the leak of its temperature anomaly to the periphery are essential ingredients to stabilize the perturbation at finite amplitude. In conclusion, SQG vortex instability exhibits considerable similarity to the barotropic {{instability of}} 2 D vortices...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{processes}} creating intermediate and heavy nuclei in massive stars {{it is necessary to}} provide neutron capture cross sections and reaction rates close to stability and for <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable</b> neutron-rich nuclei. Furthermore, one has to know the efficiency of neutron-releasing reactions in the main evolutionary phases of a massive star. We present simulations of the nucleosynthesis in a 15 and 25 solar mass star, for the first time followed completely from main sequence hydrogen burning until the type II supernova explosion including all nuclides up to Bi. Theoretical reaction rates were calculated with the NON-SMOKER code, providing a complete library of Hauser-Feshbach cross sections and rates for nuclear and astrophysical applications. Experimental rates at stability were taken from different sources. The impact of uncertainties in the rates on nucleosynthesis are illustrated by two examples, the reactions 62 Ni(n,gamma) 63 Ni and 22 Ne(alpha,n) 25 Mg.

40|$|Abstract. We {{have checked}} {{the reality of}} the yellow {{evolutionary}} void (which is an area in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where atmospheres of blueward evolving super- and hypergiants are <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable),</b> by comparing one star inside the void: HD 33579 (= R 76), and two at the low-temperature border of it: HR 8752 (= HD 217476, V 509 Cas) and IRC+ 10420. We found that the first star has a large mass and a fairly stable behaviour over time. These aspects suggest, together with abundance determinations by others, that it is a fairly young, still redward-evolving supergiant. For such a star the void is not forbidden. The two other stars, HR 8752 resp. IRC+ 10420, have low masses which places them in the post-red blueward loop. They show indications of the expected bouncing effect for blueward returning red supergiants: when approaching the void they eject mass, resulting in a sudden reduction of Teff and a decrease of the atmospheric acceleration to geff ≃ zero. Thereafter Teff and geff increase again. For HR 8752 two such recent ‘bounces’ have been identified. The photometric variations of HR 8752 and of HD 33579 are due to high–l gravity-wave pulsations...|$|E
40|$|Hemoglobin Aalborg is a <b>moderately</b> <b>unstable</b> {{hemoglobin}} variant with no affiliation {{to serious}} hematological abnormality or major clinical symptoms under normal circumstances. Our index person was a healthy woman of 58, not previously diagnosed with hemoglobinopathy Aalborg, who developed acute respiratory failure after a routine cholecystectomy. Initially she was suspected of idiopathic interstitial lung disease, yet {{a series of}} tests uncovered various abnormal physiological parameters and set the diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy Aalborg. This led us to examine a group of the index person’s relatives known with hemoglobinopathy Aalborg in order to study whether the same physiological abnormalities would be reencountered. They were all subjected to spirometry and body plethysmography, six-minute walking test, pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gas samples before and after the walking test. The entire study population presented the same physiological anomalies: reduction in diffusion capacity, and abnormalities in PaO 2 and p 50 values; the latter could not be presented by the arterial blood gas analyzer; furthermore there was concordance between pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas samples regarding saturation. These data suggest that, based upon the above mentioned anomalies in physiological parameters, the diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy Aalborg should be considered...|$|E
