40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to draw {{attention}} to calculations on the environmental effects of agriculture and to the definition of marginal agricultural yield. When calculating the environmental impacts of agricultural activities, the real environmental load generated by agriculture is not revealed properly through ecological footprint indicators, as the type of agricultural farming (thus the nature of the pollution it creates) is not incorporated in the calculation. It is commonly known that extensive farming uses relatively small amounts of labor and capital. It produces a lower yield per unit of land and thus requires more land than intensive farming practices to produce similar yields, so it has a larger crop and grazing footprint. However, intensive farms, to achieve higher yields, apply fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, etc., and cultivation and harvesting are often mechanized. In this study, the focus is on highlighting the differences in the environmental impacts of extensive and intensive farming practices through a statistical analysis of the factors determining agricultural yield. A marginal function is constructed for the relation between chemical fertilizer use and yield per unit fertilizer input. Furthermore, a proposal is presented for how calculation of the yield factor could possibly be improved. The yield factor used in the calculation of biocapacity is not the <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> for a given area, but is calculated from the real and actual yields, and this way biocapacity and the ecological footprint for cropland are equivalent. Calculations for cropland biocapacity do not show the area needed for sustainable production, but rather the actual land area used for agricultural production. The proposal the authors present is a modification of the yield factor and also the changed biocapacity is calculated. The results of statistical analyses reveal the need for a clarification of the methodology for calculating <b>marginal</b> <b>yield,</b> which could clearly contribute to assessing the real environmental impacts of agriculture...|$|E

25|$|At {{the heart}} of yield {{management}} decision-making process is the trade-off of <b>marginal</b> <b>yields</b> from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers {{in the hopes that}} the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for inventory control decisions. In these cases the intersection of the marginal revenue curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the point of interest.|$|R

Although {{life insurance}} is designed as a long-term contract, replacement of policies remains high. This study illustrates an analytical tool (<b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> analysis) that provides insight on the life insurance replacement decision.

30|$|The {{nature of}} the {{production}} system may also lend itself to the poor performance of cooperatives. Traditionally, beehives are placed within homes or backyards promoting individual commitment. However, cooperatives are given apiary sites demanding frequent visit and follow up to which many of the members fail to commit. In addition, lack of space and pesticide use around the apiary sites were reported to be the reasons impeding hive productivity. In sum, contracting {{is found to be}} instrumental for improving honey production, sales and income. However, care must be taken in interpreting the result as contract and cooperative participants are small in number. Conducting the survey at larger scale may be relevant to develop the complete picture on the contributions of contracts to honey production and producers’ welfare in Ethiopia. As such types of studies are scarce, it is difficult to have a benchmark to compare the <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> and the welfare effect of contract participation. It is then believed that it may serve as a good reference for similar studies in the future.|$|E

40|$|One obtains Bell’s inequalities if one posits a {{hypothetical}} joint probability distribution, or measure, whose <b>marginals</b> <b>yield</b> the probabilities {{produced by the}} spin measurements in question. The existence of a joint measure is in turn equivalent to a certain causality condition known as “screening off”. We show that if one assumes, more generally, a joint quantal measure, or “decoherence functional”, one obtains instead an analogous inequality weaker {{by a factor of}} √ 2. The proof of this “Tsirel’son inequality” is geometrical and rests on the possibility of associating a Hilbert space to any strongly positive quantal measure. These results lead both to a question: “Does a joint measure follow from some quantal analog of ‘screening off’?”, and to the observation that non-contextual hidden variables are viable in histories-based quantum mechanics, even if they are excluded classically. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{behavior}} of inventories and {{their role in the}} short-run dynamics of commodity production and price. Competitive producers of a storable commodity react to price changes by balancing costs of changing production with costs of changing inventory holdings. To determine these costs, I estimate a structural model of production, sales, and storage for copper, heating oil, and lumber. I then examine the implications of these costs for inventory behavior, and for {{the behavior of}} spot and futures prices. I find that inventories may serve to smooth production during periods of low or normal prices, but during periods of temporarily high prices inventories have a more important role in facilitating production and deliver scheduling and avoiding stockouts. This paper differs from earlier studies of inventory behavior in three respects. First, I focus on homogeneous and highly fungible commodities. This helps avoid aggregation problems, simplifies the meaning of <b>marginal</b> convenience <b>yield,</b> and allows the use of direct measures of units produced, rather than inferences from dollar sales. Second, I estimate Euler equations, and allow <b>marginal</b> convenience <b>yield</b> to be a convex function of inventories. This is more realistic, and better explains the value of storage and its role in the dynamics of price. Third, I use futures prices to directly measure <b>marginal</b> convenience <b>yield.</b> This produces tighter estimates of the parameters of the convenience yield function. Supported by M. I. T.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the bureaucratization of safety, {{and the increase}} in safety as measurable bureaucratic accountability. The bureaucratization of safety-which has accelerated since the 1970 s-revolves around hierarchy, specialization and division of labor, and formalized rules. Bureaucratic accountability refers to the activities expected of organization members to account for the safety performance of those they are responsible for (e. g. unit, team, site). Bureaucratization of safety has brought benefits, including a reduction of harm, standardization, transparency and control. It has been driven by regulation, liability and insurance arrangements, outsourcing and contracting, and technologies for surveillance and data storage. However, bureaucratization generates secondary effects that run counter to its original goals. These include a reduced <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> of safety initiatives, bureaucratic entrepreneurism and pettiness, an inability to predict unexpected events, structural secrecy, "numbers games," the creation of new safety problems, and constraints on organization members 2 ̆ 7 personal freedom, diversity and creativity, as well as a hampering of innovation.

Its purpose is to facilitate and encourage further research on the economics of product characteristics.

The report presents a model of consumer behavior and a model of firm behavior, both of which lead to three hypotheses, (a) Price paid for a product equals {{the sum of the}} monetary values of the product’s characteristics. Monetary value of each characteristic of a product equals the product’s <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> of the characteristic multiplied by the marginal implicit price paid for the characteristic.

40|$|This study {{proposed}} a modelling framework which addresses various {{issues such as}} decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> of corn with respect to fertilizer use in biofuel production and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. Particularly, the framework considered exogenous changes including oil price development and biofuel policy through market interactions of different inputs and outputs in biofuel production. We applied the modelling framework numerically in an example of corn ethanol production in the United States to illustrate how the economics of fertilizer use could impact the GHG emissions based on both average and marginal emissions. The results show that higher oil prices increase the prices of gasoline, natural gas, ethanol, and corn, which stimulates corn-based ethanol production and increases corn yields by encouraging profit-maximizing farmers to increase their application rate of nitrogen fertilizers slightly. The effect is that, on average, GHG emissions per unit of produced corn ethanol remain almost constant if oil price increases from 60 to 120 $/barrel. However, the marginal emissions per additional unit of ethanol production increase by 2. 2 % or 10 %, {{depending on whether the}} Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit is implemented or not. More important is that the marginal emissions of corn ethanol are much higher than those of conventional gasoline. Although on average there are GHG emission savings of corn ethanol compared to conventional gasoline, the savings are negative when based on the marginal emissions of corn ethanol. An interesting implication is that the effectiveness of biofuel policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions might be questionable...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is very important}} to use the existing cultivated lands more efficiently. Land suitability evaluation makes the sustainable use of the lands feasible. The objective of this study was qualitative, quantitative and economic suitability evaluation of irrigated croplands for wheat, maize and sesame in Mehran plain, Ilam Province. Soil survey in the field, laboratory analysis of the soil samples, qualitative, quantitative and economic evaluation were different successive stages of this research. In qualitative evaluation, climatic, topographic and soil suitability classes were determined according to the degree of the matching with plant requirements, by parametric (square root) method. Quantitative and economic evaluations were done based on observed, potential and <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> analysis. Results of the qualitative land evaluation showed that most of the land units were classified moderately suitable for given crops because of soil limitations. Qualitatively, most of the land units were classified in the same classes as, or in lower classes than quantitative suitability classes for wheat and maize production, due to high management level at the farms. Whereas quantitative classes of sesame were determined lower than qualitative classes induced by low management level for this crop. Economic land suitability classification showed that the wheat production was the most economic land utilization type. Results of the economic assessment suggested that the cultivation of wheat in rotation with sesame would produce the most income for different units and could be increased in future using improvement in management level in the study area for sesame cultivation...|$|E
40|$|We {{determine}} the ¿optimal¿ management of a closed growing system with multiple sources of water, of price decreasing with quality. The management that balances marginal costs {{of water and}} fertilizers with <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> loss is determined. By using a number of yield response curves, {{in a couple of}} different cases (Holland and Mediterranean basin), we show that, with realistic prices both of resources and of produce, closed systems are financially viable only in two cases: 1. in regions with good water or 2. with high-value crops that offset the costs of ensuring good water (such as rain collection or desalinisation), so that there is no advantage for a grower to maintain a closed loop whenever the quality of irrigation water is poor. This means that a price structure of water resources that shifts the economic optimum towards poorer irrigation water has the consequence that the irrigation loop cannot be closed. In other words, {{there is no way that}} low-value crops using poor irrigation water may still be profitable under stricter environmental rules. We conclude that in view of the environmental impact, it would be advisable for irrigation and local authorities in horticultural areas either to provide good water at a relatively high price or to consider subsidizing investment costs of on-site desalinization plants, rather than stimulating use of poor quality water, or attempting to prevent pollution through unrealistic regulations. This means that local authorities, seriously planning to reduce agricultural pollution, should either provide incentives for growers to switch to less sensitive or more valuable combinations of crops, or contemplate developing other economic activities than agriculture...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{fraction of}} protected cultivations is on systems where drain water is recollected and re-used for irrigation (closed systems). Such systems {{have a direct}} reward for growers in saving on fertilizers (and water) costs and in a higher value of the product, caused by a better control of the root environment. In view of {{the benefit of the}} prevention of leaching of chemicals in the environment, the application of closed irrigation systems is being increasingly made compulsory. However, when irrigation water contains non-nutrient salts, such salts will accumulate in the closed loop. Since a high salt concentration is known to cause yield loss (though the effect is specie-specific), first or later salts will have to be leached out, by draining the loop. Indeed, even in Holland (where environmental rules are possibly the strictest) growers are allowed to leach the system whenever a specie-specific ceiling of sodium concentration is reached. It can be shown that in a crop cycle, the fraction of water that is leached is nearly proportional to the ratio between the concentration of the critical salt of the irrigation water and the concentration at which the system is leached. In principle, therefore, the ¿optimal¿ EC-ceiling can be calculated, that balances marginal costs of water and fertilizers with <b>marginal</b> <b>yield</b> loss. By using a number of yield response curves, in a couple of different cases (Holland and Mediterranean basin), we show that, with realistic prices both of resources and of produce, the optimal EC is very near to the value that ensures maximal yield. That is, there is no advantage to the grower in maintaining a closed loop whenever the quality of irrigation water is poor. Therefore, closed systems are financially viable only in two cases: a. in regions with good water or b. with high-value crops that offset the costs of ensuring good water (such as rain collection or desalinization). We will show that the latter is the case in most protected cultivation in Europe. On the other hand, {{there is no way that}} low-value crops in poor-water-quality regions may still be profitable under stricter environmental rules. This means that local authorities, seriously planning to enforce such rules, should either provide incentives for growers to switch to less sensitive or more valuable combinations of crops, or contemplate developing other economic activities than agriculture...|$|E

Historical weather data was used to develop a range of conditions experienced at the location. Sound weather data improves the dependability of management strategies. Data from weather stations on the Automated Weather Data Network and the Colorado AgMet network were evaluated based upon net radiation and dew point temperature observations expected in an irrigated agricultural setting. This weather data was used to create a relationship between the Penman-Montieth evapotranspiration (ET) and Hargreaves ET and the geographical location of the weather stations. The AquaCrop model was calibrated to data from the Carbon Sequestration Project at Mead, Nebraska. The model was able to accurately predict canopy cover (R 2 = 0. 96), biomass production (R 2 = 0. 98), and yields (R 2 = 0. 84, RMSE = 0. 72 Mg ha- 1).

The request stemmed from disagreement among CGIAR donors on how much IRRI’s research investments in <b>marginal</b> areas <b>yield</b> in terms of productivity increase, sustainable impacts on livelihood improvement, poverty reduction, food security and environmental sustainability. The report stresses that rice based systems in the uplands wil remain relevant for the foreseeable future and that IRRI has an important role to play in uplands rice research. The report recommends that IRRI's resource allocation to uplands rice research should be maintained at a level that allows it to fulfuill this mandate...|$|R
40|$|Rough {{set theory}} {{has not been}} applied to {{automatic}} target recognition (ATR) problems because the problems of interest were too large. The determination of reducts (classifiers) was a problem whose solution grew in exponential time {{with the number of}} range bins. This paper introduces a method which allows the determination of reducts in quadratic time and a method of partitioning the problem (reducing the number of range bins being considered) so that ATR problems can be solved in a reasonable time. A method of fusing the individual classifier results, even though they may not have performed well on the training set (marginal reduct) is introduced. This fusion of <b>marginal</b> reducts <b>yields</b> a synergistic result that produces a well performing classifier...|$|R
