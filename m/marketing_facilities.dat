40|$|This paper argues {{the case}} for {{increasing}} {{the focus on the}} "place" element of the marketing mix when marketing sport. The contention that marketing and promotional strategy decisions are largely determined by the capabilities and features of the sport facility is used to argue that "place" becomes the most important element of the marketing mix when <b>marketing</b> <b>facility</b> dependent sport services. "Place" is considered from three points of view: place as a temporal and spatial concept, place from an anthropological point of view, and, finally, place from the contemporary sport spectator's point of view. A refocused <b>marketing</b> mix for <b>facility</b> dependent sport services is presented. The refocused sport marketing mix is derived from the importance of the facility as an outlet for social interaction and, as a consequence, the use of services marketing techniques to maximise spectator enjoyment. Facility dependent sport services and those sport services not dependent on facilities are distinguished. A comparison illustrates the need for the place variable to be given a prominent position when <b>marketing</b> <b>facility</b> dependent sport services. ...|$|R
