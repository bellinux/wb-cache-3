40|$|Rational use of raw {{materials}} and waste {{is one of the}} most important factors determining the effectiveness of any processing enterprise. Industrial wastes of mining and metallurgical industries are a valuable source of many elements. However, little activity of the mineral and inconsistent chemical and phase composition of the waste reduce their attractiveness for use as a secondary raw material, and the presence of heavy metals and water-soluble compounds is a serious environmental threat. Fractional excretion of elements that make up the slag can be carried out with the help of their recovery by disintegration-wave method. The paper presents a machine-hardware circuits for the implementation of recovery process of slag and disintegrator design. In conducting research on the example of slag samples of the enterprises in Stavropol and Krasnoyarsk territories, it was found out that the observed enrichment of slags on the composition of iron takes place, its physical and chemical activity increases and persists for a long period of time. These facts were noted in the study of the microstructure and the results of spectral analysis of the initial slags and subjected to recovery by disintegration-wave method. The results analysis led to the conclusion about the possibility of waste recovery of mining and metallurgical industries with by disintegration-wave method. Resulting in the processing materials with enhanced activity of the mineral part and certain chemical and phase composition, can be used as raw material for the production of <b>metallurgical,</b> <b>cement</b> and other industries. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the earlier}} studies on mixing have been focused on drums {{operated}} in or close to rolling regime, considered the most convenient for <b>metallurgical,</b> <b>cement</b> and mining applications in rotary kilns. However, many other industrial applications deal with powder mixing in rotating drums or other tumblers such as in pharmaceutical, detergent or food industry. In these cases, effectiveness of mixing may be given by other regimes. Here we compare mixing efficiency and kinetics of two different regimes, i. e. rolling and cataracting. The attention has been specifically focused on both the internal composition patterns and the mixing kinetics, aiming at optimising the operation time and the final homogeneity of the mixtures. The internal structure of the bed, after mixing, has been investigated through a solidification technique. Images of the transverse plane of the mixture {{at the ends of}} the drum provide information on the mixture composition there, during mixing. Both information from the interior and the ends have been used to point out differences in the mixing patterns and kinetics of the two regimes considered. It is known since {{a long time in the}} industry that the evolution of the mixing process strongly depends on the history whom the bulk has been subjected to before mixing begins or during the early stages of the process. This work aims at providing some mechanistic and quantitative explanation of this knowledge and shows that not a single regime, but a proper combination of the two regimes allows to achieve a better mixing quality more rapidly...|$|E

30|$|At present, it is {{accepted}} {{that the increase}} of GHG concentration in atmosphere is attributed to human activities. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced as the by-products of various non-energy-related industrial activities. Industrial processes can chemically transform raw materials, which often release waste gases such as CO 2. The processes include production of iron, steel, <b>metallurgical</b> coke, <b>cement,</b> lime, carbonate consuming processes (e.g., flux stone, flue gas desulfurization, and glass manufacturing), ammonia and urea, petrochemical, aluminum, soda ash, titanium dioxide, ferroalloy and glass. The production of some petrochemicals results in the release of small amounts of CO 2 emissions. Petrochemicals are chemicals isolated or derived from petroleum or natural gas. The chemical and petrochemical industry accounts for 30  % of global industrial energy use and 16  % of direct CO 2 emissions.

Besides, it can improve the sustainability of other products and production processes as well. Several slag valorisation routes were studied {{in the past but}} not much high value applications are implemented yet due to technical, environmental or economic constraints. Granulated Blast furnace steel slag (GBFS) is already used for long in cement production. Its application is very successful. GBFS helps to reduce the CO 2 emissions of the cement production process.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of industrial waste presents major logistical, financial and environmental issues. Technologies that {{can reduce the}} hazardous properties of wastes are urgently required. In the present work, a number of industrial wastes arising from the <b>cement,</b> <b>metallurgical,</b> paper, waste disposal and energy industries were treated with accelerated carbonation. In this process carbonation was effected by exposing the waste to pure carbon dioxide gas. The paper and cement wastes chemically combined with up to 25 % by weight of gas. The reactivity of the wastes to carbon dioxide was controlled by their constituent minerals, and not by their elemental composition, as previously postulated. Similarly, microstructural alteration upon carbonation was primarily influenced by mineralogy. Many of the thermal wastes tested were classified as hazardous, based upon regulated metal content and pH. Treatment by accelerated carbonation reduced the leaching of certain metals, aiding the {{disposal of}} many as stable non-reactive wastes.

40|$|By {{means of}} burning at {{different}} temperature conditions of a two-component raw mix consisting {{of iron and}} steel production wastes: blast-furnace slags wastes - limestone wastes ratio of 2 : 3, correspondingly, clinker samples were obtained, chemical analysis of which showed correspondence of their chemical composition to the chemical composition of the standard clinker. Laboratory testing proved high strength values for all the clinker samples. Processing of metallurgical wastes that are accumulated in the dumps in large quantities and have harmful effects on the environment, is relevant now, especially for low-cost PC (Portland cement) clinker production, the production of which by existing technologies is expensive and energy consuming, accompanied by a significant consumption of natural resources and energy, harmful emissions of dust and gas in the atmosphere. The aim is to develop the technological scheme of PC clinker production. The hydraulic module (m = 2, 37) of 2 -component mixtures of raw materials: 40 % of slag waste + 60 % of limestone waste has been defined. Mechanical activation of cement components has been found to promote the blast furnace slags activity. It has been stated that slags should be subjected to fine grinding(S ≥ 0, 6 m 2 /g) while PC clinker should be subjected to fine crushing (S = 0, 3 m 2 /g). Jet grinding can reduce 4 - 5 times the content of expensive clinker in cement, and reduce 4 - 5 times СО 2 emissions.

40|$|Atmospheric {{pollution}} by solid particles is {{a serious}} risk factor for human health. Moreover, it influences on climate change and can cause serious economical damage. More than 25 % of the total air pollution comprise industrial emissions generated by fuel-burning power plants, <b>metallurgical,</b> and <b>cement</b> works. Therefore, particulate emission monitoring is an actual problem. The present dissertation {{is devoted to the}} development of remote sensing methods for estimating parameters of disperse streams (streams of solid particles which usually form particulate fraction of industrial emissions) utilizing radar technology. In order to estimate disperse stream parameters, such as mass loading, particle concentration, and particle size, theoretical methods of electromagnetic wave scattering by a spherical dielectric particle have been used; namely the approximate method of Rayleigh scattering, which is valid for particles that are much smaller than the operating wavelength of the radar, and the rigorous method – Mie theory, which allows calculating the radar cross-section (RCS) of particles in the whole range of wavelengths. Two methods of radar sounding are considered in the work: mono-frequency and double-frequency method. The mono-frequency method enables to estimate the mass loading and particle concentration, however, the method requires information about particle size and its distribution law. Applying an additional radar with a different operating frequency enables to use a concept of differential RCS which unambiguously depends on particle size for several special cases. This allows the double-frequency method to estimate the size of particles along with the mass loading and the particle concentration. For the experimental validation of the proposed measuring concepts, the mono-frequency and double-frequency radar-sensors with a bistatic antenna system have been developed and designed for operating in an air duct. Furthermore, the prototype of the mono-frequency radar with a quasioptical antenna system, which permits the transmitter and the receiver to operate with one common antenna in CW mode, has been constructed as well. Digital methods of radar signal processing, such as spectral and correlation analysis, as well as methods of statistical data processing have been utilized for the signals received by both systems. The conducted measurement results have shown that the mono-frequency method is only applicable in case of the fulfillment of the Rayleigh scattering conditions. The double-frequency method, which applies the rigorous Mie theory for estimating the RCS of particles, has shown a good reproducibility of the measurement results over a wide range of particle concentrations. The experimental study performed for the double-frequency method confirms its validity and efficiency for remote sensing of disperse streams with preliminary unknown particle size distribution law. The results shows that the developed methods of remote sensing of the disperse stream parameters by a radar can find their applications in industrial emission monitoring along with well-known optical and contact methods...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{carbonation}} involves {{exposing a}} material to a concentrated atmosphere of carbon dioxide, {{and can be}} used to treat hazardous wastes and soils and create new construction materials. The present work examines the use of accelerated carbonation to reduce the hazardous properties of wastes as a means of reducing the costs of disposal to landfill, and then develops the process to manufacture aggregate from the waste removing it from landfill disposal completely. A range of thermal wastes, including those from <b>cement,</b> <b>metallurgical</b> and paper processes, were found to be reactive with carbon dioxide. Many of these wastes are hazardous on account of their alkaline pH, which carbonation partially neutralizes, effectively allowing reclassification of the materials as stable non-reactive hazardous wastes under the Landfill Regulations. Cement and paper wastes were highly reactive with carbon dioxide, and were considered for use as cement substitutes to reconstitute non-reactive wastes into aggregate. Previous work had suggested that carbonation and pelletising were not compatible due to differing optimum conditions. This issue was investigated by considering the effects of the mix formulations and machinery parameters. The pelletising and carbonation processes require widely different moisture contents. The disparity is due to the need for total saturation of the material to form bonds between grains during pelletising, and an open pore network for carbon dioxide to penetrate. To achieve the two simultaneously, several methods were investigated. Chemical catalysts including sodium hypochlorite and sodium sulfite increased carbonation in a saturated material. However, curing the formed aggregates in carbon dioxide was found to be the most economic solution. A pilot scale process was developed based upon the laboratory results. A bespoke rotary carbonation reactor was developed to produce aggregate in bulk for commercial testing. Aggregate which was subjected to accelerated carbonation, has enhanced strength and durability compared to aggregate exposed to natural carbonation. The aggregate was successfully used to produce lightweight concrete with comparable strength to concrete made from commercial lightweight aggregate. Aggregate was also supplied for a research project to investigate the use of recycled materials as a horticultural growing medium...|$|R
