50|$|Early {{electronic}} phonographs used a <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>crystal</b> for pickup (though {{the earliest}} electronic phonographs used crude magnetic pick-ups), where the mechanical {{movement of the}} stylus in the groove generates a proportional electrical voltage by creating stress within a crystal (typically Rochelle salt). Crystal pickups are relatively robust, and produce a substantial signal level which requires only a modest amount of further amplification. The output is not very linear however, introducing unwanted distortion. It is difficult to make a crystal pickup suitable for quality stereo reproduction, as the stiff coupling between the crystal and the long stylus prevents close tracking of the needle to the groove modulations. This tends to increase wear on the record, and introduces more distortion. Another problem is the hygroscopic nature of the crystal itself: it absorbs moisture from the air and may dissolve.

It was developed by a team from two German companies: AEG-Telefunken and Teldec. Program information was stored in the form of ridges in the surface of a thin, flexible foil disc, which was claimed to be sufficiently robust to withstand being played 1,000 times. The main technological breakthrough was the vertical recording method that reduced the track pitch to 0.007 mm, and increased the rotation speed to 1,500 rpm, making it possible to record 130-150 grooves per millimeter, compared with the typical 10-13 grooves on an audio disc. This increased the available bandwidth from around 15 kHz to 3 MHz. The tracks were read by a pressure pick-up, which translated the surface of the ridges, via a <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>crystal,</b> into an electrical signal.Tracking was controlled not by the pick-up resting within the walls of a groove, but by a mechanical coupling on which the pick-up mounting is supported. There was no turntable. The rotation of the disc at 1,500 rpm created a thin cushion of air between the disc and a fixed plate. Vertical movement of the disc was kept to within 0.05mm. Eight-inch discs could store five minutes of programming, twelve-inch discs about 7½ minutes.|$|R

The five main optics that form this interferometer are suspended in vacuum by triple pendulums with quasi-monolithic lower stages of fused silica. After installation of these pendulums in early 2003, a larger than expected coupling of longitudinal ground motion to tilt misalignment of the suspended optics was observed. Because of this, the uncontrolled misalignment of the optics during average conditions was several µrad Hz- 1 / 2 in the frequency band around the pendulum resonance frequencies (0. 5 – 4 Hz). In addition, {{it was found that}} longitudinal control signals applied to the intermediate pendulum stages also resulted in excessive mirror tilt. The resulting misalignment exceeded the level tolerable for stable operation of GEO 600. In order to reduce the level of mirror tilt, a bipartite feedforward system was implemented. One part feeds signals derived from seismic measurements to <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>crystals</b> in the stacks supporting the suspensions, reducing the longitudinal motion of the uppermost suspension points. The other applies tilt correction signals, derived from longitudinal control signals, to the intermediate level of the suspensions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these hearing aids {{is to improve the}} {{quantity}} and quality of amplification of the sound wave. Their operating principle is based on the existence of a transducer which transforms the electric signal captured by the microphone into a mechanical, vibrating wave. This transducer can act either directly on the temporal bone by short-circuiting the middle ear (and is then called a bone conduction implant) or directly on the ossicular chain (in which case it is called an ossicular transduction implant). A) There are 2 types of bone conduction implant: the "Audiant Bone Conduction" system of Hough-Vernon (Xomed), where an outside electromagnetic coil sends signals transcutaneously to a magnetic screw embedded on the temporal bone. Bone conduction must be normal. The "Bone Anchored Hearing Aid" (Nobelpharma) where the outside electromagnetic coil sends signals directly to the magnetic screw that is percutaneous.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if an ultrasonometric technique accurately monitors fundic contraction and relaxation in mice in vivo and to determine the effect of modulation of cholinergic, nitrergic and serotonergic pathways on fundic size and compliance in the intact mouse innervated stomach. Two to 4 <b>piezo-electric</b> <b>crystals</b> (diameter 1 mm, 24 μm resolution) were glued to the serosal side of fundus and used to measure distance. Validation studies showed excellent correlation between measured changes and actual changes in distances between crystals and excellent reproducibility.

Atropine increased the distance between the crystals suggesting a baseline cholinergic regulation of fundic volume. Bethanechol, L-NNA and the 5 -HT 1 B/D agonist sumatriptan decreased the distance between the crystals suggesting fundic contraction. Atropine, nitroglycerin and buspirone caused an increase in intercrystal distance consistent with fundic relaxation. Fundic compliance was investigated by changing intragastric pressure via an implanted catheter. Sumatriptan increased compliance, while buspirone increased the distance between crystals but did not change compliance.

Piezo-actuated micromanipulation enhances the penetration of membranes and matrices, and mouse ICSI is a major application. Here we describe a comprehensive, step-by-step mouse piezo ICSI protocol for non-specialists that can be completed in 2 - 4 h. The protocol is a basic prelude to multiple applications, including nuclear transfer cloning, spermatid injection, blastocyst injection, mII transgenesis, and streamlining micromanipulation in primates and livestock. Moreover, piezo ICSI can be used to obtain offspring from 'dead' (non-motile) sperm, enabling trivial sperm freezing protocols for mouse strain storage and shipment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{linear control}} theory {{as applied to}} smart structures. Specifically, the problem of active {{vibration}} damping in a flexible cantilever beam using <b>piezo-electric</b> ceramic <b>crystals</b> (PZT) as sensors and actuators is addressed. The problem of controlling linear time invariant systems subject to hard input constraints is considered. Some existing methods are reviewed and some new methods are presented. The subject of rapid prototyping and automatic system identification is addressed. Automatic system identification techniques are developed and combined with a commercially available rapid prototyping system to create a test bed {{which can be used}} to rapidly model and control existing plants. Closed loop control laws designed to actively damp vibrations in a flexible cantilever beam were tested in various laboratory experiments. The experiments are described, the design of the control laws is discussed, and the results of the experiments are presented. Finally, impact between a flexible robotic arm and a fixed sphere is addressed. A model for the impact forces is developed and compared with experimentally determined impact data. An open loop control law using a neural network is implemented to control the magnitude of the impact force...|$|R
40|$|We report thermal {{expansion}} measurements {{on a single}} crystal of the superconducting ferromagnet UCoGe for magnetic fields applied along the main orthorhombic axes. The {{thermal expansion}} cell was <b>mounted</b> on a <b>piezo-electric</b> rotator in order to fine-tune the magnetic field angle. The superconducting and magnetic phase diagram has been determined. With our bulk technique we confirm the S-shape of the upper-critical field, B_c 2, for B ∥ b and reinforcement of superconductivity above 6 T. At {{the same time the}} Curie point shifts towards lower temperatures on increasing the field along the b-axis. This lends further support to theoretical proposals of spin-fluctuation mediated reinforcement of superconductivity for B ∥ b. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
