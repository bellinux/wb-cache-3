Although the Red Sea is about [...] higher than the eastern Mediterranean, the current between the Mediterranean and {{the middle of the}} canal at the Bitter Lakes flows north in winter and south in summer. The current south of the Bitter Lakes is tidal, varying with the tide at Suez. The Bitter Lakes, which were hypersaline natural lakes, blocked the {{migration}} of Red Sea species into the Mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the Red Sea the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the Red Sea have begun to colonise the eastern Mediterranean. The Red Sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the Atlantic, so the Red Sea species have advantages over Atlantic species in the less salty and nutrient-rich eastern Mediterranean. Accordingly, most Red Sea species invade the Mediterranean biota, and only few do the opposite. This <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is called Lessepsian migration (after Ferdinand de Lesseps) or [...] "Erythrean invasion". Also impacting the eastern Mediterranean, starting in 1968, was the operation of Aswan High Dam across the Nile. While providing for increased human development, the project reduced the inflow of freshwater and ended all natural nutrient-rich silt entering the eastern Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. This provided less natural dilution of Mediterranean salinity and ended the higher levels of natural turbidity, additionally making conditions more like those in the Red Sea.|$|E

From the analysis of the Italian case emerge, moreover, some useful suggestions to help policy makers and lawgivers in the management of internal <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomena</b> and counteract the human and industrial desertification of whole regions or macroareas...|$|R

These trends were parallel with the intensification of international migrations. These, along with methodological differences in conducting the migrant population in population censuses, are important determinants of changes in the spatial distribution of population potentials in Serbia. This paper evaluated the migration component from 1961 to 2011. or in the last half century, through consideration of its impact on the transformation of rural and urban areas of Serbia. The transitional trends in the relations between natural increase and net migration formed the modern population decline on one and population concentration on other side and their individual segments. In doing so, emigration and immigration trends significantly determine the relocation of the urban population, immigrant population, the population with a higher educational level and population in the tertiary and quaternary sector activity {{at the beginning of the}} XXI century. Finally, the display density and concentration of migrant population in the contemporary period also indicates the importance of economic, social and other determinants of spatial development in the {{transition of}} <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomena</b> in Serbia...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to determine 25 [OH]D serum levels in refugees in Italy. In the following research we have taken into consideration {{the results of the}} monitoring of Vitamin D levels in 46 refugees of the Italian Service for protection of refugees and asylum seekers (SPRAR) system. The indicator of overall vitamin D status used was the circulating serum level of 25 (OH) D. Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel. In the refugees tested, the mean level of 25 (OH) D resulted 9. 18 ng/mL. The standard deviation was 4. 8, with a minimal level of 4. 3 and a maximum of 27. 4. This figure indicates a clear condition of hypovitaminosis in refugees. While it is general assumption that <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomena</b> may induce the spread of tropical or infectious diseases, widely attested literature demonstrates how chronic pathologies and diseases related to altered lifestyles are the most relevant for Italian case records. Indeed, among the aforementioned diseases, Vitamin D deficiency so far lacks acknowledgement at a national level.

40|$|This paper, from a socio-political {{approach}} on the <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomenon</b> towards Europe as a destination {{and in a}} context of globalization, highlights the contradictions of the values of the European Union.

The <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> as it is presented, is very complex and very permeable to negative readings due to serious factors that operate as strong restrictions. The objective is to try to find solutions or opportunities to circumvent these restrictions, whose purpose is to use a policy analysis methodology and the subsidiaries of the Policy Sciences for public decision making. The main results are that the demographic deficiencies in the Spanish rural environment present as an opportunity for a positive reading of a selective immigration, feasibility that today requires argumentation by the actors favorable to this reading. The current global crisis and what this represents for the phenomenon of migration is the main object of analysis of this article. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBy {{highlighting}} certain {{dynamics and}} certain economic stakes affecting transit areas {{as a result}} of Saharan and trans-Saharan migration, this article seeks to encourage these areas to be included systematically in the thinking about the migration-development relationship or the effect of migration policies. At the same time, working in the transit areas, and more particularly on transport, enables one to see migration not as a monolithic phenomenon, nor as a succession of fixed stages, but as a fluid process which spreads over time and space. Ultimately, understanding movement implies being immobile and observing those who pass by; being mobile and observing those who, through their immobility, appear to pass by; being mobile and observing those who, caught up in the same movement, appear immobile. These three approaches to migration, to movement in migration, are aimed at deciphering the tension between mobility and immobility, between travel, retention and temporary settlement, which is fundamental to all present-day <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomena</b> in North-West Africa. Since these moments in migration are not opposed to one another, but rather make up different facets of a single process, it {{is not a question of}} favouring research in the transit areas over that in the departure and destination areas, nor of favouring multiple-site or moving work over work which is fixed in a single location, but rather of stressing the complementary nature of these approaches with a view to gaining a general understanding of <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomena...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{involved the}} construction of a wide corpus of texts from five major national newspapers (Corriere della sera, la Repubblica, La Stampa, Il Giornale, Libero). The aim is to investigate the representation of migrants and of immigration in general on the Italian national press during {{the first decade of the}} XXI century. The main goal is to employ the means of critical discourse analysis to reflect on the social construction of prejudice about foreigners and on biased perceptions of the migratory process. The analysis explores three major issues (migrants’ arrival by sea; immigration and crime; socio-economic struggle) which cover the most relevant areas of interest about the <b>migratory</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in Italy. The wide corpus (over 100 million words and more than 200 thousands articles) has been investigated through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The intent is to offer a reliable and statistically significant linguistic analysis of the discursive strategies involved in the texts. The use of text analysis software helped to fulfill the goal of carrying out an analysis which employs modern methods, able to overcome and enrich previous investigations on the matter, based mostly on small and randomized samples or specific case studies. The analysis of linguistic forms and structures primarily focused on referential and predicational strategies employed to describe social actors and on discursive strategies which reflect the fundamental cognitive structures (ideologies) underlying prejudice and struggle between social groups. The results confirmed the starting hypothesis and highlighted some of the most important discriminatory elements produced (or reproduced) by the media.
