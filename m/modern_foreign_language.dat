25|$|The Netherlands has a {{tradition}} of learning foreign languages, formalised in Dutch education laws. Some 90% of the total population indicate they are able to converse in English, 70% in German, and 29% in French. English is a mandatory course in all secondary schools.

Continued language courses on B level are only available for German and French.

2500|$|In some rare cases, an {{individual}} kanji has a reading that is borrowed from a <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> (gairaigo), though most often these words {{are written in}} katakana. Notable examples include , , , and [...] See [...] for more. These are classed as kun'yomi of a single character, because the character is being used for meaning only (without the Chinese pronunciation), rather than as ateji, which is the classification used when a gairaigo term is written as a compound (2 or more characters). However, unlike {{the vast majority of}} other kun'yomi, these readings are not native Japanese, but rather borrowed, so the [...] "kun'yomi" [...] label can be misleading. The readings are also written in katakana, unlike the usual hiragana for native kun'yomi.

60|$|But {{the thing}} that still irritates me most against {{the hero of the}} popular novel is the ease with which he learns a <b>modern</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language.</b> Were he a German waiter, a Swiss barber, or a Polish photographer, I would not envy him; these people do not have to learn a language. My idea is that they boil down a dictionary, and take two table-spoonsful each night before going to bed. By the time the bottle is {{finished}} they have the language well into their system. But he is not. He is just an ordinary Anglo-Saxon, and I don't believe in him. I walk about for years with dictionaries in my pocket. Weird-looking ladies and gentlemen gesticulate and rave at me for months. I hide myself in lonely places, repeating idioms to myself out loud, in the hope that by this means they will come readily to me if ever I want them, which I never do. And, after all this, I don't seem to know very much. This irritating ass, who has never left his native suburb, suddenly makes up his mind to travel on the Continent. I find him in the next chapter engaged in complicated psychological argument with French or German savants. It appears--the author had forgotten to mention it before--that one summer a French, or German, or Italian refugee, as the case may happen to be, came to live in the hero's street: thus it is that the hero is able to talk fluently in the native language of that unhappy refugee.|$|E
