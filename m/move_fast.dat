5|$|Originally Aristotle divided {{all living}} things between plants, which {{generally}} do not <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, {{it has become clear}} that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{citizens}} {{had only}} three days from 23 - 25 January to exchange their old 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes for the new currency. Exchange could be postponed, but only through specialized government commissions. Due to this short exchange window, long queues formed in front of Soviet savings banks, {{even though it was}} also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices. This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E
5|$|The red-legged running frog (Kassina maculata) has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It can <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> {{by using}} a running gait {{in which the two}} hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion {{photography}} shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog (Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis) has broad feet and can run {{across the surface of the}} water for several metres (yards).|$|E

5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E
25|$|At {{junctions}} with {{stop signs}} or traffic lights, {{the most serious}} accidents are right-angle, left-turn or head-on collisions where vehicles <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> and collide at high impact angles, e.g. head-on. Roundabouts virtually eliminate those types of crashes. Instead, most crashes are glancing blows at low angles of impact.|$|E

25|$|Binary {{stars that}} are both visual and spectroscopic {{binaries}} are rare, and are a valuable source of information when found. About 40 are known. Visual binary stars often have large true separations, with periods measured in decades to centuries; consequently, they usually have orbital speeds {{too small to be}} measured spectroscopically. Conversely, spectroscopic binary stars <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> in their orbits because they are close together, usually too close to be detected as visual binaries. Binaries {{that are both}} visual and spectroscopic thus must be relatively close to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} war, OUN adhered to {{concepts}} of integral nationalism in its totalistic form, {{according to which}} Ukrainian statehood required ethnic homogeneity and the Polish enemy could be defeated only by the elimination of Poles from Ukrainian territories. From OUN-B perspective, the Jewish population had already been annihilated, Russians and Germans were only temporarily in Ukraine, but Poles had to be forcefully removed. The OUN-B {{came to believe that}} it had to <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> while the Germans still controlled the area in order to preempt future Polish efforts at re-establishing Poland's pre-war borders. The result was that the local OUN-B commanders in Volhynia and Galicia (if not the OUN-B leadership itself) decided that an ethnic cleansing of Poles from the area, through terror and murder, was necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Tim Burke and Tim Alexander {{were the}} visual effects {{supervisors}} for the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said, [...] "It's certainly much bolder and scarier than we imagined that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of {{not making this}} into a zombie movie, so we were constantly {{trying to figure out}} how not to make these dead people coming up look like zombies. A lot of it came down to their movement – they don't <b>move</b> <b>fast,</b> but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style." [...] He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.|$|E

2500|$|Zelica {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a buggy horse with her colt running freely alongside until he was weaned at around five or six months. At first, the young horse showed little promise. [...] "The only redeemable feature about the little fellow was that he was friendly and cute" [...] recalled Messner. [...] "I honestly thought the colt's future would be confined to hauling a delivery wagon." [...] However, a close friend named John Wattles, the owner of the livery stable in which Dan Patch was foaled, saw potential in the colt. Wattles received permission from Messner to train Dan Patch and gradually developed the horse's abilities. By late 1898, Messner was able to use Dan Patch as his buggy horse since Zelica was again in foal, and even hooked the horse up to his sleigh over the winter. The locals were increasingly impressed by the almost black colt, who loved to <b>move</b> <b>fast</b> but was biddable enough to pull young boys behind him on the sleigh.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Fu Zi, {{before the}} Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao wanted to attack Liu Bei (who had rebelled and {{seized control of}} Xu Province) first before dealing with Yuan Shao. However, some of Cao Cao's {{advisers}} expressed their worries that Yuan Shao would {{take advantage of their}} absence to attack them, rendering them trapped between Yuan and Liu Bei. Cao Cao faced a dilemma so he asked Guo Jia for his opinion. Guo Jia suggested, [...] "Yuan Shao is suspicious and he hesitates before he makes any decision, so he won't make his <b>move</b> <b>fast.</b> Liu Bei had just taken control of Xu Province so his situation isn't stable yet. He can be easily defeated if we attack him fast and hard. This is a critical opportunity, we mustn't lose it." [...] Cao Cao agreed and immediately led an army east to attack Liu Bei and defeated the latter. After his defeat, Liu Bei fled to Hebei to join Yuan Shao. Throughout that period of time, Yuan Shao did not make any move.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2012 {{and in the}} {{following}} years after Kojima finished work on the Fox Engine, Kojima has been unofficially connected to the Silent Hill series. During this time, he indicated that {{he was interested in}} making a Silent Hill game and the first instance of this was on 18 August 2012. He described his excitement regarding the potential use of the Fox Engine on the eighth generation platforms via a tweet of an image of the DVD for the Silent Hill film: Later, he added what he had in mind for this game in a series of tweets: [...] "Silent Hill is in closed room setting and doesn’t require full action so that we can focus on the graphic quality. Enemies featured in the game {{do not have to be}} consistent or <b>move</b> <b>fast.</b> It only requires scariness by graphics and presentation. As being a creator, making action games in an open world setting, such a type of game is very enviously attractive. If only someone could create this on the Fox Engine." [...] After a while, and as a result of Kojima’s interest in making a Silent Hill game, Konami officially asked him to do so. Kojima then explained the story in an interview with Eurogamer: ...|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, if {{causality}} {{is to be}} preserved, one of {{the consequences}} of special relativity is that no information signal or material object can travel faster than light in vacuum.

50|$|The {{strategy}} {{element of}} the game is enhanced by the unique abilities of soldiers from the different kingdoms.
