5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of <b>malleable</b> <b>iron,</b> for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig iron to steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of <b>malleable</b> <b>irons</b> and as a thermocouple material.|$|R
50|$|Puddling was {{one step}} {{in one of}} the most {{important}} processes of making the first appreciable volumes of high-grade bar <b>iron</b> (<b>malleable</b> wrought <b>iron)</b> during the Industrial Revolution. In the original puddling technique, molten iron in a reverberatory furnace was stirred with rods, which were consumed in the process. It was one of the first processes for making bar iron without charcoal in Europe, although much earlier coal-based processes had existed in China. Eventually, the furnace would be used to make small quantities of specialty steels.|$|R
25|$|Over the years, {{change was}} gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, {{but with the}} {{development}} of Darby's method of smelting iron using coke, painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed <b>malleable</b> <b>iron,</b> or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally retroreflective for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a system}} had been devised for making <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> rails, around 1819, the {{rack and pinion}} motion became unnecessary, apart from later use on {{mountain}} railways. However, until that time it enabled a small and lightweight locomotive to haul loads totalling at least 20 times its own weight. Salamanca was so successful that Murray made three more models. One of these was known as Lord Wellington, {{and the others are}} said to have been named Prince Regent and Marquis Wellington, though there is no known contemporary mention of those two names. The third locomotive intended for Middleton was sent, at Blenkinsop's request, to the Kenton and Coxlodge Colliery waggonway near Newcastle upon Tyne, where it appears to have been known as Willington. There it was seen by George Stephenson, who modelled his own locomotive Blücher on it, minus the rack drive, and therefore much less effective.|$|E

500|$|Plain carbon-iron alloys with {{a higher}} than 2.1% carbon content are known as cast iron. [...] With modern {{steelmaking}} techniques such as powder metal forming, {{it is possible to}} make very high-carbon (and other alloy material) steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good castability properties. [...] Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> or ductile iron objects. Steel is also distinguishable from wrought iron (now largely obsolete), which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of slag.|$|E
500|$|The railway {{that opened}} in September 1825 was [...] long and ran from Phoenix Pit, Old Etherley Colliery, to Cottage Row, Stockton; {{there was also a}} half-mile (0.8km) branch to the depot at Darlington, [...] of the Hagger Leases branch, and a [...] branch to Yarm. Most of the track used [...] <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> rails, and [...] of [...] cast iron rails were used for junctions. The line was single track with four passing loops each mile; square {{sleepers}} supported each rail separately so that horses could walk between them. Stone was used for the sleepers to the west of Darlington and oak to the east; Stephenson would have preferred all of them to have been stone, but the transport cost was too high as they were quarried in the Auckland area. The railway opened with the company owing money and unable to raise further loans; Pease advanced money twice early in 1826 so the workers could be paid. By August 1827 the company had paid its debts and was able to raise more money; that month the Black Boy branch opened and construction began on the Croft and Hagger Leases branches. During 1827 shares rose from £120 at the start to £160 at the end.|$|E
500|$|Concerned about Overton's competence, Pease asked George Stephenson, an {{experienced}} enginewright of the collieries of Killingworth, {{to meet him}} in Darlington. On 12 May 1821 the shareholders appointed Thomas Meynell as Chairman and Jonathan Backhouse as treasurer; {{a majority of the}} managing committee, which included Thomas Richardson, Edward Pease and his son Joseph Pease, were Quakers. The committee designed a seal, showing waggons being pulled by a horse, and adopted the Latin motto [...] ("At private risk for public service"). By 23 July 1821 it had decided that the line would be a railway with edge rails, rather than a plateway, and appointed Stephenson to make a fresh survey of the line. Stephenson recommended using <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> rails, even though he owned a share of the patent for the alternative cast iron rails, and both types were used. Stephenson was assisted by his 18-year-old son Robert during the survey, {{and by the end of}} 1821 had reported that a usable line could be built within the bounds of the Act, but another route would be shorter by [...] and avoid deep cuttings and tunnels. Overton had kept himself available, but had no further involvement and the shareholders elected Stephenson Engineer on 22 January 1822, with a salary of £660 per year.

40|$|Due to the {{peculiar}} graphite elements shape, Ductile Cast Irons (DCIs) {{are able to}} combine the high castability of gray irons with the toughness of steels. This result is obtained {{by means of a}} chemical composition control and not by means of an extended, and expensive, annealing treatment of white irons (that is necessary to obtain <b>malleable</b> <b>irons).</b> Focusing ferritic DCIs, different damaging micromechanisms should be investigated considering both ferritic matrix and the role played by graphite nodules: according to the observed micromechanisms, it is evident that graphite nodules role can't be summarized with a simple "debonding", usually considered as the only effective in numerical simulations. In this work, damaging micromechanisms in fatigue loaded ferritic DCI specimens were investigated by means of Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) during the fatigue test ("in situ" tests).

First, three small holes were drilled into the rock; and then these were broken into one large hole, which was afterwards smoothed, enlarged, and undercut, so as to be of dovetail form; the size of each being 7 and a half inches broad and 2 and a half inches wide at the top, and an inch broader at the bottom. They were about sixteen inches deep. Thirty-six massive <b>malleable</b> <b>iron</b> hold-fasts were then inserted, and wedged into the places thus prepared for them, besides being filled up with lead, so that no force of any kind could draw them out. The next proceeding was to place beams of solid oak timber, lengthwise, on the first step, thus bringing it level with the second step. Timbers of the same kind were then placed above and across these, bringing the level up to the third step. The next [...] "course" [...] of timbers was again laid, lengthwise, bringing the level to the fourth step, and so on to the seventh, above which two completely circular timber courses were laid, thus making a perfectly flat and solid foundation on which the remainder of the column might rest. The building, therefore, had no tendency to slide, even although it had not been held in its place by the thirty-six hold-fasts before mentioned.
