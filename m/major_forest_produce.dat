50|$|The hillsides {{rising up}} precipitously from the plains {{are covered with}} dense sal forests. The forests of the {{district}} are managed under Forest Division namely Khariar Division. According to their composition, the forests can be classified into sal forests, teak forests, miscellaneous forests where sal, teak and other species occur in mixture and bamboo forest. All these are situated in the dry deciduous forest zone. Timber {{is by far the}} <b>major</b> <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> and sal is no doubt, a major constituent of these products. Other important species are bija, asan, bandhan and teak. Among the minor forest produces of this region are kendu leaf, bamboo, broom-grass, mohua flower and seed, antia bark and sabai-grass. Timber, bamboo and kendu leaf are the main exports outside the state.|$|E

40|$|Bamboo forms a <b>major</b> nonwood <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> of the {{tropical}} forests of south and southeast Asia and provides livelihood requirements to {{a large number of}} forest fringe communities. Besides the traditional user groups – the artisans, bamboo is much sought by the paper and pulp industry. Together, the demand on the bamboo resources is substantial and it is projected that in the years to come, the demand would soon outrun the stock. This is particularly true in countries such as India where almost all the requirements of bamboo are met from the natural populations. The indiscriminate extraction of bamboo coupled with the large-scale habitat loss have seriously endangered the genetic resources of bamboo. In this chapter we review the status and threats to the bamboo genetic resources in the central Western Ghats, India and discuss the conservation of the genetic resources of two economically important species of bamboo, Bambusa arundinacea and Dendrocalamus strictus. Our study shows that the two species exhibit strikingly contrasting spatial patterns in the distribution of genetic diversity and that accordingly, strategies for the conservation of the genetic resources of the two species need to be addressed separately...|$|R
40|$|Many {{states in}} India have {{initiated}} various {{measures to protect}} their forest resources. Maharashtra is no exception to this phenomenon. An attempt, therefore, {{has been made in}} this paper to examine the extent to which this state is successful in conserving and managing its forest resources. The main foci of attention of this study are on evaluating various forest related indicators of Maharashtra such as distribution of forest area, outturn of <b>major</b> and minor <b>forest</b> <b>produce,</b> income and expenditure pattern on state forestry, extent of social forestry, and afforestation, etc. The study revealed very interesting observations. One of the major observations of this study was the sharp decline in revenue receipts from state forestry, especially after the late eighties period. Very slow growth in total value of <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> harvested and a sharp increase in total expenditure on state forestry were found to be the major causative factors responsible for this decline in revenue receipts. Although the Government has banned felling of trees {{in many parts of the}} state, it has also adversely affected not only the harvesting of <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> and thereby revenue receipts from state forestry but also the working of FLCS in the state. The study provides certain policy suggestions that will not only help the state to increase its revenue receipts from state forestry but also in respect of achieving its goal of maintaining ecological balance in the state. ...|$|R

Samples were purposively collected and extracted using the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) method and analysed for synthetic pyrethroids, organochlorine, and organophosphate pesticide residues. Aldrin, γ-HCH, β-HCH, ∑endosulfan, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin methoxychlor, ∑DDT, chlorpyrifos, fenvalerate, malathion, dimethoate, and diazinon were all detected at {{the concentration of}} 0. 01 [*]mg/kg, while cyfluthrin and permethrin were detected at mean concentrations of 0. 02 and 0. 04 [*]mg/kg, respectively. All the pesticide residues detected were very low and below their respective maximum residue limits set by the European Union. Hence, pesticide residues in honey samples analyzed do not pose any health risk to consumers...|$|R

50|$|The {{definition}} of Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce</b> (MFP) under the Maharashtra Transfer of Ownership of Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce</b> in the Scheduled Areas and the Maharashtra Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce</b> (Recognition of Trade) (Amendment) Act, 1997 {{did not include}} many of the minor <b>forest</b> <b>produce</b> recognized under the subsequent the Scheduled Tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, (FRA). Hence, despite the powers vested in them under PESA, the Gram sabhas {{were not able to}} access many important MFPs such as Tendu and Bamboo. In fact, the list included in the state subject law pertained to only 33 low value MFPs. This anomaly had led to denial of livelihood opportunities to Village Communities in the Scheduled Areas, primarily the members of the Scheduled Tribes. By Notification dated 19/08/2014, the Governor of Maharashtra made modifications to the Maharashtra Transfer of Ownership of Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce</b> in the Scheduled Areas and the Maharashtra Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce</b> (Regulation of trade) (Amendment) Act, 1997 and modifications to the Indian Forest Act, 1927, in its application to the State of Maharashtra. Because of these changes many Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas have been able to exercise their rights over minor <b>forest</b> <b>produce,</b> including high value products, such as bamboo and tendu. Using these rights in consonance with FRA, more than 100 Gram Sabhas in Gadchiroli have exercised for the first time their rights over bamboo and more than 500 have exercised their rights over tendu and earned income ranging from 10 lakh to 80 lakh per Gram Sabha, leading to a positive impact in the Left-Wing Extremist (LWE) affected district.|$|R

However, State monopolies still persist in Minor <b>Forest</b> <b>Produce,</b> especially in lucrative MFP like Bamboo and Tendu. It is interesting to observe here that the Forest Rights Act, 2006 also defines a central role to the Gram Sabha in the management of minor <b>forest</b> <b>produce.</b> Evidently, any state monopolies, in this context, are patently illegal.|$|R
