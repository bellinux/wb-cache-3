500|$|Following {{his first}} few appearances, it was {{reported}} that Criss had been confirmed as a series regular for the remainder of season two and for season three of Glee. This was based on comments by Murphy, who said: [...] "Darren has become such a sensation in one week, which I love. I think there's a hunger for him and a positive relationship role model. He’ll definitely continue through the year and longer." [...] However, the actor later denied that his role had been upgraded and said: [...] "It's never really been officially confirmed to me. I think the option is there and that they want to keep Blaine around." [...] Murphy revealed that Blaine may join New Directions during the third season. Criss hoped that this would not come to pass, as he enjoys being at Dalton Academy, but conceded: [...] "it's not <b>my</b> <b>call.</b> I'm happy to serve whatever story they want." [...] For the third season of Glee, Criss was promoted to a series regular, and Blaine did join New Directions when he transferred to McKinley High to be with Kurt.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Viflic, Foreign Secretary Hague {{expressed}} his condolences to the family: [...] "Daniel was just 16. The tragedy of his death is brought home all the more in that it occurs {{on the eve of}} Passover, normally a time of celebration for Jewish families all over the world. I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Daniel's family, and I reiterate my utter abhorrence of the cowardly attack which cost him his life, and <b>my</b> <b>call</b> for an end to all such attacks on innocent civilians." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because of his theology, Gorton {{viewed the}} {{ordinances}} promoted by governments with deep suspicion. [...] His ideology of anti-authoritarianism {{was based on}} {{his belief in the}} equality of all men, and he felt that both civil and religious hierarchical systems [...] "denied the true priesthood of all believers." [...] He considered an educated, professional ministry to be a form of Anti-Christ, a view also shared by both Dell and Erbury. [...] He wrote in New Englands Memoriall (1669): [...] "I would have you know that I hold <b>my</b> <b>call</b> to preach... not inferior to the call of any minister in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Sam/Jack {{relationship}} was fraught with complications {{given that he}} was her commanding officer. Pursuing any sort of relationship would have been inappropriate for both and would only have really been possible late in the series after Jack's retirement. [...] Jack and Sam could have gotten together after Jack's retirement, {{but it was never}} made canon because, quite frankly, it wasn't <b>my</b> <b>call.</b> Still, despite the lack of official confirmation, it was only natural that they should get together after the events of Threads and, in my mind, they have been together ever since. An attempt to suggest as much in [...] season 4's Trio unfortunately ended up on the cutting room floor when the episode ran long." ...|$|E
2500|$|On defense, the Wolverines {{became the}} first team to hold the Buckeyes {{scoreless}} since 1964. [...] They held Ohio State to 173 yards of total offense, including 101 rushing yards and only five pass receptions. [...] Defensive tackle Greg Morton led the team with 14 tackles, and Jim Pickens and Jerry Zuver each had an interception. [...] Late in the second quarter, with the game still scoreless, Ohio State drove the ball to the Michigan 10-yard line when Pickens intercepted a pass in the end zone. [...] After the game, Woody Hayes cited Pickens' interception as a turning point: [...] "The interception {{at the end of the}} first half was a costly error on our part. [...] It was <b>my</b> <b>call</b> all the way, and it was just a bad call. [...] If we had scored then, it might have affected the second half outcome." ...|$|E

2500|$|Strom was officiating a NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Dick Bavetta as his partner for that game. The game was close {{at the end}} and Earl made a last-second call against the Nets, ending the game with a win for Sixers. Suddenly Dick Bavetta ran across floor to the scorer's table, saying, [...] "No! No! I got a push off against McGinnis!" [...] Strom then {{challenged}} Bavetta, [...] "Are you overruling <b>my</b> <b>call?</b> I got pushing off right here!" [...] Bavetta insisted, which reversed Strom's call and the Nets wound up with the victory. With the game over, players were walking to their respective locker rooms when the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Dick Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?" [...] Strom was later fined for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|During Lee's 2011 book release Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going. In the book, Lee {{stated that}} Singaporean Muslims faced {{difficulties}} in integrating {{because of their}} religion, and urged them to [...] "be less strict on Islamic observances". His remarks drew firestorm from Malay/Muslim leaders and MPs in Singapore, prompting a strong reaction from his son Lee Hsien Loong, who's the current Prime Minister at that time as saying [...] "My views on Muslims’ integration in Singapore differed from the Minister Mentor's. Muslims are a valued and respected community, who have done a good deal to strengthen our harmony and social cohesion." [...] Lee Kuan Yew then told the media [...] "I made this one comment on the Muslims integrating with other communities probably {{two or three years}} ago. Ministers and MPs, both Malay and non-Malay, have since told me that Singapore Malays have indeed made special efforts to integrate with the other communities, especially since 9/11, and that <b>my</b> <b>call</b> is out of date." [...] Subsequently, he adds [...] "I stand corrected. I hope that this trend will continue in the future." ...|$|E
