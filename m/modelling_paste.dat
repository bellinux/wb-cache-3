To {{create these}} {{variously}} scaled abstract pieces, Cheng applied iron powder to torn paper which was sealed with waterproof layers of gesso, mat medium and <b>modelling</b> <b>paste</b> employed {{to create a}} sense of relief. He used a special catalyst to begin a lengthy chemical process of transforming the iron into rust. The paper was soaked in water for days and dried, acquiring a hard surface. Cheng controlled the process by deciding when to remove the paper from the wash. Cheng would sometimes resoak the paper in order to obtain the desired surface and textural coloration. He manipulated viscous surfaces with the smaller works and hoped to achieve a greater impasto with the larger torn paper pieces, as these pieces had a tendency to break if too heavily laden.|$|E

The extrusion through a square-entry die of a <b>model</b> <b>paste</b> of non-Brownian spheres suspended in a Newtonian fluid is investigated using discrete element simulations, capturing individual particle contacts and hydrodynamic interactions. The simulations reveal inhomogeneous velocity and stress distributions, originating in the inherent microstructure formed by the constituent particles. Such features are shown to be relevant to generic paste extrusion behaviour, such as die swell. The pressure drop across the extruder is correlated with the extrudate velocity using the Benbow-Bridgwater equation, with the empirical parameters being linked directly to particle properties such as surface friction, and processing conditions such as extruder wall roughness.

40|$|The glass {{addition}} in {{a silver}} paste has a key role for the adhesion of the silver track, on one hand, and for a homogeneous formation of an interfacial microstructure showing a sufficient number and size of silver precipitates, on the other hand. In our study, time and temperature dependencies of the sintering density and formation of interfacial layers were examined by interrupted firings of metallized wafers. The cross sections of intermediate states of the sintered microstructures of the <b>model</b> <b>pastes</b> were visualized by focused ion beam preparation and SEM. While the silver finger becomes densified a distinct fraction of the paste glass reacts at the interface in terms of silver dissolution, transport, precipitation and emitter etching, while the layer is growing continuously in thickne ss. Thereby, the ohmic resistivity of the glassy interface layer is simultaneously lowered by Ag-precipitation and increased by thickness. The P-doped emitter layer is partly etched by the reactive glass melt at the interface. In other words, the contact resistivity of the P-doped silicon surface is increased continuously. The specific contact resistivity of the interface {{can be referred to}} as a superposition of the specific resistances of the silver enriched glassy interface layer and the etched, phosphor doped Si-surface. By optimizing powder geometry, silver densification characteristics and sinter onset of the glass phase it is possible to control the active amount of paste glass at the interface paste/wafer.

A two roll-mill is employed here to investigate the influence of larger extensional strains. The data are analysed using an available first order engineering plasticity solution. The results confirm that this material exhibits both extensional strain and strain rate hardening. This observed strain hardening effect, which is not observed in the squeeze-film experiments, is attributed, in part, to the more homogeneous deformation fields induced during rolling and tensile extension...|$|R

40|$|A {{commercial}} toothpaste is {{investigated in}} this work as a <b>model</b> <b>paste</b> system to study its processing characteristics in capillary flow using various dies. Its rheological behaviour has been determined {{as that of a}} yield-stress, thixotropic material with a time-dependent behaviour, and severe slip at the wall. The rheological data obtained from a parallel-plate rheometer were used to formulate a constitutive equation with a structural parameter which obeys a kinetic equation, typically used to model thixotropy. The predictive capabilities of this model are tested against capillary data for a variety of capillary dies having different length-to-diameter ratios (L/D), contraction angles (2 alpha), and contraction ratios (D-b/D) (2), where D-b is the diameter of the barrel of the capillary rheometer. The major trends are well captured by the thixotropic model and show that slip is the essential parameter in predicting the flow behaviour of toothpaste. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-scale approach for the modelling of {{the degradation of}} <b>model</b> cement <b>pastes</b> using reactive transport. It specifically aims at incorporating chemistry-transport feedback results from a pore-scale approach into a continuum description. Starting from a numerical representative elementary volume of the <b>model</b> cement <b>paste,</b> which was built according to extensive experimental dedicated chacarterizations, this paper provides three separate descriptions of two different degradations: leaching and carbonation. First, 2 D pore-scale simulations are performed and predict degradation depths in very good agreement with experiments. Second, 3 D pore scale descriptions of how the microstructre evolves provides accurate description {{of the evolution of}} transport properties through degradation. Finally, those latter results are incorporated as a feedback law between porosity and effective diffusion coefficient into a 1 D continuum approach of reactive transport. This paper provides pore-scale explanations of why reactive transport modelling has encountered mitigated success when applied to cementitious materials, especially during carbonation or degradations consisting of precipitation reactions. In addition to that, different degradation modellings are in very good agreement with experimental observations. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe silver paste {{composition}} for {{the front}} side has a strong influence on the firing behaviour, contact formation and resulting efficiency of the solar cell. It is {{state of the art}} that the paste glass is needed for etching the ARC silicon nitride during firing and also plays a major role for the transport of silver to the silicon surface. However, the kinetics of the silver transport is still under discussion. A main challenge to understand the underlying mechanisms is the analysis of the microstructure evolution of the paste during firing in the high speed PV firing cycle. In this work PV high speed firing conditions were simulated by usage of a simple laboratory furnace. The microstructural evolution of a <b>model</b> <b>paste</b> was observed and correlated to obtained contact resistances. Moreover, systematic variations of the paste glass were investigated. The overall contact formation kinetics can be divided into two independent but strongly interacting single kinetic phenomena: (i) the reaction kinetics at the wafer surface and (ii) the phase transport kinetics of the silver paste. The reaction kinetic at the wafer surface is composed by three important single reactions: silver solution and precipitation in the amorphous interface layer, interface layer growth, and silicon etching. The phase transport kinetics of the metallization paste determines the quantity of glass that is mixed with the etching products in the interface layer and is dominated by the densification rate of the silver powder and the viscous flow of the paste glass. The paste glass has crucial influence for both kinetics (i) and (ii). In this study the paste glass chemistry has a dominating impact compared to the glass rheology. By an appropriate choice of the raw materials regarding the sinter behaviour and targeted selection of the powder properties substantial control over the paste contacting performance is possible...|$|R
