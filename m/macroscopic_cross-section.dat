It is shown that interactions {{in combination with the}} energy dependence of the tunneling rates dramatically affect the noise level in such a system. Interaction-induced fluctuations of the band bottom of the well contribute to the noise and lead to a new energy in the Fano factor. They can enhance the noise to super-Poissonian values in a voltage range preceding the instability threshold of the system. At low voltages, interactions may either enhance or suppress the noise compared to the the non-interacting case. Comment: 10 pages two-column; 11 figures include...|$|E

40|$|The main {{types of}} instabilities {{encountered}} in commercial Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) are global and/or regional oscillations. In addition to those, pure Density Wave Oscillations (DWOs) {{have also been}} observed in some operating BWRs. These oscillations are particularly challenging from a modelling viewpoint because of the radially strongly localized character of the perturbation and of the corresponding neutronic response. In this paper, the features of a recently developed numerical tool, named CORE SIM, are taken advantage of. More specifically, this tool {{has the ability to}} estimate in the frequency domain the spatial and energy distribution of the stationary fluctuations of the neutron flux in any three-dimensional heterogeneous system. The perturbations should be directly defined in terms of fluctuations of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> In this study, the fluctuations in the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> are obtained by first modelling a boiling channel exhibiting a DWO with the US NRC RELAP 5 code, and by thereafter converting the fluctuations of the coolant density along the channel into fluctuations of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> using the Studsvik Scandpower CASMO- 4 E code. The RELAP 5 and CASMO- 4 models are representative of a typical BWR fuel assembly. The conditions modelled in RELAP 5 were adjusted in order to obtain self-sustained DWOs. The axial distribution of the amplitude and phase of the fluctuations observed in the coolant density from the RELAP 5 simulations are thus converted into fluctuations of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> via CASMO- 4 E, and fed into a CORE SIM model representative of a heterogeneous BWR. The CORE SIM simulations in turn allow estimating the three-dimensional effects of a self-sustained DWO in a BWR core.

This method is associated to an innovative spatial kinetics model named Transient Fission Matrix, which condenses the time-dependent Monte Carlo neutronic response in Green functions. Finally, an accurate estimation of the feedback effects on these Green functions provides an on-the-fly prediction of the flux redistribution in the core, whatever the actual perturbation shape is during the transient.

The RSG-GAS research reactor, MTR (Material Testing Reactor) type is used for research and also in radioisotope production.

In this paper, the experience of managing RSG-GAS core fuels will be discussed, there are hundred possibilities of fuel placements on the reactor core and the strategy used to operate the reactor will be crucial.

40|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} problems within radiation (e. g. neutrons, photons) transport {{are those in}} which the radiation migrates through a medium which has a random or stochastic composition. The uncertain medium composition introduces an uncertainty in the radiation angular/scalar flux, current, reaction rates and other quantities of interest. Stochastic media {{play an important role}} within radiation transport and have numerous applications such as radiation shielding, nuclear criticality assessment, as well as radiative transfer in clouds, stellar atmospheres and plasma physics. Stochastic radiation transport problems reduce to treating the adsorption, scatter and other <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-section</b> data as spatially correlated random fields. Several methods for the treatment of these uncertain-ties have been proposed however they are limited in their scope and computational efficiency. Multiphase and spatially random media are often characterised by non-Gaussian random fields which are much more challenging to model than Gaussian random fields. This thesis aims to investigate, develop and implement mathematically rigorous computational algorithms that are more efficient than the current methods for solving radiation transport with multiphase and spatially random media. In particular this thesis applies iso-probabilistic (e. g. Nataf) transforms to transform Gaussian random fields into non-Gaussian random fields. This approach enables the use of optimal spectral stochastic representations, such as the Karhunen-Loève and generalized polynomial chaos methods, to be used to simulate non-Gaussian random fields. This thesis also describes the verification of these iso-probabilistic spectral stochastic projection methods against standard radiation transport in random media benchmarks, such as the widely used Adams-Levermore-Pomraning benchmark.

This study has been done about control rod worth calculation and temperature reactivity coefficients of a VVRS- 2 MWth reactor. The reactor core has been simulated by using WIMSDB 5 and CITATION-LDI 2 codes to perform neutronic calculations. The WIMSDB 5 code solves neutron transport equation and obtains <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> (Winfrith, 1982).

40|$|Neutron {{resonance}} transmission analysis (NRTA) is an active-interrogation nondestructive assay (NDA) technique {{capable of}} assaying {{spent nuclear fuel}} to determine plutonium content. Prior experimental work has definitively shown the technique capable of assaying plutonium isotope composition in spent-fuel pins to a precision of approximately 3 %, with a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. As a Grand Challenge to investigate NDA options for assaying spent fuel assemblies (SFAs) in the commercial fuel cycle, Idaho National Laboratory has explored the feasibility of using NRTA to assay plutonium in a whole SFA. The goal is to achieve a Pu assay precision of 1 %. The NRTA technique uses low-energy neutrons from 0. 1 - 40 eV, at the bottom end of the actinide-resonance range, in a time-of-flight arrangement. Isotopic composition is determined by relating absorption of the incident neutrons to the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-section</b> of the actinides {{of interest in the}} material, and then using this information to determine the areal density of the isotopes in the SFA. The neutrons used for NRTA are produced using a pulsed, accelerator-based neutron source. Distinguishable resonances exist for both the plutonium (239, 240, 241, 242 Pu) and uranium (235, 236, 238 U) isotopes of interest in spent fuel. Additionally, in this energy range resonances exists for six important fission products (99 Tc, 103 Rh, 131 Xe, 133 Cs, 145 Nd, and 152 Sm) which provide additional information to support spent fuel plutonium assay determinations. Based on extensive modeling of the problem using Monte Carlo-based simulation codes, our preliminary results suggest that by rotating an SFA to acquire four symmetric views, sufficient neutron transmission can be achieved to assay a SFA. In this approach multiple scan information for the same pins may also be unfolded to potentially allow the determination of plutonium for sub-regions of the assembly. For a 17 ? 17 pressurized water reactor SFA, a simplistic preliminary analysis indicates the mass of 239 Pu may be determined with a precision on the order of 5 %, without the need for operator-supplied fuel information or operational histories. This paper will present our work to date on this topic, indicate our preliminary findings for a conceptual assay approach, discuss resilience against spoofing, and outline our future plans for evaluating the NRTA technique for SFA plutonium determination...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a novel method for performing Monte Carlo calculations of the effect, on the neutron flux, of stationary fluctuations in macroscopic crosssections. The basic principle relies on the formulation of two equivalent problems in the frequency domain: one that corresponds to the real part of the neutron balance, and one that corresponds to the imaginary part. The two equivalent problems are in nature similar to two subcritical systems driven by external neutron sources, and can thus be treated as such in a Monte Carlo framework. The definition of these two equivalent problems nevertheless requires the possibility to modify the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> and we use the work of Kuijper, van der Marck and Hogenbirk to define group-wise <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> in MCNP. The method is illustrated in this paper at a frequency of 1 Hz, for which only the real part of the neutron balance plays a significant role and for driving fluctuations leading to neutron sources having the same sign in the two equivalent sub-critical problems. A semi-analytical diffusion-based solution is used to verify the implementation of the method on a test case representative of light water reactor conditions in an infinite lattice of fuel pins surrounded by water. The test case highlights flux gradients that are steeper in the Monte Carlo-based transport solution than in the diffusion-based solution. Compared to other Monte Carlo-based methods earlier proposed for carrying out stationary dynamic calculations, the presented method does not require any modification of the Monte Carlo code...|$|R

In this paper, multigroup microscopic cross-sectional uncertainties are propagated through the DRAGON (version 4. 05) lattice code in order to perform uncertainty analysis on and 2 -group homogenized <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> The chosen test case corresponds to the Three Mile Island- 1 (TMI- 1) lattice, which is a 15 15 pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assembly segment with poison and at full power conditions. A statistical methodology is employed for the uncertainty assessment, where cross-sections of certain isotopes of various elements belonging to the 172 -group DRAGLIB library format are considered as normal random variables. Two libraries were created for such purposes, one based on JENDL- 4 data {{and the other one}} based on the recently released ENDF/B-VII. 1 data.

It was found that the computed Uranium 235 fission covariance matrix based on JENDL- 4 is much larger at the thermal and resonant regions than, for instance, the covariance matrix based on ENDF/B-VII. 1 data.

40|$|The {{deterministic}} {{modeling of}} LWRs {{begins with the}} computation of energy‐collapsed and homogenized <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross‐sections</b> {{by means of a}} lattice code. Once these parameters are functionalized {{as a function of the}} reactor state variables and discretized in space, they are used as input variables by core simulators in order to calculate the spatial distribution of the neutron flux and thus, the spatial distribution of the power. Once the power is determined, the thermal‐hydraulic variables are updated, and the process repeated until convergence. This thesis is divided in three different parts related to the possible neutronic and thermalhydraulic modeling strategies. In the first part, microscopic cross‐section uncertainties based on two modern nuclear data libraries such as JENDL‐ 4 and ENDF/B‐VII. 1 were derived in multi‐group format. These were propagated through lattice calculations in order to perform uncertainty analysis on the infinite neutron multiplication factor (, and on two‐group homogenized <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross‐sections</b> corresponding to a PWR fuel segment. The aim is to compare the uncertainty assessment on and on the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross‐sections</b> when the different nuclear libraries are employed. It was found that the computed uncertainties based on JENDL‐ 4 are much higher than the computed uncertainties based on ENDF/B‐VII. 1. A sensitivity analysis showed that the multi‐group variances of the Uranium‐ 235 fission reaction based on JENDL‐ 4 are very high, being this the main reason of the observed large discrepancies in the different uncertainty assessments. In the second part of the thesis, two types of uncertainty analyses were performed on core simulations. The first one corresponds to the forward approach of input uncertainty propagation, where the input uncertain space formed by the nodal two‐group macroscopic cross sections and diffusion coefficients is sampled both with SRS and LHS. The possible ranges of variation of such an input space are based on data from a depletion calculation corresponding to the cycle 26 of the Swedish Ringhals‐ 1 BWR. The aim of this study is to compare the efficiency of the uncertainty assessment performed on the nodal thermal flux when SRS and LHS are employed. On the other hand, in the second type of uncertainty analysis presented in this chapter, discrepancies between spatial measured and calculated fluxes in Ringhals‐ 1 are used to perform an inverse uncertainty analysis on the spatial dependence of the different core parameters. This analysis is carried out using Bayesian statistics, where, for a certain cycle, the frequency distributions of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross‐sections</b> and diffusion coefficients at every assembly node are updated based on the error distribution of the spatial thermal flux. Emphasis was made on performing uncertainty analysis as well on the coefficients of a nodal cross‐section model. Although a very simple model was derived, the aim is to propose an uncertainty assessment based on replicated sampling techniques such as the general bootstrap method. Finally, in the third part of the thesis, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were applied to thermal‐hydraulic calculations. The objective is to show that when experimental data are available, uncertainty analysis can be used in the validation process of a BE code. Quantitative limits based on a statistical theory were computed to validate code thermal‐hydraulic features in predicting pressure drop, void fraction and critical heat flux based on the macroscopic exercises of the OECD/NRC BWR Full‐Size Fine‐Mesh Bundle Test (BFBT) benchmark.

40|$|In this paper, multi-group {{microscopic}} cross-section uncertainties are propagated through the DRAGON (Version 4. 05) lattice code {{in order to}} perform uncertainty analysis on k(infinity) and 2 -group homogenized <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> The test case corresponds to a 17 x 17 PWR fuel assembly segment without poison at full power conditions. A statistical methodology is employed for such purposes, where cross-sections of certain isotopes of various elements belonging to the 172 groups DRAGLIB library format, are considered as normal random variables. This library was based on JENDL- 4 data, because JENDL- 4 contains {{a large amount of}} isotopic covariance matrices among the different major nuclear data libraries. Thus, multi-group uncertainty was computed for the different isotopic reactions by means of ERRORRJ. The preferred sampling strategy for the current study corresponds to the quasi-random Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). This technique allows a much better coverage of the input uncertainties than simple random sampling (SRS) because it densely stratifies across the range of each input probability distribution. In order to prove this, the uncertain input space was re-sampled 10 times, and it is shown that the variability of the replicated mean of the different k(infinity) samples is much less for the LHS case, than for the SRS case. The uncertainty assessment of the output space should be based on the theory of non-parametric multivariate tolerance limits, {{due to the fact that}} k(infinity) and some of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> are correlated. Therefore, for 10 replicated samples each containing 100 elements, the total output sample is composed by 1000 calculations. This sample size is more than enough to infer that the multivariate output population is covered 95 % with a 95 % of confidence. On the other hand, statistical sensitivity analysis was performed in order to know which {{microscopic cross-section}} has the greatest impact on k(infinity) predictions. It was found that the fission cross-section of Uranium 235 is the dominant input parameter for this particular case, because the computed JENDL- 4 variances for such reaction are very high at thermal and resonant regions compared to other variances that for instance, can be computed based on other nuclear libraries such as ENDF/B-VII. ...|$|R

The consequences of the mechanical failure are a rapid positive reactivity insertion and an increase in the local power peaking with high local energy deposition in the fuel assembly, accompanied by an initial pressure increase in the reactor cooling system. In this study, the REA has been simulated in a WWER- 1000 reactor by using WIMSD- 5 B and PARCS v 2. 7 codes.

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a so-called neutron noise simulator is reported. This simulator calculates both the direct and the adjoint reactor transfer function between a stationary noise source and its induced neutron noise for any 2 -dimensional heterogeneous critical system. The main advantage of this neutron noise simulator is that any realistic core can be modelled, since the simulator is designed to rely on a set of material constants corresponding to the actual reactor operating conditions. The calculations are performed in the 2 -group diffusion approximation and in the frequency domain. The spatial discretisation is carried out with respect to the finite difference scheme. The noise source, expressed as an "absorber of variable strength" type, is defined directly from the fluctuations of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> and can be spatially distributed over the core or concentrated in a few discrete nodes. If the noise source is a point-source, the simulator actually estimates the 2 -dimensional 2 -group discretised Green's function of the system. From the calculated Green's function, the neutron noise induced by a "vibrating absorber" type of noise source can also be determined. Different benchmark cases show that this neutron noise simulator works satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} in reactor {{dynamics}} that the so-called open-loop or zero-power reactor transfer function, which assumes a point-kinetic behavior of the system, has a simple analytical expression in the frequency domain. This expression depends on the effective fraction of delayed neutrons, the decay constant of the precursors of delayed neutrons, and the neutron mean generation time. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to recover the point-kinetic component of the fluctuations in neutron flux induced by perturbations of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> These fluctuations can be estimated by any open-loop reactor simulator working in the frequency domain, and the proposed method could thus be used as a means to validate the simulator against the theoretical expression of the transfer function. This validation exercise represents {{one of the very few}} cases where the response of a heterogeneous core can be compared to the evaluation of an analytical expression. In this paper, the methodology is also demonstrated using the CORE SIM tool in two test situations: a localized absorber of variable strength, and a travelling perturbation. In both cases, the simulator is able to reproduce the expected frequency-dependence of the reactor transfer function, despite the fact that the reactor response significantly deviates from point-kinetic for localized perturbations at high frequencies. It has nevertheless to be pointed out that the proposed method only works if the applied perturbation has a non-zero reactivity effect...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of developing a fine mesh coupled neutronic/thermal–hydraulic solver within the same computing platform for selected fuel assemblies in nuclear cores. As {{a first step in}} this developmental work, a Pressurized Water Reactor at steady-state conditions was considered. The system being simulated has a finite axial size, but is infinite in the radial direction. The platform used for the modeling is based on the open source C++ library OpenFOAM. The thermal–hydraulics is solved using the built-in SIMPLE algorithm for the mass and momentum fields of the fluid, complemented by an equation for the temperature field applied simultaneously to all the regions (i. e. fluid and solid structures). For the neutronics, a two-group neutron diffusion-based solver was developed, with sets of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> generated by the Monte Carlo code SERPENT. The meshing of the system was created by the open source software SALOME. Successful convergence of the neutronic and thermal–hydraulic fields was achieved, thus bringing the solution of the coupled problem to an unprecedented level of details. Most importantly, the true interdependence of the different fields is automatically guaranteed at all scales. In addition, comparisons with a coarse-mesh radial averaging of the thermal–hydraulic variables show that a coarse-mesh fuel temperature identical for all fuel pins can lead to discrepancies of up to 0. 5 % in pin powers, and of several tens of pcm in multiplication factor...|$|R

40|$|A Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) {{benchmark}} for Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling (UAM) {{is defined in}} order to facilitate the development and validation of available uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis methods for best-estimate Light water Reactor (LWR) design and safety calculations. The benchmark has been named the OECD/NEA UAM-LWR benchmark, and has been divided into three phases each of which focuses on a different portion of the uncertainty propagation in LWR multi-physics and multi-scale analysis. Several different reactor cases are modeled at various phases of a reactor calculation. This paper discusses Phase I, known as the “Neutronics Phase”, which is devoted mostly to the propagation of nuclear data (cross-section) uncertainty throughout steady-state stand-alone neutronics core calculations. Three reactor systems (for which design, operation and measured data are available) are rigorously studied in this benchmark: Peach Bottom Unit 2 BWR, Three Mile Island Unit 1 PWR, and VVER- 1000 Kozloduy- 6 /Kalinin- 3. Additional measured data is analyzed such as the KRITZ LEU criticality experiments and the SNEAK- 7 A and 7 B experiments of the Karlsruhe Fast Critical Facility. Analyzed results include the top five neutron-nuclide reactions, which contribute the most to the prediction uncertainty in keff, as well as the uncertainty in key parameters of neutronics analysis such as microscopic and <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections,</b> six-group decay constants, assembly discontinuity factors, and axial and radial core power distributions.

40|$|AbstractDeterministic lattice physics {{transport}} calculations {{are used}} extensively {{within the context}} of operational and safety analysis of nuclear power plants. As such the sensitivity and uncertainty in the evaluated nuclear data used to predict neutronic interactions and other key transport phenomena are critical topics for research. Sensitivity analysis of nuclear systems with respect to fundamental nuclear data using multi-energy-group discretization is complicated by the dilution dependency of multi-group <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> as a result of resonance self-shielding. It has become common to group sensitivities into implicit and explicit effects to aid in the {{understanding of the nature of}} the sensitivities involved in the calculations, however the overall sensitivity is an integral of these effects. Explicit effects stem from perturbations performed for a specific nuclear data for a given isotope and at a specific energy, and their direct impact on the end figure of merit. Implicit effects stem from resonance self-shielding effects and can change the nature of their own sensitivities at other energies, or that for other reactions or even other isotopes. Quantification of the implicit sensitivity component involves some manner of treatment of resonance parameters in a way that is self-consistent with perturbations occurring in associated multi-group cross-sections. A procedure for assessing these implicit effects is described in the context of the Bondarenko method of self-shielding and implemented using a WIMS-D 4 multi-group nuclear library and the lattice solver DRAGON. The resulting sensitivity results were compared to those calculated by TSUNAMI- 1 D, which computes implicit sensitivities using a different methodology consisting of a combination of linear perturbation theory and automatic differentiation. Energy-dependent sensitivity profiles and integrated sensitivity coefficients are presented, as well as a comparison of calculated sensitivities for different energy group structures and geometry dimensionalities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a numerical tool meant at modelling the effect of stationary fluctuations in nuclear cores for systems cooled with either liquid water or boiling water. The originating fluctuations are defined for the variables describing the boundary conditions of the system, i. e. inlet velocity, inlet enthalpy, and outlet pressure. The tool then determines in the frequency domain the three-dimensional distributions within the core of the corresponding fluctuations in neutron flux, coolant density, coolant velocity, coolant enthalpy, and fuel temperature. The tool is thus based on the simultaneous modelling of neutron transport, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer in a truly integrated and fully coupled manner. The modelling of neutron transport relies on the two-group diffusion approximation and a spatial discretization based on finite differences. The modelling of fluid dynamics is performed using the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model, with a void fraction correction based on a pre-computed distribution of the static slip ratio (when two-phase flow conditions are encountered). Heat conduction in the fuel pins is also accounted for, and the heat transfer between the fuel pins and the coolant is modelled also using a pre-computed distribution of the heat transfer coefficient. The spatial discretization of the fluid dynamic and heat transfer problems is carried out using finite volumes. The tool, currently entirely Matlab based, requires minimal input data, mostly in form of the three-dimensional distributions of the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> and their relative dependence on coolant density and fuel temperature, the point-kinetic parameters of the core, as well as the three-dimensional distribution of the slip ratio (in case of two-phase flow conditions) and of the heat transfer coefficient. Such data can be provided by any static core simulator that thus needs to be run prior to using the present tool. In addition to briefly summarizing the different test cases used to verify the code, the paper also {{presents the}} results of simulations performed for a typical Pressurized Water Reactor and for a typical Boiling Water Reactor, as illustrations of the capabilities of the tool...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} and computationally fast method to generate nodal cross sections for the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) was presented. In this method, named Spectral History Correction (SHC), {{a set of}} fine group microscopic cross section libraries, pre-computed at specified depletion and moderation states, was coupled with the nodal nuclide densities and group bucklings to compute the new fine group spectrum for each node. The relevant fine group cross-section library was then recollapsed to the local broad group cross-section structure with this new fine group spectrum. This library set was tracked in terms of fuel isotopic densities. Fine group modulation factors (to correct the homogeneous flux for heterogeneous effects) and fission spectra were also stored with the cross section library. As the PBR simulation converges to a steady state fuel cycle, the initial nodal cross section library becomes inaccurate due to the burnup of the fuel and the neutron leakage {{into and out of}} the node. Because of the recirculation of discharged fuel pebbles with fresh fuel pebbles, a node can consist of a collection of pebbles at various burnup stages. To account for the nodal burnup, the microscopic cross sections were combined with nodal averaged atom densities to approximate the fine group <b>macroscopic</b> <b>cross-sections</b> for that node. These constructed, homogeneous macroscopic cross sections within the node were used to calculate a numerical solution for the fine group spectrum with B 1 theory. This new fine spectrum was used to collapse the pre-computed microscopic cross section library to the broad group structure employed by the fuel cycle code. This SHC technique was developed and practically implemented as a subroutine within the PBR fuel cycle code PEBBED. The SHC subroutine was called to recalculate the broad group cross sections during the code convergence. The result was a fast method that compared favorably to the benchmark scheme of cross section calculation with the lattice cross-section generator for two PBR reactor designs. Ph. D.
