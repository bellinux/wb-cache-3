40|$|<b>Monocytoid</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (MBLs), {{originally}} {{described as}} part of the histologic picture of toxoplasmic lymphadenitis, have been recognized as a reactive component in a variety of lymph node disorders. The authors now report 3 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in which a multidisciplinary approach allowed them to confirm the existence of a malignant lymphoma composed of the neoplastic counterpart of the MBLs found in nonneoplastic disorders. In all 3 cases, the lymphoma was composed of a relatively monomorphous infiltrate of atypical MBLs that had rather uniform-appearing nuclei and had well-defined, moderately abundant pale cytoplasm. The pattern of lymph node involvement in all 3 cases was predominantly sinusoidal and interfollicular. The neoplastic lymphoid cells were strongly positive for B-cell-restricted antigens; the light- and heavy-chain phenotypes were kappa-IgM (2 cases) and kappa-IgG (1 case). In all 3 cases, rearrangement of heavy- and/or light-chain genes was clearly identified by Southern blot hybridization. The name "monocytoid B-cell lymphoma" is proposed for this newly described malignant B-cell neoplasm...|$|R
40|$|For tularemia, a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} the gram-negative coccobacillus Francisella tularensis, research {{of the relation between}} skin lesions and lymph node lesions has not been reported in the literature. This report describes skin lesions and lymph node lesions and their mutual relation over time for tularemia in Japan. Around the second day after infection (DAI), a subcutaneous abscess was observed (abscess form). Hand and finger skin ulcers formed during the second to the fourth week. Subcutaneous and dermal granulomas were observed with adjacent <b>monocytoid</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (MBLs) (abscess–granulomatous form). From the sixth week, large granulomas with central homogeneous lesions emerged diffusely (granulomatous form). On 2 – 14 DAI, F. tularensis antigen in skin lesions was detected in abscesses. During 7 – 12 DAI, abscesses with adjacent MBLs appeared without epithelioid granuloma (abscess form) in regional lymph nodes. During the second to fifth week, granulomas appeared with necrosis (abscess–granulomatous form). After the sixth week, large granulomas with a central homogeneous lesion (granulomatous form) appeared. F. tularensis antigen in lymph node lesions was observed in the abscess on 7 – 92 DAI. Apparently, F. tularensis penetrates the finger skin immediately after contact with infected hares. Subsequently, the primary lesion gradually transfers from skin to regional lymph nodes. The regional lymph node lesions induced by skin lesion are designated as dermatopathic lymphadenopathy. This study revealed temporal differences of onset among the skin and lymph node lesions...|$|R

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) {{comprises}} B and {{plasma cell}} compartments that originate {{from the same}} parent B cell and share as a cancer signature the same clonotypic IgH VDJ gene rearrangement. Here, we hypothesize that functional interactions between MM plasma cells (MM-PC) and their sister population of MM <b>monocytoid</b> <b>B</b> cells lead to the generation of microvessel endothelium of malignant origin from the <b>monocytoid</b> <b>B</b> cell progenitors. Published reports confirm that endothelial cells can harbor a molecular cancer signature characteristic of a given malignancy. We predict that MM <b>monocytoid</b> <b>B</b> cells—in response to both paracrine and autocrine pathways—contribute to tumor neovascularization in the bone marrow of MM patients. Our hypothesis further predicts that in MM, endothelial cells of malignant origin coexist with those of normal origin. We speculate that malignant development of MM incorporates functionally distinct sister lineages arising from the same MM progenitor that—by working together—ensure survival of the MM clone. We hypothesize that these two arms of the malignant MM clone are functionally interlinked to promote growth of the MM-PC compartment; by providing its own microenvironment, MM clonal evolution may ensure neovascularization to support an expanding malignancy...|$|R

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{initiate}} adaptive im-munity {{and regulate}} the inflammatory re-sponse by producing inflammatory che-mokines. This study was aimed to elucidate {{their role in}} the pathogenesis of the suppurative granuloma induced by Bartonella henselae infection, which char-acterizes cat scratch disease (CSD). In vitro DC infection by B. henselae results in internalization of bacteria, phenotypic maturation with increased expression of HLA-DR and CD 86, and induction of CD 83, CD 208, and CCR 7. In comparison to LPS-activated DCs, B henselae–infected DCs produce higher amounts of IL- 10, whereas the production of IL- 12 p 70 is reduced. Infected DCs also produce high levels of CXCL 8 and CXCL 13, 2 chemokines active respectively on neutrophils and B lympho-cytes. These results provide the molecu-lar basis for the morphogenesis of CSD granuloma, which typically contains high numbers of neutrophils and B cells. Re-markably, CSD granulomas in vivo con-tain CXCL 13 -producing DCs. We further demonstrate that the B cells in CSD granu-lomas are represented by <b>monocytoid</b> <b>B</b> cells and, worth noting, they express T-bet, a transcription factor able to induce a T-independent immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch in <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> These findings suggest that the humoral im-mune response to B henselae initiates in the extrafollicular areas of infected lymph nodes and is regulated by DCs.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{attempted}} to clarify the effects of anti-beta 2 -microglobulin (a-beta 2 m) on lymphocyte activation. Neither a-beta 2 m IgG fraction nor F(ab') 2 had a mitogenic effect on either highly purified T or <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> alone, while their mitogenic effect was observed when T and <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were appropriately reconstituted. When T lymphocytes were reconstituted with mitomycin C (MMC) treated <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> a negligible decrease in the response to a-beta 2 m was observed compared to the response of an untreated mixture to a-beta 2 m.

These results lead {{to the conclusion that}} the cells responding to a-beta 2 m are mainly T lymphocytes whose response is strongly enhanced by <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and that for the mitogenic effect of a-beta 2 m direct cell-to-cell interaction between T and <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to stimulation through surface immunoglobulin (sIg) is developmentally regulated. While mature <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from the adult mouse spleen enter S {{phase of the}} cell cycle in response to sIg stimulation, immature <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from the neonatal mouse spleen or adult mouse bone marrow undergo cell cycle arrest, and then death by apoptosis when given the same stimulus. It is thought that this negative {{response of}} immature <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to in vitro sIg stimulation translates to clonal deletion {{in the event that}} cognate antigen is encountered in vivo. Previous work in our laboratory has uncovered two characteristics of tolerance-sensitive immature B lymphocytes: the inability to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) in response to sIg stimulation, and the lack of src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) p 59 fyn and p 55 fgr expression. To further characterize sIg signaling pathways in mature and immature <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> genetic and molecular approaches were employed. <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from p 59 fyn- and p 55 fgr-deficient mice were studied to determine whether the absence of either p 59 fyn or p 55 fgr could cause disruptions of sIg signaling pathways. Signaling and cell cycle entry in both p 59 fyn- and p 55 fgr-deficient <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was normal. We concluded that there is redundancy among the substrates of the <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> sIg-activated PTKs. Also, the inability of immature <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to proliferate following sIg stimulation is not due to the absence of either p 59 fyn or p 55 fgr. To investigate the lack of PIP 2 hydrolysis in sIg-stimulated immature <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> we first needed to identify the PTK which activates phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) the enzyme which hydrolyzes PIP 2 following mature <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> sIg stimulation. We used a GST fusion protein containing the PLCγ 1 tandem src-homology 2 (SH 2) domains to precipitate interacting PTK from <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> lysates. We determined that p 72 syk from lysates of resting and sIg-stimulated <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> interacts with the SH 2 domains of PLCγ 1. PLCγ 1 and p 72 syk were also co-immunoprecipitated from lysates of resting and sIg-stimulated <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> From these results we conclude that p 72 syk can associate with PLCγ in <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> We also attempted to map the parts of the p 72 syk molecule required for interaction with PLCγ. ...|$|R

We demonstrate a limited variation of the IgH CDR 3 repertoire in the memory <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> population compared to the naive B cell population. This difference was significant at 3 and 6 months post-HSCT. Compared to healthy controls there is a significant restriction of the memory <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> repertoire at 3 months after HSCT, but not of the naive <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> repertoire. Twelve months after HSCT, the IgH CDR 3 repertoire in both memory and naive <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are as diverse as in healthy controls. Thus, our findings suggest a role for memory B cells in the restriction of the oligoclonal B cell repertoire observed early after HSCT, which may be of importance when considering reimmunization of transplanted patients...|$|R
40|$|<b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are an {{important}} cell population of the immune system. However, until recently {{it was not possible}} to transduce resting <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with retro- or lentiviral vectors, making them unsusceptible for genetic manipulations by these vectors. Lately, we demonstrated that lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with modified measles virus (MV) glycoproteins hemagglutinin, responsible for receptor recognition, and fusion protein were able to overcome this transduction block. They use either the natural MV receptors, CD 46 and signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM), for cell entry (MV-LV) or the vector particles were further modified to selectively enter via the CD 20 molecule, which is exclusively expressed on <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (CD 20 -LV). It has been shown previously that transduction by MV-LV does not induce <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activation. However, if this is also true for CD 20 -LV is still unknown. Here, we generated a vector specific for another <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> marker, CD 19, and compared its ability to transduce resting <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with CD 20 -LV.

Independent {{studies have shown}} that both IL- 10 and SDF- 1 are involved in the persistence of the peritoneal B-lymphocyte compartment. This study shows that IL- 10 and SDF- 1 act in synergy on peritoneal <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Indeed, autocrine production of IL- 10 was absolutely required for all effects of SDF- 1 on these cells, including increased proliferation, survival, and chemotaxis. Moreover, adding IL- 10 to peritoneal <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> increased the effects of SDF- 1. Neither IL- 5, IL- 6, nor IL- 9 affected the response of peritoneal <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to SDF- 1.

However, T cell responses to the candidate pancreatic b cell autoantigen glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), but not the control Ag keyhole limpet hemocyanin, were eliminated in NOD. Igmnull mice. To initially test whether they contribute to IDDM as APC, NOD <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were transferred into NOD.

I n both humans and nonobese diabetic (NOD) 2 mice, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) results from autoim-mune destruction of pancreatic b cells by T lymphocytes (1, 2).

40|$|Agammaglobulinemia is a {{heterogeneous}} antibody deficiency disease, {{usually associated with}} defective <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (1, 2). Most patients with the common varied form of the disease have <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> which do not synthesize immunoglobulin either in vivo, or in vitro after mitogenic stimulation (3 - 6). Additionally, a few patients with the X-linked form of the disease also have <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which are blocked in differentiation (2, 7, 8). Human immunoglobulin production has previously been observed in somatic cell hybrids between human lymphocytes and mouse myeloma cells (9).

These are two membrane proteins, namely, 91 -and 22 -kDa subunits of cytochrome k 58, and two cytosolic proteins with molecular masses of 47 and 65 kDa. Like in neutrophils, cytochrome £fc 58 was expressed {{on the cell}} surface of peripheral <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Mean amounts (n = 8) of the 91 -, 22 -, 47 -, and 65 -kDa proteins, respectively, in peripheral <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> calculated from intensity of the blots were 0. 011 ± 0. 003, 0. 026 ± 0. 006, 0. 179 ± 0. 022, and 0. 039 ± 0. 013 relative to those in neutrophils {{on the basis of}} cell number.

40|$|Isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) are {{organized}} lymphoid structures that facilitate the efficient interaction of antigen, antigen-presenting cells, and lymphocytes to generate controlled adaptive immune responses within the intestine. Because CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR 6) deficiency affects {{the generation of}} mucosal immune responses, we evaluated a potential role for CCR 6 {{in the development of}} ILFs. We observed that CCR 6 and its ligand CCL 20 are highly expressed within ILFs and that <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are the largest CCR 6 -expressing population within ILFs. ILF development was profoundly arrested in the absence of CCR 6. Concordant with a block in ILF development at a stage corresponding to the influx of <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> we observed that CCR 6 -deficient mice had a diminished population of intestinal <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Bone marrow reconstitution studies demonstrated that ILF development is dependent on CCR 6 -sufficient <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and adoptive transfers demonstrated that CCR 6 −/− <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were inefficient at localizing to intestinal lymphoid structures. Paralleling these findings, we observed that CCR 6 -deficient mice had a reduced proportion of Peyer’s patch <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and an associated reduction in the number and size of Peyer’s patch follicular domes.
