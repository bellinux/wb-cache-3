Various means {{can be used to}} try to solve this problem. In this article, the case {{of the production}} multi-stages (<b>manufacturing</b> <b>range)</b> is modelled completely. The objective is to determine optimal solutions of systems of production under multiple constraints (interns and external). On a simple example of part, an application of this general modeling is carried out by integrating various methods of optimization of the variables of production. Lastly, a quantitative comparison of these methods is proposed and makes it possible to determine the restrictions suitable for each one...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} investigation of firm level productivity effects of outsourcing against the background of a review of recent theoretical considerations about the topic. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical research is based on a large representative data set from the Gentian manufacturing industries containing detailed data about almost 500 establishments. It investigates productivity effects of outsourcing under control of other relevant factors influencing firm level productivity by means of a multivariate regression analysis. Findings - In sharp contrast to common belief and prevailing management practices, outsourcing, i. e. the extent to which the vertical range of manufacturing is reduced, has a strong negative impact on a firm's labour productivity. Against the background of the theoretical considerations reviewed from the literature, this result can be explained such that mere cost-efficiency comparisons are insufficient for appropriate decisions on vertical <b>manufacturing</b> <b>range</b> as the effects of opportunism, of disturbed competence fort-nation, and of limited innovative value creation processes may be overcompensating cost benefits. Research limitations/implications - The investigation focuses on productivity effects of outsourcing as a relevant long-term performance measure not regarding other firm level performance indicators. Although covering a significant range of industrial sectors in Germany, more empirical evidence is needed from other sectors and regions. Moreover, performance effects of different types, of outsourcing implementations (e. g. simple part supply versus outsourcing of whole business processes including design, production, and marketing) should be investigated as they might have different impacts. Practical implications - The findings strongly recommend a revision of established decision-making schemes for vertical <b>manufacturing</b> <b>range</b> based on cost-efficiency considerations. Decision making should instead integrate cost efficiency and transaction cost analysis with the competence and innovation capability formation perspectives. Procedural schemes for this integrated view are still to be developed, however. Originality/value - The research described in this paper considerably widens the empirical knowledge about productivity effects of outsourcing and has strong impact on management practice...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of our {{previous}} works (6), one present here a FEM application of a method that allows one to detect structural zones producing hypersensitive behavior. The concept is quite simple, and is cheaper than Monte Carlo simulations. The complete resolution of the problem is done only once, using nominal parameters of the structure, in order to obtain the displacement field. Then, considering another structure, built using variable parameters, chosen in a random way in the acceptable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>range,</b> the finite element assembly procedure is performed. These matrices are finally used to define an indicator in which the displacement field of the nominal solution permits to detect structural zones responsible for hypersensitive behavior. It is based on the computation of energy of a residual displacement field. After a presentation of {{the basis of}} this tool, numerical results are presented on a finite element model of a hypersensitive plates network, in which sensitivity problems are linked to angular coupling, and on a cross member beam, which is made up of three spot-welded layers...|$|E
40|$|A one-phrase {{explanation}} {{for the impact of}} ERP would be Simplifying Complex Process. ERP has a significant impact right from the time it is conceived in the organization. It paves way for restructuring which would not have otherwise happened in organizations sticking to traditional and conventional values. ERP is an eye-opener for such organizations because they get to realize the fine distinction involved in modifying the business process. Organizations now disclose vital information in the public domain, which was otherwise, considered confidential and not meant for dissemination.

40|$|The {{fiberboard}} assembly used in 9975 shipping packages as an impact-absorption and insulation component has {{the capacity}} to absorb moisture, with an accompanying change to its properties. While package fabrication requirements generally maintain the fiberboard moisture content within <b>manufacturing</b> <b>range,</b> there is the potential during use or storage for atypical handling or storage practices which result in the absorption of additional moisture. In addition to performing a transportation function, the 9975 shipping packages are used as a facility storage system for special nuclear materials at the Savannah River Site. A small number of packages after extended storage have been found to contain elevated moisture levels. Typically, this condition is accompanied by an axial compaction of the bottom fiberboard layers, and the growth of mold. In addition to potential atypical practices, fiberboard can exchange moisture with the surrounding air, depending on the ambient humidity. Laboratory data have been generated to correlate the equilibrium moisture content of cane fiberboard with the humidity of the surrounding air. These data are compared to measurements taken within shipping packages. With a reasonable measurement of the fiberboard moisture content, an estimate of the fiberboard properties can be made. Over time, elevated moisture levels will negatively impact performance properties, and promote fiberboard mold growth and resultant degradation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{uncertainties}} analysis. The {{objective is to}} detect structural zones producing hypersensitive vibration behavior. Many industrial products, because of production and assembly lines, present small differences in parameters values, which can sometimes induce large distortions {{as far as the}} radiated sound is concerned. On the basis of our previous works [1], we present here a FEM application of a method that allows one to detect structural zones producing hypersensitive behavior. The concept is quite simple, and is cheaper than Monte Carlo simulations. The complete resolution of the problem is done only once, using nominal parameters of the structure, in order to obtain the displacement field. In our case, a finite element analysis is performed on a typical hypersensitive structure, and modal deformations are determined on the particular nominal structure. Then, considering another structure, built using variable parameters, chosen in a random way in the acceptable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>range,</b> the finite element assembly procedure is performed. These matrices are finally used to define an indicator in which the displacement field of the nominal solution permits to detect structural zones responsible for hypersensitive behavior. It is based on the computation of energy of a residual displacement field. After a presentation of the basis of this tool, numerical results are presented on a finite element model of a plates network and on an industral cross member beam...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} years have {{delivered}} {{a great deal of}} development in the area of Layered Manufacturing. The challenge is to apply the existing technologies to existing and/or new manufacturing systems, thereby adding value to these systems. The advances in the field of Layered <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>range</b> from the process of slicing to the actual building process. The main achievements in the arena of slicing have been in the advances of Adaptive Slicing. By not using a uniform slice thickness, not only is the stair stepping effect minimized, but the build time is also shortened. Many advances have been made in terms of the actual materials used and the process of building, thereby expanding the range of uses for the technology as a whole. With the extension in the variety of materials available for use with the technology, new uses become more than mere possibility and actually become viable. The use of Layered Manufacturing {{in the case of the}} CSIR was not the focus of the original experiment, but was a method to test the results of their main experiments – namely, research into the properties of ceramic materials and their use in the realm of medicine. The research of the CSIR focuses on the use of ceramic materials for the purpose of bone implants, which is a problem area in medicine. The machine they built in order to test the properties of the new materials they invent, uses Layered Manufacturing as a building process. What the CSIR lacks are the backend systems to enable the building of more complex experimental parts, as they have no way of going from design to a full build. This research project focuses on proving that the technologies involved in Layered Manufacturing will add value to the CSIR’s research. By implementing a system that takes advantage of existing software, and by using custom software to make it applicable to the environment the CSIR is currently operating in, their research could be speeded up tremendously without putting too much strain on their budget. What has been achieved is a simple system which employs the use of available technologies and software packages, and which requires no changes to the hardware of the current process used, such as the Rapid Prototyping machine.
