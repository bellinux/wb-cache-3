500|$|During the 1850s, quarry owner James Harrison of Charmouth, West Dorset of England found fossils {{from the}} cliffs of Black Ven between Charmouth and Lyme Regis, that were quarried, {{possibly}} for {{raw material for}} the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cement.</b> Some of these he gave to the collector and retired general surgeon Henry Norris. In 1858, Norris and Harrison sent some fragmentary limb bones to Professor Richard Owen of the British Museum (Natural History), London (today the Natural History Museum). Among them was a left thighbone, specimen GSM 109560. In 1859, Owen named the genus Scelidosaurus in an entry about palaeontology in the Encyclopædia Britannica. The lemma text contained a diagnosis, implicating that the genus was validly named and was not a nomen nudum, {{despite the fact that}} the definition was vague and no specimens were identified. Owen intended to call the dinosaur [...] "hindlimb saurian" [...] but confused the Greek word σκέλος, skelos, [...] "hindlimb", with σκελίς, skelis, [...] "rib of beef". The name was inspired by the strong development of the hind leg. Afterwards Harrison sent a knee joint, a claw (GSM 109561), a juvenile specimen and a skull to Owen, that were described in 1861. On that occasion the type species Scelidosaurus harrisonii was named, the specific name honouring Harrison. The skull later was revealed to be part of a nearly complete skeleton, that was described by Owen in 1863.|$|E
