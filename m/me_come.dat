The birds are also the only species in the Certhiidae family that neither sings in duet nor has their song control regions affect repertoire size. Males alone sing, and have a repertoire of at least twenty different phrase patterns and on average, thirty two. One of these patterns is repeated for several minutes, and although the male's song can be repeated up to twelve times, the general amount of songs range from three to five times in repetition. While singing, the tail of the birds is pointed downward. Some general vocalizations have been transcribed as teakettle-teakettle-teakettle and cheery-cheery-cheery. Various descriptions of the teakettle song include whee-udel, whee-udel, whee-udel, che-wortel, che-wortel and túrtee-túrtee-túrtee and familiar names and phrases such as sweet heart, sweet heart, come to <b>me,</b> <b>come</b> to me, sweet William, and Richelieu, Richelieu.|$|E

New York City's The Cramps attribute much of their punk-psychobilly traits to Adkins, and covered [...] "She Said" [...] on their live album Smell of Female (1983).

Executive producer Paul Tibbitt said [...] " [...] wanted to do a show about extreme sports and the first thing that came to mind was Johnny Knoxville, because there are few humans living that are as extreme as him." [...] Knoxville accepted the role because he is a fan of the show. Knoxville said [...] "I got a lot of street cred in the office for doing SpongeBob.

500|$|... "Evermore"'s lamenting melody is {{paired with}} lyrics that express loneliness, {{accompanied}} by heavy orchestration that swells and loudens as the ballad progresses. Both [...] "brooding" [...] and hopeful {{at the same}} time, Jay Jason of Comicbook.com believes that the song's lyrics are inspired by the popular saying [...] "If you love someone, let them go." [...] Stevens' voice quavers with emotion when he sings the phrase [...] "I never needed anybody in my life". Amanda Greever of The Daily Times insists that the song's lyrics will move all listeners to tears. Featuring lyrics that revolve around heartache and heartbreak, [...] "Evermore"'s chorus reads: [...] "Now I know she'll never leave me/Even as she runs away/She will still torment me/Call me, hurt me/Move <b>me,</b> <b>come</b> what may/Wasting in my lonely tower/Waiting by an open door/I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in/And be with me for evermore", which Stevens performs vulnerably. The track also discusses themes such as true love, sacrifice and learning to understand love. Stevens sings within the vocal range of a [...] "deep, resonating baritone" [...] throughout the song, which lasts a total duration of three minutes and fourteen seconds; Channel NewsAsia contributor Genevieve Sarah Loh compared Stevens' voice, whose notes are suspended by the instrumentation, to [...] "melted-chocolate", gradually becoming more human-sounding as the song progresses. Belting comfortably, Stevens' voice {{has been compared to}} that of Terrence Man, the actor who originated the role of the Beast in the Broadway adaptation and recorded [...] "If I Can't Love Her". Some traces of Auto-Tune can be heard in Stevens' performance.|$|E
