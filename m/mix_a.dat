5|$|Cointreau-brand triple sec {{is used in}} some versions, {{and it may be}} {{prepared}} using a simple syrup that has been infused with lemon juice.

Lemon is also sometimes included within the drink, such as a lemon wheel. Additional ingredients may also be used in the drink's preparation, such as ginger syrup and lavender extract.|$|E

The final album, Ayu-mi-x II Version Non-Stop Mega Mix, reached number six and was certified platinum by RIAJ.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to <b>mix</b> <b>a</b> soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

25|$|The Greys {{wrapped up}} their third {{straight}} Mid-Ontario crown in 1974-75, beating first-place Collingwood 4-1 in the final.

25|$|The CIE model capitalises on {{this fact}} by {{defining}} Y as luminance. Z is quasi-equal to blue stimulation, or the S cone response, and X is a <b>mix</b> (<b>a</b> linear combination) of cone response curves {{chosen to be}} nonnegative. The XYZ tristimulus values are thus analogous to, but different from, the LMS cone responses of the human eye. Defining Y as luminance has the useful result that for any given Y value, the XZ plane will contain all possible chromaticities at that luminance.|$|E

25|$|The precise balls {{chosen by}} the bowler during an over {{will depend on the}} {{situation}} of the match, the skill of the batsman and how settled the batsman is at the crease. It is common to attack batsmen who have recently come to the wicket with successive short-pitched balls or bouncers with the dual aim of getting them out and stopping them from settling into an attacking mode of play for as long as possible. Short balls are more risky against batsmen who have settled at the crease since they make easy boundaries, but most bowlers will still <b>mix</b> <b>a</b> few in during a spell, just to keep the batsman guessing.|$|E
25|$|Microphones ("mics") {{are used}} with drums {{to pick up}} the sound of the drums and cymbals for a sound {{recording}} and/or {{to pick up the}} sound of the drum kit {{so that it can be}} amplified through a PA system or sound reinforcement system. While most drummers use microphones and amplification in live shows in the 2010s, so that the sound engineer can adjust and balance the levels of the drums and cymbals, some bands that play in quieter genres of music and that play in small venues such as coffeehouses play acoustically, without mics or PA amplification. Small jazz groups such as jazz quartets or organ trios that are playing in a small bar will often just use acoustic drums. Of course if the same small jazz groups play on the mainstage of a big jazz festival, the drums will be mic'ed so that they can be adjusted in the sound system <b>mix.</b> <b>A</b> middle-ground approach is used by some bands that play in small venues; they do not mic every drum and cymbal, but rather mic only the instruments that the sound engineer wants to be able to control in the mix, such as the bass drum and the snare.|$|E

500|$|A Caesar is a {{cocktail}} created and primarily consumed in Canada. [...] It typically contains vodka, a caesar <b>mix</b> (<b>a</b> blend of tomato juice and clam broth), hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, and is served with ice in a large, celery salt-rimmed glass, typically garnished with a stalk of celery and wedge of lime. What distinguishes {{it from a}} Bloody Mary is the inclusion of clam broth. The cocktail may also be contrasted with the Michelada, which has similar flavouring ingredients but uses beer instead of vodka.|$|E
