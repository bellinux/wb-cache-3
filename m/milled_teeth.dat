5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{rolling cutter}} drill bit design was disclosed in U.S. patents granted to Howard R. Hughes, Sr. on August 10, 1909, and {{which led to}} the creation of what became the Hughes Tool Company. This bit employed two conical steel rolling elements with <b>milled</b> <b>teeth</b> that engaged the formation, when the device was rotated, to produce the cutting action. This design represented a significant improvement in drilling performance over the so-called [...] "fish tail" [...] scraper type bits commonly used in rotary drilling at the time, and over the next two decades, rotary drilling with rolling cutter bits largely replaced all other drilling methods in the oilfield. The significance of the Hughes Two-Cone Drill Bit was recognized on its 100th anniversary when it was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{commercial}} {{rolling cutter}} bits usually employ three cones {{to contain the}} cutting elements, although two cone or (rarely) four cone arrangements are sometimes seen. These bits mainly fall into two classes depending on the manufacture of the cutting elements or [...] "teeth". Steel-tooth bits have cones that have wedge-shaped teeth milled directly in the cone steel itself. Extremely hard tungsten carbide material is often applied to the surfaces of the teeth by a welding process to improve durability. Tungsten carbide insert (TCI) bits have shaped teeth of sintered tungsten carbide press-fit into drilled holes in the cones. Some types of steel-tooth bits also have TCI elements {{in addition to the}} <b>milled</b> <b>teeth.</b> The cones rotate on roller or journal bearings that are usually sealed from the hostile down-hole drilling fluid environment by different arrangements of o-ring or metal face seals. These bits usually also have pressure compensated grease lubrication systems for the bearings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} limestone formation {{as well as the}} performance of different tri-cone bits in limestone in Ewekoro. Rock samples were collected from different layers of limestone encountered in the quarry during drilling operation. These samples were tested in the laboratory for uniaxial compressive strength and the tensile strength. Also, the chemical compositions of the samples were determined using the X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectrometer and the results were used in the determination of the Equivalent Quartz Content (EQC). The length of the insert buttons {{on the surface of the}} drill bits were measured using digital vernier calliper at regular intervals. In addition, the tooth and bearing wear rates as well as the penetration rate were determined on the field. The results of the uniaxial compressive strength varied from 86. 5 MPa (medium strength) to 112 MPa (high strength). The Equivalent Quartz Content (EQC) of the rock samples varied from 17. 37 % to 36. 676 % while the Rock Abrasivity Index (RAI) varied from 15. 03 to 43. 317. The results of the drilling variables showed that higher wear rate was experienced when <b>milled</b> <b>tooth</b> tri-cone bit was used for drilling than using insert tri-cone bit for drilling limestone formation, hence the tri-cone bits performed optimally well in all the formations except in glauconite (GLAB) where its performance was low. However, the economic analysis indicated that the insert tri-cone bit drilling cost per metre varied from N 660 /m to N 673 /m while the <b>milled</b> <b>tooth</b> tri-cone bit drilling cost per metre varied from N 684 /m to N 710 /m. This will act as a data base for selection of drill bits and drilling equipment in limestone quarries...|$|R

50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond. Roller cone bits can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or <b>milled</b> <b>tooth</b> (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.|$|R

40|$|Application of mills with a {{curvilinear}} {{profile of}} the cutting edge (often called rough end mills) allows us to increase milling rate, but a roughness of the surface treated by such mills is higher, than after milling by the "ordinary" mills with the "smooth" cutting edge. Deterioration of a roughness {{is caused by a}} curvature of cutting edge. The shape and sizes of a profile are of crucial importance for forming roughness on a surface. A literary review revealed that depending on a {{profile of the}} cutting edge the roughness of the machined surface makes Ra 2 … 12, 5 μm. There is a developed parametrical computer model to visualize roughness formed on a surface after milling by the fluting cutter and curved cutting edge mill. The computer model also allows a 3 D chip type to be cut off from a work-piece by the mills with various cutting edge profiles. When developing the model it was assumed that the tilt angle of a cutting flute is equal 0 °, a trajectory of the tooth movement is a circle rather than a trochoidal curve. An experimental test of the model has shown that the radial beats of the <b>mill</b> <b>teeth</b> have a very significant effect on the extent of the roughness formed on the machined surface. After amendments - taking into consideration teeth beats - introduced into model the modeling error made less than 5 % that {{can be explained by the}} fact that profile parameters of the cutting edge of mills embedded in the model are inaccurate because of the tilt angle the cutting flutes. The analysis of the surface model has shown that after milling the work piece has a cellular structure.

Unlike in case of uniform tooth pitch cutters, chip loads on each flute are different in <b>milling</b> with irregular <b>tooth</b> pitch cutters. The excess surface error generated by the flutes which have larger chip loads is removed by the following flutes which have smaller chip load due to the irregular tooth pitch.

40|$|Essentially, new {{constructive}} solutions, {{among which}} there are such as application of highstrength aluminum alloys for large-size case parts with the wafer design of the shell (WDS) characterize modern and perspective products of the missile and space equipment (MSE). To define optimum strategy of WDS pocket treatment, the paper presents a strategy analysis of penetration and treatment in CAID "ADEM". Based on the performed optimization a combination "spiral" and penetration "spiral on a contour" has been accepted as a strategy of the pocket treatment. To optimize the cutting modes, taking into consideration an elimination of the WDS element deformations, are calculated the hard-alloy mill forces, temperatures, wear rate, size of wear, and tool life, when milling a pocket as a standard element of WDS. A calculation technique which distinctive feature is {{to take into account}} the forces and pressure from the face edge of a <b>mill</b> <b>tooth</b> is used. In particular, there is functional relationship between the wear rate of a back surface of the tool and the generalized parameter, i. e. the cutting speed relation to hardness of the wearing tool surface as a function of the cutting temperature for milling conditions of aluminum alloys on the modern CN equipment. The paper presents a sequence of formulas implemented as a calculating algorithm and appropriate calculating program. It shows power and polynomial equations obtained to establish relations of the tool life and a torque of cutting with the variable parameters, i. e. the speed, depth, feed, mill diameter and width. Modeling and optimization results show that for rough treatment of grooves, a technological restriction is machine spindle power. With fine finish and penetration a feed of the tool has to be restricted to prevent deformation of a pocket bottom. During treatment of pockets in large-size parts with WDS a lag effect of the linear drives of equipment has to be taken into consideration, when feeding.

40|$|In milling the hard-to-machine {{materials}} vibrations (chatter) often {{arise from}} the high cutting forces if a technological system is insufficiently rigid. The main way to suppress these vibrations is to increase a stiffness of the mounting system of the tool and the work-piece to be machined. However, sometimes this method doesn’t lead to desirable result because of high values of intrinsic pliability of the tool and the work-piece. Currently, there are more complicated methods to ensure milling process quality. Among them there are three main groups: mathematical simulation of milling process dynamics and computation of processing parameters which provide high quality of machined surface, low level of vibrations and static deflections of a tool and a work-piece; introduction of the active vibration suppression devices into machine tool design; such devices include a vibration sensor, a feedback circuit, and an actuator which induces kinematic or force action on the oscillatory system; control of processing parameters, mainly of rotation frequency for minimizing the amplitudes of vibrations. The paper studies one of the 3 rd group methods. There is a suggestion to process a signal of vibrational accelerations in real time and detect a chatter onset. If the chatter has been detected its frequency is to be identified, and the new value of rotation speed is set: where Ω – rotation frequency, rot/s; p – the tool eigenfrequency value identified during processing, Hz; z – <b>mill</b> <b>tooth</b> number; i – positive integer number; ε< 1 – small positive parameter. In the current research {{it is assumed that}} ε = 0, 2. The formula has been chosen because at the rotation frequency axis where tooth pass frequency is slightly less than the eigenfrequency divided by the integer value there are stable zones of dynamics in the milling process. The study shows a developed model of the plane milling dynamics. It includes a dynamic model of the tool, a model of cutting forces, and geometrical models of cutting edges and work-piece surface.   The model is used to study an impact of described control system on the milling process dynamics.

40|$|Grinding {{process is}} one of the most common methods to {{manufacture}} parts that require precision ground surfaces, either to a critical size or for the surface finish. In abrasive machining, abrasive tool consists of randomly oriented, positioned and shaped abrasive grits which act as cutting edges and remove material from the workpiece individually to produce the final workpiece surface. Hence it is almost impossible to achieve optimum process parameters and a repeatable process by experience or practical knowledge. In order to overcome these issues and predict the outcomes of the operation beforehand, modeling of the process is crucial. The main aim of this thesis is to develop semi-analytical or analytical models in order to represent the true mechanics and thermal behavior of metals during abrasive machining processes, especially grinding operations. Abrasive wheel surface topography identification, surface roughness, thermomechanical and semi-analytical force models and two dimensional moving heat source temperature model are proposed. These models are used to simulate the grinding process accurately. The proposed models are more sophisticated than previous ones as they require less calibration experiments and cover wider range of possible cutting conditions. Once the wheel topography and abrasive grit properties are identified, uncut chip thickness per grain and final workpiece surface profile can be predicted. A novel thermo-mechanical model at primary shear zone with sticking and sliding contact zones on the rake face of the abrasive grit was established to predict cutting forces by assuming each of the abrasive grit similar to a micro <b>milling</b> tool <b>tooth.</b> Knowing the force and total process energy, by using two dimensional moving heat source theory, process temperatures are predicted.

40|$|The design {{theory and}} method of formed milling cutter for double-helix screw of {{progressing}} cavity pump are presented. Through analyzing {{the shape and}} characteristic parameters of double-helix screw, the helicoids equation and axial curve equation of double-helix screw were established. According to the relative position relations between formed milling cutter and double-helix screw in the machining process, the geometric mapping relationship of screw coordinate system and formed milling cutter coordinate system was established by using the coordinate transformation theory. Based on noninstantaneous envelope method and the meshing conditions between formed milling cutter and double-helix screw, the contact line equations were established by minimum value method. By analyzing the machining errors caused by resharpening the formed <b>milling</b> cutter, the <b>tooth</b> back curve equation was established based on spiral of Archimedes, and the profile equation of formed milling cutter with constant back angle was got. On this basis, the formed milling cutter of processing double-helix screw was designed, and the cutter head and tool post were manufactured, respectively. The measuring results have shown that this method can satisfy the requirements of machining accuracy for double-helix screw. So this is an effective method to get formed milling cutter profile for double-helix screw...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -dimensional {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} analysis of minimum quantity lubricant flow for a four-tooth milling cutter operation with single and three nozzles is presented in this paper. CFD modelling is utilized to simulate the flow distribution around a four- <b>tooth</b> <b>milling.</b> The domain of a rotating cutter along with the spraying nozzle was defined. Operating cutting and boundary conditions were defined based on previous literature. A steady-state, pressure-based, planar analysis was performed with a viscous, realizable k-ε model. A 3 -D transient-case, incompressible analysis for the minimum quantity lubricant is also performed. The domain of the milling cutter is rotated {{at a very high}} spindle speed, and a single nozzle is used to investigate the effects of MQL spray. A mixture of oils and air is sprayed onto the tool. Another analysis is performed with three nozzles placed at equal angles to each other around the periphery of the tool. A 2 -dimensional steady-state analysis is also carried out using CFD. The obtained results verify that the single nozzle cannot fully lubricate the rotating tool. It was observed that flow penetration into the cutting zone is dependent on the flow velocity and the number of nozzles. Hence, it can be concluded that the MQL nozzle arrangement can be improved with three nozzles with a constant mass flow rate...|$|R
40|$|The cutting forces, tooth wear, surface finish, {{and cutting}} power were {{observed}} for 3 / 8 " x 3 " side and face milling cutters at {{two levels of}} cutting feed (2. 1 and 7. 7 in. /min.) and depth of cut (. 005 " and. 010 ") while cutting Inconel X- 750. [...] The investigation briefly traces the development of metal cutting science, pointing {{out some of the}} fallacies which have persisted to the present day. It proposes that metal to metal contact, and hence wear, be reduced by using a soft metal as a solid lubricant. Copper was eventually selected because of its electro-negative nature when compared to high speed steel. Copper is deposited continuously on the face and flank of <b>milling</b> cutter <b>teeth</b> by an electrolyte solution of copper sulphate and sulphuric acid. [...] The experiment consisted of three phases, the first being of a preliminary nature to evaluate the feasibility of depositing copper by this process. Measurements of cutting power for various depths of cut, using a mild steel work piece, were compared to those obtained using a soluble oil, with favourable results for the copper sulphate electrolyte. [...] Evaluation of the electrolyte cutting fluid to determine its optimum composition by measuring cutter wear, cutting forces, cutting power, and the surface finish of the work piece, follows. Observations of surface finish and cutting power produced no positive result. However, the other variables indicated a preference for a copper sulphate concentration of 11. 1 grams per litre of solution and a sulphuric acid concentration of 5 millilitres of concentrated acid per litre of solution. [...] The determination of the optimum composition of the copper based electrolyte was achieved using Inconel X- 750 as the work piece material. This grade of Inconel was also used in the third and final phase of the experiment, which was to compare the electrolyte cutting fluid with a conventional sulphurized cutting oil. Results of this comparison indicate that the conventional cutting oil, Veedol AFTON # 8 containing 1. 8 to 2 per cent sulphur, produces less wear at a lower wear rate than the copper sulphate solution...|$|R
