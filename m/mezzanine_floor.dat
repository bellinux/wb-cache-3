5|$|The {{museum was}} {{designed}} in a French inspired Egyptian Revival style by the architects Antoine Nahas and Pierre Leprince Ringuet, and built with Lebanese ochre limestone. It comprises a basement, a ground floor, a <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> and a terrace; the central block {{is covered by}} a glass roof, above the mezzanine, giving natural overhead light.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the small}} family/chaplain's {{room on the}} third floor, was the servant's room with a corner {{fireplace}} and two windows on the <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor,</b> accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof level, was the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe. There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in {{the ceiling}} of the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E

50|$|Facing the canal, {{the privately}} owned home {{consists}} of a central building with two <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> and a barchessa, positioned as a wing addition with arches and external frescoes.|$|R
50|$|Internally, <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> and cocklofts are {{constructed}} to form extra bed spaces compounding the overcrowding problem. There are no toilets or bathrooms, all ablutions had {{to perform in}} the kitchens at the rear.|$|R
5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> {{into an area}} {{that could be used}} as an arts venue, cinema, music {{auditorium}} or conference room for 120 to 150people. New plans cost £60,000. However this new design was deemed to be unworkable. A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and did not include the tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over parking, and the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E
5|$|Palladio {{would often}} model his villa {{elevations}} on Roman temple facades. The temple influence, {{often in a}} cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated the family of the householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor,</b> as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
50|$|The castle has six floors, plus a basement: ground <b>floor,</b> <b>mezzanine</b> first, main <b>floor,</b> <b>mezzanine</b> second, upper {{gallery and}} gallery of covers. The main gate {{is flanked by}} two towers with an arch between them.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{there are}} two {{parallel}} <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> running east to west, one along the north wall and a larger one along the south wall, both reached by two staircases, between each is the level frame itself.|$|R
50|$|The office conversion, {{which was}} carried out by the firm Downs & Variava in 1990, has been criticised favourably; the {{insertion}} of <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> is regarded as sympathetic to the spacious interior by the retention of the area under the crossing to roof height.|$|R
5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> to provide {{sleeping}} facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were {{on the top floor of}} the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to the bedrooms each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E
25|$|It {{had three}} main floors and an attic in a mansard roof. A <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> at cornice height {{was used for}} storage. The house was {{separated}} from the sidewalks by a moat-like light well that lit the service areas in the basement. The main parlour ran {{the full length of}} the house's Fifth Avenue frontage.|$|E
25|$|On 10 March 1965, a bomb {{planted by}} Indonesian saboteurs on a <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> of MacDonald House exploded, killing three people and {{injuring}} 33 others. It was the deadliest {{of at least}} 42 bomb incidents which occurred during the Konfrontasi. Two members of the Indonesian Marine Corps, Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said, were eventually convicted and executed for the crime. The MacDonald House suffered $250,000 bomb damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in the 1950s, with {{the removal of}} the corner oriel and cupola, the top cornice and the balconettes, and the painting of the brickwork. In the 1970s, the upper floors were sealed off, leaving only the basement, ground and <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> in use as retail spaces.|$|R
50|$|The clerestory, on {{each side}} of the central king post trussed roof, {{provides}} natural light to both levels through the central mezzanine opening. Large timber beams and columns support both the mezzanine level and the roof. The <b>mezzanine</b> <b>flooring</b> is supported on closely spaced timber joists separated by herring-bone strutting.|$|R
50|$|The main stairs {{are located}} {{at the ends of}} the nave. They run over the {{balustrade}} of the <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> of the main hall to the third floor. The main staircase now contains an elevator that goes up to the fourth floor. The window facing the courtyard are painted in the colours of the mezzanine.|$|R
25|$|SkyLounge is Royal Brunei Airlines' lounge at the Brunei International Airport. It {{was opened}} in January 2004 and {{occupies}} the entire <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> at the departure hall (airside) of the airport. The lounge is exclusively reserved for Royal Brunei’s first and business class passengers, and Royal Skies Gold and Silver members. The lounge {{may also be}} used by qualifying members of other airlines with an agreement with Royal Brunei Airlines to use the lounge, such as Singapore Airlines.|$|E
25|$|Under Malaysia Airports Berhad retail {{optimisation}} plan, {{the retail}} space in satellite terminal A will be further optimised {{to increase its}} revenue derived from commercial space rental and a percentage of sale receipts to 50% by year 2010 which currently stands at 35%. Some notable improvements that will be seen after the refurbishments will be the Jungle Boardwalk {{which will be the}} first of its kind in the world and larger <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> to accommodate F outlets and viewing galleries.|$|E
25|$|Above this {{floor is}} a further almost <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor,</b> its small unpedimented windows {{aligning}} with the larger below, serve to emphasise {{the importance of the}} piano nobile. The roofline is hidden by a balustrade. Each of the terminating 'wings' is crowned by a one storey, pedimented tower resembling a Palladian pavilion. At the time, his style was an innovation. Just thirty years earlier, Montacute House, exemplifying the English Renaissance, had been revolutionary; only a century earlier, the juxtaposing mass of wings that is Compton Wynyates, one of the first houses to be built without complete fortification, had just been completed and was considered modern.|$|E
50|$|When {{viewed from}} the second <b>floor</b> <b>mezzanine,</b> the lobby <b>floor</b> is {{designed}} as an optical illusion giving the appearance {{that it is a}} cone-shaped pit with the marble pedestal at the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the rear}} facade {{of the house was}} remodeled in the 19th century in a Tudor Gothic style. However, the {{haphazard}} fenestration suggesting <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors,</b> and stonework and the need for a low buttress suggest that the lower floors, at least, may belong to the 16th and 17th-centuries. Facing the rear are a number of outbuildings, including the former stables, which date from 1849 to 1860.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War the {{building}} reverted {{to its former}} use as the AMP's Queensland headquarters until February 1978 when the Society moved to AMP Place in Eagle Street. In 1979 the ground and <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> were refurbished and leased as retail premises and offices. The building was re-opened and named MacArthur Chambers in honour of General MacArthur. In November 1990 the Brisbane City Council acquired MacArthur Chambers.|$|R
25|$|Charles Barry {{introduced}} the Neo-Renaissance to England with his {{design of the}} Travellers Club, Pall Mall (1829-1832). Other early but typical, domestic examples of the Neo-Renaissance include Mentmore Towers and the Château de Ferrières, both designed in the 1850s by Joseph Paxton {{for members of the}} Rothschild banking family. The style is characterized by original Renaissance motifs, taken from such Quattrocento architects as Alberti. These motifs included rusticated masonry and quoins, windows framed by architraves and doors crowned by pediments and entablatures. If a building were of several floors the uppermost floor usually had small square windows representing the minor <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> of the original Renaissance designs. However, the Neo-renaissance style later came to incorporate Romanesque and Baroque features not found in the original Renaissance architecture which was often more severe in its design.|$|E
25|$|Building the new chapel {{with the}} same {{proportions}} as the old one and making it fit {{within the walls of}} the old chapel, with a retained high ceiling inside the walls of the former northeast tower (now the northeast corner of the palace), proved difficult for Tessin if he was to be able to adhere to the austere Baroque style where all the windows aught to be the same size, and placed in precise rows despite what rooms were behind them. To achieve this, Tessin added a <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> with smaller square windows just above the lower row of windows. These smaller windows now encircles the whole building, a remnant of the first castle chapel. After the fire, when Tessin could make more substantial alterations, the Royal Chapel and the Hall of State were placed in the southern row instead, and the furniture and inventories, such as benches, household silver and decorations are to some extent preserved in the present-day Royal Chapel.|$|E
25|$|The Chancery Wing {{is another}} name for the {{northwest}} wing of the palace. It was planned for the central parts of the government administration, the Royal chancery. The wing was finished by architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, and was originally used as the royal gardhouse, offices for domestic, foreign and war departments as well as the National Archives of Sweden. As the government administration grew, it moved from the palace and formed new independent departments, and around 1780, the Chancery Wing was transformed into an apartment for the three-year-old Crown Prince Gustav (IV) Adolf and later for his mother the Queen Dowager Sophia Magdalena. The Chancery Wing was once again the home of a prince in 1905, when it became the Crown Prince and later King Gustaf VI Adolf, who used it as his private lodgings until his death in 1973. A part of the <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> above his apartment was converted into his private library in the 1930s. The Spegelsalongen (the Mirror Hall), updated in 1866 by Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, is in the wing as well as a Green and a Blue Drawing room. The Slottsarkivet, a part of the present National Archives of Sweden, is still in the cellars of the wing.|$|E
50|$|The Sacred Heart Church, a Victorian mid-sized Catholic {{church that}} caters to parish members of Santacruz (west) is located on same {{premises}} as the school. The church is built {{in the shape of}} a cross with <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> in the left and right arms. Stained glass windows adorn the church entrances. Towards the west gate of the campus and close to the church is a grotto frequented by people of all faiths.|$|R
5000|$|Roberts Hotel is a {{historic}} hotel located at Muncie, Delaware County, Indiana. It was built in 1921, and is a six-story, Colonial Revival style steel frame building sheathed in red brick with limestone detailing. The basement, first, and <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> measure 120 feet by 125 feet, where the second through sixth floors above are [...] "L"-shaped. It has a flat roof behind a parapet. The hotel closed in 1972, but reopened in 1976. The building has been renovated into loft apartments.|$|R
5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, the stage was {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts of the stage had a ladder reaching the <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, and instruments adorned with red roses. The main set list for the residency encompassed songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.|$|R
25|$|Beirut National Museum is the {{principal}} museum of archaeology in Lebanon. The collection was begun after World War I, and the museum was officially opened in 1942. The museum has collections totaling about 100,000 objects, {{most of which are}} antiquities and medieval finds from excavations undertaken by the Directorate General of Antiquities. About 1300 artifacts are exhibited, ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. The museum was designed in a French-inspired Egyptian Revival architecture and built with Lebanese Ochre limestone. It comprises a basement, a ground floor, a <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> and a terrace; the central block is covered by a glass roof, above the mezzanine, giving natural overhead light. The whole site is approximately 5,500 square meters (59,000 sq ft), and the exhibition floor space totals 6,000 square meters (65,000 sq ft). The immediately adjoining museum annexes and administrative offices occupy about 1,000 square meters (11,000 sq ft). The museum displays follow a chronological circuit beginning in Prehistory and ending in the Ottoman era. The circuit begins on the ground floor where 83 large objects are displayed, these include sarcophagi, mosaics statues and reliefs. The upper floor displays 1243 small and medium-sized artifacts arranged by chronological order and by theme in modern showcases with soft lighting and magnifying glasses that emphasize the aesthetic aspect of the artifacts.|$|E
500|$|The building's adult {{reading room}} is {{equipped}} with mahogany furniture specifically designed for the space. [...] It also contains matching built-in shelving and custom-made bronze lamps. [...] The circulation desk area has two-tiered bronze-trimmed book stacks. [...] The <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> is composed of glass blocks.|$|E
500|$|The {{ground floor}} holds the main banking room (the Portland branch of U.S. Bank), and a grand room {{measuring}} [...] with [...] ceilings. [...] The interior is extensively decorated with highly textured materials. Square columns of polished marble topped by Corinthian capitals that incorporate an eagle motif line all four {{sides of the}} main public space. The coffered ceiling is intricately detailed. The marble floor is patterned, and the teller windows are divided by Hauteville-marble pillars detailed with bas reliefs. A recessed <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floor</b> runs along {{the north and south}} sides, behind the columns. The bank vaults are in the basement, where the public space also has a marble floor.|$|E
50|$|The facades (exterior) of the {{building}} were reconstructed with red sandstone panels and a chhajja {{with the addition of}} duchhati (<b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors)</b> at the corners by the Mughals. On each facade there is a rectangular structure which projects forward and has a pointy arch in it. It is flanked on either sides by wings, which consists of three arches and a set of double arches, one over the other, thus accommodating a duchhatti at each corner of {{the building}}. The wings are protected by chhajjas. The duchhatti are accessible by stairways.|$|R
50|$|Urbis is a {{building}} in Cathedral Gardens, designed by SimpsonHaugh and Partners with consulting engineers Martin Stockley Associates.The building has six storeys and a distinctive sloping form. Visitors were intended {{to travel to the}} top floor, accessed by an elevator, to admire the cityscape, then progress down a series of cascading <b>mezzanine</b> <b>floors</b> past exhibits about cities. The fully glazed facades consist of approximately 2,200 glass panes arranged in horizontal strips. The building has an adiabatic cooling system for use in summer and heat recovery system for use in winter increasing its energy efficiency.|$|R
