5|$|A {{few days}} after the murders, the Ministry of Interior {{announced}} its deliberation about making the gun license registry accessible to psychiatrists in order to give them the ability to report to police possible changes of mental state of their patients having an impact on their eligibility to possess firearms. This was, however, rejected by psychiatric associations. They argued that psychiatrists' <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> is to cure patients, and that potential patients {{may be more likely to}} avoid psychiatric treatment for fear of losing their gun license.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a decree}} from 1972, the Ministry of Justice {{prepared}} proposals for the codification of law; it carried out methodological management of legal {{work in the}} national economy. The Ministry directed and coordinated the work of state bodies and public organisations to promote legal knowledge and to clarify the law among the population about the judicial agencies, as well as general management of the civil registry, state, and legal profession. The Ministry was liable to the Party, the state, and the people. The Ministry's <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> was to strengthen socialist legality {{and the rule of}} law within Soviet judicial institutions.|$|E

5|$|During {{the closing}} stages of World War I, German-trained Finnish Jäger troops {{played a key}} role in the Finnish Civil War, while the German Baltic Sea Division also intervened late in the civil war. Jäger troops were volunteers from German-influenced circles, such as {{university}} students. This participation in the Finnish struggle for independence created close ties with Germany, but after the German defeat in the World War, Scandinavian relations became more important and the <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> of the Finnish foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Forward riding, {{also called}} Straight riding or the Remontenschule - This {{is the name}} given to the skills taught {{in the first year}} of training, where a young horse learns to be saddled and bridled, learns basic {{commands}} on a longe line, and then is taught to be ridden, mostly in an arena in simple straight lines and turns, to teach correct responses to the rider's legs and hands while mounted. The <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> during this time is to develop free forward movement in as natural a position as possible.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the {{decentralisation}} stance {{taken in}} the treaty, Pavlov {{was one of the}} key players in the establishment of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in August 1991. Pavlov's inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness to revert to pre-Gorbachev policies. The Committee's <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralised union state. The Emergency Committee was led by Gennady Yanayev, Vice President of the Soviet Union, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, Defence Minister Dmitry Yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust Gorbachev.|$|E

5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Five-Year Plan is {{subordinate}} to the Ten Year Socio-economic Development Strategy (2001–2010) which aims to continue comprehensive reform and achieve fast, sustainable growth rates. The <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> of the Ten Year Plan is to lift Vietnam out of the category of underdeveloped countries and to reach {{the status of a}} modern-industrial nation by 2012. The Eighth Five-Year Plan, while approved by the Congress, had to earn the approval of the National Assembly before being implemented.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen as a working document, compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission and}} purpose of the Army and Navy Union are to bind {{together}} in fraternal comradeship all comrades, shipmates, soldiers, sailors and marines, regular and volunteers, veterans of all wars in which the United States has been or may be engaged in. Besides patriotic, other purposes for the organization are for history and genealogy records. The <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> of the organization is to fraternally join all these veterans in a common semi-military group with similar backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers line up {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5|$|Vinokourov led the Astana squad at the Tour de France. Entering 2011, he {{had thought}} it to be his final season as an active competitor, and his <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> for the year was to wear the yellow jersey at some time during the Tour. His pursuit of yellow was {{strengthened}} {{by the addition of}} Kreuziger to the squad, riding solely in support of the veteran Kazakh. Paris–Nice stage winner Di Gregorio and Tiralongo were also named to the squad.|$|E

5|$|With Chadwick {{involved}} the <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> {{was to show}} that the Quebec Agreement was a success. It was Britain's duty to co-operate to the fullest and speed along the process. Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience as possible so that they might carry that experience to post-war Britain. He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat's integrity to the cause, and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality. Rotblat had been left in charge of the Tube Alloys research, and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> is to move traffic efficiently, the city {{was not able to}} carry out pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E
5|$|Sports such as polo do {{not judge}} the horse itself, but rather use the horse {{as a partner}} for human {{competitors}} as {{a necessary part of}} the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.|$|E

5|$|The F-4s {{and their}} crews, however, proved {{equal to the}} {{situation}} and claimed seven MiG-21s destroyed, {{almost half of the}} 16 then in service with the VPAF without loss to USAF aircraft. Olds himself shot down one of the seven, for which he and the other aircrew were awarded Silver Stars. Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C reconnaissance aircraft led to a similar mission on a smaller scale on January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or diminish the threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban took its toll on Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his <b>main</b> <b>goal,</b> aiming to prove he could perform without the use of drugs. Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal, covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of White Finland, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's first senate, {{was called the}} Vaasa Senate after relocation to the west-coast city of Vaasa, acting as {{the capital of the}} Whites from 29 January to 3 May. In domestic policy the White Senate's <b>main</b> <b>goal</b> was to return the political right to power in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported monarchy and opposed democracy; others approved parliamentarianism since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917-1918 concluded, that empowering the common people would not work. Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.|$|E
