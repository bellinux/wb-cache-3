25|$|A tall man, {{he might}} have {{achieved}} even <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> but for back trouble. Even so, he was an essential member of the Surrey side for many years. As a batsman, he preferred to attack, and was an especially fine driver of the ball. He was often at his best in a crisis. He reached a thousand runs in a season nine times in succession (1938–1939 and 1946–1952 – this excludes 1945, in which season he played in only one match). His medium-paced bowling was generally steady rather than particularly penetrative. He took 50 or more wickets in a season 5 times, but never managed more than 67.|$|E
25|$|To {{show this}} relationship, {{suppose that the}} market price of a product is $1.00, and that a $0.50 tax is imposed on the product that, by law, is to be {{collected}} from the seller. If the product has an elastic demand, a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by the seller. This is because goods with elastic demand cause a large decline in quantity demanded for a small increase in price. Therefore, in order to stabilize sales, the seller absorbs more of the additional tax burden. For example, the seller might drop {{the price of the}} product to $0.70 so that, after adding in the tax, the buyer pays a total of $1.20, or $0.20 <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> before the $0.50 tax was imposed. In this example, the buyer has paid $0.20 of the $0.50 tax (in the form of a post-tax price) and the seller has paid the remaining $0.30 (in the form of a lower pre-tax price).|$|E
25|$|Before Cal's {{newspaper}} goes to press, Collins goes {{on record}} {{to present his}} research into PointCorp. Collins's estranged wife Anne (Robin Wright Penn), whose conversation with Cal seems to imply a past love triangle dating back to their college years, reveals that she knows {{the amount of money}} Sonia received from PointCorp, after just hearing Collins's statement to the newspaper. After the couple leaves, Cal realizes that Collins knew already that Sonia was working for PointCorp. Cal wonders what Collins would have done had he known he had been tricked and whether Collins himself is connected with Sonia's assassin. A picture of Collins from his military days, with the assassin in the frame, confirms Cal's hunch. Collins reveals that he had been suspicious of Sonia, and that he hired the assassin to watch her. The assassin is U.S. Army Corporal Robert Bingham (Michael Berresse), whose life Collins had once saved. Collins says that Bingham hated PointCorp <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and that he killed Sonia with no authorization from him.|$|E

500|$|Ron Hauge, {{writer of}} the episode, wanted to do an episode where he would use Homer's qualities such as oafishness, brute strength, thickness, and loyalty, for good. When Lisa says {{they have to go}} back for Maggie after the family escape the riot, Homer says [...] "Forget Maggie, she's gone." [...] Matt Groening claims this to be one of his {{favorite}} quotes in the show. Hamill only agreed to guest star if he was allowed to voice a character as well as himself. He stated that he loved doing the voice for bodyguard instructor Leavelle a lot <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> providing the voice for himself.|$|E
500|$|A leitmotif is a {{recurring}} musical theme {{within a particular}} piece of music, associated with a particular person, place or idea. Wagner is the composer most often associated with leitmotifs, and Parsifal makes liberal use of them. Wagner did not specifically identify or name leitmotifs in the score of Parsifal (any <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in any other of his scores), although his wife Cosima mentions statements he made about {{some of them in}} her diary. However, Wagner's followers (notably Hans von Wolzogen whose guide to Parsifal was published in 1882) named, wrote about and made references to these motifs, and they were highlighted in piano arrangements of the score. Wagner's own reaction to such naming of motifs in the score was one of disgust: [...] "In the end people believe that such nonsense happens by my suggestion." ...|$|E

2500|$|For her {{literary}} accomplishments, Blixen {{was awarded}} the Danish Holberg Medal in 1949, the Ingenio et Arti medal in 1950, granted the inaugural Hans Christian Andersen Scholarship of the Danish Writers Association in 1955 and received the Henrik Pontoppidan Memorial Foundation Grant in 1959. Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, described it as [...] "a mistake" [...] that Blixen was not awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature during the 1930s and when Hemingway won the prize in 1954, he stated that Bernard Berenson, Carl Sandburg and Blixen deserved the prize <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Although never awarded the prize, she finished in third place behind Graham Greene in 1961, the year Ivo Andrić {{was awarded the}} prize. In 2012, the Nobel records were opened after 50 years and {{it was revealed that}} Blixen was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with John Steinbeck (the eventual winner), Robert Graves, Lawrence Durrell, and Jean Anouilh. Blixen became ineligible after dying in September of that year.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, [...] "aware of {{his status}} {{as one of the}} few leaders revered across Japan's {{suddenly}} fractured political landscape" [...] and the country's [...] "most revered elder statesman", Nakasone launched a series of interviews to address the direction of prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's government. In a profile at that time, he saw Hatoyama's [...] "inexperienced left-leaning" [...] government as [...] "challenging Japan's postwar political order and its close relationship with the United States". As well, the LDP was [...] "crumbling into disarray" [...] in the wake of Hatoyama's victory. In the profile, Nakasone described the moment [...] "as a national opening on par with the wrenching social and political changes that followed defeat in the [...] war [...] praised the appearance of a strong second political party as a step toward true democracy". [...] "Being knocked out of power is a good chance to study in the cram school of public opinion", he was quoted as saying of the LDP. He [...] "faulted Mr. Hatoyama for giving Washington the impression that [...] valued ties with China <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> those with the United States. 'Because of the prime minister’s imprudent remarks, the current situation calls for Japan to make efforts to improve things,' he said. The [...] relationship with the United States is different from that with China, he said, because 'it is built on a security alliance, and not just on the alliance, but on the shared values of liberal democracy, and on its shared ideals.'" [...] And relative to another high-profile current source of friction between Japan and the United States, Nakasone said [...] "Problems like Okinawa [...] can be solved by talking together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Firemen {{frequently}} pitched two- or three-inning outings to earn saves. The modern closer, {{reduced to}} a one-inning role, is available to pitch more save opportunities. In the past, a reliever pitching three innings one game would be unavailable to pitch the next game. Gossage had more saves {{of at least two}} innings than saves where he pitched one inning or less. [...] "The times I did a one-inning save, I felt guilty about it. It's like it was too easy", said Gossage. ESPN.com wrote that saves have not been determined to be [...] "a special, repeatable skill—rather than simply a function of opportunities". It also noted that blown saves are [...] "non-qualitative", pointing out that the two career leaders in blown saves—Gossage (112) and Rollie Fingers (109)—were both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Fran Zimniuch in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball wrote, [...] "But {{you have to be a}} great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, [...] saved many, many <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not save." [...] More than half of Gossage's and Fingers' blown saves came in tough save situations, where the tying run was on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of their blown tough saves, they entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save. [...] The pitchers need to get out of the initial situation and pitch additional innings with more chances to lose the lead. A study by the Baseball Hall of Fame found modern closers were put into fewer tough save situations compared to past relievers. The modern closer also earned significantly more [...] "easy saves", defined as saves starting the ninth inning with more than a one-run lead. The study offered [...] "praise to the combatants who faced more danger for more innings." ...|$|E
