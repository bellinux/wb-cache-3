LeMond's cycling talent—his overall strength, climbing ability, ability to ride a fast time trial and his capacity to recover quickly—all suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for the <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> Grand Tours.|$|E
5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is the <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{ultimately}} {{proved to}} be an able commander. Thirty-seven years old and a New Zealander by birth, he had been commissioned into the Australian 2/2nd Battalion with Green during the Second World War. Serving as an intelligence officer on the headquarters of the 16th Brigade during the Libyan campaign in 1941, Ferguson had been awarded the Military Cross for his actions during fighting on the Kokoda Track in New Guinea in 1942. Later, he had served as a liaison officer with the 6th Division, before finishing the war as a staff officer posted to the 7th Division headquarters on Morotai island, taking part in the amphibious landing at Balikpapan in 1945. Ferguson volunteered to serve in the BCOF in Japan after the war and was posted to the 67th Battalion as a company commander, arriving in Kure in February 1946. After leaving the battalion in 1948 to serve on the headquarters of BCOF for six months, he returned as battalion second-in-command. In 1949 the battalion had been renamed the 3rd Battalion, Australian Regiment, and was later granted the 'Royal' prefix. He remained with the battalion after that time. The change of command was confirmed by the Commander-in-Chief BCOF, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, and Ferguson was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 10 November. He developed a good working relationship with Coad, who held him in high regard, and went on to command 3 RAR during its <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> period in Korea.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{returned}} to Asia, the focus {{shifted to the}} championship race. Lewis Hamilton put himself in the ideal position to take the fight to Fernando Alonso, qualifying on pole whilst Alonso could only manage fifth place. In the physically <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> race of the year, the teams jostled for position through {{the first phase of}} the Grand Prix, trying to position themselves for the final ten laps. Just as the drivers established a rhythm, Hamilton's gearbox failed, forcing him out of the race and handing the lead to Sebastian Vettel. The race was shortened by two laps to fit the two-hour time limit for a Grand Prix following a pair of lengthy safety car interventions; first, Narain Karthikeyan understeered into the barriers under the grandstands on lap 30, forcing the safety car to be deployed. The drivers had little opportunity to get comfortable on the restart, as Michael Schumacher misjudged his braking point at the end of the Esplanade Bridge, careening into the back of Jean-Éric Vergne and triggering the safety car for the second time in an accident that was a near mirror-image of his collision with Sergio Pérez in 2011. He was later given a ten-place grid penalty for the Japanese Grand Prix. Vettel controlled the race from the second restart, beating Jenson Button to the line, for his second win of the season and his first since the Bahrain Grand Prix five months previously. Alonso completed the podium, retaining his championship lead after defending from Paul di Resta late in the race. Elsewhere, a string of retirements – including a late engine problem for Bruno Senna, which left the Brazilian with minor burns to his back – and a series of altercations involving Mark Webber, Nico Hülkenberg, Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez as they fought over the minor points positions allowed Timo Glock to finish twelfth, the result seeing Marussia retake tenth position in the World Constructors' Championship from Caterham.|$|E

5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E

25|$|Because {{wirewound}} resistors are coils {{they have}} more undesirable inductance than other types of resistor, although winding the wire in sections with alternately reversed direction can minimize inductance.

25|$|The {{relative}} {{success of}} the defensive system at Ypres in 1917 was not repeated in 1918 on the Santerre in Picardy or the downlands west of Cambrai. The Vorpostenfeld could be overrun behind creeping barrages at night or in twilight and there were too few Eingreif divisions to counter-attack, those present being capable only of local attacks or reinforcement of the defenders. German divisions were smaller than earlier in the war, had more machine-guns and better command arrangements but the system of linked Stellungsdivisionen and Eingreifdivisionen was <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> of manpower; British attacks in late 1918 rarely outnumbered the defenders, relying on initiative and surprise.|$|E
