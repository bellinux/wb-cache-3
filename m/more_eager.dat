5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> {{to take on a}} wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E

25|$|By the 1820s, many Indians (they were {{referred}} to as Klings, or Keling, which {{was used as a}} derogatory word, much as the word Coolie) were voluntarily enlisting to go abroad for work, in the hopes of a better life. European merchants and businessmen quickly took advantage of this and began recruiting them for work as a cheap source of labour. The British began shipping Indians to colonies around the world, including British Mauritius, British Fiji, British Natal, British East Africa, British Tanganyika, British Somaliland, British Bechuanaland, British Seychelles, British Uganada, British Northern Rhodesia, British Rhodesia, British Nyasaland, British Guiana, British Trinidad and Tobago, British Jamaica, British Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, British Honduras, Saint Kitts and Nevis, British Barbados, the rest of the British West Indies, and British Malaya. The Dutch also shipped workers to labor on the plantations on Dutch Surinam the Netherlands Antilles, and the Dutch East Indies. The French had also shipped laborers to Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, the rest of the French West Indies, and Réunion. A system of agents was used to infiltrate the rural villages of India and recruit labourers. They would often deceive the credulous workers about the great opportunities that awaited them for their own material betterment abroad. The Indians primarily came from the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but also from Tamil Nadu and other areas to the south of the country. Indians had faced a great number of social and economic disasters, causing them to be <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> than other groups to leave India. In {{the last part of the}} nineteenth century alone, there were 24 famines.|$|E

Michelle Nguyen of Geek.com, writing following the release of [...] "Sword and Shield", was generally positive about the anime, praising its characters despite her dislike {{for the lack of}} playable female characters in the game itself. Speaking about each episode, she found the first episode to be rather weak, and ranked [...] "Dogged Runner" [...] high for changing Prompto into a more complex character.

500|$|During the Brezhnev Era, {{pressure}} from below forced the Soviet leadership to alter some cultural policies, though the fundamental {{characteristics of the}} Communist system remained the same. Rock music and jeans, which had been criticized as hallmarks of Western culture, were legalized. The Soviet Union even started to manufacture its own jeans in the 1970s. As time progressed, however, the youth were <b>more</b> <b>eager</b> to buy Western products. The Soviet black market flourished during the Brezhnev Era, and [...] "fake Western jeans" [...] became very popular according to Archie Brown. Western rock groups such as The Beatles remained very popular throughout the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, even if Soviet official policy remained wary of it. Soviet rock music evolved, and became a form of dissidence against the Soviet system. Vladimir Vysotsky, Alexander Galich and Bulat Okudzhava were the most renowned rock musicians, and their lyrics, and music in general, were critical of the country's Stalinist past, {{as well as its}} undemocratic system. In a 1981 editorial published in Pravda, Viktor Chebrikov, a deputy KGB head, commented on the apathy of Soviet youth towards the system and accused the West of using concepts such as consumerism, religion, and nationalism to encourage [...] "pessimism, nihilism, and the pervasive view that life is better in the West." [...] He also argued that foreign groups of Estonians, Latvians, and other ethnicities had a considerable influence on Soviet society.|$|E
500|$|In 415 BC, {{delegates from}} the Sicilian city of Segesta (...) arrived at Athens to plead {{for the support}} of the Athenians in their war against Selinus. During the debates on the undertaking, Nicias was vehemently opposed to Athenian intervention, {{explaining}} that the campaign would be very costly and attacking the character and motives of Alcibiades, who had emerged as a major supporter of the expedition. On the other hand, Alcibiades argued that a campaign in this new theatre would bring riches to the city and expand the empire, just as the Persian Wars had. In his speech Alcibiades predicted (over-optimistically, in the opinion of most historians) that the Athenians would be able to recruit allies in the region and impose their rule on Syracuse, the most powerful city of Sicily. In spite of Alcibiades's enthusiastic advocacy for the plan, it was Nicias, not he, who turned a modest undertaking into a massive campaign and made the conquest of Sicily seem possible and safe. It was at his suggestion that the size of the fleet was significantly increased from 60 ships to [...] "140 galleys, 5,100 men at arms, and about 1300 archers, slingers, and light armed men". Philosopher Leo Strauss underscores that the Sicilian expedition surpassed everything undertaken by Pericles. Almost certainly Nicias's intention was to shock the assembly with his high estimate of the forces required, but, instead of dissuading his fellow citizens, his analysis made them all the <b>more</b> <b>eager.</b> [...] Against his wishes Nicias was appointed General along with Alcibiades and Lamachus, all three of whom were given full powers to do whatever was {{in the best interests of}} Athens while in Sicily.|$|E

500|$|Each playable {{character}} in the game {{has the ability to}} equip items. Weapons in the game, unlike its predecessors, are gained in levels.

By defeating generals and lieutenants, the player's character is awarded experience scaled by the difficulty of each officer, and the amount of them defeated.
