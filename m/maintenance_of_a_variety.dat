40|$|Existing neurocomputational and {{empirical}} data link deficient neuromodulation of the fronto-parietal and hippocampal-striatal circuitries with aging-related increase in processing noise and declines in various cognitive functions. Specifically, {{the theory of}} aging neuronal gain control postulates that aging-related suboptimal neuromodulation may attenuate neuronal gain control, which yields computational consequences on reducing the signal-to-noise-ratio of synaptic signal transmission and hampering information processing within and between cortical networks. Intervention methods such as cognitive training and non-invasive brain stimulation, e. g., transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been considered as means to buffer cognitive functions or delay cognitive decline in old age. However, to date the reported effect sizes of immediate training gains and <b>maintenance</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> cognitive trainings are small to moderate at best; moreover, training-related transfer effects to non-trained but closely related (i. e., near-transfer) or other (i. e., far-transfer) cognitive functions are inconsistent or lacking. Similarly, although applying different tDCS protocols to reduce aging-related cognitive impairments by inducing temporary changes in cortical excitability seem somewhat promising, evidence of effects on short- and long-term plasticity is still equivocal. In this article, we will review and critically discuss existing findings of cognitive training- and stimulation-related behavioral and neural plasticity effects {{in the context of}} cognitive aging, focusing specifically on working memory and episodic memory functions, which are subserved by the fronto-parietal and hippocampal-striatal networks, respectively.

Its turnover, believed to be mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitates apoptosis induction in response to cellular stress. To investigate the contribution of ubiquitinylation in regulating murine MCL- 1 turnover, we generated an MCL- 1 mutant lacking the lysine residues required for ubiquitinylation (MCL- 1 KR). Here, we demonstrate that despite failing to be ubiquitinylated, the MCL- 1 KR protein is eliminated at a rate {{similar to that of}} wild-type MCL- 1 under basal and stressed conditions. Moreover, the degradation of wild-type MCL- 1 is not affected when ubiquitin-activating enzyme E 1 activity is blocked. Likewise, both wild-type and MCL- 1 KR proteins are similarly degraded when expressed in primary lymphocytes. Supporting these findings, unmodified, in vitro-translated MCL- 1 can be degraded in a cell-free system by the 20 S proteasome. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MCL- 1 degradation can occur independently of ubiquitinylation...|$|E

The Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) was developed as a content-independent measure of RNT to allow research into this process from a transdiagnostic perspective. In a recent study, good psychometric properties were established for the original German and English versions of the measure. The current study describes the crossvalidation of the PTQ in two Dutch-speaking samples, one from the Netherlands and one from Belgium (total N = 1, 845). The factor structure of the original PTQ with one higher-order factor and three lower-order factors was replicated for the Dutch-language version of the measure (PTQ-NL) using confirmatory factor analyses. In addition, the PTQ-NL showed good internal consistency and satisfactory stability.

In this system, mangrove pneumatophores trap the free-living alga, Hormosira banksii, which, in turn, supports dense and diverse assemblages of epifaunal mollusks. The first experiment, which manipulated pneumatophore height and density, revealed that these two traits each had additive negative effects on the establishment, but additive positive effects on {{the persistence of the}} cascade. High densities of tall pneumatophores initially served as a physical barrier to algal colonization of pneumatophore plots, but over the longer term enhanced the retention of algae.

The second experiment demonstrated that the retention of algae by pneumatophores was influenced more by algal thallus length than vesicle diameter, and this effect occurred independent of pneumatophore height. Our study has extended facilitation theory by showing that the morphological traits and density of basal and intermediary facilitators influence both the establishment and persistence of facilitation cascades. Hence, attempts to use foundation species as a tool for restoration will require an understanding not only of the interactions among these, but also of the key traits that modify interrelationships. 10 page(s...|$|R

They are of high ecological value due to their important role as bulk feeders in the grazing hierarchy. They also have high economic value, because {{they are one of}} the sought after ‘Big Five’ in the eco-tourism industry. In Africa, buffaloes have been recognised for some time as an important role player in the <b>maintenance</b> and transmission <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> economically important livestock diseases at the wildlife and/or livestock interface. These include African strains of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), Corridor disease (theileriosis), bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. For <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> other diseases of veterinary importance, African buffaloes may also serve as amplifier or incidental host, whereby infection with the causative pathogens may cause severe clinical signs such as death or abortion {{as in the case of}} anthrax and Rift Valley fever, or remain mild or subclinical for example heartwater. The long term health implications of most of those infections on the buffalo at a population level is usually limited, and they do not pose a threat on the population’s survival. Because of their ability to harbour and transmit important diseases to livestock, their sustainable future in ecotourism, trade and transfrontier conservation projects become complex and costly and reliable diagnostic tools are required to monitor these infections in buffalo populations.

40|$|Ingestion {{of protein}} {{is crucial for}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of body {{functions}} and {{within the scope of}} this review we will specifically focus on the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. A quantitative limitation exists as to how much muscle protein the body can synthesize in response to protein intake. Ingestion of excess protein exerts an unwanted load to the body and therefore, it is important to find the least amount of protein that provides the maximal hypertrophic stimulus. Hence, research has focused on revealing the relationship between protein intake (dose) and its resulting stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (response). In addition to the protein amount, the protein digestibility and, hence, the availability of its constituent amino acids is decisive for the response. In this regard, recent studies have provided in-depth knowledge about the time-course of the muscle protein synthetic response dependent on the characteristics of the protein ingested. The effect of protein intake on muscle protein accretion can further be stimulated by prior exercise training. In the ageing population, physical training may counteract the development of “anabolic resistance” and restore the beneficial effect of protein feeding. Presently, our knowledge is based on measures obtained in standardized experimental settings or during long-term intervention periods. However, to improve coherence between these types of data and to further improve our knowledge of the effects of protein ingestion, other investigative approaches than those presently used are requested...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands neurturin(NTN),persephin (PSP),and artemin(ART) was examinedbyimmunohistochemistry in the normal human brainstem at pre-, perinatal and adult age. Immunolabelled neurons were unevenly distributed and each trophin had a consistent distribution pattern. As a rule, the NTN antiserum produced the most abundant and diffuse tissue labelling, whereas the lowest density of positive elements was observed after ART immunostaining. Labelling for NTN, PSP, and ART occurred at all examined ages. For each trophin, neuronal perikarya were observed within sensory and motor nuclei of cranial nerves, dorsal column nuclei, olivary nuclear complex, reticular formation, pontine nuclei, locus caeruleus, raphe nuclei, substantia nigra, and quadrigeminal plate. Nerve fibers occurred within gracile and cuneate fasciculi, trigeminal spinal tract and nucleus, oculomotor and facial nerves, solitary tract, vestibular nerve, medial longitudinal fasciculus, medial and lateral lemnisci, and inferior and superior cerebellar peduncles. Age changes were detected in the distribution pattern for each trophin. On the whole, in the grey matter, labelled perikarya were more frequently observed in pre- and perinatal than in adult specimens; on the other hand, in discrete regions, nerve fibers and terminals were abundant and showed a definite arrangement only in adult tissue; finally, distinct fiber systems in the white matter were immunolabelled only at pre- and perinatal ages. The results support {{the concept of a}} trophic involvement of NTN, PSP, and ART in the development, functional activity and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of human brainstem neuronal systems...|$|E
40|$|Silica (SiO 2) {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{have found}} extensive applications in industrial manufacturing, biomedical and biotechnological fields. Therefore, the increasing exposure to such ultrafine particles requires studies to characterize their potential cytotoxic effects {{in order to}} provide exhaustive information {{to assess the impact of}} nanomaterials on human health. The understanding of the biological processes involved in the development and <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> of pathologies is improved by genome-wide approaches, and in this context, gene set analysis has emerged as a fundamental tool for the interpretation of the results. In this work we show how the use of a combination of gene-by-gene and gene set analyses can enhance the interpretation of results of in vitro treatment of A 549 cells with Ludox® colloidal amorphous silica nanoparticles. By gene-by-gene and gene set analyses, we evidenced a specific cell response in relation to NPs size and elapsed time after treatment, with the smaller NPs (SM 30) having higher impact on inflammatory and apoptosis processes than the bigger ones. Apoptotic process appeared to be activated by the up-regulation of the initiator genes TNFa and IL 1 b and by ATM. Moreover, our analyses evidenced that cell treatment with LudoxÒ silica nanoparticles activated the matrix metalloproteinase genes MMP 1, MMP 10 and MMP 9. The information derived from this study can be informative about the cytotoxicity of Ludox® and other similar colloidal amorphous silica NPs prepared by solution processes...|$|E
40|$|In systems analysis, it {{is common}} to deal with the {{complexity}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entire system by considering it to consist of interrelated sub-systems. This leads naturally to consider models as consisting <b>of</b> sub-models. Such <b>a</b> (conceptual) model can be implemented as a computer model that consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> connected component models. Component-oriented designs actually represent a natural choice for building scalable, robust, large-scale applications, and to maximize the ease <b>of</b> <b>maintenance</b> in <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> domains, including agro-ecological modelling. The modular approach was chosen to develop Agricultural Production and Externalities Simulator (APES). APES is a modular simulation system targeted at estimating the biophysical behaviour of agricultural production systems in response to the interaction of weather, soils and different options of agro-technical management. Although a specific, limited set of components is available in the first release, the system is being built to incorporate, at a later time, other modules which might be needed to simulate processes not included in the first version. The processes are simulated in APES with deterministic approaches which are mostly based on mechanistic representations of biophysical processes. The criteria for selecting modelling approaches are based on the need for: 1) accounting for specific processes to simulate soil-land use interactions, 2) input data to run simulations, which may be a constraint at EU scale, 3) simulation of agricultural production activities of interest (e. g. crops, grasses, orchards, agroforestry), and 4) simulation of agro-management implementation {{and its impact on the}} system. This report presents the current state of development of the model components being developed for APES and for third parties use. The intended use and modelling capabilities of each component are summarized...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of criminal law to consensual sex is <b>an</b> arena <b>of</b> conflict and contest between conservative and liberal {{forces in the}} United States, with occasional feminist interventions. The same arguments tend to recur {{on each side of}} the debate. Conservatives assert the appropriateness and necessity <b>of</b> enforcing <b>a</b> particular Judeo-Christian sexual morality through law. Liberals argue for tolerance of private consensual sexual conduct. When the debate shifts from the private to the public arena, conservatives may argue privacy principles, asserting the right of bystanders to be let alone, whereas liberals may shift to freedom of expression arguments. In this paper, I am seeking to find <b>a</b> new way <b>of</b> understanding the criminal regulation of consensual sex that transcends this conservative-liberal debate. In tracking the debate through courts, legislatures, and academic literature, I noted frequent references to disgust or revulsion. These were not incidental, throwaway references. An examination of the theory behind the opposing arguments reveals that disgust plays a central role in determining for each camp which consensual sexual practices should or should not be regulated through criminal law. Disgust is deployed by conservatives to argue for prohibition of various consensual sexual practices. On the other side, one might expect liberals to keep their disgust under wraps in the interest of pluralistic tolerance. This proves not to be the case. Liberals do argue that the generation of disgust by any given practice is not a sufficient basis for criminalizing consensual conduct, but nevertheless frequently invoke disgust to justify confining such conduct to the private realm. Drawing upon literary and psychoanalytic theory, the above references can be characterized as abjection responses and linked to anxiety about the <b>maintenance</b> <b>of</b> boundaries between <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> cherished classifications, such as human/animal, male/female, adult/child, and citizen/foreigner, the existence <b>of</b> which impose <b>a</b> semblance <b>of</b> order and hierarchy in society. Making this link helps to explain why many are so strongly invested in regulating the private and consensual conduct of others...|$|R
40|$|Experience {{plays an}} {{important}} role in building management. “How often will this asset need repair?” or “How much time is this repair going to take?” are types of questions that project and facility managers face daily in planning activities. Failure or success in developing good schedules, budgets and other project management tasks depend on the project manager's ability to obtain reliable information to be able to answer these types of questions. Young practitioners tend to rely on information that is based on regional averages and provided by publishing companies. This is in contrast to experienced project managers who tend to rely heavily on personal experience. Another aspect of building management is that many practitioners are seeking to improve available scheduling algorithms, estimating spreadsheets and other project management tools. Such “micro-scale” levels of research are important in providing the required tools for the project manager's tasks. However, even with such tools, low quality input information will produce inaccurate schedules and budgets as output. Thus, it is also important to have a broad approach to research at a more “macro-scale. ” Recent trends show that the Architectural, Engineering, Construction (AEC) industry is experiencing explosive growth in its capabilities to generate and collect data. There is <b>a</b> great deal <b>of</b> valuable knowledge that can be obtained from the appropriate use of this data and therefore the need has arisen to analyse this increasing amount of available data. Data Mining can be applied as a powerful tool to extract relevant and useful information from this sea of data. Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Data Mining (DM) are tools that allow identification of valid, useful, and previously unknown patterns so large amounts of project data may be analysed. These technologies combine techniques from machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to automatically extract concepts, interrelationships, and patterns of interest from large databases. The project involves the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prototype tool to support facility managers, building owners and designers. This final report presents the AIMMTM prototype system and documents how and what data mining techniques can be applied, the results of their application and the benefits gained from the system. The AIMMTM system is capable of searching for useful patterns of knowledge and correlations within the existing building maintenance data to support decision making about future maintenance operations. The application of the AIMMTM prototype system on building models and their maintenance data (supplied by industry partners) utilises various data mining algorithms and the maintenance data is analysed using interactive visual tools. The application of the AIMMTM prototype system to help in improving maintenance management and building life cycle includes: (i) data preparation and cleaning, (ii) integrating meaningful domain attributes, (iii) performing extensive data mining experiments in which visual analysis (using stacked histograms), classification and clustering techniques, associative rule mining algorithm such as “Apriori” and (iv) filtering and refining data mining results, including the potential implications of these results for improving maintenance management. <b>Maintenance</b> data <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> asset types were selected for demonstration with the aim of discovering meaningful patterns to assist facility managers in strategic planning and provide a knowledge base to help shape future requirements and design briefing. Utilising the prototype system developed here, positive and interesting results regarding patterns and structures of data have been obtained...|$|R
