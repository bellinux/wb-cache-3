5|$|At {{certain times}} {{there was an}} {{administrative}} office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of Thutmose III the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Kingdom. The Romans established a similar office, that of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.|$|E
5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. The architecture in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although the architecture in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E
5|$|The I Ching {{has been}} {{translated}} into Western languages dozens of times. The most influential edition is the 1923 German translation of Richard Wilhelm, later translated to English by Cary Baynes. The earliest complete published I Ching translation in a Western language was a Latin translation done in the 1730s by Jesuit missionary Jean-Baptiste Régis that was published in Germany in the 1830s. Although Thomas McClatchie and James Legge had both translated the text in the 19th century, the text gained significant traction during the counterculture of the 1960s, with the translations of Wilhelm and John Blofeld attracting particular interest. Richard Rutt's 1996 translation incorporated <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> archaeological and philological discoveries of the 20th century. Gregory Whincup's 1986 translation also attempts to reconstruct Zhou period readings.|$|E
50|$|Since Benedict (1972), many {{languages}} previously inadequately documented {{have received}} more attention with <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> <b>new</b> grammars, dictionaries, and wordlists. This new research has greatly benefited comparative work, and Bradley (2002) incorporates <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> data.|$|R
50|$|All the {{shopping}} {{and other facilities}} in the parish are now found in Botley. <b>The</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old village is now effectively cut off from <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> part <b>of</b> Botley by <b>the</b> busy Oxford Ring Road, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> A34 trunk road, though there are two pedestrian underpasses.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, ProFusion {{incorporated}} still photography equipment {{into its}} promotion, {{based on the}} idea that photo and video were converging in <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> equipment. Companies like Nikon, Fujifilm and Sony brought their latest camera offerings, which led to larger attendance numbers and a more diverse showing of equipment.|$|R
5|$|The Jugendstil, {{a variant}} of Art Nouveau, had a certain {{influence}} on <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> construction in Norway {{around the turn of}} the 20th century. The city of Ålesund, after burning to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels. Trondheim also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a stagnant building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the Historical Museum and the Government office building. In Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example.|$|E
5|$|Utica's {{location}} on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution. Utica's economy centered around the manufacture of furniture, heavy machinery, textiles and lumber. The combined effects of the Embargo Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry. Like other upstate New York cities, mills in Utica processed cotton from the Deep South, a slave society. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to have a negative opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> {{residential}} construction {{has been built}} in a style to imitate that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historic house-styles, such as Greek Revival, Federal, Victorian, and Colonial. A house in Slingerlands built in 1922 was once the official residence for <b>the</b> president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University at Albany, SUNY. Among <b>the</b> relatively <b>new,</b> yet still historic, is a 1929 cottage built from a kit bought from the Sears, Roebuck catalogue.|$|R
50|$|Lake People Park is a 1/2 acre park at 3070 S. Bradford Street in the Columbia City {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, Washington, just south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection <b>of</b> Martin Luther King Jr. Way S. and Rainier Avenue S. In 2003, {{the land was}} donated to the Seattle Parks Foundation by Monte Powell, a developer {{who was responsible for}} <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> construction in <b>the</b> neighborhood. He decided to make the donation after attending a presentation on community-established parks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> estates {{were built}} on the Wentloog Levels, areas of low-lying {{farmland}} which regularly became flooded until they were reclaimed from the sea during Roman times. A system of drainage reens and sluice gates together with a seawall which runs from the River Usk in the east to the Rhymney River in the west protect the area from <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> coastal flooding as the land is still only a few metres above sea level.|$|R
25|$|This riding {{was created}} by The Representation Act, 2002 (Saskatchewan).

This was added to the Dollar Menu in December 2014.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{production}} {{dropped from}} more than seven million barrels in 1919 to fewer than three million in 1921. The boom ended nearly {{as quickly as it}} began, and <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> population abandoned <b>the</b> community. Another fire in 1921 destroyed an entire block. The Lone Star Hotel was also burned. With few residents, Desdemona dissolved its municipal government in 1936, and the general area has since been governed by Eastland County. The Desdemona public school (grades 1-12) was built in 1922, expanded as a Works Progress Administration project in 1937, and closed because of lack of enrollment in 1969.|$|R
25|$|The 18th century saw {{a gradual}} {{recovery}} {{and an increase}} in prosperity through <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empire. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> Bourbon monarchy drew on <b>the</b> French system <b>of</b> modernising <b>the</b> administration and the economy. Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom's elite and monarchy.

500|$|<b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> {{commercial}} {{development has been}} along the Warwick Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue corridors, with newer planned industrial, commercial, and mixed development such as Oyster Point, Kiln Creek and the City Center. While the downtown area had long been <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city that offered the traditional urban layout, the city has supported a number of New Urbanism projects. One is Port Warwick, named after the fictional city in William Styron's novel, Lie Down in Darkness. [...] Port Warwick includes housing for a broad variety of citizens, from retired persons to off-campus housing for Christopher Newport University students. Also included are several high-end restaurants and upscale shopping.|$|R
25|$|This disarray at the Justice Department {{meant that}} the government's lawyers often failed to foster viable test cases and {{arguments}} for their defense, subsequently handicapping them before the courts. As Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes would later note, it was because <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Deal legislation was so poorly drafted and defended that {{the court did not}} uphold it.|$|E
25|$|As a {{departure}} from the prevailing Somali architectural style, the National Theatre in Mogadishu was completely built from a Chinese perspective. The town-hall was constructed in the Moroccan style. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> architecture also continued upon ancient tradition, the Al-Uruba Hotel, the pre-eminent hotel in Somalia and an iconic feature of Mogadishu's waterfront was entirely designed and constructed by Somalis in the Arabesque style.|$|E

In 1845 the Book of Common Prayer was translated by a committee comprising William Williams, Robert Maunsell, James Hamlin and William Puckey. The full translation of the Bible into the Māori language was completed in 1857.|$|E
25|$|President Eisenhower {{feared that}} {{excessive}} military spending would damage the economy, so he downsized the Army after Korea and shifted priorities to missiles {{and nuclear weapons}} (which were much less expensive than army divisions). He also promoted the Interstate Highway system as necessary for national defense, and made space exploration a priority. His successor John F Kennedy made a manned mission to the moon a national priority. <b>Much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> spending went to California and the West, a continuation of wartime spending.|$|E
25|$|The gap {{was closed}} on 7 August 1908 {{for the first}} through {{passenger}} train, the 11-car Parliamentary Special carrying the Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and other parliamentarians north to see the American Great White Fleet at Auckland. But <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> section was temporary, with some cuttings north of Taonui having vertical batters and some unballasted sections of track. Ward drove the last spike on 6 November 1908, and the 'Last Spike' monument is at Manganui-o-te-Ao , near Pokaka. A two-day NIMT service started on 9 November, with an overnight stop at Ohakune.|$|E

25|$|A late August {{poll taken}} by Gallup found {{the race to}} be {{essentially}} tied, but Roosevelt's popularity surged in September following {{the announcement of the}} Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Willkie supported <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Deal as well as rearmament and aid to Britain, but warned that Roosevelt would drag the country into another European war. Responding to Willkie's attacks, Roosevelt promised to keep the country out of the war.

25|$|Following the {{grouping}} of the LB and other railways in southern England {{to form the}} Southern Railway, in 1923, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> locomotive construction for the new railway {{was transferred to the}} more modern facilities at Eastleigh Works. After mid-1931, with the impending electrification of the Brighton main line, the locomotive works once again seemed likely to close. Many of the skilled workmen and much of the equipment were transferred to Eastleigh and Ashford, the Paint Shop was converted into an Electric multiple unit maintenance facility, and the former carriage shed was converted for use by the Southern Railway's new Road Motor Engineers Department. Similarly the steam motive power depot was rebuilt and reduced in size.|$|E
