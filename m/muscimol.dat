5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, <b>muscimol,</b> is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to <b>muscimol,</b> with approximately 10–20% converting to <b>muscimol</b> after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6mg <b>muscimol</b> or 30 to 60mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol</b> than autumn fruitings.|$|E
5|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A.muscaria poisoning are <b>muscimol</b> (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. <b>Muscimol</b> {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. <b>Muscimol</b> and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century. Researchers in England, Japan, and Switzerland showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol,</b> not muscarine. These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk. Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no <b>muscimol</b> is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but <b>muscimol</b> is detectable in the urine after eating A.muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} <b>muscimol</b> are {{structurally}} {{related to each}} other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol</b> act like these neurotransmitters, <b>muscimol</b> being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. <b>Muscimol</b> is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{traditionally}} used for catching flies possibly {{due to its}} content of ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Recently, an {{analysis}} of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching flies in Slovenia {{have shown that the}} release of ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol</b> did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol.</b>|$|E
5|$|The active {{constituents}} {{of this species}} are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies A.muscaria. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent <b>muscimol.</b> According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, <b>muscimol</b> does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of <b>muscimol.</b> Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria, {{commonly}} known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It is also a <b>muscimol</b> mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.|$|E
5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound <b>muscimol.</b> The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and <b>muscimol,</b> the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis, {{commonly}} known as the royal fly agaric or the king of Sweden Amanita, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family. Common in Scandinavian countries, it is also found in eastern and northern Europe. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska. The fruit bodies of the fungus somewhat resemble the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), and it was formerly regarded as a variety of this species. A.regalis differs from it in being larger, with a liver-brown cap bearing numerous scabs, and in having a stem which is yellow-ochre at the base, with patches or rings of patches. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains <b>muscimol,</b> the same psychoactive compound found in A.muscaria.|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs have}} been found that lessen the risk of {{neurotoxicity}} from NMDA receptor antagonists. Centrally acting alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are thought to most directly target the etiology of NMDA neurotoxicity. Other drugs acting on various neurotransmitter systems known to inhibit NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity include: anticholinergics, diazepam, barbiturates, ethanol, 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonists, and <b>muscimol.</b>|$|E
25|$|In addition, animals display risk {{assessment}} behaviors {{to the environment}} previously associated with the cat. Fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the PMDvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus, and inactivation with <b>muscimol</b> prior to exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior. Therefore, the hypothalamus, mainly the PMDvl, has {{an important role in}} expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors to a predator.|$|E
500|$|Toxicity is {{suspected}} {{to be due}} to the presence of <b>muscimol</b> and ibonetic acid.|$|E
500|$|The {{notion that}} Vikings used A.muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first {{suggested}} by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784. Ödmann based his theories on reports {{about the use of}} fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. <b>Muscimol</b> is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people. It is possible that it could make a person angry, or cause them to be [...] "very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright".|$|E
2500|$|A few {{species in}} the Amanita genus, most recognizably A. muscaria, but also A. pantherina, among others, contain the psychoactive {{compound}} <b>muscimol.</b> [...] The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of Amanitas contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due {{to the presence of}} ibotenic acid. The Amanita intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes CNS depressant and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium in high doses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muscimol</b> is the psychoactive {{compound}} {{responsible for}} the effects of Amanita muscaria intoxication. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxic secondary metabolite of Amanita muscaria, serves as a prodrug to <b>muscimol</b> when the mushroom is ingested or dried, converting to <b>muscimol</b> via decarboxylation.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} find out the {{relationship}} between GABA, NMDA, and SP, MK-801 was administered intrathecally to determine the effect on <b>muscimol</b> potentiation of SP hyperalgesia. MK-801 reduced the exaggeration of SP hyperalgesia induced by <b>muscimol.</b> Also, low doses of SP and intrathecal <b>muscimol</b> increased the expression of phosphorylated NR1 subunits of NMDA receptors. Intrathecal gabazine treatment before <b>muscimol</b> blocked the increase in phosphorylated NR1 expression.|$|E
50|$|The major toxins {{involved}} in A. muscaria poisoning are <b>muscimol</b> (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) {{and the related}} amino acid ibotenic acid. <b>Muscimol</b> {{is the product of}} the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. <b>Muscimol</b> and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century.

50|$|<b>Muscimol</b> is {{a potent}} GABAA agonist, {{activating}} the receptor for the brain's principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. <b>Muscimol</b> binds to the same site on the GABAA receptor complex as GABA itself, as opposed to other GABAergic drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines which bind to separate regulatory sites. GABAA receptors are widely distributed in the brain, and so when <b>muscimol</b> is administered, it alters neuronal activity in multiple regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.|$|E
5000|$|Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) - Contains the psychoactive <b>muscimol</b> and the neurotoxin ibotenic acid. Ibotenic acid decarboxylates into <b>muscimol</b> upon curing of the mushroom, {{rendering}} it relatively non-toxic, though death via {{respiratory depression}} is possible. <b>Muscimol</b> intoxication is often considered unpleasant and undesirable, however, {{and as such}} has seen little recreational use compared to the unrelated psilocybin mushroom, though {{it has been used}} as an entheogen by the native people of Siberia.|$|E
50|$|Agonists: GABA, <b>muscimol,</b> progabide, gaboxadol, etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Muscimol</b> (also {{known as}} agarin or pantherine) is the {{principal}} psychoactive constituent of Amanita muscaria and related species of mushroom. <b>Muscimol</b> is a potent, selective agonist for the GABAA receptors and displays sedative-hypnotic, depressant and dissociative psychoactivity.
